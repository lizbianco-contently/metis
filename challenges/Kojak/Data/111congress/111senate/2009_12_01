Mr. President, here are two truths about the historic \nhealth care reform bill that is now before this body. First, it will \nsave money, it will save lives, and it will save Medicare. Again, the \nlegislation before this body will save lives, money, and Medicare.\n  While this is a pretty good start toward that, the second fact is, \nthere is always room for improvement for this bill. Of course, that is \nwhat the legislative process is all about. Senator Barbara Mikulski of \nMaryland has offered an amendment that does both. Her proposal would \nimprove this bill by making sure women get, at no cost, the preventive \nscreenings they need to stay healthy. These are important screenings \nthat can catch potential problems as early as possible and that will \nsave lives and save money.\n  Health care premiums rise higher and higher every year. The insurance \nindustry this year has already raised insurance rates an average of 10 \npercent--an average. Of course, this is far faster than incomes in this \ncountry, and that is an understatement. As this happens, more and more \nwomen are simply skipping the important preventive care they need. Why? \nThey are skipping screenings for cervical cancer, they are skipping \nscreenings for breast cancer, they are skipping screenings for \npregnancy. They are even skipping annual checkups and doctor visits \nthat could flag serious problems, such as postpartum depression and \ndomestic violence.\n  Why is this happening? Do women simply care less about their well-\nbeing? Of course not. Are diseases on the decline? Quite to the \ncontrary. The only reason women are putting off going to the doctor is \nbecause, in our broken health care system, it simply costs too much to \nstay healthy.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment also makes clear that the decision of \nwhether and when to get a mammogram\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\nshould be made by a patient and a doctor. It shouldn't be made by an \ninsurance company, by Members of Congress or by someone you have never \nmet. No matter what independent task forces recommend and no matter \nwhat some Republican Senators falsely claim, this legislation--the one \nbefore this body--offers free preventive services to millions of women \nwho are being discriminated against by their insurance companies, and \nthis amendment before this body makes that absolutely clear.\n  Senator Mikulski has long been someone who has been a leader and has \nlooked out for women's health. Years ago, she worked with me on a \nproblem women have; 90 percent of the people who have a disease called \ninterstitial cystitis are women. I discovered that when three women \ncame to visit me in Las Vegas. It was a disease that was ignored. \nPeople thought it was psychosomatic. Working with Senator Mikulski, we \nhad the National Institutes of Health set up a protocol. Now 40 percent \nof those people, who previously were thought to be psychosomatic and \nwho suffered with symptoms they described as shoving slivers of glass \nup and down their bladder, are symptom free--not 100 percent but 40 \npercent. It is easier to diagnose now.\n  Senator Mikulski has also worked hard to have the National Institutes \nof Health set up a division for women's health problems. So she is a \nleader in this area, has been for a long time, and with this amendment \nshe does it once again.\n  I am sorry to see Republicans deliberately confuse the facts about \nwomen's health, particularly as they relate to mammograms. It shows how \ndesperate some of them are to distract the American people from the \nreal debate and from the fact they have no vision for fixing our health \ncare system, which is so broken.\n  I am even more sorry to say it is part of a larger trend. In recent \ndays, they have been distorting the data from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, an independent agency Republicans in the past have praised. \nWhat are they complaining about now, the Republicans? They are \ncomplaining about two of this Nation's top priorities: reforming our \nhealth care insurance system and helping our economy recover.\n  First, on health care. The Congressional Budget Office said yesterday \nthe majority of American families who buy insurance in the new \nmarketplace we will create--what we call health insurance exchanges--\nwill see their premiums go down. They will go down by as much as 60 \npercent. Out of 100 percent of the American people, 93 percent will \nhave a drop in their insurance premiums with this legislation--93 \npercent.\n  CBO's experts aren't the first to recognize these benefits. \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Jonathan Gruber, who is one of \nthe most respected economists in the world, said in today's Washington \nPost:\n\n       Here's a bill that reduces the deficit, covers 30 million \n     people and has the promise of lowering premiums in the long \n     run.\n\n  Pretty good statement. That means millions of Americans who today \ncannot afford coverage or whose medical bills drive them to financial \nruin. Remember what I said yesterday as this debate began. Last year, \n750,000 people in America filed for bankruptcy. Almost 70 percent of \nthe bankruptcy filings were because of health care costs. But of those \npeople who filed for bankruptcy because of health care costs, 62 \npercent of them had health insurance. Does that speak about a system \nthat is in trouble? Of course it does.\n\n  So I repeat: This bill will mean millions of Americans who today \ncannot afford coverage or whose medical bills drive them to financial \nruin will be able to afford to stay healthy. It means, if we don't \nreform health care, millions more will find themselves in bankruptcy, \nbad health or worse.\n  Second, on economic recovery. The Congressional Budget Office said \nyesterday the extraordinary steps we took to bring our economy back \nfrom the brink have created and saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. I \nwill direct my comments to the American people but also to the brave \nRepublicans who joined with us to make this possible--Senators Snowe \nand Collins. I want them to know that what they did helped us get that \nlegislation passed and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nsaved hundreds of thousands of jobs. The CBO said yesterday the \nextraordinary steps we took to bring our economy back from the brink \nhave created or saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. Its estimate \nreaches as high as 1.6 million jobs, each one a direct result of our \neconomic recovery plan. Pretty good. The same report also said our \ncountry's gross domestic product has gone up by as much as 3.2 \npercentage points higher than it would have if we hadn't acted.\n  Let us not do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ndoing--betting on failure. This country is coming out of a hole that \nwas dug by this administration for some 8 years. The facts are that \nwhat we did on a bipartisan basis in January and February has brought \nthis country out of an economic hole. We still have a ways to go, no \nquestion about it. But we created 1.6 million jobs and increased the \ngross national product by as much as 3.2 percentage points. Pretty \ngood. These facts tell us the same thing: Not acting is not an option.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues prefer to close their eyes and ears \nto this reality. They prefer to play politics than to do what is right \nand what is necessary. They are content to say no, instead of offering \nconstructive alternatives and a way to lead our country and our \nconstituents back to health.\n  At the beginning of this second day of debate, I say: Come along and \nwork with us to improve this legislation. Try to improve it the way \nSenator Mikulski looked at it and said: This legislation can be \nimproved. We want to work with the minority. We want to have \nlegislation that is bipartisan. We don't want to do this alone. We need \nthe Republicans' help, and I hope they will join with us. It would \ncertainly look better. Let's stop berating this legislation before this \nbody. If they do not like it, try to do something to make it better.\n  As we know, this legislation saves lives, it saves money, it saves \nMedicare, and it brings down insurance premiums. That is a pretty good \ndeal. And it brings down the debt. It saves $130 billion over the next \n10 years and, after that, $650 billion. Not bad. So the numbers they \nkeep talking about are out of--I don't know where they come from. We, \nas a body, have used the Congressional Budget Office for 50 years. It \nis bipartisan. That is the way it should be. We should start talking \nreal numbers, not fake numbers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12020-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, certainly in a country of 300 million \npeople there are differences of opinion, and you will see them on full \ndisplay in the Senate on this monumental 2,074-page scheme that would \nexpand the reach of government deeper into our lives, raise taxes, \nincrease health care premiums, and cut Medicare for seniors.\n  On the other side are the American people. We know, from all the \nsurveys we have seen, the American people are opposed to this bill. \nThey are astonished that we are trying to pass a bill that is clearly \nopposed by the American people in every survey that has been published.\n  Americans do support reform, but this isn't the reform they were \nasking for, and it is not the reform they were told they could expect. \nIn fact, it is pretty clear by now that the American people were sold a \nbill of goods when the administration and its allies in Congress said \ntheir health care bill would lower costs and help the economy because \nthe plan that has been produced, that is before the Senate, will not do \neither.\n  The debate is no longer about improving care by reducing costs. We \nare past that. This plan will raise costs on American families, and it \nwill make an already struggling economy even worse. The only question \nnow is how we got to a point where we are actually considering spending \ntrillions of dollars on a brand new government entitlement at a time \nwhen more than 1 in 10 Americans is looking for a job and when our \ndebts and deficits are well past the tipping point.\n\n[[Page S12021]]\n\n  For many, the answer to that question is quite clear. We know that \nsome here in Washington have wanted government-run health care for many \nyears. It is hard to escape the conclusion that these same people saw \nthe current economic crisis as their moment. Earlier in this year, some \nin this administration said that ``a crisis is a terrible thing to \nwaste.'' Americans are hoping this bill is not what they meant, but \nthey are concerned that it is.\n  Americans already know this bill will make our economic problems \nworse, not better, without even addressing the serious health care \nproblems we already face--and they would be right. That is why they \nwant us to start over and accomplish the real mission of lowering \ncosts.\n  That is precisely what the McCain amendment would allow us to do. The \nMcCain amendment would send this bill back for a rewrite. It would send \nit back to the Finance Committee with instructions to give us a new \nbill that does not include $\\1/2\\ trillion cuts to Medicare. It would \nsend the bill back to committee; send us a new bill without $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion cuts to Medicare, one that does not pay for the bill on the \nbacks of seniors; that is, if you pass the McCain amendment.\n  Here is a program, the Medicare Program, that is already struggling, \na program that needs help. Yet, in order to finance their vision of \nreform, our friends on the other side want to use Medicare as a piggy \nbank to create an all-new government program that is bound to have the \nsame problems as Medicare. As written, their bill would cut nearly $\\1/\n2\\ trillion from Medicare--not to make the program stronger but to fund \nmore government spending. In the process, millions of seniors would \nlose benefits. Literally millions of seniors would lose benefits.\n  The McCain amendment would not let that happen. The McCain amendment \ntells the committees: Don't cut hospitals. The McCain amendment tells \nthe committees: Don't cut hospice. The McCain amendment tells the \ncommittees: Don't cut home health care. The McCain amendment tells the \ncommittees: Don't cut Medicare Advantage. It would allow us to focus \nour efforts, instead, on the prevention of waste, fraud, and abuse, \nwhich we know to be rampant in this program. It would ensure we are not \ncutting one government program just to create a new one. That is what a \nvote in favor of the McCain amendment would be, it would be a vote to \npreserve Medicare, not weaken it. That is the message America's seniors \nwant to hear in this health care debate, that improving health care in \nAmerica doesn't have to come at their expense.\n  Some may argue that they need to cut Medicare to create a new \ngovernment program. That is their call. But it is not the call \nAmericans are asking us to make. I haven't gotten a call yet from \nanybody in Kentucky or around the country saying: Please cut Medicare \nso you can start a new program for somebody else--not my first call.\n  The American people want us to start over from the beginning and \ncraft a bill they can actually support, and we know they don't support \nthis bill. All the surveys indicate that. Then we could start over and \nend junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up costs, \nsomething the majority didn't find any room for in their 2074-page \nbill--not a word about controlling junk lawsuits against doctors and \nhospitals. Then we could encourage healthy choices such as prevention \nand wellness programs, something the majority somehow couldn't squeeze \ninto their 2074-page bill. Then we could lower costs by letting \nconsumers buy coverage across State lines, something the majority must \nhave overlooked in their 2074-page bill. Then we could address the \nrampant waste, fraud, and abuse, something our friends didn't think was \nimportant enough to seriously address in their 2074-page bill.\n  The McCain amendment would allow us to vote with seniors. That is \nwhat the McCain amendment is about. It would allow the Senate to say we \nare not going to finance a new government program on the backs of \nseniors, we are not going to use Medicare as a piggy bank to fund a new \ngovernment program. It would allow us to vote with the American people. \nMost important, it would allow us to start over and get this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12021-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the 30 \nminutes controlled by the Republicans, we be allowed to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will begin by making some comments about \nthe amendment Senator McCain, my colleague from Arizona, has filed. \nThis is an amendment that, as the minority leader just said, will \nprotect America's seniors. It will disallow the Medicare cuts this bill \nincludes.\n  The economist Milton Friedman famously said, ``There is no such thing \nas a free lunch,'' and that applies to health care as well. There is no \nsuch thing as free health care. Someone has to pay. Since this bill is \na $2.5 trillion bill, the first question is, Who pays? The first answer \nto who pays is, it is America's seniors, because about half of the cost \nof the bill is allegedly paid for by cuts to Medicare.\n  Let me break down a little bit more specifically than the Republican \nleader did exactly what that means. This is about $500 billion in \nMedicare cuts as follows: $137.5 billion from hospitals who treat \nseniors; $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, which is the insurance \nprogram that provides benefits to seniors which will be cut more than \nin half as a result of this $120 billion reduction; $14.6 billion from \nnursing homes that treat seniors; $42.1 billion from home health care \nfor seniors; and $7.7 billion from hospice care, one of the most cruel \ncuts of all.\n  Obviously, with cut this dramatic there is no way to avoid \njeopardizing the care seniors now enjoy, and seniors know this. That is \nwhy they have been writing our offices and attending townhall meetings \nto let us know they disapprove. I quoted from two letters constituents \nof mine from Arizona sent asking to please not cut their Medicare \nAdvantage Program. This has been called the crown jewel of the Medicare \nsystem, and many of them rely on Medicare Advantage for dental care or \nvision care or hearing assistance they have come to rely on. They are \nnot buying the claims that somehow or other we can make $\\1/2\\ trillion \ncuts in Medicare without somehow hurting their care. They know better \nthan that, and they are right. The care they have been promised will be \ncompromised to pay for this new government entitlement under the bill.\n  Finally, many are wondering what happened to the promise that they \nget to keep the care they have. We all heard the President say that \nmany times: If you like the care you have, you get to keep it. That is \nsimply not true. There are 337,000 Arizonans who are Medicare Advantage \npatients. They like what they have. Yet we know, according to the \nCongressional Budget\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\nOffice, that the benefits they have under Medicare Advantage are going \nto be cut by more than half. They are saying: What happened to the \npolicy I like? I am not going to be able to keep it if this bill \npasses.\n  This is why the McCain amendment must pass. If our Democratic \ncolleagues are not willing to protect Medicare, then I cannot imagine \nhow the bill could otherwise be made acceptable since it starts with \nthe commitments that Congress and the President have made to our senior \ncitizens.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I congratulate the Senator from Arizona on his \nanalysis of the Medicare cuts. I heard the Democratic leader talk about \nfigures and how we have some figures and the Democrats have other \nfigures. I agree with him. I think someone watching this must think we \nare on two different planets sometimes, so let me focus in on the \nfigures.\n  I believe I heard my colleague say to pay for this health care bill \nover 10 years there would be $465 billion in the Medicare cuts. Where \ndoes that figure come from?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Tennessee, first of \nall it comes from a reading of the bill. It is very clear in the bill \nas to how much money is taken from Medicare. The number the Senator \nfrom Tennessee just articulated is the correct number.\n  In addition to that, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nTax Committee analyzed the specific numbers. Obviously they were given \nthe numbers in the bill, but the numbers they are using are--I just \nbroke it down into four or five general categories. There are other \ndivisions within that. But as I said, for notional purposes here: \n$137.5 billion from hospitals; $120 billion from Medicare Advantage. \nThat number might be $118 billion; I am not precisely certain of it, \nbut it is very close. There is $14.6 billion from nursing homes, $42.1 \nbillion from home health, and $7.7 billion from hospice care. If any of \nour colleagues would like to contest these numbers, I would be happy to \nbe corrected, but I believe those are the correct numbers.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think the Senator from Arizona is right. The \nPresident of the United States, in his address to us about health care, \nand the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal--everyone who has \nreported on the Congressional Budget Office figures said the same \nthing. We are going to pay for this bill, which is $2.5 trillion over \n10 years when fully implemented, by $465 billion cuts in Medicare.\n  What Senator McCain in his amendment that we are in support of is \nsaying is, don't cut grandma's Medicare to pay for someone else's \ninsurance. He goes on to say, if you are going to find some savings in \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in grandma's Medicare, spend it on grandma. The \nreason for that is that the Medicare trustees have said to us that \nthere is $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities for the Medicare Program \nand that the program will start going bankrupt between 2015 and 2017. \nAccording to the Medicare trustees, they say, ``We need timely and \neffective action to address Medicare's financial challenges,'' and the \nproposal, if I may say to the Senator from Arizona, who is on the \nFinance Committee and deeply involved in what we need to do about our \nNation's finances, I don't think the Medicare trustees were thinking \nthat the timely and effective action we could take to keep Medicare \nfrom going broke was to take $465 billion out of it and spend it on \nsome new program.\n  Mr. KYL. On a new program. That is exactly correct. What the Medicare \ntrustees were saying is, if we can effect cost savings in Medicare, and \nsurely there are some to be had there, they should go to strengthen the \nMedicare Program itself and not allow it to go bankrupt, rather than it \nbeing used to create a new government program.\n  Perhaps one of the reasons why there are different numbers from one \nside of the aisle to the other is that sometimes we are not talking \napples to apples. We are talking apples to oranges, and perhaps both \nnumbers are correct in their context. The Senator from Tennessee used \nthe number $2.5 trillion when the program is fully implemented. That is \na very important statement. The other side will argue it is only $1\\1/\n2\\ trillion for the first 10 years of the program. That is a correct \nstatement. But it is $2.5 trillion for the first 10 years of total \nimplementation of the program. What is the reason for the difference? \nFor the first 4 years, money is being collected, but very few benefits \nare going out. The benefits start after year No. 4. So if we take the \nfirst 10 years of the program, we are collecting money to pay for it \nover the entire 10 years, but almost all of the benefits only occur \nduring the last 6 years. Naturally, we have collected more money than \nwe have paid out. But when we take the first 10 years of full \nimplementation, it is as my colleague from Tennessee noted, a cost of \n$2.5 trillion. That is how sometimes we get somewhat different numbers.\n  As long as we are clear about what we are talking about, one thing is \ncrystal clear: Whether it is $1\\1/2\\ trillion or $2.5 trillion, we are \ntalking real money. Somebody has to pay for it. If America's seniors \nare being asked to pay for half of it, that is not fair to America's \nseniors, given the commitment we have made to them. That is the point \nof the McCain amendment. Protect Medicare, protect America's seniors. \nWe can do that with the simple amendment Senator McCain has which is \nsend the bill back to committee--it would only take 1 day--and send it \nback here without those Medicare cuts in the bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Idaho here. I wish to hear his \nobservations. If there is any issue in this entire health care debate \nthat symbolizes why we on the Republican side want to change the debate \nto a step-by-step approach to reducing the cost of premiums, it would \nbe the Medicare issue. As the Senator from Arizona said, what we need \nto do about Medicare is make it solvent as quickly as we can, as \neffectively as we can. The Senator from Kansas said the other day that \nthe proposal to take $465 billion from grandma's Medicare and spend on \nit some new program is like writing a check on an overdrawn account in \na bank to buy a big, new car. There is a lot of truth to that.\n  The President said earlier this year something I agree with. He said \nthis health care debate is not just about health care. It is about the \nrole of the Federal Government in the everyday life of Americans. He is \nexactly right about that. This health care debate, which we are \nbeginning this week, is not just about health care. It is about the \nstimulus package, about the takeover of General Motors. It is about the \ntrillion dollar debt. It is about the Washington takeovers. It is about \ntoo much spending, too much taxes, too much debt. The Medicare \nprovisions in this bill are a perfect symbol of that. That is why \nSenator McCain is right. What he is saying is, don't cut grandma's \nMedicare and spend it on some new program. If you can find some savings \nin the waste, fraud, and abuse of grandma's Medicare, spend on it \ngrandma. Make sure those of us who are older and those of us who are \nyounger and looking forward to Medicare can count on its solvency.\n  Later this week we will talk more about premiums going up. There was \na lot of discussion yesterday because, according to the Wall Street \nJournal, some health premiums would rise. For people who get their \ninsurance from large employers, this bill won't make much difference. \nAnd for small employers, if you get your insurance from a small \nemployer, it won't make much difference. If you are going to the \nindividual market to buy insurance yourself, your premiums will go up, \nexcept we are going to get some money from somewhere to help pay part \nof your premiums, at least for about half of Americans who are in the \nindividual market. Where are we going to get that money? From grandma. \nWe are going to get it from Medicare. So that is what is wrong with \nthis bill. And what is right about the McCain amendment is, it says \nsimply, don't cut Medicare. If we find savings, which we hope we can in \nMedicare, we should spend it on making Medicare solvent.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Idaho is hearing from seniors in his \nState about the proposed $465 billion cuts to Medicare and how they \nfeel about taking that money and spending it to create a new program?\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. Very definitely we are \nhearing from seniors in Idaho who see through this. It is very clear to \nthe\n\n[[Page S12023]]\n\nfolks in Idaho that what we are seeing is a proposed massive growth of \nthe Federal Government by over $2.5 trillion, when fully implemented, \nthat is to be funded on the backs of American taxpayers and senior \ncitizens through cuts in Medicare. In fact, in addition to those who \nhave contacted me who are seeing their health benefits lost, I have \nalso been contacted by a number of the providers. We are talking about \nthose who are in home health care or hospice health care, skilled \nnursing facilities or hospitals and the like.\n  They make a very interesting point. Their point is that not only will \nsenior citizens--in Medicare Advantage in particular--literally be \nlosing their benefits dramatically, but that other senior citizens who \nare in traditional Medicare will also be losing access and quality of \ncare. How is that the case? We know from the details of this bill that \nwe are going to see major cuts in hospice care, home health care, \nskilled nursing facilities, and hospitals.\n  The points made to me by those providers are that they have already \ngone through a series of very deep cuts, cuts to the point that in \nIdaho for home health care, we have lost something like 30 percent of \nour facilities already. The way one of them explained to it me was that \nif you reduce the compensation we are receiving, then we have to reduce \nsomething in our budget. He said: We can't just start taking bricks off \nof our buildings. What we will end up having to do is to reduce \npersonnel. That would be the nurses and the doctors and the other care \nproviders who are there to provide support for these individuals. We \nwill have to reduce the number of rooms we operate or the facilities we \nprovide. In the end, there will be a reduction of services and access \navailable to senior citizens, including a reduction in the quality of \nthe care they are able to be provided.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. In discussing the Medicare cuts, another provision of \nthe bill which we will be talking about this month and next month as we \ngo through the health care debate is what about the problem of paying \ndoctors and hospitals who see Medicare patients. They get paid about 83 \npercent of the rate they would be paid if they were seeing a private \ncare patient. Every year Congress has to make an adjustment in \nsomething we did a few years ago which automatically cuts the amount of \nmoney that we pay doctors who are seeing Medicare patients.\n  That is a big problem for Medicare patients. Because if the doctors \ncan't be paid, they won't see the patients, and Medicare patients may \nfind themselves increasingly in the condition that Medicaid patients \ndo, low-income Americans who are covered through the State program--\nthat is our largest government-run program--where they are paid about \n60 percent of what doctors who see private patients are paid and about \nhalf of Medicaid doctors won't see new patients.\n  I ask the Senator, does he see anywhere in this bill a provision for \nthe $\\1/4\\ trillion that will be needed to pay doctors 10 years from \nnow what they are making today? If it is not in the bill, where is that \n$\\1/4\\ trillion going to come from? Is it going to come from Medicare \ncuts, or will it come from adding to the deficit?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Obviously, it will come from cuts in Medicare or increased \ntaxes or simply more debt on the Federal level.\n  The Senator raises a very interesting point. This question of fixing \nthe compensation rates for physicians in Medicare is a huge question, \none which we have been fighting for for a number of years to try to \nfind a solution to, as each year we delay the expected cuts that will \nhappen. I have talked about this factor in the context of being a \nbudget gimmick in this bill. What do I mean by that? Those who say this \nbill reduces the deficit are able to say so only because it has about \n$500 billion of new taxes, about $500 billion of Medicare cuts, and a \nnumber of budget gimmicks that delay the implementation of the spending \nside of the bill or, in this case, don't even include at all one of the \nmajor expenses that needs to be accommodated, and that is the fix for \nphysician compensation. If any of those things were not in this bill, \nthis bill would drive up the deficit tremendously.\n\n  What we are going to see, in addition to these fiscal impacts on the \nFederal Treasury in terms of huge increases in the debt or huge \nincreases in more taxes, even more than we are talking about with this \nbill, is we are going to see the very real potential that access to \nmedical care for seniors will be again reduced because of this factor.\n  Let me give a couple of statistics. In their June 2008 report, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, said that 29 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries who were surveyed were looking for a primary \ncare physician and had trouble finding one to treat them. In other \nwords, about 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries today are having \ntrouble finding a physician who will take a Medicare patient. That is \nbefore the $465 billion of cuts and before simply not including \nphysicians at all in this legislation.\n  A 2008 survey by the Texas Medical Association found that only 58 \npercent of the State's doctors took new Medicare patients, and only 38 \npercent of the primary care doctors accepted new patients. Again, it is \nan example from MedPAC and from one State that indicates what we know \nis happening around the country; namely, that doctors in increasing \nnumbers are no longer taking new Medicare patients, just as they have \nbeen doing with Medicaid patients for years. Yet we see these massive \ncuts to Medicare being proposed that will have the same impact on \nhospice care and home health service and skilled nursing facilities and \nhospitals, and we see that doctors are not even included at all, \nmeaning they are projected now to receive major reductions. I think it \nis over 20 percent reduction in their compensation for taking Medicare \npatients.\n  The solution here to establishing a massive new Federal entitlement \nprogram is not to cut Medicare. I want to repeat something both the \nSenators from Arizona and Tennessee have already said that is critical. \nReducing the Medicare budget by $464 billion, by any number, is \nsomething that has been encouraged in terms of trimming the growth path \nfor Medicare. That is something this Congress has looked at in the \npast. But never was it intended by those who made these projections \nabout needing to control the spiraling cost of Medicare that we address \nthe fiscal circumstances in Medicare with the intended purpose of \ncreating another new, massive Federal entitlement program that will \ngrow the Federal Government by over $2 trillion--we talked about the \nnumbers; the full 10-year period is $2.5 trillion--and leave Medicare \nwith these dramatic cuts, this loss of service and loss of benefits to \nthe recipients, while they see this new government growth with a new \ngovernment program. That was not in the mind of anybody who was asking \nus to deal with the solvency issues on Medicare, and I don't think it \nwas in the mind of anybody who asked that we have some kind of health \ncare reform to deal with the rising cost of premiums.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Chair let me know when 4 minutes remain.\n  The Senator from Idaho will conclude our remarks at that time.\n  The Senator from Idaho has made an important point, anticipating our \nDemocratic friends will have the next 30 minutes and some other things \nthey may be saying the rest of the day. There was a lot of talk \nyesterday about the CBO report about the effect of this $2.5 trillion \nproposal on premiums. Rather than take my word for it, let's go to the \nnews section of the Wall Street Journal of today which has the \nheadline: ``Some Health Premiums to Rise.'' That means going up. That \nmeans the cost of your insurance is going up for some Americans.\n\n  So my question is, why would we spend $2.5 trillion over 10 years, \ncut Medicare, raise taxes, and run up the debt to raise some health \npremiums? I thought the whole exercise was to lower the cost of health \ncare premiums.\n  The article says:\n\n       The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan \n     Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation--\n\n  We are supposed to pay some attention to these outfits as \nnonpartisan--\n\n     painted a more complicated and uncertain picture. It said \n     people who pay for their own insurance would see a higher \n     bill, albeit for more generous benefits--\n\n\n[[Page S12024]]\n\n\n  That is the government-approved insurance you are going to be forced \nto buy.\n\n     unless they are lower earners who qualify for a new \n     government tax credit.\n\n  Where is the money going to come from for those subsidies? It is \ngoing to come from grandma. It is going to come from Medicare. It is \ngoing to come from taxes. And it is going to come from increasing the \ndebt.\n  Those are facts.\n\n       Employees of small firms--\n\n  Says the Wall Street Journal--\n\n     would effectively see their insurance premiums unchanged--\n\n  So for small firms, we are going to spend $2.5 trillion over 10 \nyears, cut Medicare, cut taxes, and run up premiums for millions of \nAmericans, so your insurance will continue to go up at about the rate \nit already was. Why should we be doing that?\n\n     while workers at large firms would see something between \n     unchanged and slightly lower premiums under the bill--\n\n  Compared to what would already happen--\n\n     according to the analysis.\n\n  We need to change the debate. We need to start over. Instead of this \ncomprehensive 2,000-page bill that is full of taxes, mandates and, as a \ngeneral effect, raises premiums and taxes and cuts Medicare, we should \nset a clear goal, reducing costs, and begin to go step by step toward \nthat goal--reducing junk lawsuits against doctors, allowing health care \nto be purchased across State lines to increase competition, allowing \nsmall businesses to combine in health plans so they can offer more \ninsurance to employees at a lower cost.\n  These three bills I mentioned have been offered and rejected so far \nby the Democratic majority. We should have more flexibility in health \nsavings accounts, efforts at waste, fraud, and abuse, which are, in \neffect, Medicaid--the largest government program--and Medicare--the \nsecond largest--and more aggressive steps to encourage wellness and \nprevention.\n  One approach, the comprehensive 2,000-page bill, Washington-takeover \napproach, Americans are very leery of. In my respectful opinion, this \nbill is historic in its arrogance for thinking we could take a system \nthat affects almost all 300 million Americans, 16 percent of the \neconomy, and change it all at once.\n  Instead, why don't we go step by step to re-earn the trust of the \nAmerican people? Republicans will be making those proposals on the \nfloor this month and next month and as long as it takes to try to see \nthat we get real health care reform. Cutting grandma's Medicare by $\\1/\n2\\ trillion and spending it on a new program at a time when Medicare is \ngoing broke is not real health care reform.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to conclude with our time \nthis morning by focusing on the larger picture a little bit, as my \ncolleague from Tennessee has done in his concluding remarks.\n  When you ask Americans whether they want health care reform, the vast \nmajority would say yes. When you ask them what they mean by that, the \nvast majority in the polls and in my personal experience are saying: We \nwant to see the spiraling costs of health care and our health insurance \nbrought under control and reduced, and we want to see increased access \nto quality health care for those who do not have access today and for \nthose who have limited access today.\n  This bill fails on those two central points. What this legislation \ndoes, instead, is increase the size of government by $2.5 trillion of \nnew Federal spending, establishing massive new Federal controls over \nthe economy, and even creating a Federal Government insurance company. \nIt increases taxes by about $500 billion, and not just on the so-called \nwealthy. The vast majority of these taxes is going to squarely hit \nthose who President Obama said would not be hit: those who make less \nthan $200,000 a year and, frankly, all the way down the income chain.\n  It cuts Medicare by $464 billion. It puts a major new unfunded \nmandate on our States, which are already struggling in their fiscal \nbudgets. As my colleague indicated, it causes the price of insurance \npremiums to go up for the individual market, to go up in the small \ngroup insurance market, and to be basically unchanged in the large \ninsurance market, according to the CBO study.\n  By the way, one of the things that is not pointed out in that CBO \nstudy very much is in that large market, which it says will be the only \npart of the market that does not see insurance rates go up, one of the \nreasons is because their health care will go down. In other words, \nthere is a tax on these larger, high-cost insurance premiums that is \ngoing to be either passed through and cause their insurance to go up or \nwill be avoided by reducing the cost of their insurance and reducing \ncoverage of the benefits in these policies. So one way or the other, \nall Americans are going to see their health care premiums go up or, in \nthe large groups, see their health care premiums be held the same by \nreducing the quality of the insurance they have.\n  If you go back to those two reasons Americans wanted health care \nreform, did we see premiums go down? No. Did we see increased quality \nor increased access to care? Well, there are some who are going to get \na subsidy in this program for this new massive Federal program. But at \nwhat price? Mr. President, $2.5 trillion, $464 billion of cuts in \nMedicare, the establishment of a major new government program that \nwould essentially be funded on the backs of massive new tax increases, \nmassive Federal tax increases, and Medicare cuts, and in the end we \nwill still be in a system in which we are seeing spiraling increases in \nhealth care costs. To me, that is not the kind of reform we need.\n  My colleague from Tennessee indicated there are a number of reforms \non which we can find common ground that will reduce health care costs. \nThere are a number of reforms on which we can find common ground that \nwill help us to increase access to quality care. That is where our \nfocus should be. That is why I stand here today in support of my \ncolleague John McCain, his motion to commit this legislation to the \nFinance Committee. As was indicated, it could be done in 1 day, to \nsimply remove the Medicare cuts that are contained within it. Let's fix \nthat part of this bill, and then let's work forward.\n  I see my time has expired. I encourage this Senate to focus closely \non the legislation and to let us work together in a bipartisan fashion \nrather than speeding ahead and trying to pass legislation that has not \nhad the opportunity for this kind of bipartisan effort to develop a \ngood work product for the American people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, I believe is on her way to the floor of the Senate. She and \nseveral other Members, in the time we have allocated to us between now \nand 11:30, will address her amendment she proposed yesterday. But \npending her arrival, I want to respond, if I could, very briefly to \nsome of the conversation here this morning.\n  First, I know some people have short memories, but I am somewhat \nintrigued to hear our good friends and colleagues talk about preserving \nMedicare. I have been around here a few years and recall very vividly \nthe debates of 1995 and 1997 on the issue of Medicare, where our \nfriends, who were in the majority in those days, were talking about \nslowing the growth of Medicare and one of the proposals they had for \ndoing so was to cut into the benefits of Medicare recipients.\n  We do not do that in this bill at all. Quite to the contrary, despite \nthe language about ``big cuts in Medicare,'' we strengthen the Medicare \nProgram substantially. That is the reason the AARP and other major \norganizations involved with the elderly have endorsed our proposals. \nThey would hardly be doing so if they thought this was some massive cut \ninto the Medicare Program that has been so critical to so many of our \nfellow citizens.\n  Just for a little bit of history here--In 1995 our Republican \ncolleagues proposed cutting benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. Newt \nGingrich, our former Speaker and friend from the other body, was quoted \nas saying ``let's let Medicare wither on the vine.'' That is not \nancient history. That is not 1965.\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n\nThat is just a few years ago in all of this debate.\n  There are some very strong provisions in the bill that reduce \npremiums and co-pays for seniors, ensure seniors are able to see their \nown doctors, and keep Medicare from going bankrupt for an additional 5 \nyears. If we adopt the McCain amendment, we are being told today by CBO \nand others that Medicare becomes insolvent in 8 years. So vote for the \nMcCain amendment and you are going to have an insolvent program in 8 \nyears. That is a fact.\n  We extend the life here an additional 5 years. We provide new \npreventive and wellness benefits for seniors, lower prescription drug \ncosts, allow seniors to stay in their homes and not end up in nursing \nhomes.\n  This is a long bill. It is a big bill. But instead of complaining \nabout its size, I would encourage my colleagues to read it and \nunderstand what is being done for Medicare. This is a complicated area, \nbut, nonetheless, critically important.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, who \nis here, and others who want to address the issue of the Mikulski \namendment, and I will yield the floor so they can be heard. I believe \nit is going to be each for 5 minutes. There are about seven of our \ncolleagues who want to be heard on the issue before 11:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might respond.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The plan is, women colleagues will be coming to the \nfloor. As they come, I will yield to them, until Senator Mikulski gets \nhere, and then she will yield the time, if that is all right.\n  Mr. DODD. Very good.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I start, I want to say to my \ncolleague from Connecticut how much I appreciate his work and the work \nof Senator Baucus and Senator Reid. What a remarkable moment we have \nhere.\n  When I go home--and I was home for the holidays--people are urging us \nto get this done. They know their biggest chance of going into \nbankruptcy is a health care crisis--62 percent. They know, as my friend \nSenator Dodd has said almost every day of this debate, every morning \n14,000 people lose their health care. They know if we do not intervene \nwith a good bill, their premiums--in my home State, I say to the \nSenator--will be 41 percent of their income, the average income, by \n2016.\n  Can you imagine? That is unsustainable. For people who say: Why don't \nwe address the economy instead of health care, let me say what happens \nto my constituents if they have to pay 41 percent of their income for \npremiums. Even if they have a good job, I say to my friend from \nConnecticut, they cannot make it. So the status quo is cruel, and it is \nparticularly cruel to women.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to support the Mikulski-Harkin-\nBoxer amendment to improve preventive health coverage for women. The \nMikulski amendment addresses this critical issue by requiring that all \nhealth plans cover comprehensive women's preventive care and \nscreenings--and cover these recommended services at little or no cost \nto women. These health care services include annual mammograms for \nwomen at age 40, pregnancy and postpartum depression screenings, \nscreenings for domestic violence, annual women's health screenings, and \nfamily planning services.\n  The preventive services covered under this amendment would be \ndetermined by the Health Resources and Services Administration to meet \nthe unique preventive health needs of women. HRSA is an agency within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. HHS Secretary Kathleen \nSebelius has already said that ``Mammograms have always been an \nimportant life-saving tool in the fight against breast cancer and they \nstill are today.'' The Secretary made clear that recommendations by the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force ``do not set federal policy and \nthey don't determine what services are covered by the federal \ngovernment.''\n  This is not the first time that experts have disagreed about this \nissue. I have been in this battle before, with Senator Mikulski, who \ncalled a hearing with all of the women Senators in 1994 where I \ninsisted that routine mammograms for women over 40 must be covered. And \nthank goodness we fought back then, and in 1997 and in 2002 when this \nissue was raised again and again. Since 1991, the death rate from \nbreast cancer has been reduced by over 20 percent.\n  According to a 2007 Partnership for Prevention report, 3,700 \nadditional lives would be saved each year if we increased to 90 percent \nthe portion of women age 40 and older who have been screened for breast \ncancer in the past 2 years. The most recent data show us that \napproximately 17 percent of breast cancer deaths occurred in women who \nwere diagnosed in their forties. That is why the American Cancer \nSociety continues to recommend annual screening using mammography and \nclinical breast examination for all women beginning at age 40. \nMammograms are still the most effective and valuable tool for \ndecreasing suffering and death from breast cancer. The Mikulski \namendment will ensure women are able to get access to this and other \nlifesaving preventive services at no cost.\n  The underlying bill introduced by Senator Reid already requires that \npreventive services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce be covered at little to no cost. These recommendations already \ninclude some women's preventive services such as osteoporosis \nscreenings.\n  But they do not include certain recommendations that many women's \nhealth advocates and medical professionals believe are critically \nimportant, such as screenings for ovarian cancer--a disease that will \nclaim the lives of nearly 15,000 women this year. We know that when \novarian cancer is diagnosed early, more than 93 percent of women \nsurvive longer than 5 years.\n  Women are often the decisionmakers for their families when it comes \nto health care. But women too often put the health needs of their \nfamily members and their children ahead of their own.\n  By passing this amendment, we are saving the lives of countless \nmothers, daughters, grandmothers and sisters who would otherwise forgo \npreventative health care because of high copays and expensive \ndeductibles.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues a story from a doctor in my \nhome State of California, William Leininger, that drives home the \nimportance of this amendment:\n\n       In my last year of residency, I cared for a mother of two \n     who had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23. At \n     that time, she was covered by her husband's insurance, but it \n     was an abusive relationship, and she lost her health \n     insurance when they divorced.\n       For the next five years, she had no health insurance and \n     never received follow-up care (which would have revealed that \n     her cancer had returned). She eventually remarried and \n     regained health insurance, but by the time she came back to \n     see me, her cancer had spread.\n       She had two children from her previous marriage--her \n     driving motivation during her last rounds of palliative care \n     was to survive long enough to ensure that her abusive ex-\n     husband wouldn't gain custody of her kids after her death. \n     She succeeded. She was 28 when she died.\n\n  That is not a story that should be told in the richest nation in the \nworld.\n  As I said, I am so proud to support the Mikulski-Harkin-Boxer \namendment to improve preventive health care coverage for women. Here is \nwhy. It is a fact that women are increasingly delaying or skipping \naltogether preventive health care, and they are doing it because of \ncosts.\n  I read a statistic done by a nonpartisan group that said about 39 \npercent of men are delaying going to a physician to check on a problem. \nBut over 50 percent of women are doing that either because they do not \nhave health coverage or they are fearful of the copay. So we could sit \nhere and do nothing--that is the easy thing to do: Scare people, do \nnothing--or we could step to the plate, save Medicare, which is very \nimportant to save, and that is what this bill does. Because we say we \nare not going to spend money on waste, fraud, and abuse. We are going \nto spend money on health care for our people.\n  And to believe that my friends on the other side are the ones who are \ngoing to save Medicare? You just have to read history. Senator Dodd \nexplained it; Newt Gingrich saying: Let Medicare wither on the vine; \nBob Dole, our friend, who said, at the time of his Presidential \ncampaign: I fought against Medicare. It was a failure.\n\n[[Page S12026]]\n\n  Well, if you ask our seniors, I think they are the group most pleased \nwith their coverage. It is not perfect, but it is critical, and we save \nit here. We extend the life of Medicare.\n  So here we are in a situation where many women are delaying going to \nthe doctor, getting their preventive services, and the Mikulski \namendment addresses this critical issue. It requires that all health \nplans cover comprehensive women's preventive care and screenings, and \ncover them at little or no cost.\n  The reason this is so important is--first of all, in the HELP \nCommittee, under Senator Dodd's and Senator Kennedy's leadership, this \npiece of the package was in the bill because Senator Mikulski and \nothers pushed so hard to get it placed into the bill.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nif I could complete my remarks and then give the floor over to her?\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I am so proud to work with Senator Mikulski. I say to the Senator, we \nworked on this issue over the years. I just asked my staff to go back \nand look at the first time we teamed up to ensure that women get \nmammograms at age 40. That was in 1994. Then, again, over the years, \nevery 3 or 4 years, this whole notion would rear its ugly head: Well, \nwomen can do without mammography. The question I have is, What is going \nto replace it? They would keep trying to take away our tools of self-\nexamination and mammography. We know if you look through the years--and \nSenator Mikulski and I are proud of a lot of the work we do, but this \ngoes right at the top of the list--we know mortality for breast cancer \nis way down since the early 1990s. It is 20 percent down since the \nearly 1990s. We have had to stand our ground to protect women, to make \nsure they get those services they need, those lifesaving services, at \nlittle or no cost.\n\n  I would also say the American Cancer Society continues to recommend \nannual screening using mammography and clinical breast exams for all \nwomen beginning at age 40. There are a lot of other very important \ntests that are included in the Mikulski amendment--very important \ntests--to deal with cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, finding the \nmarkers so we know how to deal with these deadly diseases. To give up \nthe tools we have, to turn it over to some organization that does not \nreport to the Secretary of HHS, makes no sense.\n  What my friend has done with her amendment is to make sure the group \nthat decides this is under the jurisdiction of the HHS Secretary. We \nknow the HHS Secretary has already said she wants to make sure women, \nstarting at age 40, get those mammograms.\n  I am going to close by reading from an article in the March 10, 1994, \nSan Francisco Chronicle. It says:\n\n       Joining what became a phalanx of six female Senators \n     staring down at federal health officials Boxer said she will \n     insist that routine mammograms and a host of other women's \n     health needs be part of any new nationwide benefit package.\n\n  The article goes on. It is very clear. What I said at the time is:\n\n       After all of these years of women being told it is crucial \n     by age 40 to get a baseline mammogram, now to have this \n     tremendous confusion hit us is very disturbing.\n\n  Well, it was disturbing on March 10, 1994, when I first got involved \nin this issue. It was disturbing when Senator Snowe, 3 years later, had \nus pass S. Res. 47 which said this is our only tool. Let's do it. Thank \ngoodness we have now in this body women and men who get the fact that \nwe refuse as women to be stripped of the only tools we have. Making all \nof these important tests part of this package is going to save lives. \nIt is going to save money. It is going to mean our families can breathe \na deep sigh of relief out there.\n  So I wish to thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this issue \nand to always stand right at her side on this issue of mammography. We \nalso worked on standards for mammography. Remember that one? It was the \nderegulation fever that hit the Republican side. They wanted to take \naway the regulations for mammography, roll them back. We fought the \nfight, and we will continue to fight the fight.\n  So thank you very much. I strongly support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor for my friend, Senator Mikulski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we debate health care reform, we need \nto recognize in the United States of America that health care is a \nwomen's issue. Health care reform is a must-do women's issue, and \nhealth insurance reform must be a must-change women's issue.\n  Too often when we look at when health care is even available to us, \nwe face discrimination. We face continually the punitive practices of \ninsurance companies that charge women more and give us less in a \nbenefit. A 25-year-old woman pays more for health insurance than her \nmale counterpart of the same health status. A 40-year-old woman pays \nalmost 35 percent more for her insurance than a male of the same age, \nsame health status. We want to change that in health care reform. We \nwant to end the punitive practices of the private insurance companies \nin their gender discrimination.\n  We, the women of the Senate, are concerned that even being a woman is \nbeing viewed by the insurance companies as a preexisting condition.\n  Now we have the opportunity to change the law and change the \ndirection of health care. I have offered an amendment to expand the \nscreening and preventive services available to women in order to save \nour lives, make sure our lives are not impaired as we get older and, at \nthe same time, be able to save money. We know early detection saves \nlives, curtails the expansion of disease, and, in the long run, saves \nmoney.\n  There are certain killers of women, the dread ``c'' word, cancer--\nbreast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer that are unique to we \nwomen. Then there is the dread disease of lung cancer that affects men \nand women but is emerging as a main killer of women. Then there is the \nother issue of heart disease and vascular disease. We know for years \nwomen were often left out of the research on heart disease. For years \nwomen's heart disease went undetected and unrecognized because our \nsymptoms are different. We can change this law.\n  In my amendment we expand the key preventive services for women, and \nwe do it in a way that is based on recommendations from the Centers for \nDisease Control and from HRSA. It will be based on the benefit package \navailable to Federal employees. It means if our amendment passes, the \nwomen of America will have the same access to preventive and screening \nservices as the women of Congress. What is good enough for a United \nStates Senator should be good enough for any woman in the United States \nof America.\n  That is why we ask not only the women to join us but the good men of \nquality who support us. We know people such as Senator Dodd, Senator \nReid, Senator Baucus, men of quality, never fear we women who seek \nequality. They have raced for the cure as long and as hard as we have \nand have fought for mammogram standards. This is why we are wearing \npink today. Pink is the universal color that says while we race for the \ncure, we want to have access to it when we find it. But to have access \nto the cure, we are going to need to have access to mammograms to be \nable to get that diagnosis, and then we are going to have to have \nhealth insurance to be able to pay for the treatment we have.\n  This is the Titanic battle we have today: Are we going to have access \nto health insurance and are we going to have access to these preventive \nservices?\n  We do know in the area of heart disease and cancer and silent, \nundetected killers such as diabetes, it is often undetected. What \nhappens is, for many women they do not get that early detection and \nscreening, No. 1, because they can't afford it. They can't afford it \nbecause they either don't have health insurance and there are other \ndemands on their family or, No. 2, when they go, if they do have \ninsurance, they find their benefit might not be covered. So many of \nthese benefits are based on State mandates, but worse than that it is \nthe copayments and high deductibles.\n  Many women say: Well, my insurance company provides for it, but this \ncopayment and deductible, I have to choose between my children's shoes \nor my deductible. We want to either\n\n[[Page S12027]]\n\neliminate or shrink those deductibles and eliminate that high barrier, \nthat overwhelming hurdle that prevents women from having access to \nthese early detection and screening programs.\n  Much is being debated about mammograms. We believe access to \nmammograms should be universal, universal access. But the decision on \nwhether to get one should be made with your doctor. Well, that is great \nto say, but you need to have access to your doctor. You need to not \nhave to overcome the high hurdle of deductions or copayments to be able \nto do it.\n  We know mammogram screenings decrease breast cancer by over 40 \npercent. Regular pap smears reduce cervical cancer by 40 percent. This \nyear, 4,000 women will die of cervical cancer. Then let's take the \ndread, but often overlooked, diabetic screening. Diabetes is the \nunderlying cause of two-thirds of chronic illness in both younger and \nolder women. If we find it early and get everybody in the right \nprogram, they are going to be able to get the treatment they need so \nthey don't lose an eye, they don't lose a kidney, they don't lose a \nleg.\n  We can't lose any more time. We need to provide universal access to \nhealth care to the American people and we need to make sure they have \naccess to the screening and early preventive actions that will save \nlives.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Mikulski amendment, and I \nthank you for your leadership on this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be equally divided \nbetween Governor Shaheen, Senator Hagan, Senator Murray, and Senator \nGillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nMikulski's amendment to ensure that women have access to preventive \nhealth care screenings and care at no cost. I wish to thank Senator \nMikulski for her leadership not just in this effort but over the years \nto make sure women are treated fairly when it comes to our health care.\n  As a woman, a mother of three daughters and a grandmother of three \ngranddaughters, this is an issue that is critically important to me \npersonally. But as a former Governor, now a Senator and a policymaker, \nI understand these preventive services are not just good for women but \nthey are good for families--for the children and husbands and brothers \nand fathers of the women we are talking about today. This amendment is \ngood for our society as a whole.\n  Women must have access to vitally important preventive services such \nas screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, pregnancy, and \npostpartum depression screenings, annual well-woman visits, and \npreconception counseling that promotes healthier pregnancies and \noptimal birth outcomes. It is the right thing to do, but it is also \nfiscally responsible.\n  Not only does diagnosing disease early significantly increase a \nwoman's chance for survival, but it also significantly decreases the \nprojected costs of treatment. In fact, one recent study estimated that \nalmost 80 percent of all health care spending in the United States can \nbe attributed to potentially preventable chronic illness. This \namendment takes a great step forward to early diagnosis of these costly \nand potentially preventable diseases. We must ensure these important \nservices are provided at no cost.\n  Too often, women forgo their health care needs because they are not \naffordable. We know cost plays a greater role in preventing women from \naccessing health care than it does men. In 2007, more than half of all \nwomen reported problems accessing needed health care because of costs.\n  It is clear we need to support Senator Mikulski's amendment that will \ngive women access to important health care screening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator \nMikulski's amendment, which improves the health care measures that are \nalready in this act.\n  Women must shoulder the worst of the health care crisis, including \noutrageous discriminatory practices in care and coverage. Not only do \nwe pay more for the coverage we seek for the same age and the same \ncoverage as men do, but in general women of childbearing age spend 68 \npercent more in out-of-pocket health care costs than men.\n  Some of the most essential services required by women are currently \nnot covered by many insurance plans, such as childbearing, Pap smears, \nand mammograms. A standard in-hospital delivery can cost between $5,000 \nand $10,000 and much more if there are complications. You cannot \nimagine what it is like for a pregnant woman to recognize she may not \nhave coverage for the essential services she needs for herself and her \nchild. The health care bill before us ensures that this will no longer \nhappen.\n  However, there is much room for improvement. In America today, too \nmany women are delaying or skipping preventive care because of the \ncosts of copays and limited access. In fact, more than half of women \ndelay or avoid preventive care because of its cost.\n  This fundamental inequity in the current system is dangerous and \ndiscriminatory and we must act.\n  The prevention section of the bill before us must be amended so \ncoverage of preventive services takes into account the unique health \ncare needs of women throughout their lifespan.\n  With Senator Mikulski's amendment, even more preventive screening \nwill be covered, including for post-partum depression, domestic \nviolence, and family planning.\n  Covering more preventive screening at no cost to women will encourage \nthat more women go to the doctor, improving their health, saving lives \nand, as Senator Mikulski brought out, saving money.\n  The whole point of this health care bill is to lower costs across the \nboard. When you shift America's health care system to preventive \nservices over the current emergency room services, you are going to do \nexactly that.\n  This amendment will ensure that the coverage of women's preventive \nservices is based on a set of guidelines developed by women's health \nexperts.\n  This amendment will also preserve the doctor-patient relationship, to \nallow the patient to consult with their doctor on what services are \nbest for them.\n  This amendment will cost $490 million over 10 years and it is fully \npaid for.\n  The health care crisis in America must be addressed, and I am very \nsupportive of Senator Mikulski's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the senior Senator from Maryland.\n  This amendment tackles a serious problem: Women are increasingly \nskipping critical preventive health care screenings because of costs, \neven when they have health insurance.\n  This summer, I received an e-mail from a woman named Julie in \nRaleigh, NC, about her sister who had no insurance and waited years to \nget a mammogram because she couldn't afford to pay the $125 fee for a \nmammogram. Then she found a lump in her breast.\n  Eventually, the mass grew so large Julie's sister finally got her \nmammogram and paid for it with cash. The mammogram confirmed what she \nhad suspected, that she had breast cancer. But now that she had a \ndiagnosis, she had no way to pay for the treatment.\n  She lost her battle with breast cancer in March of this year. Julie's \nsister, perhaps, could have beaten this cancer if she had had access to \naffordable, preventive care and, after her diagnosis, access to \ninsurance or medical care to cover her cancer treatment.\n  In this heartbreaking situation, Julie's sister was sick and stuck. \nThis health care reform bill will provide people such as Julie's sister \nwith access to affordable, quality health insurance.\n  The President of Randolph Hospital in Asheboro, NC, wrote to me \nrecently that a few years ago, he was in a meeting with 20 to 30 of his \nnursing assistants who were covered by the hospital's insurance plan. \nOf those who were old enough to require a mammogram, only 20 percent \nhad actually gotten one. The reason, they said, was the\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\nhigh out-of-pocket costs they would have to pay.\n  When these women had to choose between feeding their children, paying \nthe rent, and meeting other financial obligations, they skipped \nimportant preventive screenings and took a chance with their personal \nhealth.\n  The hospital then decided to remove the financial barrier to \npreventive care and pay for 100 percent of preventive screenings.\n  With the passage of Senator Mikulski's amendment, we will do the same \nfor all women. A comprehensive list of women's preventive services will \nbe covered with no added out-of-pocket expenses.\n  With this amendment, we will ensure that, as the old saying goes, \n``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,'' for women across \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Washington \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I add my thanks to the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, for bringing forth this important issue as we \naddress health care reform in this country to ensure that all our \nfamilies have access to health care.\n  One of the most important things we can do is make sure the \ncaregivers in our families--the women--get access to preventive care so \nthey can take care of their families.\n  This amendment will require all the health plans to cover \ncomprehensive women's preventive care and screenings at no cost to \nwomen. That is extremely important. We all understand that--but \nespecially in these tough economic times, when families across the \ncountry are struggling. One of the results has been that a lot of women \nare skipping or delaying their health care. We all know this \npersonally. As moms, you take care of your kids first. When you do \nthat, you often leave your families at risk because you haven't gotten \nthe necessary preventive care.\n  We know that, in 2007, a quarter of women reported delaying or \nskipping health care because of the costs. In May of 2009, a report by \nthe Commonwealth Foundation found that more than half of women delayed \nor avoided preventive care because of its cost.\n  This amendment will ensure that those women don't delay their \npreventive care because they cannot afford it. It is extremely \nimportant for this bill, it is important for women in this country, and \nit is important for men and children in this country as well.\n  I add my thanks to the senior Senator from Maryland and all our \nSenate colleagues who have been down here to make sure that one of the \nfirst things we do as we move the bill to the floor is make sure \nwomen's preventive care is covered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, that concludes our discussion and our \nresponses to this portion of the health care reform bill.\n  I must say: Alert, alert, alert. We have just been informed that a \nshrill advocacy group is spreading lies about this amendment. They are \nsaying that because it is prevention, it includes abortion services. \nThere are no abortion services included in the Mikulski amendment. It \nis screening for diseases that are the biggest killers for women--the \nsilent killers of women. It also provides family planning--but family \nplanning as recognized by other acts. Please, no more lies. Let's get \noff of it and save lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute. Very much \nstraight to the point here, there has been some discussion about CBO's \nassessment on the health care premiums. The letter was out yesterday. \nThat letter shows that for all Americans--all Americans--premiums will \nbe lower. They will be modestly lower to those larger employers. We \nhave a range between those small businesses of between a 1-percent \nreduction and a 2-percent increase, and for the individual market there \nis more variation because there is much more variation today currently \nin the individual market.\n  Those who purchase in the individual market will be getting a lot \nbetter quality of insurance than they are getting today--much better. \nAbout 60 percent of those in the individual market will find that their \npremiums are actually lower after the tax credit/subsidies are taken \ninto consideration.\n  So netted all out together, all Americans are going to see their \npremiums are lower for what they get today. About 7 percent will see an \nincrease, but they are getting better coverage than today--quite a bit \nbetter coverage. On a net basis, basically, bottom line, everyone were \nwill see his or her premiums lower. For the 7 percent that are not \nlowered, they will get a lot better quality of insurance. That will \nmore than offset the increase in premium. That is what that CBO letter \nsays. I urge all folks who are interested to read that letter.\n  I have one other minor point on the so-called Cadillac plans. CBO \nsaid that those who receive Cadillac plans will find their premiums \nreduced, not increased--I think it is by about 6 or 7 percent. That, \ntoo, is very important. There has been a lot of discussion about the \neffect of premiums on Cadillac plans. CBO says those premiums will be \nreduced.\n  My minute is probably up. I wish to use the last seconds to just say \nthat the net, all the way across the board, CBO says premiums will be \nreduced when you take subsidies into consideration and compare the \nplans people get today with what they would otherwise get in the \nfuture, the quality of coverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to consume that \n3 minutes and the other 15 minutes allotted to our side on the \nexecutive nomination, and when that 18 minutes is up, the remainder be \nfollowed by the time on the Democratic side and the nomination be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wished to spend a few minutes on this.\n  As a physician who cared for Medicare patients for 25 years, I cannot \ntell you how worried I am about what this bill is going to do to my \nsenior patients. When Medicare was first written, two things were put \ninto the law--very straightforward, very direct. Let me read them to \nyou, for a minute. I hope Americans listen to this. Here is what the \nlaw is. CMS is breaking the law today and, with the new Medicare \nCommission, they are going to break it even further under this bill.\n  Section 1801 says this:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize any \n     Federal officer or employee to exercise any supervision or \n     control over the practice of medicine or the manner in which \n     medical services are provided, or over the selection, tenure, \n     or compensation of any officer or employee of any \n     institution, agency, or person providing health services; or \n     to exercise any supervision or control over the \n     administration or operation of any such institution, agency, \n     or person.\n\n  That says that the Federal Government cannot practice medicine. That \nis what it says.\n  Section 1802 says this--and this is where it is important for my \nMedicare patients and everyone out there:\n\n       Any individual entitled to insurance benefits under this \n     title may obtain health services from any institution, \n     agency, or person qualified to participate under this title \n     if such institution, agency, or person undertakes to provide \n     him such services.\n\n  Well, what we have in this bill is the gutting of those two \nfoundational principles of Medicare. The first is the Medicare Advisory \nCommission is going to tell you what you can and cannot have. Here is \nwhat we are going to see: You will choose what I tell you to choose if \nyou are a Medicare patient.\n  Not only do we have almost $500 billion in cuts to Medicare, under \nthe auspices that we have to control entitlement spending; not only are \nwe taking away plans from people who are very satisfied with what they \nhave today, but we have enhanced, and will enhance, the ability of the \nFederal Government to practice medicine.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who have never \npracticed medicine, who know the legalese but don't know the \nconsequences of right now the rationing of Medicare on drugs such as \nEpigen and Neupogen--you see, Medicare has decided when oncologists can \nuse those drugs. They have taken a\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\nblanket position, although they have released it somewhat. But what it \nsays is this--I will give you a patient who has breast cancer. She is \n67 years old. She is being treated for breast cancer. She becomes \nanemic and neutropenic. That means her white blood cell count, her \nability to fight infection goes down.\n\n  We have wonderful drugs that raise the white blood cell count and \nraise the red blood cell count. But Medicare, in its obvious wisdom of \npracticing medicine, has told the oncologists when they can and cannot \nuse it. That is fine for 75 percent of the patients, but it totally \nignores the other 25 percent of the patients who happen to have \ncomplicating factors, such as congestive heart failure or if they \nbecome anemic under breast cancer chemotherapy and have congestive \nheart failure as well. The government says you cannot have \nerythropoietin at this level of hemoglobin regardless of whether you \nhave congestive heart failure.\n  What happens is the practice of medicine out of Washington or \nMaryland, more specifically, determines who can and cannot have a drug; \nin this case, erythropoietin.\n  What is the consequence of that? The consequence is that the patient \ndid not die of breast cancer; she died of congestive heart failure that \ncould have easily been treated had we not had medicine practiced by CMS \ndenying the ability of the physician to give the patient exactly what \nshe needed when she needed it.\n  We are starting down that road with this bill--aggressively starting \ndown that road--because the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \ncombined with the Comparative Effectiveness Panel will not look at \ncomplications and will not look at secondary diseases. They will look \nat the average.\n  I want to tell my colleagues, when you are sitting in an office with \nyour doctor, you are not average. You are you, and you are a specific \nindividual with a set of factors that nobody else has. The judgment in \nthe practice of medicine cannot be done by an insurance company or CMS \nat a distance without them having a hand on the patient. They never \nhave their hand on a patient.\n  The whole art of medicine, which is 40 percent of getting people \nwell, is the knowledge and training and experience and gray hair that \ncomes with looking at the total patient, being one on one, not having \nthe government between the doctor and their treatment of a patient.\n  What this bill does--this bill is a lie one of two ways. One, it says \nwe are going to take this money out of Medicare and you are not going \nto notice any difference. That cannot be true. If we take $500 billion \nor $400 billion-plus out of Medicare, millions of seniors are going to \nnotice a difference in their health care and what they get under \nMedicare. If we say that is not true, then the only way that is not \ntrue is the game that is being played on the financing of this program; \nthat is to say, we are going to cut this money out of Medicare and then \nwith a wink and a nod know we are never going to do it.\n  The majority leader said yesterday there is nothing more important in \nthis Nation right now than passing health care reform. I differ with \nthat statement. I think 10.2 percent unemployment is a whole lot more \nimportant, and finding those people jobs, than passing health care \nreform. I think a $12 trillion debt is more important to address than \nfixing health care right now. I think the fact that we have $350 \nbillion worth of waste, fraud, and duplication in the Federal \nGovernment every year, and we are not addressing it, is more important \nthan fixing health care right now. I think the fact that our economy is \nstill on its back and people are continuing to lose jobs is more \nimportant than fixing health care right now.\n  I understand the political dynamics, but I also understand very well \nwith my quarter of a century of practicing medicine that what this bill \nis going to do is destroy the best health care system in the world, and \nit is going to undermine the security of every senior in this country \nbecause what starts as a small couple of things, such as Neupogen and \nEpogen or like when you can have bone densitometry and whether your \nosteoporosis can truly be evaluated, CMS has already said how much you \ncan do that, whether your bones are falling apart or not. It is the \nstart of the government practicing medicine.\n  It is the beginning of our seniors having the government step in \nbetween them and their physician in terms of the physician wanting to \ndo what is best for that senior and the government saying: No, I will \ntell you what you are going to have. I will tell you what you will \nhave.\n  Thomas Jefferson taught us a lot. He predicted we would have ``future \nhappiness for us if we can prevent the government from wasting the \nlabors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.''\n  I want to see a lot of things changed in health care. I want to see \ntrue competition in the insurance industry. I want to make sure nobody \nloses their insurance because they get sick. I want to make sure \neverybody can get insurance if they are sick. I do not disagree with \nthe basic premise. What I disagree with is moving $2.5 trillion more \nunder government control, which will raise costs ultimately in the \nhealth care sector. If it does not raise costs and we are truly going \nto take this money from Medicare, what it is going to do to our \nseniors, I have a message for you: You are going to die soon, and they \nare going to say that is not true, that it is not true.\n  When you restrict the ability of the primary caregivers in this \ncountry to do what is best for their senior patients, what you are \ndoing is limiting their life expectancy. We are saying CMS, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, and the Comparative Effectiveness \nPanel will tell the doctors what they can and cannot do, ignoring the \n20 percent of the people for whom that is exactly the wrong \nprescription. So for 20 percent of our seniors, this bill is going to \nbe a disaster, but it is going to save money because you are not going \nto be around for us to spend any money on you because the government \nwill have already told us what the treatment plan will be for you. We \nwill decide in Washington through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices what you will receive.\n  They will dispute that, but the people who are going to be disputing \nthat are lawyers; they are not doctors. They have never laid a hand on \na patient. They have never put their hand forward on a Medicare patient \nknowing the consequences of the total patient, the background, the \nmedical history, the sociologic factors that fit, the family dynamics, \nthe past medical history, the family history, and the present state of \nmind of that patient.\n  Even more important, what this bill is going to do is divide the \nloyalty of your doctor away from you. When you go to the doctor today, \nmost of the time that doctor's No. 1 interest is in you and your well-\nbeing. When you have this Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and you \nhave this Comparative Effectiveness Panel, what that does is that \ncauses the physician--he or she--to take their eyes off of you. Now \nthey are going to put their eyes on what the government says because \nthe consequences of not doing what the government says will ultimately \nresult in some type of sanction.\n  Do we want physicians to be patient-centered and focused on their \npatients or do we want physicians to have their eye on the government \nand half of an eye on the patient? Which do you think is going to give \nus the best care? Which do you think is going to give us the greatest \nquality of life? What is going to give us the greatest longevity with \nthe greatest quality of life? Is it the government practicing medicine, \nor is it the trust that has been developed through years between a \npatient and a doctor to do what is in the best, long-term interest of \nthat patient?\n  I cannot tell you the number of people who die from the CMS \nregulations on Epogen for oncologists. But there were hundreds--\nhundreds--because Medicare never looked at the patient; they looked at \ndollars.\n  As we go forward in this debate, what I want seniors in America to \nknow--and I am fast approaching Medicare age; I am 3 years from it--I \nwant them to know the key thing they are going to lose in this bill is \nthe loyalty and primacy of their physician thinking about them. We are \ngoing to divide that loyalty to where the physician is going to be \nlooking at the government. If you think that is not true, just look at \nwhat has happened so far when CMS\n\n[[Page S12030]]\n\nhas decided to start practicing medicine.\n  In the HELP Committee, I offered an amendment to change the language \nso there would be absolutely a prohibition on rationing care and \ndirecting the care from Washington. It was rejected out of hand--\nrejected out of hand. Not one of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle voted to prohibit rationing of health care.\n  Why would they do that? Because the ultimate intention through the \nComparative Effectiveness Panel is to ration care. It is to ration the \ncare. It is to limit the amount of dollars we spend and never look at \nthe individual patient.\n  If we think about the Medicare cuts in this bill, we are going to \ntake $135 billion out of the hospitals. Do you think seniors will ever \nnotice that? I do. I think when you ring your button and you are \nhurting and you need pain medicines or you need to go to the bathroom, \nthe time it takes for somebody to get there will not be sufficient. \nWhat will happen is you will wait. You will have a complication. If you \nhave acute shortness of breath and press the button, the available \nnurses will not be there. There will be a consequence to cutting $135 \nbillion from payments to hospitals in this country.\n  We are going to take $120 billion out of the seniors--the one in five \nseniors who now have Medicare Advantage. I agree, it is more expensive \nthan Medicare. It needs to have some cost containment through \ncompetitive bidding, but we should not be decreasing the services, \nwhich is exactly what is going to happen. If you are a senior on \nMedicare Advantage, you are going to lose benefits you now have. You \nare going to lose them.\n  One of the ideas of Medicare Advantage was preventive services. One \nof the things that improved the care in rural America was Medicare \nAdvantage. Yet we are going to take that away. The vast majority of the \nbenefits we are going to cut in half.\n  We are going to take $15 billion from nursing homes. That may or may \nnot be appropriate, but the way to do that is through a competitive \nexperience based on quality and outcome rather than some green-eyeshade \nstaffer saying we can take $15 billion out of Medicare from payments to \nnursing homes.\n  One little secret that is not in this bill, that has not been \naddressed in this bill, is the estimate by a Harvard researcher that \nthere is $120 billion to $150 billion a year in fraud in Medicare \nalone. HHS admits to $90 billion. We know it is well over $100 billion \na year. Cleaning up the fraud in Medicare would pay for a lot of health \ncare for a lot of folks in this country. There is $2 billion in this \nwhole bill to clean up the fraud.\n  Why would we not fix that first? Why would we take money from \nMedicare to create a new program when in fact we are wasting 10 to 15 \npercent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will close with this remark. If you are a senior and \nyou are on Medicare, you better be afraid of this bill. I don't come to \nthe floor and say that very often, but your health care is totally \ndependent, in terms of being decreased by this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for 1 minute 7 seconds and the time be taken from that of my good \nfriend and colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, Senator Tom Coburn and I have become great \nfriends. We have spent a lot of time together this summer in my HELP \nCommittee. He talked with great eloquence about that distance that can \noccur between a doctor and patient, and obviously as someone who \npracticed medicine for a long time, he speaks from strong personal \nexperience, and I admire and respect that immensely. But let me say to \nmy colleagues, without this bill we are talking about here, this comes \nto a simple choice. Under existing law, the way things are today, one \ninstitution stands between a doctor and patient and that is your \ninsurance company. They ration care all the time. In fact, I am a \nliving example of rationed care, having been through surgery, getting \npreapproval twice before surgery and then being rejected by the very \ninsurance company I paid premiums to for a long time as a Member of \nthis body. We are working it out, I believe, because they thought--I am \n65--that Medicare ought to pay for my surgery rather than the company I \npaid premiums to for a long time.\n  They were rationing my care. That insurance company, it wasn't some \ngovernment entity or someone else, they are the ones. Without our bill, \nthe only one getting to decide what health services anyone receives is \nthe insurance industry.\n  I hope we would have a chance to debate this further, as I am \nconfident we will.\n  Let me also say how much I support the effort by Senator Mikulski on \nher efforts to see to it that women are treated equally, and \nparticularly in preventive care, and I strongly urge the adoption of \nher amendment and ask to be added as a cosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, our Nation is in the midst of a historic \ndebate about how to reform our health insurance system. Three House \ncommittees and two Senate committees have spent countless hours trying \nto answer the question of how best to introduce competition and make \nhealth insurance affordable for all Americans. I applaud their efforts, \nand I applaud the efforts of the many Senators who have fought to bring \nthis important debate to the Senate floor.\n  I have pushed and will continue to push for provisions that \naccomplish the ``three C's'' of health insurance reform: choice, \ncompetition, and cost control. I recently reaffirmed my support for a \npublic option.\n  A public option would give consumers more choices to purchase an \naffordable and quality health insurance plan and will help drive down \noverall health care costs. I will continue to push for inclusion of a \npublic option in the final Senate bill.\n  Amid this discussion of how best to introduce competition into the \nhealth insurance industry, it is important to remember that today the \nhealth insurance industry does not have to play by the same rule of \ncompetition as other industries. Due to a six decade-old special \ninterest exemption, the business of insurance is not subject to the \nNation's antitrust laws. If there was ever a good reason for such an \nexemption, it no longer exists.\n  While there are divergent views on the best way to introduce choice \nand competition into health insurance market, we can surely agree that \nhealth and medical malpractice insurers should not be allowed to \ncollude to set prices and allocate markets.\n  Today, I am filing the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust \nEnforcement Act of 2009 as an amendment to the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. This legislation, which I introduced in September \nand which is cosponsored by 18 Senators, will repeal the antitrust \nexemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance \nproviders, and ensure that the basic rules of fair competition apply to \nthe industry as part of the reforms that the larger health care bill \nwill enact. Our Nation's antitrust laws exist to protect consumers, and \nit is vital that the health insurance and medical malpractice insurance \ncompanies are subject to these laws.\n  These laws promote competition, which ensures that consumers will pay \nlower prices and receive more choices.\n  The Majority Leader, an original cosponsor of this legislation, \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that ``[i]t is of the \nupmost importance that we make sure the insurance industry is playing \nby the same rules as everyone else, and that they are subject to \ncompetition.'' I could not agree more, and I encourage the leader to \nschedule a vote on this amendment early in this debate. The President \nalso recently supported Congress's efforts to determine whether any \njustification remains for permitting price fixing.\n  The vast majority of the companies doing business in the United \nStates are subject to the Federal antitrust laws.\n  However, a few industries have used their influence to maintain a \nspecial, statutory exemption from the antitrust laws. The insurance \nindustry is\n\n[[Page S12031]]\n\none of those few remaining industries. In the markets for health \ninsurance and medical malpractice insurance, patients and doctors are \npaying the price, as costs continue to increase at an alarming rate, \nwhile patients and small businesses suffer. This is wrong, and this \namendment fixes this problem.\n  The Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act is supported \nby a cross-section of groups interested in promoting competition, \nincluding the Consumer Federation of America, Health Care for American \nNow, and the American Hospital Association. I also received a letter \nfrom a coalition of 10 State attorneys general who voiced their \nspecific need for this legislation.\n  The top law enforcement officers in those States argue that ``Repeal \nof the McCarran-Ferguson exemption would enhance competition in health \nand medical malpractice insurance by giving state enforcers, as well as \nfederal enforcers, additional tools to combat harmful anti-competitive \nconduct.'' The letter goes on to state that ``The McCarran-Ferguson \nexemption serves no plausible public interest.''\n  This amendment will prohibit the most egregious anticompetitive \nconduct--price fixing, bid rigging and market allocations--conduct that \nharms consumers, raises health care costs, and for which there is no \njustification. Subjecting health and medical malpractice insurance \nproviders to the antitrust laws will enable customers to feel confident \nthat the price they are being quoted is the product of a fair \nmarketplace.\n  The lack of affordable health insurance plagues families throughout \nour country, and this amendment is a first step towards ensuring that \nhealth insurers and medical malpractice insurers are subject to fair \ncompetition. I hope all Senators will join me in support of this \nimportant amendment.\n  Madam President, I note my amendment removes the outdated, \nantiquated, unnecessary antitrust protection given to our insurance \ncompanies, a protection which, instead of allowing them to thrive and \ngive us lower premiums, has perversely acted in such a way that our \npremiums continue to rise 15 percent in the last year alone. This will \nhelp change that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12031-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12031-S12033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JACQUELINE H. NGUYEN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                 FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to report the following nomination.\n\n       The bill clerk read the nomination of Jacqueline H. Nguyen, \n     of California, to be United States District Judge for the \n     Central District of California.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from California \ndesires some time. I yield her 5 minutes, beginning now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of California Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to be a \nFederal District Court Judge from the Central District of California. I \nurge her confirmation.\n  Judge Nguyen is a tested judge with a track record of success as both \na judge and a Federal prosecutor. She will be the first Vietnamese \nAmerican on the Federal bench. Her nomination comes about this way.\n  I have had, for a long time, a bipartisan judicial selection \ncommittee in California to advise me in recommending judicial nominees \nto the President. The committee gave Judge Nguyen its unanimous \nrecommendation. Then I recommended her to the President for his \nnomination to the Federal district court. I believe she is going to be \nan excellent Federal district court judge in the Central District.\n  Judge Nguyen was born in South Vietnam. She immigrated to this \ncountry with her family at the age of 10 during the final days of the \nVietnam war. The Nguyens spent several months living in a refugee camp \nin Camp Pendleton, San Diego, before moving to the La Crescenta \nneighborhood of Los Angeles. She was naturalized in 1984.\n  Judge Nguyen's parents worked two and three jobs at a time in Los \nAngeles, and Judge Nguyen and her siblings worked side by side with \nthem, cleaning a dental office, peeling and cutting apples for a pie \ncompany, and finally managing the doughnut shop that their parents \nbought and owned.\n  In her application to my selection committee, she explained that \nlooking back on these experiences she realizes now that they were \ndifficult. She wrote:\n\n       But I nevertheless feel incredibly fortunate because those \n     early years gave me invaluable life lessons that have shaped \n     who I am today.\n\n  She went on to graduate from Occidental College in 1987 and from UCLA \nLaw School in 1991. She was in the Moot Court Honors Program.\n  For the first 4 years of her career, she practiced commercial law as \na litigation associate at the private law firm of Musick, Peeler and \nGarrett, where her caseload included complex contract disputes and \nintellectual property cases. In 1995 she left the firm to become an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, \nand a very good one.\n  As an assistant U.S. attorney in the criminal division, she \nprosecuted a wide variety of crimes, including violent crimes, \nnarcotics trafficking, organized crime, gun cases, and all kinds of \nfraud. She spent 6 months in the organized crime strike force section, \nhandling a title III wiretap investigation of a Russian organized crime \ngroup responsible for smuggling sex slaves into the United States from \nthe Ukraine. In 2000, she received a special commendation from FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh for obtaining the first conviction ever in the \nUnited States against a defendant for providing material support to a \ndesignated terrorist organization.\n  The Justice Department recognized her with three additional rewards \nfor superior performance as an assistant U.S. attorney, and in 2000 she \nwas promoted to deputy chief of the general crimes section.\n  In 2002, Judge Nguyen left the U.S. attorney's office when Governor \nGray Davis appointed her to the Superior Court in Los Angeles, and she \nhas been on that bench for more than 7 years and has presided over more \nthan 65 jury trials.\n  As she has said in her own words:\n\n       I am deeply passionate about the privileges that we enjoy \n     as Americans and am committed to spending my life in public \n     service. If I am given the honor to serve as a United States \n     District Judge, I believe my experiences, work ethic, \n     maturity and judgment will serve me well.\n\n  I could not agree more. I think Judge Nguyen will be a truly \noutstanding judge of the Federal district court and I urge my \ncolleagues to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I absolutely concur with the comments of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from California in support of the \nnomination of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to serve on the Federal Court in \nthe Central District of California. I supported Judge Nguyen in the \ncommittee and I am glad we are able to act on her nomination today.\n  Judge Nguyen participated in a confirmation hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee on September 23. Hers was a historic hearing at \nwhich, for the first time, three Asian Pacific American judicial \nnominees appeared together--Judge Nguyen, Dolly Gee and Judge Edward \nChen. Indeed, three Asian Pacific American judicial nominees have never \nbeen confirmed in the same year. Of the 876 active judges serving on \nour Federal courts, only 8 are Asian Pacific American.\n  We also held a November hearing for Judge Denny Chin, a well-\nrespected judge on the Southern District of New York, whom President \nObama has nominated for elevation to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Judge Chin was the first Asian Pacific American appointed as a \nFederal district court judge outside the Ninth Circuit. If confirmed to \nthe Second Circuit, he will be the only active Asian Pacific American \njudge to serve on a Federal appellate court anywhere in the country. It \nis unbelievable that with 179 Federal appellate court judgeships in our \ncountry, none are currently held by an Asian Pacific American. More \nthan 14\n\n[[Page S12032]]\n\nyears have passed since an Asian Pacific American was nominated to a \nFederal appellate court. This progress is long overdue.\n  I commend President Obama for following his commitment to nominate \nmen and women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity of \nAmerica. Diversity on the bench helps ensure that the words ``equal \njustice under law,'' inscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to \nthe Supreme Court are a reality, and that justice is rendered fairly \nand impartially.\n  Judge Jacqueline Nguyen will be the first Vietnamese American to \nserve as a Federal district court judge in the United States, and the \nfirst Asian Pacific American woman to serve as a Federal district court \njudge in the State of California. Today is an important milestone not \nonly for Judge Nguyen, the Vietnamese American community and the Asian \nPacific American community, but for all Americans.\n  Judge Nguyen, Ms. Gee, and Judge Chen were reported favorably to the \nSenate on October 15, more than 6 weeks ago. I am glad we are \nproceeding with Judge Nguyen but urge Senate Republicans to allow \nthe other nominations to proceed to Senate debate and votes, as well. \nWhen she is confirmed, Ms. Gee will be the first female Chinese \nAmerican Federal district court judge in the Nation. When he is \nconfirmed, Judge Chen will be the first Asian Pacific American Federal \ndistrict court judge in the history of the Northern District of \nCalifornia. Judge Chen is already the first Asian Pacific American to \nserve in that district as a magistrate judge. The American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated the \nthree of them unanimously as ``well qualified,'' their highest rating.\n\n  I thank the committee's ranking member, Senator Sessions, for his \ncooperation in securing the recent confirmations of Judge Christina \nReiss of Vermont and Judge Abdul Kallon of Alabama before the \nThanksgiving recess. They were confirmed 17 days after their hearing. \nThat prompt action by the Senate demonstrates what we can do when we \nwork in good faith. It should not take weeks for the Judiciary \nCommittee to report nominations and additional weeks and months before \nSenate Republicans allow nominations to be considered by the Senate. We \nhave shown what we can do.\n  Following the model we have established for Judges Reiss and Kallon, \nthe Senate should be able to consider and confirm all eight of the \njudicial nominations currently on the Executive Calendar awaiting final \naction by the Senate, the additional five judicial nominees included at \nconfirmation hearings in November, and Justice Thompson of Rhode \nIsland, who had her hearing this morning. Acting on these nominations, \nwe can reach a total of 23 Federal circuit and district court \nconfirmations this year. That is well short of the total of 28 a \nDemocratic Senate majority worked to confirm in President Bush's first \nyear in office, 2001, but better than the 9 confirmations achieved in \nthe first 11 months of this year.\n  This year we have witnessed unprecedented delays in the consideration \nof qualified and noncontroversial nominations. We have had to waste \nweeks seeking time agreements in order to consider nominations that \nwere then confirmed unanimously. We have seen nominees strongly \nsupported by their home state Senators, both Republican and Democratic, \ndelayed for months and unsuccessfully filibustered. I have been \nconcerned that these actions by the Republican leadership signal their \nreturn to their practices in the 1990s, which resulted in more than \ndoubling circuit court vacancies and led to the pocket filibuster of \nmore than 60 of President Clinton's nominees. The crisis they created \neventually led to public criticism of their actions by Chief Justice \nRehnquist during those years.\n  I hope that instead of withholding consent and threatening \nfilibusters of President Obama's judicial nominees, Senate Republicans \nwill treat the nominees of President Obama fairly. I made sure that we \ntreated President Bush's nominees more fairly than President Clinton's \nnominees had been treated. In the 17 months that I served as chairman \nof this Committee during President Bush's first term, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 of his judicial nominations. We should continue that \nprogress, but need Republican cooperation to do so. I urge them to turn \naway from their partisanship and begin to work with the President and \nthe Senate majority leader.\n  During the month of December in 2001, a Democratic-led Senate \nconfirmed 10 of President Bush's judicial nominees, bringing the total \nnumber of nominations confirmed that year to 28. We will have to exceed \nthat number this month in order to get to 20 confirmations, and a \npossible total of 23 this year. I fear that Senate Republican delaying \ntactics will, instead, yield the lowest total in modern history. If \nSenate Republicans continue their delaying tactics, the total could be \nas low as that during the 1996 session when a Republican Senate \nmajority would only allow 17 judicial confirmations all session, \nincluding none for circuit courts.\n  Today, with the confirmation of Judge Nguyen, we will finally move \ninto double digits in the confirmations of Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges--hers is our 10th this year. Although there have been \nnearly 110 judicial vacancies this year on our Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts around the country, only 10 vacancies have been filled. \nThat is wrong. The American people deserve better.\n  It has not been for lack of qualified nominees. As I have noted, \nthere are seven more nominations awaiting Senate action on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar and another six who have had their confirmation \nhearings and can be considered once approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Senate should do better and could if Senate Republicans \nwould remove their holds and stop the delaying tactics.\n  During President Bush's last year in office, we reduced judicial \nvacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a presidential election \nyear. Judicial vacancies have now spiked. There are currently 98 \nvacancies on our Federal circuit and district courts, and 23 more have \nalready been announced. This is approaching record levels. I know we \ncan do better. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any American \nbecause of overburdened courts and the lack of Federal judges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been requested on \nthis nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jacqueline H. Nguyen, of California, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe Central District of California?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I said yesterday when I spoke on this \nvery same bill, the excesses of the Reid bill appear willfully ignorant \nof what is going on in the rest of the economy outside of health care.\n  I believe the reason people have objected to the health care bill so \nquickly after the summer was that there was a rude awakening on a lot \nof other things the Congress has done to put this country further into \ndebt, and then they heard us talking about $1.3 trillion and $1.6 \ntrillion for health care, and they thought Congress had gone bananas. \nSo everything seemed to focus on health care reform at that particular \ntime. People were concerned about the economy as a whole. I think the \nhealth care issue in and of itself was what people came out for, but \nhealth care was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back and \nbrought attention to everything else--the debt and things that weren't \nworking. At the same time, they saw the auto industry going into \nbankruptcy and, of course, being bailed out or nationalized, as it is. \nThey have seen banks go under. Then they wondered about health care \nbeing nationalized as well.\n  We have seen our Federal debt skyrocket by $1.4 trillion since this \nPresident took office. I say ``since this President took office'' \nbecause I acknowledge there was a trillion-dollar debt in last year's \nbudget. Just with the addition, it comes out to $11,500 per household. \nSo our Federal debt exceeds $12 trillion for the first time in history. \nAlready, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries stand at nearly $3.5 \ntrillion or 46 percent of the Federal debt held by the public. There \ndoesn't appear to be light at the end of the tunnel. Don't just take my \nword for it. We have the nonpartisan CBO and the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget which have intellectually honest people working \nthere who aren't politically motivated who tell us really what is what. \nThis is what they have to say. Both have stated that within 5 years, \nthe Obama administration's policies will more than double the amount of \ndebt held by the public. Both have stated that by 2019 these policies \nwill more than triple the national debt.\n  In this context, you would expect Congress to be considering a bill \nthat would create jobs and prevent the country from being burdened with \na bigger and more unsustainable Federal budget. Instead of working to \nbring the Federal budget under control, we have in this Congress--the \nmajority of it, by 60 being Democratic--putting forward a bill, this \n2,074-page bill before us that will cost $2.5 trillion when fully \nimplemented. Instead of addressing the budget crisis, this bill will \nbend the Federal spending curve the wrong way by over $160 billion over \nthe next 10 years.\n  I remember during the summer that the Gang of 6, under the leadership \nof Senator Baucus--I was part of that bipartisan group--said there are \ntwo things we need to accomplish: We need to make sure that what we \nhave comes out balanced, and we also need to make sure we do not have \ninflation of health care continuing to go up, that we would eventually \nbring it down. These bills don't do either. I know people say we do \nhave the 10-year window balance. Yes, that is technically right. But \nwhen you have 10 years of income and 6 years of policy expenditure, it \nis easy to do almost anything you want to in that 10-year window. But \nyou have to look beyond that 10-year window, and then you have \nquestions about that.\n  So instead of addressing this budget crisis, this bill adds to the \nFederal burden with enormous costs from the biggest Medicaid expansion \nin history and unfunded liabilities from the new program. Instead of \naddressing this budget crisis, we are now considering this 2,074-page \nbill that cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion and threatens seniors' \naccess to care.\n  After the bailouts of Wall Street and Detroit, a stimulus bill that \nhas led to the highest unemployment in 26 years, and the Federal \nReserve System shoveling money out the door without any \naccountability--they even object to having the GAO check on them--the \nhealth care reform agenda the Democratic leadership put forward is, \nonce again, kind of the straw that broke the camel's back.\n  We have the Senator from Arizona offering a motion to send this bill \nback to the Finance Committee with instructions to report a bill \nwithout the drastic, arbitrary Medicare cuts that are in this bill. I \nsupport the Senator's motion because it is an opportunity to fix the \nbill and then come back to the full Senate with a better bill. Anything \nthat comes back to the Senate floor should not have the drastic and \narbitrary Medicare cuts.\n  I am hearing this from seniors: I have paid into this Medicare for \nall these years. I am in retirement, and now Congress wants to take \nthat money and establish a new entitlement program for somebody else \nother than seniors. So to a lot of seniors it just doesn't add up.\n  This bill, as written, now permanently cuts all annual Medicare \nprovider payment updates in order to account for the supposed increases \nin productivity by health care providers. The productivity measure used \nto cut provider payments in this bill does not represent productivity \nfor a specific type of provider, such as nursing homes.\n  You would think that if Medicare is going to reduce your payments to \naccount for increases in productivity, it would at least measure your \nproductivity, not an entire group of productivity or not somebody \nelse's productivity but yours, and you would be rewarded according to \nthat productivity or, if it wasn't productive, be harmed because of it \nbecause you are not doing the best job you can. But that is not the \ncase. Instead, these reform bills would make the payment cuts based on \nmeasures of productivity for the entire economy. So if the productivity \nof the economy grows because computer chips and other products are made \nmore efficiently, then health care providers see their payments go \ndown. What is the relationship? These permanent cuts threaten \nbeneficiary access to care.\n  The Chief Actuary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nrecently identified this threat to beneficiary access to care. He \nconfirmed this in an October 21 memorandum analyzing the House of \nRepresentatives' bill and again in a November 13 memorandum. Both the \nHouse bill and the Senate bill propose the same type of permanent \nMedicare productivity cuts.\n  We have a chart here. Here is what Medicare's own Chief Actuary had \nto say about these productivity cuts. Referring to these cuts, he \nwrote:\n\n       The estimated savings . . . may be unrealistic.\n\n  In their analysis of these provisions, Medicare's own Chief Actuary \nsaid:\n\n       It is doubtful that many could improve their own \n     productivity to the degree achieved by the economy at large.\n\n  The Actuary goes on to say:\n\n       We are not aware of any empirical evidence demonstrating \n     the medical community's ability to achieve productivity \n     improvements equal to those of the overall economy.\n\n  So you have a $14 trillion economy today. You have $2.3 trillion of \nthat, or one-sixth, related to health care, and you are going to try to \ndo something to the health care aspect, productivity measure, harm or \nbenefit, based upon what happens to the entire $14 trillion economy? \nThat doesn't make sense.\n\n[[Page S12034]]\n\n  The Chief Actuary's conclusion is that it would be difficult for \nproviders to even remain profitable over time as Medicare payments fail \nto keep up with the cost of caring for the beneficiaries.\n  Going back to my chart again, ultimately here is the Chief Actuary's \nconclusion--that providers who rely on Medicare might end their \nparticipation in Medicare, ``possibly jeopardizing access to care for \nbeneficiaries.''\n  This bill also cuts $120 billion from the Medicare Advantage Program, \nwhich provides health coverage to 11 million seniors, including the \n64,000 seniors in my State of Iowa. These drastic Medicare cuts would \nreduce Medicare payments for those 11 million beneficiaries by close to \n50 percent.\n  Just like a lot of people, seniors are struggling financially right \nnow, and these Medicare Advantage cuts will only make it harder for \nthem to afford vision care, chronic-care management, dental care, and \nother benefits they have come to rely on, of their own choosing, \nbecause they decided to go to Medicare Advantage instead of staying in \ntraditional Medicare. And what they are going to lose if they don't \nwant to stay in Medicare Advantage and they are not going to get the \nbenefits they got out of it, they go over to traditional Medicare, are \nthese sorts of benefits which will not be included in traditional \nMedicare.\n  During the campaign, the President said that if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. Well, that won't be true for Medicare Advantage \npeople. They will either pay more, which is contrary to what the \nPresident said in his September speech to the joint session of \nCongress, they are going to pay more or lose benefits.\n  Another problem is that this bill creates a new body of unelected \nofficials with broad authority to make even further cuts in Medicare. \nIronically, this body has been renamed the ``Independent Medicare \nAdvisory Board,'' but it is not really advisory. I would hardly \ndescribe this group that way when its so-called recommendations can \nautomatically go into effect, even absent congressional action--absent \nCongress going after it.\n  I want to go to the chart again. The Wall Street Journal has a more \nappropriate name for this group. They call it the ``rationing \ncommission.'' They described it as ``the unelected body that will \ndictate future medical decisions.''\n  These additional cuts in Medicare will be driven by arbitrary \nspending targets and automatic Medicare cuts written into law by this \nbill.\n  This bill, unwisely, makes this board permanent. This bill requires \nthis board to continue making even more cuts to Medicare and to do that \nforever. If you want to stop it, it will take another act of Congress \nto do it. Of course, this kind of sounds like the sustainable growth \nrate, or SGR, that impacts doctors every year. We always have to \ncorrect the mistakes that were made by passing the sustainable growth \nrate, SGR, first set in place probably 20 years ago, because this SGR \nformula set arbitrary spending targets. These targets turned out to be \nunrealistic. Now that flawed formula will cause an automatic 21-percent \ncut in Medicare physician payments on January 1 if Congress doesn't \nintervene by the end of the year.\n  We all know the challenges Congress faces every year in trying to \nprevent these Medicare physician cuts that are supposed to take place \nbecause spending targets have been exceeded, so automatic payment cuts \nare then to automatically kick in.\n  We have all heard from physicians in our States about the challenges \nin providing care to Medicare beneficiaries while these payment cuts \nloom above. This permanent board would cause the same problem for the \nentire Medicare Program, not just as SGR does for physician payments. \nThis is a far bigger threat to the Medicare Program. It will jeopardize \naccess to health care for our Nation's seniors on a much bigger scale.\n  If this bill is enacted with this permanent board, we will be hearing \nfrom other providers, in addition to doctors, about how they cannot \nafford to treat Medicare patients.\n  What is more alarming is that special back-room deals were cut to \nexempt some providers. This forces then, because of these special \nexemptions that were made, even greater cuts to fall directly on the \nremaining providers.\n  Also, the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the board \nstructure requires it to take focus on its Budget Act on premiums that \nseniors pay for Part D prescription drug coverage and for Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  I have already spoken about Medicare Advantage but just think: One of \nthe things we hear about this time of the year all the time from \nseniors is prescription drug costs are going up, premiums on Part D are \ngoing up. Then you want to give this advisory commission--that is not \nadvisory--authority to increase premiums that seniors pay for Part D \nprescription drug coverage? That means higher premiums for some of our \nmost vulnerable populations.\n  Another issue that cannot be ignored is the pending insolvency of the \nMedicare Program. The Medicare hospital insurance fund started going \nbroke last year. That means more money is going out than is coming in \nfrom the payroll tax. The Medicare trustees--you remember, they report \nyearly and they look ahead 75 years--the Medicare trustees have been \nwarning all of us for years that this trust fund is in terrible trouble \nand, by a certain date, 2017, we bust it. But rather than work to \nbridge Medicare's $37 trillion in unfunded liabilities--and that $37 \ntrillion is that 75-year figure the trustees give us once a year, each \nspring, as they update it--so instead of working to bridge that $37 \ntrillion of unfunded liabilities, this bill does what? It cuts $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from the Medicare Program to fund yet another unsustainable \nhealth care entitlement program.\n  Medicare has a major problem with physician payments that could cost \nmore than $250 billion to fix, but this bill ignores the problem. \nInstead, the proposed legislation assumes the government would \nimplement the 23-percent Medicare cut scheduled to go against doctors \nin January 2011, as well as additional cuts that are scheduled for \nfuture years under that SGR.\n  By pretending the physician payment issue does not exist, this bill \nwould leave future Congresses virtually no way to restructure Medicare \nthat would fix this problem. Instead, this bill diverts Medicare \nresources elsewhere and ignores major problems such as that one.\n  Besides ignoring major problems, such as the physician payment issue, \nthis bill also ignores the predictions of experts that Medicare cuts, \nsuch as are in this bill, will jeopardize access to care of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  There are no fail-safes in this bill that would automatically kick in \nif these drastic cuts caused limited provider access or worsened \nquality of care. Instead, Congress would have to step in. Congress can \nalways step in, but will it step in. We know how impossible it is to \nundo this kind of damage. By making this board a permanent program and \nrequiring permanent productivity cuts, they become part of the baseline \nin the next decade. They go on cutting, cutting, cutting forever. If \nCongress ever wants to shut off those cuts, then this is the problem \nCongress faces: We have to come up with offsets to do it. The \nadministration can cut and cut and cut or add and add and add. They do \nnot have to do that. But the budget laws require us to have these \noffsets or to do the famously impossible thing to do--get a 60-vote \nmargin to overcome it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has projected that these Medicare \ncuts keep increasing by 10 to 15 percent each year over the next \ndecade. You heard me right. Medicare cuts keep growing 10 to 15 percent \neach year beyond the year 2019. Those are some pretty substantial cuts \nin a program that 43 million seniors and people with disabilities rely \non for their health coverage.\n  Provisions, such as the productivity adjustments and the Medicare \nindependent advisory board, would drive the increased cuts to the \nprogram. This gives us an idea of the damage these bills will do to \nhealth care. This is an example of the challenge Congress will face in \nthe next decade if this bill--this 2,074-page bill--becomes law.\n  The few years of extended life this bill would give to the Medicare \nhospital insurance trust fund is a pyrrhic victory because the drastic \nand permanent Medicare cuts in this bill will worsen health care \nquality and access.\n  This bill is the wrong way to address a big and unsustainable budget. \nYou\n\n[[Page S12035]]\n\nsimply cannot slash Medicare payments, spend those funds to start up \nanother new unsustainable government entitlement program, and then turn \na blind eye toward the effect on access and quality. That is why I will \nsupport the motion of the Senator from Arizona to commit this bill and \ndevelop a bill without these Medicare cuts. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  The reason I urge my colleagues to do the same is because we have an \nopportunity to step back just a little ways, go back to the drawing \nboard on bipartisanship and maybe come up with something that fits in \nwith the health care issues affecting the lives of 306 million \nAmericans and, secondly, restructuring one-sixth of our economy. That \nis something I have heard people on both sides of the aisle say ought \nto be done on more of a consensus basis than the partisan road this is \ngoing down. It was a road that, for the first 6 months of this year, \nlooked very doable, but it never turned out that way.\n  I get back to this bottom line: If you are having a coffee club \nmeeting in some restaurant Saturday morning in Delaware, Illinois or \nIowa, and they are talking about health care reform and I go in to \nexplain that what we are discussing right now on the floor of the \nSenate is going to raise taxes, it is going to raise premiums, it is \ngoing to not do anything about the inflation of health care costs, and \nwe are going to take almost $\\1/2\\ trillion out of the Medicare fund to \nfund a new entitlement program, I would say that unanimously people \nwould say: This is not health care reform. There has to be something \nelse. But we throw away the word ``reform'' when we are not \naccomplishing the kind of goals we set out to accomplish the first 6 \nmonths of this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is a saying in Iowa; that is, that \nany old mule can kick down a barn door, but it takes a carpenter to \nbuild one. I would modify that slightly and say any old elephant can \nkick down a barn door, but it takes a carpenter to build one.\n  We are debating health care reform. The American people are following \nus closely because it affects every single one of us in this room, \neveryone in the galleries, and everyone watching. This is one of the \nfew issues we will debate which you can bet is going to affect you and \nyour family personally. It is rare that an issue comes before us of \nthis gravity and an issue that reaches every single person in America. \nIt may be the biggest single issue we have ever tackled on the floor of \nthe Senate in terms of its scope and its impact on the future of every \nsingle one of us.\n  For more than a year, a lot of people have been working hard to come \nup with a piece of legislation that will have a positive impact on \nhealth care in America. It has involved lengthy committee hearings. The \nPresiding Officer is a member of the Senate Finance Committee. They sat \nin meetings hour after weary hour, day after weary day, considering \namendments before they produced a bill that is part of what we have \nbefore us today.\n  The Senator from Iowa is part of that same committee. I understand he \nmet personally over 60 times with Democratic Senators and a few from \nhis own side trying to see if we could come up with some kind of \nbipartisan approach. I commend him for his good-faith effort in doing \nthat.\n  There is another committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, that spent even more days in deliberation on a \nbill, considered over 100 different amendments, adopted over 100 \nRepublican amendments to the bill, and not one single Republican \nSenator would then vote for the bill--not one. One Senator, Senator \nSnowe of Maine, voted for the Senate Finance Committee bill. One \nRepublican Senator voted for that version of the bill.\n  What we have today--and I wish to slightly modify the remarks of my \nfriend from Iowa--is a 2,074-page bill with a 1-page add. This is \nSenator Reid's amendment to use it as a substitute. So it is 2,075 \npages, created by these two committees in the Senate and a similar \nendeavor taking place in the House.\n  For at least 10 days, this bill, in its entirety, has been available \nfor public review. I ask anyone interested who wants to read this bill, \nas every Member should, to go to the Senate Democratic Web site. If you \nGoogle ``Senate Democrats,'' you will find it and you will find this \nbill in its entirety, every single word of it, sitting out there to be \nread and reviewed, as it should be.\n  Then I invite you, for comparison's sake, to go to the Senate \nRepublican Web site to look at the bill produced by the Senate \nRepublican side. Take a look at the Senate Republican health care \nreform bill. Take a look at what they propose to change--the health \ncare system in America. Look at the Senate Republican proposals for \nmaking health insurance more affordable. Look at the Senate Republican \nproposals for dealing with health insurance companies which deny you \ncoverage because of preexisting conditions. Take a look at the Senate \nRepublican approach to pass health care reform and not add to the \ndeficit. I am afraid you will be disappointed because, as the Senator \nfrom Iowa knows, when you go to the Senate Republican Web site, there \nis no Senate Republican bill. In fact, what you will find on the Senate \nRepublican Web site is the Democratic bill.\n  For more than a year, while we have labored to produce this \nmonumental, historic legislation, our Republican colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have not broken a sweat to produce their own \nanswer to this challenge facing America. All they can do is come before \nus and criticize this bill. Any old mule can kick down a barn door, but \nit takes a carpenter to build one.\n  We have been working for over a year--almost a year--to build this \nhealth care reform package. Here is what we know. We just received a \nreport from the Congressional Budget Office, which is akin to the \nreferee up here. This is an agency that takes a look at what we do and \ntells us whether it is going to reduce the deficit, add to the deficit, \nreach its stated goal or fail to reach it. It is maddening sometimes to \nhave this separate agency kind of looking over your shoulder, but they \ndo. They reported just yesterday that this bill will make health \ninsurance more affordable for many Americans and will not add to the \ncosts for many others.\n\n  I wish it would do more. I wish it would bring down costs \ndramatically, even more. But for weeks and months we have heard from \nthe Republican side that our health care reform proposal would run \npremiums sky high. It turns out they were wrong. This bill we have \nproduced moves us toward more affordable health insurance. Every \nAmerican who pays any attention to the cost of health insurance knows \nthat is absolutely essential. In the last 10 years, health insurance \npremiums have gone up 131 percent in America. Ten years ago, a family \ncould have bought health insurance for about $6,000 a year. Now they \nbuy it on average for about $12,000 a year. In 7 or 8 years it will go \nup to $24,000 a year in premiums, projecting it will eat up 40 percent \nof your income for health insurance in just 8 or 10 years.\n  That is an impossible situation. We know it is. It is unsustainable. \nBusinesses can't offer health insurance that expensive. Individuals \ncan't buy health insurance that expensive. So if we do nothing we will \nreach a situation where the current health care system in America will \nstart to collapse. I do not want to stand idly by and let that happen; \nneither does President Obama. He has challenged us to address it and \naddress it honestly.\n  On the other side of the aisle, the Senate Republicans have not \nproduced a bill, a proposal, an alternative which will make health \ninsurance more affordable--nothing. They come before us in criticism of \nwhat we have done, and yet they cannot produce a bill.\n  I might also tell you the same Congressional Budget Office tells us \nthe bill we put together will actually reduce the Federal deficit over \nthe next 10 years by at least $130 billion. This bill, this 2,075-page \nbill, will cut more deficit than any piece of legislation we have ever \nenacted in Congress.\n  The Senator from Iowa is concerned about our national debt. So am I. \nWhere is the Senate Republican proposal for health care reform that is \ngoing to reduce America's deficit? Incidentally, the same Congressional \nBudget Office says in the second 10 years--\n\n[[Page S12036]]\n\nthink that far in advance--this approach will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by another $650 billion.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa, with all his concern about the Federal \ndeficit, where is the Senate Republican bill that will reduce the \nFederal deficit by $750 billion over 20 years?\n  The answer, I am sorry to tell you, is it does not exist. They either \nhave not or cannot write a bill. They are legislators, but frankly they \nhave come here to be critical of what we have done and will not offer a \nsubstitute or an alternative.\n  There is something else this bill does. It is a travesty in America \ntoday that almost 50 million people do not have health insurance. A lot \nof these folks are children. A lot of them are people in low-wage jobs \nwith no benefits. A lot of them are the newly unemployed. These are 50 \nmillion of our neighbors in America who go to sleep at night without \nthe peace of mind of having health insurance protection.\n  In my life it happened once: newly married, college student, baby on \nthe way, no health insurance, and our baby had a problem. I ended up \ncarrying, for 8 years, medical bills that I slowly paid off year after \nyear. That goes back many years ago, as you might imagine, but it was \ntroubling and heartbreaking to be the father of a child and not have \nhealth insurance; to sit at Children's Memorial Hospital in Washington, \nin the room that was set aside for people without health insurance, and \nwait until my number was called to bring my wife and my baby in for a \ncheckup. I didn't have health insurance. I never felt more helpless in \nmy life.\n  Fifty million Americans go to bed each night with that feeling. They \ndon't have health insurance. What does this bill, this 2,075-page bill, \ndo about it? It extends the coverage of health insurance, the peace of \nmind and protection of health insurance to 94 percent of Americans. It \nis the largest extension of health insurance in our history.\n  Where is the Republican alternative that offers coverage for 94 \npercent of Americans? It doesn't exist. They have not written that \nbill. They don't know how to write that bill. They do know how to come \nand criticize this bill, but they cannot produce a bill which covers 94 \npercent of Americans and provides tax credits and tax assistance to \nhelp those Americans pay their premiums.\n  If you are making under poverty wages, let's say you are making less \nthan $14,000 a year--and I have friends of mine in my State who are--\nyou are covered by Medicaid. You don't pay premiums. The Federal \nGovernment compensates the States and pays the premiums. All the way up \nto about $80,000 for a family of four, we provide credits and help to \npay the premiums, as we should, because premiums can break the bank not \nonly for businesses but for families.\n  There is also something we do in this bill I never hear from the \nother side of the aisle--and I will tell you why in just a second. We \ngive consumers across America a fighting chance when the health \ninsurance company goes to war with you. Do you know what I am talking \nabout? If somebody in your family gets sick, you know it is going to \nrequire a hospitalization or surgery and you know the cost is going to \ngo sky high, and you say: Thank goodness, I have health insurance. You \nmake the claim and the health insurance company comes back and says: We \ndispute the claim. We are not paying. People say: Wait a minute, I have \nbeen paying health insurance premiums for years just for this day, and \nyou are telling me I don't have coverage?\n  It happens thousands and thousands of times each day. Do you know \nwhy? Health insurance companies are profitable when they say no. What \nare the reasons for saying no? ``You failed to disclose a preexisting \ncondition when you applied for the insurance.'' It turns out they go to \nridiculous extremes to find an excuse not to provide coverage.\n  We also know what happens when you lose a job. You can't take your \ninsurance with you, by and large. We know when your child reaches the \nage of 24 they are no longer carried on your family health insurance. \nThose are the realities of health insurance companies saying no. I have \nyet to hear the first Republican Senator come to the floor and say that \nis outrageous and it has to change. We have to tackle the health \ninsurance industry because the health insurance industry opposes this \nbill.\n  The health insurance industry believes their profitability and their \nfuture depend on saying no. This bill starts saying to these companies: \nYou can't say no based on a preexisting condition, based on lifetime \nlimit, based on losing a job. And we cover kids through the age of 26. \nWe extend the family coverage to children of that age, and you know \nthat is only sensible because a lot of kids are going to college and \ngetting out without jobs. You want them covered by your family health \ninsurance plan. This bill does it.\n  Republicans have yet to produce one bill, just one, on health care \nreform to take on the health insurance industry. Instead, what they \nhave come to do, and the pending amendment by the Senator from Arizona \nleads with this, is to protect the health insurance companies. The \nfirst thing the motion to commit does, from the Senator from Arizona, \nis to instruct the committee, the Senate Finance Committee, to protect \na program called Medicare Advantage.\n  This is a great idea for health insurance companies and not a great \nidea for most seniors or taxpayers in America. Allow me to explain. The \nhealth insurance companies came to us several years ago and said \nMedicare is a bureaucratic mess. The government cannot run these \nprograms. We are in the private sector. We understand competition. Let \nus compete with Medicare.\n  They were given the right to do that. Private health insurance \ncompanies were given the right to write health insurance that provides \nMedicare benefits. They said they could do it more cheaply and, in \nfact, some of them did. But at the end of the day, after years of \nwatching them, it turned out these Medicare Advantage policies cost 14 \npercent more--not less, 14 percent more--than government-administered \nMedicare Programs. In other words, we were subsidizing health insurance \ncompanies, paying them more for the same Medicare coverage people \nalready had received.\n\n  They loved it. Thousands and thousands of Americans are now covered \nby Medicare Advantage with these great subsidies coming from the \nFederal Government. Talk about an earmark, Senator, 14 percent--what an \nearmark that is, a subsidy given to the private health insurance \ncompanies.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? Since the Senator \nmentioned my name, will he yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What the basic problem with the amendment of the Senator \nform Arizona is--and I will yield in just a moment--what the basic \nproblem with his amendment is, he is protecting these health insurance \ncompanies with Medicare Advantage. First thing he does. He is \nprotecting this subsidy, this big fat earmark we put in legislation, 14 \npercent bump in premiums is protected by this motion to commit.\n  It is understandable the health insurance companies want to keep \nthis. It is a sweet deal. They are getting paid for something they \npromised us would never happen. Also, there is a provision in the \nmotion to commit of the Senator that says we should take out the \nconflict-of-interest sections in Medicare. Do you know what that is? \nThat is when your doctor also owns the laboratory which does your blood \ntest and the imaging center which does the x rays and says: I am not \nsure what is wrong with you, but I know there are two things you need: \nYou need a blood test and you need an x ray.\n  Maybe you do; maybe you don't. We say in this bill you have to \ndisclose to your patient that you have a personal financial interest in \nthis laboratory and this processing operation, and you have to give \nthem an alternative to shop for another place if they want. Is that \nunreasonable? It is one of the provisions the Senator from Arizona \nwants to take out. It is a savings in Medicare.\n  That is unfortunate. We have to do our best to eliminate the waste \nand fraud and abuse, as terrible as that old cliche is, in Medicare. \nWhy is it that the same medical procedure offered in Rochester, MN, to \na Medicare recipient costs twice as much or more in Miami, FL? Do you \nthink maybe we ought to take a look at that? I think we should. I think \nmaybe there is some price gouging. I want to know.\n\n[[Page S12037]]\n\n  Does that mean we are going to reduce the benefits for someone living \nin Miami? Not necessarily. But it means the taxpayers will not be \nripped off. Medicare would not go broke. We are doing what we need to \ndo to be responsible. So taking money out of Medicare means shutting \noff the subsidy to the private health insurance companies for Medicare \nAdvantage. It means stopping the self-dealing of some doctors who are \nsending Medicare patients to their own labs and their own processing \ncompanies. It means finding out where the waste is taking place.\n  The Senator from Arizona says we instruct the Finance Committee to \ntake out those provisions in the bill. Keep Medicare Advantage there, \nwith the 14 percent subsidy for private health insurance companies, \ndon't engage these doctors when it comes to these conflicts of \ninterest. I don't think that is right.\n  It was not long ago that my friend from Arizona was a candidate for \nanother office. During the course of his campaign for President, he \nsuggested we have a pretty substantial cut in Medicare and Medicaid. In \nfact, during the campaign the Senator from Arizona called for $1.3 \ntrillion in reforms in Medicare and Medicaid, more than twice as much \nas we are calling for in Medicare, 2\\1/2\\ times as much.\n  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who worked for the Senator from Arizona, said \nthe campaign planned to fund tax credits in their health care proposals \nwith savings from Medicare and Medicaid. So the idea of saving money in \nMedicare is certainly not something with which the Senator is \nunfamiliar. We all understand there are possibilities for savings that \ndon't jeopardize basic services for seniors. We also understand that \nleft untouched, Medicare is going broke. Ignoring the problem will make \nit worse. If we want to put Medicare on sound footing we have to tackle \nthis issue foursquare. We cannot afford these subsidies for private \nhealth care companies for Medicare Advantage, and we cannot afford the \nwaste that is going on in the system today.\n  I might also tell you the increase in payroll taxes for those \nindividuals making over $200,000 a year and families over $250,000 a \nyear--that is the increase in the Medicare tax--is going to be buying 5 \nyears of solvency for Medicare. So when they talk about our raising \ntaxes--true, at the highest income levels--what they don't tell you is \nthe other side of the coin. The money brought in goes straight to the \nMedicare trust fund to keep it solid.\n  What else does this bill do? It starts filling the doughnut hole. You \nmay not know what that means until you happen to be a senior or have \none in your family, but Medicare prescription drug coverage stops \npaying at a certain point. This bill starts coverage in the doughnut \nhole, in the gap in coverage that currently exists in Medicare \nprescription Part D.\n  Where is the Republican bill to fill the doughnut hole? It doesn't \nexist--at least I have not seen it. It is not on their Web site. Here \nis ours. That is why AARP has endorsed this bill. The American \nAssociation of Retired Persons knows this bill is a good bill for \nseniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain motion to commit.\n  If we take this bill off the floor, which many Republicans want us to \ndo, it will take us days, maybe a week, to bring it back to the floor. \nThey want to delay this as long as possible. They want us to fail. They \nwant us to stop. They want us to adopt the Senate Republican approach \nto health care reform which is do nothing, leave the system the way it \nis. We cannot continue the system the way it is. This is a responsible \nbill. It makes health insurance affordable. It reduces the deficit, \naccording to the CBO, and covers 94 percent of Americans. It finally \ntackles the health insurance companies for the first time in a long \ntime, and it buys at least 5 years more for the Medicare Program. I \nwish I could compare it to the Senate Republican approach, but that \ndoesn't exist. Any mule can kick down a barn door. It takes a carpenter \nto build one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I regret that the Senator from Illinois did not observe \nthe courtesies of the Senate, particularly when a person's name is \nmentioned, as he continued to mention my name throughout and totally \nfalsifying my position both in the Presidential campaign and the \nposition that we have on this side and this amendment. I have always \nextended that courtesy to the Senator from Illinois. I deeply regret \nthat even this comity of the Senate is no longer observed.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, I regret you would not respond to \na question I had posed, when you had said: I will respond in a minute. \nAgain, even comity is not observed here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will go ahead with the--the Senator did not provide me \nwith the courtesy of allowing me to respond to a question. Now you want \nme to respond to a question from you? I will display more courtesy than \nyou displayed to me. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I apologize. I planned on yielding to you. I would be \nhappy to yield to you. I always do, and I failed to. I apologize.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I guess my questions were, one, did the Senator, \nwho claimed that no Republican has done anything to curb the health \ncare insurance industry, was the Senator in the Senate when Senator \nKennedy and I fought for weeks and months for the Patients' Bill of \nRights? Was the Senator here then? Was he engaged in that debate? \nSenator Kennedy and I fought for the Patients' Bill of Rights, and the \nmajority on that side of the aisle opposed it. The fact is, there have \nbeen efforts on my part to curb the abuses of the health insurance \nindustry by sponsorship of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Second, during the campaign, yes, I said that we could reduce and \neliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in spending, and I said it because of \nSenator Coburn's Patients' Choice Act which would save $1 trillion in \nthe States in Medicaid savings, $400 billion over the next 10 years in \nMedicare savings. I wish the Senator from Illinois would examine the \nPatients' Choice Act, as proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma. Maybe \nhe would learn something. The Coburn bill wants to preserve the best \nquality health care in America and not eliminate $12 billion in the \nMedicare Advantage Program, which 330,000 of my citizens who are \nenrollees like and want to keep, not eliminate $150 billion to \nproviders, including hospitals, hospice, and nursing homes, $23 billion \nin unspecified decreases to be determined by an independent Medicare \nadvisory board, as well as billions of additional cuts to the Medicare \nProgram.\n  There is no relation between what I tried to do in my campaign and \nwhat is being done in this legislation, I tell my friend from Illinois. \nI would be glad to hear the Senator's response. I would be glad to \nextend him that courtesy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I commend him for his \nwork on the Patients' Bill of Rights which I joined him in with Senator \nKennedy and would do it again. The point I was making----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Your statement was that no Republican had done anything. \nYou just said no Republican had done anything to curb the health \ninsurance industry. The Patients' Bill of Rights certainly would have \ndone it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My point was that there are provisions in this bill \ndealing with the rights of consumers against health insurance companies \nwhich I have not heard the Senator or others----\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is not what you said.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask you, do you support the health insurance reforms in \nthis bill that give patients rights against health insurance companies; \npreexisting conditions, for example?\n  Mr. McCAIN. My record is very clear of advocating for patients and \nagainst the abuses of insurance companies across the board.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma to describe the Patients' Choice Act and the way we could \ntruly save money and reduce fraud, abuse, and waste in the system and \nat the same time preserve quality health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. There needs to be some clarification. Medicare doesn't \ncover everything. Eighty-four percent of all\n\n[[Page S12038]]\n\nMedicare patients have to buy a supplemental policy now. Do you know \nwhat Medicare Advantage is about? Who set the prices on Medicare \nAdvantage? The government set the prices on Medicare Advantage. The \nvery same people you want to run it now created a 14-percent premium. \nThe insurance industry didn't set the prices. The Center for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services set the prices. The government is responsible for \nthat differential.\n  Why is Medicare Advantage important? Because the vast majority of the \npeople in my State and every State who have Medicare Advantage can't \nafford to buy a supplemental policy to make them whole on Medicare, \nbecause Medicare won't cover it. So Medicare Advantage for 89,000 \nOklahomans is the only way they get equality with the rest of their \npeer group who can afford to buy a supplemental policy.\n  Now we are going to take that ability away from poor seniors in \nOklahoma, Arizona, Iowa, and Illinois, and we are going to say: You \ndon't get what everybody else has because you are economically \ndisadvantaged. So we are going to give you substandard care, and we are \ngoing to take more of your income. Medicare Advantage offers the things \nyou get with a supplemental policy when you can't afford to buy a \nsupplemental policy. The very idea of saying we are going to take that \naway, when you are taking that away from the cheapest program we have \nin terms of performance, because what Medicare Advantage does, which \ntheir bill and this bill purports to do, is recommends and encourages \nand incentivizes prevention as the Senator from Iowa wants to do for \neverybody. It incentivizes it. It doesn't cost to have a prevention \nexam under Medicare Advantage. There is no out-of-pocket cost for our \nseniors who are poor who happen to have the benefit of Medicare \nAdvantage. You are going to take that away. You are going to destroy it \nfor 11 million seniors, the ability to get a preclearance, a screening \nexam, without them having to spend money on it.\n  Is there a way to get money out of Medicare? Yes, there is $100 \nbillion worth of fraud a year in it. According to Harvard, there is \n$150 billion worth of fraud a year in Medicare. There is $2 billion \nworth of fraud.\n\n  I want to address something else the Senator----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before the Senator continues, I ask unanimous consent to \nregain the floor and then yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have to address the situation since I \nhave been accused by the majority leader of changing my position. The \nSenate considered the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 which called for \napproximately $10 billion in reduction in Medicare costs, approximately \n$10 billion. Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Republican budget is an immoral \n     document. Let's look at what is in the bill before us. The \n     budget increases burdens on America's seniors by increasing \n     Medicare premiums, and we have not seen what the House is \n     going to give us. It cuts health care, both Medicare and \n     Medicaid, by a total of $27 billion.\n\n  The majority leader was outraged in 2005 that there should be \nreductions in Medicare and Medicaid spending of $27 billion. Now the \ndistinguished majority leader, with the white smoke coming out of his \noffice, says he is for $483 billion in cuts in Medicare. That is a \nremarkable flip-flop.\n  By the way, I might add, Senator Dodd, who is here on the floor, \nsaid, concerning the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005:\n\n       For example, this bill cuts funding for Medicare and \n     Medicaid which provide health care to poor children, working \n     men and women, the disabled, and the elderly.\n\n  What a plea. What a plea.\n  Senator Barbara Boxer said:\n\n       Mr. President, I strongly oppose the reconciliation bill \n     before the Senate. The bill would cut vital programs for the \n     middle class, elderly, and poor. That is why I cannot believe \n     only 2 months after Katrina we have a bill that would cut \n     Medicare and Medicaid by $27 billion.\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Now before us we have cuts of $483 billion, including hospice, \nhospitals, other vital programs for our seniors. If we are going to go \naround and talk about flip-flops, let's look at the rhetoric that \naccompanied my colleagues on the other side in their opposition to $27 \nbillion in savings which, by the way, actually only saved $2 to $3 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma, does he believe it is possible to make \nthese cuts, including from the Medicare Advantage Program, and \nestablish a Medicare commission that would not, over time, cut benefits \nthat exist today for Medicare and Medicaid patients?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would answer my colleague by saying this \nbill is a government-centered approach, not a patient-centered \napproach. It is the very reason we are in the trouble we are in today. \nWe have had the government making decisions rather than the patients \nand the physicians. It will, in fact, lessen the care for seniors.\n  I gave a speech earlier this morning on the floor that if you are a \nsenior, you should be worried. Because the Medicare Advisory Commission \nand the cost comparative effectiveness commission will now decide \nultimately what you get. We have an amendment on the floor, which in \nmany ways I support but I would like to modify, about reinstituting \nwhat should be the standard for mammography for women. How did we get \nthere? We have a commission that looks at cost and not patients. From a \ncost standpoint, the task force on screening is absolutely right. But \nfrom the patient's standpoint, it is absolutely wrong. How do we decide \nthe difference? Do we make the difference based on what something costs \nor do we make it on what my wife, who will soon be a Medicare patient, \nreceives? The question is, will the cuts that are manifested by this \nbill impact seniors' care? As somebody who has practiced medicine for \n25 years and cared for seniors for longer than that, I will tell you \nundoubtedly they will have delay, denied care, and 80 percent of them \nwill be fine. But 20 percent of the seniors in this country will be \nmarkedly hurt by this bill because a bureaucracy looking at numbers, \nnot patients, never putting their hand on the patient, will make a \ndecision about what is good for them and what is not.\n  Everything we know about medicine is that is exactly the wrong way to \npractice it. Every patient is different. Every patient's family history \nis different. When we talk about taking $120 billion out of the \nMedicare Advantage Program, what we are talking about is decreasing \naccess to some of the most important screening capabilities that many \nof these people have and making them unaffordable because they cannot \nafford a supplemental Medicare policy. They cannot accomplish it.\n\n  I want to address one other question. The majority whip said the \nRepublicans have not had a bill. During the markup in the HELP \nCommittee, I went through point by point the Patients' Choice Act. The \nPatients' Choice Act puts patients and doctors in charge, not the \ngovernment in charge. The Patients' Choice Act neutralizes the tax \neffect to make everybody treated the same in this country, as far as \nthe IRS is concerned.\n  Right now, if you get insurance through your insurance company, you \nget $2,700 worth of tax benefits. If you do not, you get $100. That is \nreally fair. That is one of the reasons why people who do not get \ninsurance through their employer cannot afford health insurance. It is \nbecause we do not give them the same tax benefit. It would give a tax \ncut to 95 percent of Americans, plus help them buy their care.\n  The Patients' Choice Act solves the liability problem by \nincentivizing States to have reforms in terms of the tort problem we \nhave, where we know the cost is at least 6 to 7 percent more that we \nhave spent on health care than we would if we had a realistic tort \nsystem.\n  Finally, we go after insurance companies because we do what is called \nrisk readjustment. If you are dumping patients or cherry-picking--guess \nwhat--you have to pay extra; you have to pay to the very insurance \ncompanies that are covering those sick people. So we change the \nincentive to where an insurance company is incentivized to care for \nsomebody rather than to dump them.\n  I was an advocate, when I was in the House, for the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\nI was defeated at every turn, trying to make this. To say we did not \ncome with a bill, on a party-line vote in the HELP Committee 13 voted \nagainst a commonsense bill that did not increase taxes, did not \nincrease premiums, covered more people than this bill will cover by 4 \nmillion, putting everybody in Medicaid on a private insurance policy so \nno longer are they discriminated against by the doctors who will not \ntake Medicaid, taking the Medicaid stamp off their forehead and giving \nthem the same access to health care we have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So does my colleague find it entertaining that my friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in 2005--as part of the \nDeficit Reduction Act, we had to bring in the Vice President, who I \nthink was overseas, in order to break the tie because they were worried \nabout what Senator Reid called an ``immoral document,'' referring to \nthe Republican budget?\n  By the way, is the Senator aware that Citizens Against Government \nWaste has come out in favor of this amendment?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: You will soon vote on Senator John McCain's \n     (R-Ariz.) motion to commit H.R. 3590 to the Senate Committee \n     on Finance with instructions to remove the drastic cuts made \n     to Medicare. On behalf of the more than one million members \n     and supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support this motion.\n       H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     would slash Medicare by $500 billion. Depriving seniors of \n     their much-needed benefits is not a responsible way to \n     achieve healthcare reform.\n       As it currently stands, the legislation calls for \n     significant reductions including $120 billion to the highly \n     successful Medicare Advantage program; $150 billion to \n     providers including hospitals, hospice programs, and nursing \n     homes; and $23 billion in unspecified decreases to be \n     determined by an ``Independent Medicare Advisory Board.''\n       While CCAGW has been a long-time critic of improper \n     payments and Medicare waste and fraud, the $500 billion in \n     cuts in H.R. 3590 would not solve these inherent problems or \n     help make Medicare solvent. The major reductions proposed to \n     Medicare merely help lawmakers offset the costs of a massive \n     new entitlement program to the detriment of the nation's \n     senior citizens.\n       I urge you to support Senator McCain's motion to commit. \n     All votes on this motion and other amendments pertaining to \n     Medicare cuts will be among those considered in CCAGW's 2009 \n     Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, I say to the Senator, as you know, many of the \nseniors in my State--I would ask my colleague--have been very puzzled \nat the AARP's endorsement of a proposal that would cut their Medicare, \nwhere it has already been made clear that Medicare Advantage--and there \nare 330,000 seniors citizens in my State who are under Medicare \nAdvantage--that it has been announced it will be slashed, and that \nsomehow AARP is now supporting it.\n  All I can say is, is my friend aware there is an organization called \n60 Plus that is working very hard on behalf of seniors to make sure \nthey do not lose these benefits?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am. I would tell the Senator, again--how are we where \nwe are? How are we where we are, when we are going to take a program \nthat is working--granted, I think Medicare Advantage could be decreased \nthrough true competitive bidding. But CMS did not do that. We could \nbring the costs down and still have the same benefits. But this bill \ncuts the benefits in half, the extra benefits that Medicare patients \nhave by being signed up on Medicare Advantage that everybody has who \ncan afford a supplemental policy.\n  I want to address one other thing, if the Senator would allow me. The \nmajority whip said: Don't we want to get rid of conflicts of interest? \nYes. But his argument was specious because the price is set for an X-\nray or a mammogram or a CT or a blood test. They are set by Medicare \nnow. There is no differential in the price other than what Medicare \nsays the differential will be. There is no arbitrariness. The \ngovernment sets the price for every Medicare test out there by region. \nSo there is no way to game it, as the Senator from Illinois said it was \ngamed. The best reason to have a lab in a doctor's office is so you do \nnot have to wait and come back for another visit to the doctor who \ncharges Medicare another $60 because you get the answer right then. We \nwant to eliminate that. So what will we do? There is no cost savings in \nthat. There is a cost increase because now, instead of giving an answer \nto the patient, the patient is going to wait as they send it off to the \nlab, and have them come back in.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I ask the Senator another question? How does the \nSenator envision that we can eliminate fraud and abuse and waste and \ninstitute significant savings? One of the ways is to retain the \nprovisions in this amendment, this motion to commit, that uses the \nsavings from fraud, abuse, and waste elimination to make the trust fund \nstronger, but at the same time preserves the benefits that our senior \ncitizens have earned. How many times have you heard from senior \ncitizens in your State saying: I paid into this trust fund. I paid for \nmy Medicare all my life. Now it is going to be cut. How is that fair? \nHow is that fair to my generation, the greatest generation?\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, if you take $100 billion a year--and that is not an \nexaggeration; even HHS, this last week, said their improper payments \nwere $92 billion; the Inspector General and the GAO both say it is \nhigher than that; that is on Medicare alone--if we just captured $70 \nbillion of that.\n  How do you do that? Do you know how Medicare pays down? They pay and \nthen chase. So you submit an invoice. They do not know if it is \naccurate. They pay it, and then they go try to get the money back \nafterwards.\n  How about precertification of a payment, as everybody else does that \nhas anything to do with the volume that Medicare has? The other way you \ndo it is with undercover patients, where you put people actively \ndefrauding Medicare in jail. Less than $2 billion in this whole bill \ngoes after fraud. That is 2 percent of the fraud per year. We could \ncover everybody in the country or extend the life of Medicare 20 years \nby eliminating the fraud that is in Medicare today. What are we going \nto do? We are not. We are going to create more government programs and \nmore agencies that are going to be designed to be defrauded. So, \ntherefore, the fraud is going to go up, not down. The fraud is going to \ngo up, not down.\n  We are also going to limit the availability of prevention to seniors. \nI have read the prevention text in the bill. There are parts of it I \nabsolutely agree with. We know if we manage prevention and we manage \nchronic diseases, we are going to save a lot of money. But we are not \ngoing to save any of it by building jungle gyms and sidewalks. What we \nhave to do is incentivize people, both physicians and patients, to get \nin the preventive mode. We need accountable care organizations.\n  There are lots of things we can do. There are lots of things we can \nagree on. I know the Senator from Iowa and I agree on a lot on the \nprevention, but we ought to be saving that money, and we ought to \neliminate the fraud. If we did nothing in this body except eliminate \nthe fraud in Medicare, think what we would have done, think what we \nwould have done for the kids who follow us.\n  Mr. President, $447 billion spent on Medicare; $100 billion in fraud. \nWheelchairs that have been billed out so many times they have collected \n$5 million on them, doctors who submit false invoices, suppliers who \nsubmit invoices for people who are deceased. And we try to go get that \nafter the fact? There are lots of things we could do. This bill is \nshort on that. You all recognize it is short on it. It is the biggest \nsavings out there. The reason there is not more in it is because CBO \nwill not score it because we have never demonstrated that capability.\n  One final point. This bill only scores the way CBO scores because it \nsays you intend to do what no Congress has ever done. It says you \nintend to cut Medicare $460 billion to $480 billion. If you intend to \ncut Medicare, the American people ought to know where you are going to \ndo it, how it is going to affect them. But if you are just doing it for \na\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\nscoring point, the young people in this country ought to know that too. \nBecause where you say you are claiming $460 billion, you are adding to \nthe deficit if, in fact, we do not cut Medicare that much. And is it \nfair to the Medicare Advantage patients, who are poor--who do not \nqualify for dual coverage with Medicaid, who cannot afford a \nsupplemental policy--is it fair to take away the benefits they have \ntoday that we have given them--and it was not priced by the insurance \nindustry; it was priced by CMS--and say because CMS, the government \nagency, did not price it, we are going to take away half of your \nbenefits? It is not fair. It is not right. If there is anything \nimmoral, that is immoral.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa is to be recognized \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, Mr. President, sitting here listening to the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Oklahoma go on, I hardly know \nwhere to start. There have been so many accusations and so much \nmisinformation it is hard to know where to begin.\n  I would begin by, first of all, saying the people who keep saying we \nare slashing Medicare and we are going to harm seniors are totally \nwrong. The fact is, the bill we have before us protects Medicare's \nguaranteed benefits, reduces premiums and copays for seniors, ensures \nthat seniors can keep their own doctors, and ensures Medicare will not \ngo broke in 8 years by stopping the waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I might also say, as an aside, every time I hear the Senator from \nOklahoma talking about waste and abuse and fraud in Medicare, it sounds \nlike it is all in Medicare. The waste, fraud, and abuse we are talking \nabout are the ripoffs of Medicare by pharmaceutical companies, many of \nwhich have been fined big fines and have settled. One of the most \nrecent ones, I think, was almost for a billion-some dollars. It was one \nof the largest settlements in our history with a pharmaceutical company \nthat was caught ripping off Medicare. And insurance companies have \nripped off Medicare, and others. It is not within Medicare; it is those \nwho are coming at Medicare and trying to plunder it.\n  But that is what we do in this bill: We are stopping that kind of \nwaste and abuse against Medicare; not in Medicare but against Medicare. \nWe provide new preventive and wellness benefits for seniors. We lower \nprescription drug costs, keep seniors in their own homes, and not \nnursing homes, with the CLASS Act and the Community Choice Act that is \nalso in this bill.\n  When they talk about going after Medicare, boy, talk about crocodile \ntears. Was it not Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House, the \nleader of the Republican revolution, who said he wanted Medicare to \n``wither on the vine''? Was it not Senator Bob Dole, their standard \nbearer for President in the 1990s, who said he had fought against \nMedicare and was proud he voted against it? Now, all of sudden, it \nseems as though Republicans are the guardians of Medicare.\n  People know the truth. The American people know the truth. They know \nit is the Democrats who fought for Medicare. Lyndon Johnson, as \nPresident, and the Democrats in the House and Senate, if it were not \nfor them, Medicare would have never been passed. It is the Democrats \nwho have fought to keep Medicare alive and well and healthy, and \nexpanding it to people all over this country every step of the way--\nbeing opposed by our friends on the other side of the aisle. And now to \nhear them talk about how much we are going after Medicare, boy, talk \nabout crocodile tears.\n  The other thing I want to say is that I want to correct something the \nSenator from Oklahoma said. He talked about the recommendations that \nrecently came out--I will have more to say about this in a minute--on \nmammograms. He said the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force--all they \ndid was look at costs. That is what the Senator said. They looked at \ncosts but they did not look at the people.\n  Recommendations that come from the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce cannot take into account cost. Cost cannot be a factor. They can \nonly look at scientific evidence, safety, and efficacy. Cost cannot be \ntaken in as any factor in their deliberations. So I wanted to set the \nrecord correct on that.\n  As I said, there were so many things I heard from the other side it \nis hard to know where to start. I see my leader here, Senator Dodd, who \ndid such a great job in getting our bill to the committee and getting \nit in the form that it is now and on the floor.\n\n  I wish to ask the Senator--I know the Senator was here listening to \nour friend, the Senator from Arizona, speak. Did it strike you that \nwhat he said was kind of missing the mark here a little bit and maybe \nnot quite what we are doing in this bill?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. Just to set the record straight, \nbecause it is amazing to me, in a very short amount of time, how people \ncan misconstrue events. First of all, the Senator from Oklahoma was \ntalking about the Medicare Advantage bill, and he said: Do you know who \nsets the rates? The government sets the rates.\n  That is true. That is because when that bill was passed, with very \nfew people on this side supporting that bill--almost overwhelmingly on \nthe other side--the requirement under the law, the requirement to pass, \nmandated under the law that the private plans of Medicare be overpaid, \nand on average those overpayments averaged 14 percent and in some \nStates over 50 percent. The law that was passed here by the majority--\nand running the place at the time--insisted upon the mandates being \nincluded. So if you wonder why that occurs today, it is because they \nrequired it in the law.\n  Secondly, when you talk about the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005--\nagain, memories fade for some people. In fact, under that bill, \nchildren, working families lost the insurance they had. Cuts occurred. \nWomen lost access to mammographies. Cervical cancer screenings were \ncut. Families lost benefits. There were direct cuts in them. The \ndifference is, today, with what we are talking about, you don't cut \nthese benefits at all--at all. In fact, we are increasing the \nopportunity for Medicare to be strengthened under this bill. There is a \nvast difference between what happened in 2005 and what is being \nsupported today. So, again, I just want the record to be clear. You \ncan't make these things up as you go along. That is what happened in \n2005. It was an abomination and did great damage to people in this \ncountry. People lost their insurance.\n  Under our bill, 31 million Americans will have coverage. We now know \nthe premiums are going to drop for 93 percent of all Americans. \nPremiums will actually come down for individuals, small businesses, and \nlarge employers. For five out of six people who have their jobs, those \npremiums come down. Thirty-one million Americans will be covered with \nhealth insurance. Compare that, if you will, with 2005 when we actually \ncut mammography screening, cervical cancer research, and assistance in \nhealth care for infants and children and women. That all got damaged in \nthat year. Not in this bill. This is the difference.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the only thing I would say to my friend \nfrom Connecticut--he said that in 2005 we had made all of these cuts in \nthe Deficit Reduction Act. I just want to say for the record that I \ndidn't vote for it and neither did the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is this not when the Republicans were in charge and they \nhad a Republican President and a Republican House and Senate? That is \nwhen they cut all the mammogram screenings and things such as that?\n  Mr. DODD. That is true. The record is very clear on this. People had \nthe right to do so; that was their choice at the time. But to try to \nrewrite history somehow and say those cuts didn't occur--in fact, they \ndid occur in these areas. That is why there were those of us here who \nobjected strongly at the time. My colleague from Arizona is absolutely \ncorrect when he said that I said this was going to cut benefits for \nchildren and working families and cut screenings and tests for people. \nIt did do that. Those of us who made those warnings on that day were \nproven to be 100 percent accurate. Compare that, if\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\nyou will, with what we are talking about here today, particularly \nregarding reducing costs, premiums, and providing increased access for \nmillions of Americans. That is the difference.\n  If you vote for the McCain amendment, we are right back where we were \nbefore--right back--which, of course, we all know means premium \nincreases go up by literally 100 percent in the next 7 years. Tell that \nto a family of four in my State who is paying $12,000 right now and \nwill go to $24,000 in 7 years, as opposed to having those premiums \nbeing reduced, depending on if you are an individual, small business, \nor large employer, by as much as 20 percent, 11 percent, or 3 percent, \nnot to mention, of course, that you will also increase the number of \npeople who will be covered under this.\n  The present situation runs the risk of bringing our economy to its \nknees if we don't act. Recommitting this bill--going back, in a sense--\nwould roll the clock back and do great damage to both individuals and \nto our country economically. That vote in 2005 set us back terribly in \nthis country. This proposal allows us to move forward and provide the \ncoverage a lot of people need.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend for pointing out those facts.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter dated December 1, 2009, from the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator:\n       On behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \n     I am writing to express our opposition to the amendment \n     offered by Senator McCain which would recommit the bill to \n     the Senate Finance Committee.\n       Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform \n     is intended to frighten our Nation's seniors by persuading \n     them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so \n     that they too will oppose this legislation. The fact is that \n     H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--\n\n  The bill we have before us--\n\n       does not cut Medicare benefits; rather, it includes \n     provisions to ensure that seniors receive high quality care \n     and the best value for our Medicare dollars. This legislation \n     makes important improvements to Medicare which are intended \n     to manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to \n     eliminate wasteful spending.\n\n  I won't read all of it, but it concludes:\n\n       The committee urges you to oppose the motion to recommit \n     the bill to the Finance Committee.\n       Sincerely, Barbara B. Kennelly, President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the millions of members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I am writing to express our opposition \n     to the amendment offered by Senator McCain which would \n     recommit H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act, to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions \n     to remove important Medicare provisions.\n       Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform \n     is intended to frighten our nation's seniors by persuading \n     them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so \n     that they too will oppose this legislation. The fact is that \n     H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     does not cut Medicare benefits; rather it includes provisions \n     to ensure that seniors receive high-quality care and the best \n     value for our Medicare dollars. This legislation makes \n     important improvements to Medicare which are intended to \n     manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to \n     eliminate wasteful spending.\n       The National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicare \n     benefits. Protecting the Medicare program, along with Social \n     Security, has been our key mission since our founding 25 \n     years ago and remains our top priority today. In fact, these \n     programs are critical lifelines to today's retirees, and we \n     believe they will be even more important to future \n     generations. But we also know that the cost of paying for \n     seniors' health care keeps rising, even with Medicare paying \n     a large portion of the bill. That is why we at the National \n     Committee support savings in the Medicare program that will \n     help lower costs. Wringing out fraud, waste and inefficiency \n     in Medicare is critical for both the federal government and \n     for every Medicare beneficiary.\n       The Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth in \n     Medicare spending by two to three percent, or not quite $500 \n     billion, over the next 10 years. However, it is important to \n     remember that the program will continue growing during this \n     time. Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of money--\n     and providers will be receiving increased reimbursements--on \n     a per capita basis every one of those years, for a total of \n     almost $9 trillion over the entire decade. Even with the \n     savings in the Senate bill, we will still be spending more \n     money per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decades, \n     though not quite as much as we would be spending if the bill \n     fails to pass.\n       America's seniors have a major stake in the health care \n     reform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care are \n     especially challenging for those on fixed incomes. Not a \n     single penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come out \n     of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare \n     program. The Medicare savings included in H.R. 3590, the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, will positively \n     impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate \n     of increase in out-of-pocket costs and improving benefits; \n     and it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by \n     five years. To us, this is a win-win for seniors and the \n     Medicare program.\n       The National Committee with urges you to oppose the motion \n     to recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with \n     instructions to strike important Medicare provisions from \n     health care reform legislation.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the amendment before \nus which has been offered by the Senator from Maryland, my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski. I am going to have more to say about the bill and \nengage with, perhaps, the Senators from Arizona and Oklahoma in the \ndays and weeks ahead on the structure of the bill itself, but I wish to \nfocus on the amendment that is now before us.\n  First of all, I am proud that this bill, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, makes significant investments in prevention and \nwellness because I have long believed that such investments are \nessential for transforming our sick care system--that is what we have \nnow, a sick care system--into a true health care system, one that keeps \nAmericans healthy in the first place. It keeps them out of the \nhospital. It will keep a check on rising costs in both the public and \nprivate health care markets.\n  It does this in a number of ways. I won't go into all of them, but \namong the most important is that this bill requires insurance companies \nto cover highly effective preventive services with no copayments or \ndeductibles--no copayments or deductibles. This is critical because we \nknow that all too often people forgo their yearly checkups or \nscreenings either because their insurance company doesn't cover them \nor, secondly, because they have high copays or deductibles that make \nthem simply unaffordable. For example, I had a recent conversation with \na small business owner in western Iowa, and he and his few employees \nhave a $5,000 deductible. He recently turned 50. His doctor said: Time \nfor you to get your first colonoscopy. Well, he found out that the \ncolonoscopy was $3,000. He has a $5,000 deductible. This is all out-of-\npocket. So not being a man of wealth and not having a lot of means, \ntrying to struggle to keep his small business afloat, he is putting it \noff. He is putting it off. So that is what is happening now. But what \nwe say in our bill is that these have to be covered without copays or \ndeductibles.\n  There has been a lot of discussion recently on the coverage of \npreventive services for women in light of the recent recommendations \nissued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on mammogram \nscreenings. It has been alleged that the Reid bill, like the HELP and \nFinance bills that preceded it, only requires coverage of those \nservices strongly recommended by the Preventive Services Task Force. \nThis simply is not true. Under the language of this bill, health plans \nare required at a minimum--at a minimum--to provide coverage without \ncost for preventive services recommended by the Preventive Services \nTask Force. Understand that. It only says that health plans are \nrequired at a minimum to provide coverage at no cost for certain \npreventive services recommended by the Preventive Services Task Force. \nBut these are\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\nsimply the minimum level, not the maximum. The task force will \nestablish the floor of covered preventive services, not the ceiling. No \nhealth plan will be prohibited from providing free coverage of a \nbroader range of preventive services, and in many cases the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services may well require that. That is because our \nbill gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \nidentify additional preventive services that will be part of the \nessential health benefits offered by health insurers in the exchange.\n  The simple fact is, the Preventive Services Task Force cannot set \nFederal policy and they cannot deny coverage, period, although there \nhas been a lot of misinformation that has gone out about this. They \nsimply give doctors and patients the best medical information, as I \nsaid earlier, not based on cost--cost cannot be a factor--but based on \nscience and based upon efficacy and based upon outcomes and nothing \nelse.\n  Still, I share the concerns of some that the task force has not spent \nenough time studying preventive services that are unique to women. This \nis a concern that was raised when the HELP Committee debated the bill \nin committee. At that time, I worked with the Senator from Maryland, \nMs. Mikulski, to include language requiring that all health plans cover \ncomprehensive women's preventive care and screenings based upon \nguidelines supported by what we call HRSA, the Health Resources and \nServices Administration, again, with no copays, no deductions. That \nlanguage is in our bill. It was not included in the merged bill. \nSenator Mikulski's amendment which is now before us and which I have \ncosponsored would add that language--would add that language--like we \nhad in our committee bill, and I strongly urge its adoption.\n  By voting for this amendment, which I understand we will do in a \ncouple of hours, we can ensure all women will have access to the same \nbaseline set of comprehensive preventive benefits that Members of \nCongress and those in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program \ncurrently enjoy. Let me repeat that. If you vote for the Mikulski \namendment, you will ensure that all women will have access to the same \nbaseline set of preventive services that are enjoyed by Members of \nCongress, women Members of Congress, and all women Federal employees in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That is what voting for the \nMikulski amendment will do.\n  Expanding preventive health care is just one of the ways this bill \nbenefits women. Again, our health care system is broken. It is \nexpensive. Today, less than half of women have access to employer-\nsponsored insurance coverage. Think about that. Less than half of the \nwomen in this country have access to employer-based insurance coverage. \nAgain, many of these women work for very small businesses, and they \ncan't afford to provide that kind of insurance coverage.\n  In most States, it is legal for insurance companies to charge women \nmore than men for the same policy. Women can pay more than double what \nmen pay at the same age for the same coverage. Each year, thousands of \nwomen are denied coverage from health insurance companies for \npreexisting conditions. In many States, a history of hospitalizations \nfrom domestic violence is considered a preexisting condition. Think \nabout that. A battered woman lives through domestic violence and now \ncan't get health insurance coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition--being battered. That happens in many States. With these \noptions, it is not surprising that more than 16 million women are \nuninsured in this country.\n  Women are often the health care decisionmakers for their families. \nThey face difficult choices daily. One-third of women are forced to \nmake tradeoffs between basic necessities and health care. In 2009, more \nthan one-half of women reported delaying care because of its high cost.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to fix these problems. This historic \nlegislation now before us increases access to affordable health \ninsurance and ensures that women's coverage meets their health care \nneeds.\n  We will end premium discrimination against women. We will end \ndiscrimination against those with preexisting conditions. We will \nprohibit the rescission of health insurance coverage because of an \nillness. We will provide more affordable insurance choices through the \nhealth insurance exchange, including a strong public option to increase \ncompetition and choice. We will ensure that the policies families buy \nare good enough. We will require that all insurance policies sold in \nall markets provide adequate coverage for primary and preventive care, \nfor screenings, maternity services, and many other services that women \nand their families need to stay healthy.\n  As has been said many times before, this bill will extend coverage to \nan additional 31 million Americans who are currently uninsured. As I \nsaid, 16 million women in America are uninsured. So that is why Senator \nMikulski's amendment is so important, vitally important. That is why \nthis bill is so vitally important.\n  We are going to talk a lot about Medicare. I see the Republicans are \nfocusing on that, although a recent letter I read and had inserted in \nthe Record from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare says we ought to oppose the McCain amendment. We will hear a \nlot about that.\n  What about the women of this country and what is happening to them? \nThe Mikulski amendment addresses that in a very profound way. But then \nthis bill takes it even a step further by making sure that women, many \nof whom work for small businesses, who are sort of in an uncovered \npool, so to speak, out there by themselves, now they can go on the \nexchange. Now they can get the kind of coverage they need. They will \nhave choices available to them--not just maybe one option and in some \nStates no option. They will have different options available. They will \nbe able to join with other like women around so they will have a bigger \npool and better coverage for themselves and their families.\n  Yes, I can honestly say the health care reform bill before us, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is a pro-woman bill. It is \nnot talked about a lot, but many of the things in this bill will go to \nease the dilemma so many women find themselves in, in this country--\nproviding basic necessities for their children or trying to get health \ncare coverage for themselves. I can tell you so many women whom I have \nmet and talked to have given up on buying health insurance for \nthemselves so they will have enough money to feed and clothe their kids \nand send them to school. Women should not be forced to make that kind \nof a choice.\n  This bill before us will enable women to not have to make that \nchoice. They will be able to get the insurance coverage they need at an \naffordable price, with the tax credits that are included for low-income \nwomen, and they will be able to have the piece of mind of knowing that \nthey and their kids are truly covered with the health insurance they \nneed.\n  I will keep coming back to these two things, time after time, as we \ngo through the bill: prevention and wellness. Keeping people healthy in \nthe first place is a big part of this bill. If there is one thing that \nwill bend the cost curve, it is putting more focus upfront on \nprevention and more focus on keeping people healthy in the first place. \nThat will save us money in the future.\n  The second theme is what this is going to do for the women of \nAmerica; how is it going to help them and their families to have peace \nof mind and to have the health insurance coverage they need.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next four \nRepublican speakers to be recognized be Senators Johanns, Roberts, \nHutchison, and Cornyn and for the Democrats to speak in an alternating \nfashion, with the next Democrats being Senators Murray and Cantwell to \nspeak on the tragic shootings in Washington, and that following Senator \nRoberts, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the McCain \namendment. I have been down here for a while, and I have listened to \nthe debate on the Medicare cuts.\n  What strikes me about this debate is that reality sets in. It simply \ndoes. There will be a point at which hospitals, hospice programs, and \nskilled nursing facilities are going to see less money. That is simply \nthe reality of what we are debating.\n  It is kind of remarkable to me that you could go from a period just a \nfew years ago, where $10 billion over 5 years was described as immoral, \nand today we are talking about nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts. That is \ngoing to have a real impact on real programs that involve real people \nin our States.\n  From our standpoint, we try to look at this in a way that says: OK, \nif this were to happen, if, in fact, this gets the necessary votes, \nwhat impact will it have on real programs in Nebraska?\n  Let me walk down through that, if I might. For example, more than $40 \nbillion in cuts from home health on the national level would translate \nback to the State I represent to the tune of $120 million in cuts. By \n2016, according to our analysis back home, 68 percent of Nebraska home \nhealth agencies will be operating in the red.\n  In rural areas, as high as 80 percent will have negative margins. If \nyou lose those services in rural areas, they are lost. In fact, they \nmay be lost forever.\n  Skilled nursing facilities are already struggling to keep their doors \nopen. I visit these facilities when I get back home. Many of us do \nthat. They are already doing everything they can to make ends meet. We \nare already seeing them go under in community after community. I visit \nthese facilities and they tell me: Mike, we are just holding on.\n  Hospice programs in Nebraska have been very well received. Years ago, \nI might have predicted otherwise. The reality is, hospice has worked \nwell in my State, and I am guessing it is also in other States in the \ncountry. A survey reported that 100 percent think access to hospice \nservices is important. This bill cuts $80 billion nationally from \nhospice programs.\n  How can we legitimately expect little or no impact, or simply attempt \nto argue it away, when 38 Nebraska hospice programs are already \noperating right at the margin? If there is any reduction, they will go \nout of business.\n  Hospitals will also see negative impacts. Let me quote, if I might, \nfrom a Nebraska Hospital Association letter:\n\n       Our 85 community hospitals have a unique stake in this \n     debate. Not only are we providers of care to more than 10,000 \n     patients per day, we are also one of the largest consumers of \n     health care because we employ 42,000 people. . . . Hospitals \n     are an economic mainstay of the community they serve and we \n     (the NHA) are opposed to all measures that weaken our \n     financial stability and viability.\n\n  The Nebraska Hospital Association indicates that disproportionate \nshare hospital cuts will be $128 million. If other hospital cuts are \nfactored in, Nebraska hospitals say they will see a total loss of $910 \nmillion.\n  I visit these little 25-bed hospitals. They have no room for error. \nThere is no margin there. When they lose something such as this, they \nsimply cease to exist. That community, then, is on its way to ceasing \nto exist.\n  Finally, it is very clear that Medicare Advantage is on the chopping \nblock. That is 35,000 Nebraskans. No matter how hard you want to argue \nthat, there are 35,000 Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in my State who \nwill experience cuts in the very program that is such an important \nsafety net to them.\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, estimates reduced benefits from \n$135 to $42 a month. The so-called extra payments that would be cut are \nhelping Medicare Advantage beneficiaries get very valuable benefits. \nMany who utilize Medicare Advantage are truly our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  We cannot ignore that important fact. Seniors with a Medicare \nAdvantage plan might receive vision or dental benefits or have their \nMedicare copayments reduced. In our State--I am guessing this is true \nof States all across the country--what you see is some of the poorest \nactually have Medicare Advantage.\n  If you don't believe me, just yesterday I received a letter from some \nHispanic groups which said this:\n\n       With the growing number of Hispanic seniors, one in four of \n     whom have Medicare Advantage, the defunding of the Medicare \n     Advantage program and other Medicare cuts proposed would \n     result in fewer benefits and a significant disruption in the \n     care and coverage senior Hispanic Americans receive.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 16, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: As organizations that represent Hispanic \n     Americans, we are deeply concerned with the health care \n     reforms currently being discussed. We do not support reforms \n     that will lead to increases in taxes for all Americans but \n     especially for small business owners, cuts in Medicare, and \n     mandates on families and businesses.\n       Hispanic small businesses are among the fastest-growing \n     sectors in the U.S.--growing at a rate of over three times \n     faster than the national average. We have been hit hard by \n     this slow economy and cannot afford a greater tax burden and \n     mandates on our families and small businesses. The result \n     will be more Hispanics out of work and reduced wages that \n     directly impact low-income and minority communities.\n       With the growing number of Hispanic seniors, one in four of \n     whom have Medicare Advantage, the de-funding of the Medicare \n     Advantage program and other Medicare cuts proposed would \n     result in fewer benefits and a significant disruption in the \n     care and coverage senior Hispanic Americans receive.\n       Many of our families came to the United States to escape \n     hardship, pursue business opportunities and enjoy its \n     economic freedoms. We deserve the right to make our own \n     health care choices and not be subjected to costly and \n     inefficient government mandates.\n       More than 30 percent of Hispanics are currently uninsured, \n     and we want real reform that would help them. These reforms \n     must promote real competition and choice. We want to ensure \n     that Hispanic families have affordable health care, more \n     choices and that their direct relationships with their \n     doctors remain intact and uninhibited by bureaucrats.\n       Competition-increasing solutions include allowing \n     businesses and individuals to purchase health insurance \n     across state lines, which would make it easier and less \n     costly for small businesses to provide employees with \n     coverage. Allowing groups to join together to purchase \n     insurance--whether they be small business or church or \n     community groups--would also have a significant impact on the \n     affordability of insurance for Hispanics and increase \n     choices.\n       Government-focused proposals where bureaucrats and not \n     individual business owners will decide what coverage an \n     employer should provide will not help our families or \n     businesses. Also, individuals will be penalized with fines \n     and higher taxes if they do not follow the rules in \n     Washington.\n       We hope that you will consider these concerns and what is \n     in the best interest of Hispanic Americans, and all \n     Americans, as you vote on health care reform.\n           Sincerely,\n         Hialeah Chamber of Commerce & Industries, Hispanic \n           Alliance for Prosperity Institute, Hispanic Leadership \n           Fund, Hispanic Professional Women Association, \n           CAMACOL--Latin Chamber of Commerce of U.S.A.\n         Patients' First (Pacientes Primero), The Latino \n           Coalition, U.S. Mexico Chamber of Commerce, Virginia \n           Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Voces Action.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. How could any Member go back to their State and defend \nthese cuts to services that provide very important health care needs? \nAmericans simply deserve better than that. If we want serious Medicare \nreform, we should start with true waste and fraud and concentrate on \nMedicare insolvency--especially when we all agree insolvency arrives in \n2017.\n  What we are doing in these days of debate is truly robbing from Peter \nto pay Paul--and Peter is soon to be broke. Unfortunately, that is \nexactly what we are doing. Americans deserve better than the bill we \nare debating. I can't stand silently and accept a bill that has such \ndramatic cuts in the services provided to Nebraska seniors.\n  I will conclude by saying I support the McCain motion to commit to \nremedy these problems and get us back on track with commonsense reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                     Lakewood, WA, Police Shootings\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are obviously in the middle of a very \nimportant debate on health care. I thank the managers of this bill for \nallowing my colleague from Washington, Senator Cantwell, and me to \ninterrupt this important debate to talk for a few minutes about a very \ntragic event that\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\noccurred in Washington over this past weekend.\n  Just 2 days ago, our State was shocked and saddened and appalled by \nnews of the deadliest attack on law enforcement in Washington State's \nhistory. On Sunday morning, just after 8 a.m., a gunman walked into a \ncoffee shop in Pierce County, WA, and opened fire, killing four members \nof the city of Lakewood Police Department who were going over the \ndetails of their upcoming shift.\n  It was a senseless and brutal killing. It specifically targeted the \npeople who sacrifice each and every day to keep all of us safe--our \npolice officers.\n  This terrible crime has not only left the families of these victims \nshattered, but it has shattered our sense of safety and left an entire \ncommunity and State in disbelief.\n  It is also part of a shockingly violent month for my State's law \nenforcement community that has also included a senseless attack on \nOctober 31, which killed Seattle police officer Timothy Brenton and \nleft another officer, Britt Sweeney, injured.\n  These attacks remind all of us of the incredible risks our law \nenforcement officers take each day and that even when doing the most \nroutine tasks and aspects of their jobs, our law enforcement officers \nput themselves on the line for our safety.\n  Today my thoughts and prayers, like those all across Washington State \nand our Nation, remain with the families of the brave police officers \nwho were killed on Sunday.\n  Officer Tina Griswold was a 14-year veteran who served in the police \ndepartments in Shelton and Lacey before she joined the Lakewood Police \nForce in 2004. She leaves behind a husband and two children.\n  Officer Ronald Owens followed his father into law enforcement. He was \na 12-year veteran of law enforcement and served on the Washington State \nPatrol before moving to the Lakewood Police Department. He leaves \nbehind a daughter.\n  SGT Mark Renninger was a veteran who wore the uniform of the United \nStates before putting on the uniform of the Tukwila Police Department \nin 1996. He joined the Lakewood Police Department in 2004. He leaves \nbehind a wife and three children.\n  Officer Greg Richards was an 8-year veteran who served in the Kent \nPolice Department before he joined the Lakewood Police Department. He \nleaves behind a wife and three children.\n  Because of this senseless attack, nine children have lost their \nparents. These were officers--mother and fathers, husbands and wife--\nwho woke up every day, put on their uniforms, and went out to protect \nour children, our communities, and our safety. On Sunday, they did not \ncome home.\n  Already in news reports, Internet postings, and candlelight vigils \nthousands of tributes to these officers' dedication to their families \nand jobs have been shared. They paint a picture of brave officers who \nnot only kept our communities safe but were also respected and revered \nmembers of our communities; a mother and fathers who in the wake of \nthis tragedy will leave young families behind; neighbors and friends \nwho coached softball and helped repair local homes and reached out to \nhelp those in need. They are police veterans who helped build the \nfoundation of a new police force. They are public servants who put the \nsafety of all of us behind their own every single day.\n  Already this year 111 police officers across our country have given \ntheir lives while serving to protect us. Each of those tragedies sheds \nlight on just how big a sacrifice our police officers make in the line \nof duty. But these most recent attacks in my home State also offer an \nimportant reminder: that our officers are always in the line of duty, \neven when they are training other officers or out on routine patrols or \nsimply having coffee.\n  There is no doubt these senseless attacks have left many law \nenforcement officers across my State and our country feeling targeted. \nBut there is also no doubt that their willingness to put themselves on \nthe line to protect us will continue unshaken. In fact, over the last 3 \ndays, law enforcement officers from all across my State have risked \ntheir own lives in the successful search to find the man accused of \nthis killing and to keep him from hurting more innocent people. That is \na testament to the unwavering commitment they make to serve and protect \neach of us every day. It should remind all of us that these brave men \nand women deserve all the support we can provide to keep them safe.\n  No words are adequate to express the shock, the anger, and the \ndisbelief that comes with such a brutal crime. No words will be enough \nto lessen the loss. Our law enforcement professionals put themselves \nbetween us and danger every day.\n  Right now, in light of such horrible events, we hold them even closer \nin our thoughts and our prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Washington State, Senator \nCantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Murray, in expressing my sorrow over the tragedy that struck \nWashington State and the law enforcement community. I extend the \nprayers and condolences of the Senate and the entire Nation to the \nfamilies, loved ones, and colleagues of the four police officers who \nlost their lives in the line of duty Sunday in Lakewood, WA.\n  Those four officers, part of Washington's best, are SGT Mark \nRenninger, Officer Ronald Owens, Officer Tina Griswold, and Officer \nGreg Richards.\n  Collectively, they served for 47 years in the line of duty. As \nLakewood Police Chief Bret Farrar describes them, they were \n``outstanding individuals'' who brought a range of talents to a 5-year-\nold department.\n  These heroes, who put their lives at risk for our safety every day, \nwill be deeply missed and never forgotten. The men and women in blue \nwho keep our communities safe make tremendous sacrifices daily, and so \ndo their families.\n  The senseless tragedy that claimed the lives of these four officers, \nas my colleague said, the deadliest attack in Washington State history, \nreminds us of the risk that police officers take every day when they \nput on their badges.\n  The risks that police take every day was driven home again today when \na Seattle police officer on routine patrol confronted, shot, and killed \nthe person believed responsible for this crime. And at a time when we \nare all in shock over the loss of these officers, the police remain \nvigilant. They did not stop doing their job, even when tragedy struck \nclose to home.\n  I thank all those who participated in the law enforcement's response \nsince this tragedy happened. I thank the Pierce County Sheriff's Office \nand Sheriff Paul Pastor for the investigation they have led. My heart \ngoes out to the Lakewood Police Department and Chief Bret Farrar.\n  I also thank the efforts of the Seattle Police Department and the \ninterim Chief John Diaz for his efforts and his agency's work.\n  In a matter of days, police and public safety officers from all \naround the country will converge on Puget Sound. They will form a long \nblue line in a show of respect for those who have fallen--Mark \nRenninger, Ronald Owens, Tina Griswold, and Greg Richards.\n  This moving ritual, which happens all too often in our country, \nspeaks eloquently of the solidarity all of us feel with those who risk \ntheir lives to keep us safe. This tragedy also struck our State earlier \nin October when Officer Timothy Brenton was struck down randomly while \nsitting in his police car.\n  I hope everyone in this country will take time today and tomorrow and \nnext week, if they see a police officer, to thank them. Thank them for \ntheir service. Express your appreciation for the job they do putting \nthemselves at risk for all of us. We did not have enough time to thank \nMark, Ronald, Tina, and Greg, but we are thanking them in our thoughts \nand prayers, and we are sending strength to their families with much \nlove and appreciation for what those officers and their families have \ndone to serve us and their communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sorry. I think Mr. Roberts is to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana and my chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S12045]]\n\n  Let me say first to the Senators from Washington State that I think \nall Senators appreciate both Senators bringing to the attention of the \nSenate the heartfelt feelings in regard to the tragedy that happened in \ntheir State. I share their dismay with regard to what has happened. I \nknow the thoughts and prayers of all Senators are with them. I \nappreciate the remarks they have brought to the body at this time.\n  I would now like to discuss briefly the motion to commit in regard to \nMedicare and the tremendous cuts that are proposed in the bill--a bill \nI define not as the Finance Committee bill, not as the HELP Committee \nbill, but the bill that was done behind closed doors, which I think was \nmost unfortunate.\n  This bill slashes--and I think that is the appropriate word--nearly \n$\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare. Then it is used to establish a huge new \ngovernment entitlement program.\n  Earlier this year during the Finance Committee markup of the health \ncare reform legislation, I offered a nearly identical amendment to the \nMcCain motion to commit we are now considering, which is a motion \nsimply to send the legislation back to the Finance Committee with \ninstructions to strike the cuts to Medicare in this bill. \nUnfortunately, my amendment during that time failed in committee on a \nparty-line vote.\n  Let me see if I understand this correctly. Medicare is going broke. \nIt has around $38 trillion in projected future unfunded liabilities. It \nis a huge, crushing entitlement program that threatens to bankrupt this \ncountry. But instead of owning up to this enormous threat and doing \nsomething about it for our financial future, instead of considering a \nMedicare reform bill to address this menace to future generations of \nAmericans, instead of guaranteeing that the government-run plan we \ncurrently have remains solvent, instead we are actually cutting some \n$465 billion from Medicare in order to start a brandnew, huge, crushing \nentitlement program that makes no sense.\n  If Medicare needs to be reformed--and I certainly believe it does--\nthen we should be considering a Medicare reform bill right now. We \ncertainly should not be cutting Medicare for the purpose of financing a \nhuge new entitlement program.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have the temerity--that is \na pretty strong word, but I think it applies--to assert these huge cuts \nwill actually make Medicare more solvent. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I have news for them. Cutting reimbursements to doctors, \ncutting reimbursements to hospitals and other providers--all \nproviders--and it has been mentioned by my distinguished colleague from \nNebraska--home health care providers, hospices is not reform. These \ncuts will hurt Medicare beneficiaries, our seniors who have worked \ntheir entire lives with the promise that this program would support \nthem through their older age.\n  Medicare already pays doctors and hospitals well below cost--70 \npercent approximately for hospitals, 80 percent for doctors \napproximately. The only saving grace is that these providers have the \nability to shift their losses on to private payers to keep their doors \nopen or their practices going. But there is a limit to their ability to \ncost shift. There is only so much the private sector is willing to \nabsorb.\n  American families already pay--now get this--an extra $90 billion in \na hidden tax to make up the Medicare and Medicaid underpayments that we \nin past years have provided each year. More cuts to reimbursements \ncoupled with the massive increase to Medicaid this bill assumes will \npush these limits, meaning that fewer doctors will open their doors to \nnew Medicare patients. They are doing that right now. We are rationing \nright now as to access to doctors who accept Medicare patients, and \nhealth care access and quality for our seniors will be compromised.\n  Take the $105.5 billion cut to hospitals as an example. I know the \nNational Hospital Organization has signed off on these cuts. I don't \nknow why, but they have signed off on these cuts. I also know for a \nfact they will harm Kansas hospitals. I asked my Kansas Hospital \nAssociation--I did, at my request--to run the numbers on how this bill \nwill affect their bottom lines. Their findings are frightening.\n  According to the Kansas Hospital Association's outside experts, this \nbill will result in nearly $1.5 billion in losses to Kansas hospitals \nover the next 10 years. It may be true that some urban hospitals that \ncurrently have large percentages of uninsured patients may have some of \ntheir cuts offset by the potential reduction this bill will make to the \nuninsured population. But that is no consolation to a hospital in \nMcPherson, KS, for example, that may be too large to qualify for the \nhigher reimbursements allotted for what we call critical access \nhospitals, and has, unfortunately, the misfortune of serving a smaller \nthan average uninsured base. Those hospitals will see huge cuts without \nseeing any of the gains. This bill's $100 billion cut will only hurt \nthese hospitals and their ability to serve Medicare and even non-\nMedicare patients. Remember the cost sharing.\n\n  Medicare's own actuaries at CMS, the Center for Medical Services--\nsort of an oxymoron--have agreed that the Democrats' cuts to hospitals \nand other providers could be dangerous and could cause them to end \ntheir participation in Medicare. So why are we doing this?\n  Another huge cut to Medicare in this bill is that $120 billion cut to \nthe Medicare Advantage Program. My distinguished colleague from \nNebraska has already talked about that, the effects of Medicare \nAdvantage to Nebraska. Let me talk about Kansas. Close to 11 million, \nor one-quarter, of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage; 40,000 of those beneficiaries are in Kansas. I want to read \nan excerpt from one letter I received from a very satisfied Medicare \nAdvantage customer in Shawnee, KS. Ms. Lila J. Collette is enrolled in \nHumana Gold Plus, a Medicare Advantage plan. She writes:\n\n       Please use everything in your power to let me and the many, \n     many other people in Kansas who have chosen Humana Gold Plus \n     to keep this wonderful plan.\n\n  Ms. Collette is not alone. Satisfaction rates among seniors enrolled \nin Medicare Advantage plans are very high. I know they are very \nunpopular to the other side and there are a lot of allegations made, \nbut these people made that decision on their own, so why are we \nessentially gutting this program that provides quality and choice to \nour seniors?\n  I could go on about the cuts to hospice, home health care providers, \nnursing homes, but I think you get the point. I disagree with the \nfailure to prioritize the solvency of Medicare over the establishment, \nagain, of new government programs. And I certainly will never agree to \nfinancing these government expansions by bleeding the Medicare Program \ndry.\n  That is why, as I have said, I offered amendments in the Finance \nCommittee markup that would have struck these Medicare cuts. Again, \nunfortunately, they were defeated on a party-line vote.\n  As the President is fond of saying, ``Let me be clear.'' This bill is \nfunded on the backs of our seniors and those who provide Medicare to \nour seniors. This bill slashes Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion. This bill \nthreatens access to care for seniors and health care for all Americans. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in opposing these cuts by voting for \nthe McCain motion to commit.\n  This is the key vote. Don't kid yourselves, this is the key vote. You \nare either for protecting Medicare or not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to once and for all lay to rest \nthis false claim that the pending bill is going to ``hurt seniors'' and \nis going to hurt providers; it is going to be this long parade of \nhorribles that the other side likes to mention. It is totally, patently \nuntrue, the claims they are making.\n  No. 1, all the crying allegations on the other side that the \nunderlying legislation cuts Medicare, it cuts Medicare, it cuts \nMedicare--that is what they say. What they do not say is it does not \ncut Medicare guaranteed benefits. It doesn't cut benefits. It does \nreduce the rate of growth that hospitals would otherwise receive. It \ndoes reduce the rate of growth that medical device manufacturers might \nreceive. All that is true. So it is true it is cutting the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare providers. It is not true that this legislation cuts \nMedicare benefits. That is not true. The other side would like you to \nbelieve that is true by using the words\n\n[[Page S12046]]\n\nthey choose. By saying ``cutting Medicare,'' they want you to think \nthat is cutting Medicare benefits.\n  But it is not cutting Medicare benefits. Rather, the underlying bill \nreduces the rate of growth of government spending on providers, on \nhospitals, home health, hospice--lots of other providers. That is what \nis going on here. Don't let anybody fool you. This bill does not cut \nMedicare benefits. It does not. But it does reduce the rate of growth \nof providers.\n  Why are we doing that? First of all, most of these providers, \nvirtually all the providers say--gee, we don't like our rate of growth, \nthe Federal dollars coming to us, cut, but they will go along with it. \nThey are OK with it. Why are they OK with it? Why is the American \nHospital Association OK with reducing the rate of growth of hospital \npayments by $155 billion? Why are they OK with that? They are OK with \nthat because they are going to make it up on volume. This legislation \nprovides coverage for many more Americans. They are going to have \nhealth insurance. Americans who do not have health insurance now often \nhave to go to the emergency room of the hospital, the hospital has to \nprovide the care, it is uncompensated care--nobody is paying for those \nhospital benefits--and that cost is transferred on to private health \ninsurance premium holders. They have to pick it up. On average, that is \nabout $1,000 per family per year.\n  No. 1, let me repeat, there are no cuts to Medicare benefits. There \nare reductions in the rate of growth to Medicare providers--which the \nproviders agree with, by and large. I won't say totally, I wouldn't \nstand here and say they are jumping up and down and they are \nenthusiastic about it, but I am saying they realize they are not \ngetting hurt. They are going to do OK. They are going to do OK because \nthey are going to make up in volume what they might otherwise lose. \nThat is a very important point for people to understand.\n  Second, if you listen to the other side, what they would have us do \nis virtually do nothing. What does doing nothing mean? Doing nothing \nmeans the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is just over the horizon. \nThis legislation extends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund \nanother 4 to 5 years. Man, if I am a senior--I am about to be a \nsenior--I would sure like the Medicare trust fund to be solvent. I \nwould like that very much. This legislation extends the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund by another 4 to 5 years, to about the year 2017. So \nwithout this legislation, the actuaries say the Medicare trust fund is \ngoing to become insolvent 5 years earlier, 2012, somewhere there. That \nis not many years from now; not many years at all. So it is very \nimportant we extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  You might ask why is the Medicare trust fund in a little bit of \njeopardy? Why is that? The very basic reason is because health care \ncosts are going up at such a rapid rate in America. Our health care \ncosts are going up by 50 or 60 percent more quickly than the next most \nexpensive country. We already are paying per capita 50 percent or 60 \npercent more than the next most expensive country. So there is a whole \nhost of things we are doing in this legislation to make sure we have \nsome limit over our health care costs.\n  I realize I misspoke earlier. Currently the Medicare trust fund is \ndue to be insolvent about the year 2017. This legislation extends the \nsolvency of the Medicare trust fund to the year 2022. The principle is \nthe same, just the 5 years is tacked on a little later period of time \nrather than upfront.\n  But we are doing a whole host of things in this legislation to reduce \nthe rate of growth of health care costs to people in this country. It \nis health care costs which are driving up the Medicare trust fund costs \nso we are doing all we can to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund.\n  People are saying the Medicare trust fund is getting insolvent \nbecause baby boomers are retiring, and that will increase the pressure \non it. But the Congressional Budget Office did a study 6 or 8 months \nago that said about 70 percent of the additional cost of the Medicare \ntrust fund is due to cost increases, it is not due to more baby boomers \nretiring when they reach the age of 65.\n\n  What do some of the groups say about this legislation? Let me say \nwhat AARP says. We have a chart here which indicates what the American \nAssociation of Retired People says about the underlying bill. If it was \ncutting Medicare as the other side says, you would think they would not \nlike this bill. You would think they would have problems with it.\n  AARP has not totally endorsed this bill, but they don't have problems \nwith it because they know we are doing the right thing. What do they \nsay? AARP says:\n\n       Opponents of health care reform won't rest. [They are] \n     using myths and misinformation to distort the truth and \n     wrongly suggesting that Medicare will be harmed. After a \n     lifetime of hard work, don't seniors deserve better?\n\n  That is what the AARP says, referring to the distortions, \nmisrepresentations, and untruths, trying to scare seniors, mentioned by \nopponents of this legislation.\n  Here is another AARP quote. This is this month:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     free preventive benefits, and--most notably for AARP \n     members--reducing the drug costs for seniors who fall into \n     the dreaded Medicare donut hole, a costly gap in prescription \n     drug coverage.\n\n  That is a very important point. This bill not only does not cut \nbenefits, it increases benefits for seniors. A big one is referred to \nright there and that is the so-called doughnut hole, the gap in \ncoverage under the prescription drug program. This legislation in \neffect says that seniors now who have $500 of their drug benefit, \nprescription drug benefits paid for when they are in that doughnut hole \nperiod, and add to that this bill also says it is all paid for, at \nleast for 1 year, in this doughnut hole. We have to worry about that in \nsubsequent years, but this bill improves the benefits that seniors will \nget, not take away benefits as the other side would imply.\n  It is true that private programs, such as Medicare Advantage, are \nreduced from what they otherwise would be, just as hospitals are \nreduced in payments from what they otherwise would get. I have a chart \nhere. Let me point out the next chart here, if I could, which shows \nthat the provider groups, hospitals, et cetera, are actually going to \ndo OK under this legislation. What does this chart show? This chart \nshows that Medicare spending will continue to grow under this \nlegislation. It will grow, and grow by a lot. Here, in 2010, it is $446 \nbillion and you see a steady growth through the 10 years of this bill.\n  I might say parenthetically, one of the previous speakers said rural \nhealth care is going to be hurt, rural hospitals are going to be hurt \nin this legislation. I do not think that is entirely true. I have a lot \nof hospitals in my home State of Montana, rural hospitals. They are not \nupset with this legislation. They say it is OK. They approve it.\n  In addition, there are no cuts to critical access hospitals. In rural \nAmerica most of those hospitals are critical access hospitals. So they \nare going to be OK.\n  Basically, if we did not pass this legislation, these provider \ngroups--hospitals, nursing homes, home health, hospice, Medicare \nAdvantage, even Part B Medicare improvement--would all increase by \nabout 6.5 percent over the decade. Under this legislation they all \nincrease by about 5 percent over this decade, with a 1.5 percent cut \nwhich they basically agree to.\n  I want to make that point clearly. We are not cutting Medicare. We \nare not cutting Medicare benefits, but we are reducing the rate of \ngrowth of Medicare spending.\n  Another point I want to make, if I may, is there is nothing new here. \nMany of the Senators who are advocating killing this bill made the \nopposite statement not too many years ago. What did they say? They \nsaid: You have to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending in \norder to save Medicare benefits. That is what they said a few years \nago, exactly what they said. Let me read:\n\n       We propose slower growth in Medicare. Medicare would \n     otherwise be bankrupt.\n\n  They are standing on this floor making the opposite statement today, \nthe exact opposite statement today, trying to scare people to kill the \nbill.\n  Here is another Senator. I will not embarrass them by giving their \nnames,\n\n[[Page S12047]]\n\nbut they are Senators who currently serve in this body.\n\n       We do heed the warning of the Medicare Board of Trustees \n     and limit growth to more sustainable levels to prevent \n     Medicare from going bankrupt in 2002. That is what is \n     necessary to ensure that seniors do not lose their benefits \n     altogether as a result of bankruptcy in 7 years.\n\n  One Senator said that. When? About 14 years ago. Exact same thing \nthat is going on today.\n  We know, experts know that if we are going to save Medicare benefits, \nwe have to stop overpaying some of the providers, hospitals and so \nforth. We are overpaying them.\n  Let me tell you one small example of how we are overpaying them. Did \nyou know that the updates--the fancy term for paying more for hospitals \nand so forth--did you know they don't take productivity into account \nwhen they make these update recommendations? The recommendations are \nbasically made by an organization called MedPAC. MedPAC is a \nnonpartisan organization composed of doctors and experts that advise \nCongress on what the payment updates--what the payment increases should \nbe for different groups over the years. We in Congress basically look \nat them. We try to decide what makes sense, what doesn't, and so forth. \nBut MedPAC has said that this is what we have to do. We have to slow \nthe rate of growth in some of these providers because they are getting \npaid too much. They are getting paid more than they need to be paid.\n  I repeat: We are still going to allow 5 percent growth for all the \nproviders over the next 10 years. None of them are really crying wolf, \nI might say. That is the main point I wanted to make.\n  I mentioned what AARP is saying. Let me mention the American Medical \nAssociation:\n\n       [We are] working to put the scare tactics to bed once and \n     for all and inform patients about the benefits of health \n     reform.\n\n  That is the American Medical Association. They are referring to the \nscare tactics of the other side. The AARP and the American Medical \nAssociation and others know that no senior will see a single reduction \nin their guaranteed Medicare benefits under this bill, not a single \none.\n  I might also say that this bill would reduce premiums seniors would \nhave otherwise paid. Much of those savings to seniors comes from \neliminating massive overpayments to private insurers; that is, private \ncompanies such as Medicare Advantage.\n  A small point here. When seniors hear the words ``Medicare \nAdvantage,'' they tend to think that is Medicare. It is not. It is a \nprivate company. Those are private companies. They were basically \nenhanced. Under the 2003 Medicare Part D legislation, they were given a \nlot more money to encourage them to have competition in rural areas. It \nturns out we gave them way too much additional money. They know it. \nThis legislation is trying to cut back on the excess they were provided \nback in the year 2003. The cut is about $118 billion over 10 years. I \ndon't have with me how much is remaining. But that 5 percent figure I \ngave you of growth, that includes Medicare Advantage.\n  I mentioned already that this legislation would reduce prescription \ndrug costs. That doesn't sound like a benefit cut to me; that sounds \nlike an additional benefit for seniors. We also provide for new \nprevention and wellness benefits in Medicare. That is an addition. That \nis not a cut. That is an addition. We are also helping seniors stay in \ntheir own homes, not nursing homes. That is a benefit.\n  It is important to point out here that the opponents of health care \nreform do not have a plan to protect seniors and strengthen the \nMedicare Program. They say don't do what they said a few years ago. \nThey say: Commit the bill, do nothing. They say: Go back and start from \nscratch again. That is basically what they say. If you listen to the \nmusic as well as the words, if you read between the lines, basically \nthey are saying: Kill it. Don't do it. That doesn't make sense.\n  That is what they are saying. I hate to say this because I tend to be \na pretty nonpartisan kind of a guy. But these are scare tactics. They \nare not truths. Sometimes you have to call a spade a spade, and that is \nexactly what is happening here.\n  I might say that MedPAC, the outfit that advises us, is nonpartisan. \nThey can't help us decide what to do here. They think Medicare \nAdvantage plans are overpaid by 14 percent. In addition, a typical \ncouple will pay $90 more per year in Part B premiums to pay for \nMedicare Advantage overpayments even if they are not enrolled in these \nplans. That is not right.\n  Medicare home health providers--I gave that list earlier. One small \npart of that is Medicare home health providers. They have an average \nmargin of 17 percent. That is a little high.\n  If we are trying to protect Medicare benefits, we have to make sure \nwe are not overpaying the Medicare providers. That is just common \nsense. It is the right thing to do. So many seniors just need help with \ntheir Medicare benefits.\n  Nursing homes are making profits of 15 percent off of Medicare. In my \njudgment, that, too, is unacceptable. We have to bring those down \nwithin reason.\n  We have an obligation. This is a government program. We have an \nobligation to taxpayers to make sure we are not overpaying hospitals \nand providers. We have to do right by them, make sure they are doing \nOK, but just not overpay. That is a tough line to draw sometimes. It is \na judgment call. But that is what we are doing here.\n  In addition, the Office of Inspector General has found rampant fraud \nand waste and abuse in the Medicare Program. There is a lot of fraud \nand waste in the Medicare Program. The last figure I saw was about $60 \nbillion in fraud in Medicare--providers, frankly, just ripping off \ntaxpayers and seniors. We have added additional provisions in here to \noutlaw that fraud--additional screening, additional certification, \nadditional ways to make sure that Medicare does a better job, that CMS \ndoes a better job in knowing which payments to providers are right and \nwhich are not right.\n  What is the real impact of the Medicare policies here? Let's be \nclear: The real impact of these policies, even with the Medicare \nchanges in the bill, overall provider payments will still go up. I \ndon't want to beat that horse too much, but I want to make it clear. We \nare not cutting benefits. We are reducing the rate of growth of \nspending for health care providers, hospitals, and nursing homes, but \nwe are reducing it in a moderate way. We are not reducing it by too \nmuch. As this chart shows, those providers still get at least a 5-\npercent net increase in payments over the years, and the groups \nthemselves have not really complained about them. Take the \npharmaceutical companies, hospitals, nursing homes, home health, \nhospice--they are not crying crocodile tears because they know they are \ngoing to do better under health care reform.\n  Remember that famous meeting down at the White House not too long \nago. The industry came in and talked to the President. Remember what \nthey pledged, all these providers, how much they can cut reimbursements \nto them? This is including the insurance companies, hospitals, and \neverybody. They said they would cut $2 trillion over 10 years--$2 \ntrillion. This legislation doesn't come close to cutting $2 trillion. I \nthink the figure is about $400 billion. That is not $2 trillion, that \nis $400 billion. So we are not hurting them that much. We are not \nhurting them, frankly. They are doing OK.\n  I have quotes from hospital associations. This is from Sister Carol \nKeehan, president of the Catholic Health Association:\n\n       Clearly, the Catholic Health Association thinks the \n     possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicare . . . \n     to be very, very unfounded.\n\n  I have heard the claim over here that this legislation is going to \ncause providers to pull out of Medicare. That is totally untrue. I have \nso many quotes here from people in the hospital industry who believe \nthis is OK. They are not going to pull out.\n  Chip Khan, president of the Federation of American Hospitals:\n\n       Hospitals will always stand by senior citizens.\n\n  I also know some providers are going to do very well under this \nreform legislation. Wall Street analysts have suggested that many \nproviders, including hospitals, will be ``net winners,'' according to \nthe basic feeling among Wall Street analysts. Under our bill, they \nestimate hospital profitability\n\n[[Page S12048]]\n\nwill increase with reform because more and more hospital patients will \nhave private health insurance.\n  Nobody is going to pull out. They are not going to cut Medicare \nbenefits. It is true that there is a reduction in some of the private \nplan nonguaranteed benefits companies would give to seniors at the \nexpense of private patients. That is true.\n  MedPAC has said it should be cut. MedPAC has said it should be cut \nmore. We are giving these plans a break by not cutting them by what \nMedPAC says they should be cut.\n  Again, the reductions in this bill--for the providers, not \nbeneficiaries--are far less than the health care industry itself said \nit could save over the next decade. A reminder: They pledged to save $2 \ntrillion over 10 years. Under this legislation, they are going to be \nhit for $400 billion.\n  I mentioned before that the other side has often said this is exactly \nwhat we to have do, although today they say: No, no, no. I am not quite \nsure what the difference is between a few years ago when they said this \nis what we should do. Perhaps they can explain that.\n  I might mention, too--and this is very important, although we tend to \nlose sight of it--under this legislation, we provide delivery system \nreform.\n  There is a lot of waste in our health care system--estimates are 15, \n20, 30 percent waste in the American system. Why is there so much \nwaste, which means seniors are not given the benefits they should \nreceive, which means private patients generally aren't getting the \nbenefits they should receive because of all the waste? The waste is \nbasically because of the way we pay for health care. We pay on the \nbasis of quantity. We pay on the basis of volume. We do not pay on the \nbasis of quality. To state it differently, a hospital tries to do the \nright thing, doctors try to do the right thing. They are paid on the \nbasis of how many procedures they provide, basically, not outcomes, not \nquality. That is the basic root that has caused a lot of the waste in \nthe current American system.\n  Health care is provided for differently in different parts of the \ncountry. The fancy term is ``geographic disparity.'' Health care in one \ncommunity is practiced one way. Health care in another community is \npracticed another way. They are very different.\n  Many of us have read the June 1 New Yorker article written by Dr. \nGawande comparing El Paso, TX, with McAllen, TX. I see the two Senators \nfrom Texas on the floor. Perhaps they can help us elucidate what is \ngoing on in El Paso and what is going on in McAllen. In El Paso, the \ncost of health care is about half per person what it is McAllen, \nanother border town. Spending per person in El Paso is about half what \nit is in McAllen. Yet the outcome; that is, how well the patients do, \nis a little bit better in El Paso than it is in McAllen. Why? According \nto the author of the article, it is because of how medicine is \npracticed, what is the ethic, what is the sense in El Paso regarding \nhealth care and what is it in McAllen regarding health care. It may be \ndangerous for me to say so, but according to the author, his conclusion \nis that in El Paso, it is because the care is more patient centered, it \nis coordinated care, it is less on making a buck; whereas in McAllen, \nit is less coordinated care, more specialties in hospitals, a little \nbit more providers wanting to go make a buck.\n  The main point is that medicine is practiced so differently all over \nthe country. There are geographic disparities. In Northern High Plains \nStates, it is less spending per person and the outcomes are terrific. \nIn some of the Sunbelt States--and I don't want to step on the toes of \nany Senators from Sunbelt States--there is more spending and the \noutcomes are worse. It is just because it is based on volume and \nquantity, not based on quality.\n\n  This legislation starts to put in place ways to move toward \nreimbursing based on quality, not volume. That, paradoxically, is going \nto result in lower costs and higher quality--lower costs but higher \nquality. Virtually all the folks in the health care community--the \ndoctors, hospitals, and administrators I talk to--virtually all agree--\nI will be very conservative--80 percent agree, 85 percent agree, this \nis the direction in which we have to go.\n  This legislation goes in that direction. Failure to pass this \nlegislation, which the other side wants, means we do not do any of \nthat. It means we do not start putting in place ways to more properly \nreimburse doctors and hospitals and other health care providers.\n  This bill includes those patient-centered reforms I just mentioned. \nWhat are they? They include accountable care organizations, bundling is \nanother concept, reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions, creating \ninnovation centers. This bill starts to do that.\n  There is something else this bill does but which some on the other \nside get all exercised over and which I think they get exercised over \nimproperly; that is, ways to start to compare one drug versus another, \ncompare one procedure versus another, one medical device versus \nanother. We have to start doing more of that with a nongovernment \nagency, with a private-public agency that works together so it gives \ngood, solid information so we have more evidence-based medicine in \nAmerica.\n  Right now, a lot of docs want to do the right thing, but what they do \ndepends on the drug rep who comes in their office and starts peddling a \ncertain drug. Docs feel uneasy about that, they do not like it, but \nthey are so busy they see so many patients, it is hard to keep up to \ndate. So we are trying to help them keep up to date with evidence-based \nmedicine, and with a lot more health IT, health information technology, \nso they can get access to the best evidence through these various \norganizations.\n  There are just so many reasons this legislation is so important. I \npersonally believe we have to move a bit toward what is called \nintegrated systems. We hear about Geisinger, the Mayo Clinic, the \nCleveland Clinic, Intermountain Healthcare. There is some home health \nout in Seattle where doctors and hospitals and nursing homes and \npharmacists are more integrated, and that, therefore, cuts down on \ncost, increases quality. It is more patient centered. It is more care \ncoordinated. This legislation helps us move in that direction.\n  We are just trying to get started with this legislation, get started \nin doing some of the right things we know we should do. We do not have \nall the answers. Nobody has all the answers. But if we get this \nlegislation passed, in the next couple, 3 or 4 or 5 years, working with \nthe basic underpinnings of this legislation, we are going to help \ncorrect some mistakes. We are going to see some new opportunities. We \nare going to be working on getting health care costs down, which we \nhave to begin doing to help our people, help our companies.\n  We are going to work to get more coverage so more people have health \ninsurance. It is an embarrassment today. It is an absolute \nembarrassment that the United States of America, an industrialized \ncountry, does not provide health insurance for its people. It is more \nthan an embarrassment. It is a travesty. It is a tragedy. It is just \nwrong, it is morally wrong.\n  So this legislation gets us moving on the right track. It helps \nMedicare beneficiaries not hurt them, as the other side would like you \nto believe. It does not unnecessarily harm doctors and hospitals. They \nkind of go along with this. They kind of know it is the right thing to \ndo. They are still getting big increases in payments, and there are \nother reforms here which I have not the time to mention tonight. But I \nstrongly urge us to say: Hey, this is the right thing to do. Let's get \nstarted. Let's pass this legislation and certainly trounce this \ncommittal motion to stop what we are doing. It is not right to stop \nthis. We are getting started. Let's keep going.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk about health care \nlegislation. That is what we have been talking about now on the Senate \nfloor for the last week. I expect we will be talking about it for quite \na long time.\n  We have just begun considering this bill, and the American people are \ngrowing in their opposition. According to a new Gallup Poll released \nyesterday, American independent voters now oppose this bill by an 18-\npoint margin: 53 percent against it, 37 percent for it. This Gallup \nPoll states:\n\n\n[[Page S12049]]\n\n\n       Despite the considerable efforts of Congress and the \n     President to pass health insurance reform, the public remains \n     reluctant to endorse that goal.\n\n  But this poll is just confirming what we have really known for \nmonths; that is, the bill before us--and the one that passed the House \nbefore that--is the wrong approach.\n  We are not against reform of health care; we need reform of health \ncare. People are concerned about the rise of premiums in health care. \nSo we ought to be looking at ways to address that issue. By doing what? \nBy cutting the costs in the system and by allowing people to have more \naffordable health care options, none of which is in this bill.\n  Americans do not support $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. They do \nnot support $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes. They do not support mandates. \nThey do not support our growing national debt, which has hit its \nceiling at $12 trillion. They certainly do not support a government \ntakeover of our health care system.\n  Let's talk about the Medicare cuts. The Americans who are most \nimpacted are those we are usually trying to protect: our seniors. I \nhear others on the Senate floor saying there are no cuts to Medicare. I \nam looking at the language in the bill. I am looking at the description \nof the bill, and the fact is there is $135 billion in cuts to \nhospitals, $120 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, $15 billion in \ncuts to nursing homes, $8 billion in cuts to hospice care. That is \nnearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts. That is $500 billion.\n  In Texas, over half a million seniors are enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage. We know this bill will reduce their choices and the benefits \nthey have today--benefits such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, dental \nbenefits, preventive screenings, flu shots, home care, medical \nequipment, and more. So more and more seniors are not going to take the \nMedicare Advantage option which they now take and enjoy. This is not a \nsolid approach.\n  I have heard others on the Senate floor on the other side of the \naisle say it was Republicans who attempted to cut Medicare in previous \nyears. The Republican effort to cut Medicare growth was $10 billion \nover 5 years. Not one Democrat voted for a $10 billion cut over 5 \nyears. Yet today they are touting a $500 billion cut over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, $10 billion was out of the question, and $500 billion \nis now something that can be accepted? There is no reason to cut \nMedicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion. We should save Medicare. We should make it \nlast longer and be more stable. But $500 billion in cuts is just going \nto make it worse. It is going to make it insupportable. Health care for \nour seniors will surely suffer on its face. That is a fact.\n  It is a fair question to ask: Well, what are Republicans for? Are you \nfor health care reform? Well, of course we are for health care reform. \nEvery one of us pays health insurance premiums, and we know people who \nare complaining about the rise in premium costs, especially small \nbusinesspeople. I sympathize with that. We all do.\n  So what is our approach? Step-by-step reform. What the American \npeople are looking for is reform that does not cripple the health care \nindustry in our country, that does not bankrupt our country, and that \ndoes not include a government takeover of the health care system.\n  There are commonsense, fiscally responsible reforms that Republicans \nhave been promoting for years and would support today if we could have \na bill that had any Republican input whatsoever, which this one does \nnot--allowing small businesses to pull together and purchase insurance.\n  Sitting on the floor with us today is Senator Mike Enzi. Senator Enzi \nwas the chairman, previously, of the HELP Committee. He produced a \nbill. He produced a bill that would have given more people coverage \nthan the bill before us today--allowing small businesses to come \ntogether and pool their risk pool, make it larger, and give much more \naffordable premiums to more small businesses so they could afford to do \nwhat every small business wants to do; and that is, offer health care \ncoverage to their employees.\n  But the Democrats killed Senator Enzi's bill. That would have been \nthe first step to health care reform. We could have passed that years \nago and been on the right track increasing the number of people who \nhave affordable options for health care.\n  No. 2, reducing frivolous lawsuits. Where States have taken the \nmeasure to reduce frivolous lawsuits, such as Texas and a few other \nStates, it has been a phenomenal success. It has brought down the cost \nof medical malpractice premiums for doctors. It has increased the \nnumber of doctors who are willing to practice medicine again. It has \nincreased the number of doctors who will go into rural areas that are \nunderserved. It works.\n  The estimates are that if we had a part of this bill that would \nreduce frivolous lawsuits, it would save about $50 billion a year. If \nwe could reduce $50 billion out of the cost in the system that is not \ngoing for anything productive, we could then put that into either \nhelping shore up Medicare or give the Medicare reimbursements to \ndoctors and health care providers, to hospitals. We could help the \nsystem by cutting those costs. That is something Republicans would \nsupport in a heartbeat.\n  How about tax incentives to people who are buying their own health \ncare insurance? If we provided families with a tax credit worth $5,000, \nit would give them the ability to put that on a health care policy for \ntheir families. It would cut the cost and allow them to have an \naffordable option. Another is a tax deduction above the line or a tax \ncredit, which would be a huge incentive to employers, as well as to \nindividuals, who would be able to have that kind of help in covering \nthe cost of health care. We are willing to support that.\n  Another is allowing individuals to purchase insurance across State \nlines; tear down that bureaucracy that keeps people from going across \nState lines and getting the very best deal for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Even an exchange could work. That is something that is embedded in \nthe bill, but it is an exchange that has so many mandates that it is \ngoing to raise the cost for everyone. Just a simple exchange that has \ncompetition and transparency could actually make a difference in \ncutting the costs of health care.\n  So I think there are many things we could do to reform health care, \nif we could have Republican input and a bipartisan bill that would \noffer more affordable health care coverage to more people in our \ncountry. These are ideas that would improve competition in the \nmarketplace, reduce costs, increase access. We do not need a \ngovernment-run plan to achieve that objective.\n  I will be offering an amendment that will allow States to opt out, \nwithout penalties, of this plan, if it passes, not just the government \npart of the plan, but all of the harmful measures. We should be \nproviding choices, not forcing people into government plans. States \nshould not be forced to participate in the government plan. They should \nnot be forced to subsidize it. They should not pay for a plan through \nincreased taxes, nor mandates on businesses.\n  We want businesses to grow. We want businesses to hire people. We \nwant to have jobs created. This bill is a job killer. Has anyone \nnoticed we have one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression \nin this country, that over 3 million people in this country have lost \ntheir jobs this year? Mr. President, 300,000 of them live in my home \nState of Texas. Yet we are talking about a bill that is going to \nincrease mandates on businesses and surely will reduce the number of \npeople who can be hired. There is a disconnect we need to put back \ntogether. We need to talk about options that can work, that can give \nmore people health insurance coverage at a reasonable price and most \ncertainly not be job killers, with mandates and taxes on small \nbusinesses that already are having a hard time staying afloat, creating \njobs, and providing health care for their employees.\n\n  The first amendment we will vote on tonight is the Mikulski amendment \nthat has to do with breast cancer screening and other preventive \nservices for women. Senator Mikulski and I have worked together on \nwomen's health issues for a long time in this body. Two years ago, we \nchampioned the reauthorization of the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program, which provides screening and diagnostic \nservices. So we know how important it is to address women's health care \nissues.\n  I was in complete disagreement with this new task force \nrecommendation on\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\nmammograms and the need for mammograms for women under the age of 50. \nBut I am very concerned that with the recent recommendations of the \ntask force and how this health care bill that is before us relies on \nthe task force, that the amendment is not going to do anything to solve \nthat problem. The health care reform bill relies on the task force 14 \ntimes, and it even allocates money to pay for advertising the task \nforce recommendations. This amendment does not address the problem. \nRather than severing the ties with that task force so it will not \nbecome the norm, the amendment now allows yet another government \nagency, the Health Resources and Services Administration, to interfere \nwith the relationship between a woman and her doctor. So now coverage \ndecisions will be dictated by both the task force and the Health \nResources and Services Administration. Instead of letting doctors and \ntheir patients make the decision about when a woman needs a mammogram, \nwe have now not one government task force but two that we will have to \nintervene in that decision. Oh, my gosh, that does not make any kind of \ncommon sense. While I agree with Senator Mikulski about the great \nimportance of preventive care for women, I disagree with this approach \nbecause it still injects a government agency or task force into the \ndecision that is going to determine whether women have access, easy \naccess, full access to the health care of their choice.\n  The item we will be considering after the Mikulski amendment and the \nMurkowski amendment is the McCain motion. The McCain motion is going to \nstrike the Medicare cuts from this bill. His motion, which I certainly \nendorse and support, would send the bill back for a rewrite. It would \nsend it back to the Finance Committee with instructions to give us a \nnew bill that does not include $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, a bill \nthat would not be paid for on the backs of our seniors whom we should \nbe protecting. As I mentioned previously, the bill that is before us \nwould cut nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion--$500 billion--from Medicare. It will \nnot make it stronger; it will fund more government spending, more \ngovernment takeover in our health care system. Health care reform \nshould not mean slashing Medicare by cutting $\\1/2\\ trillion from \nseniors' care. This is not reform.\n  If we can support the McCain motion to go back to the drawing board \nand look for a way we can have a bipartisan bill that would have \nRepublican as well as Democratic input and agree to step-by-step \nreforms that would increase access, reduce costs and not take away \nchoices of seniors and certainly not have a government takeover of \nhealth care, then I think we could produce something the President \nwould sign and the American people would embrace. Right now, everyone I \ntalk to in Texas is scared to death. They are scared to death of this \nbig government takeover of our health care system because they know \nthat when government gets involved, we are not going to have the \nquality we have known in the past, that the jobs are not going to be in \nthe private sector, that we are not going to have the choice. When this \nbill--which relies on this task force 14 times to make the \nrecommendations that would determine what the coverage is of the \ngovernment plan--was put before us, all of a sudden people started to \nsay women don't need mammograms before the age of 50, when we have \nalways said it was after the age of 40; and after the age of 50, with a \ndoctor's input, and that it would generally be on an annual basis.\n  The former head of the Red Cross, Bernadine Healy, and many of our \nhealth care agencies and task forces said that is going to kill women. \nThat is going to kill women if they don't have early detection. Early \ndetection is all we have for breast cancer right now. We don't have a \ncure. We only have early detection as a way to fight breast cancer. But \nall of a sudden, the task force that is relied on by this bill says we \ndon't need mammograms before the age of 50; and after the age of 50, \nevery 2 years, not every year; and after the age of 72, not at all. \nThat is not health care reform. That is not what the President \npromised, and it is certainly not what Congress ought to assent to.\n  We can produce health care reform. We can lower the cost. We can give \npeople access. We can give people choices. We don't have to mandate \ntaxes and hurt businesses in this economic climate to do it. We have \nthe capability to do something right. If we pass the McCain motion, we \ncan go back to the drawing boards and do this right. That is the most \nimportant thing I hope we will do this week in the Senate for the \nAmerican people, and they deserve it.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if I may, that I be \nallowed to speak for 15 minutes and that that time include a colloquy \nwith my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to address a couple \nissues, if I may; one is this debate about Medicare cuts and savings. \nLet me put up one chart. I will not spend a long time on this, but I \nwish to make a point to my colleagues.\n  About a year ago, the Bush administration sent us a budget. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office and the Senate Budget Committee, the \nproposals in the Bush administration's budget in the last year alone \ncalled for $481 billion in Medicare savings and cuts. It was not in the \ncontext of a health care bill; that was part of a budget proposal. That \nwas $481 billion, according to the CBO just last year. Literally, 12 \nmonths ago that was the proposal. In the context of the overall reform \nof the health care system, in which we are trying to achieve savings to \nmake sure the dollars are going to go further and go for the things \nthat are needed, our proposal calls for $380 billion in savings over \nthe coming 10 years.\n  I think, again, people need to understand what we are talking about \nand that is the difference. So a year ago, $481 billion and no health \ncare proposal--just to get to budget proposals. Here we are in the \ncontext of over 10 years of trying to put things in this bill to ensure \na more solid footing.\n  The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \nrepresenting millions of our fellow citizens, wrote a letter to the \nSenate, every Member, dated December 1, 2009. Senator Harkin earlier \nput the entire letter in the Record. I am going to read just one \nsentence from the letter, signed by Barbara Kennelly, the President and \nCEO of this organization:\n\n       Not a single penny of the savings in the Senate bill\n\n  This bill we are debating--\n\n     will come out of the pockets of beneficiaries in the \n     traditional Medicare program.\n\n  This is an organization that does not bear a political label. It \ndoesn't represent Democrats, Republicans, Independents. It merely \nspends every hour of every working day assessing what happens to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. That is all they do--all they do. Believe me \nwhen I tell my colleagues this organization would not make a statement \nsuch as this if it were untrue. I know the organization. I know the \npeople involved. They are highly critical of Democrats and have been \nwhen they think we have gone too far in various areas. They state, \ncategorically, what this bill does to Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee To Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the millions of members and \n     supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I am writing to express our opposition \n     to the amendment offered by Senator McCain which would \n     recommit H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act, to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions \n     to remove important Medicare provisions.\n       Much of the rhetoric from opponents of health care reform \n     is intended to frighten our nation's seniors by persuading \n     them that Medicare will be cut and their benefits reduced so \n     that they too will oppose this legislation. The fact is that \n     H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     does not cut Medicare benefits; rather it includes provisions \n     to ensure that seniors receive high-quality care and the best \n     value for our Medicare dollars. This legislation makes \n     important improvements to Medicare which are intended to \n     manage costs by improving the delivery of care and to \n     eliminate wasteful spending.\n       The National Committee opposes any cuts to Medicare \n     benefits. Protecting the Medicare program, along with Social \n     Security,\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\n     has been our key mission since our founding 25 years ago and \n     remains our top priority today. In fact, these programs are \n     critical lifelines to today's retirees, and we believe they \n     will be even more important to future generations. But we \n     also know that the cost of paying for seniors' health care \n     keeps rising, even with Medicare paying a large portion of \n     the bill. That is why we at the National Committee support \n     savings in the Medicare program that will help lower costs. \n     Wringing out fraud, waste and inefficiency in Medicare is \n     critical for both the federal government and for every \n     Medicare beneficiary.\n       The Senate bill attempts to slow the rate of growth in \n     Medicare spending by two to three percent, or not quite $500 \n     billion, over the next 10 years. However, it is important to \n     remember that the program will continue growing during this \n     time. Medicare will be spending increasing amounts of money--\n     and providers will be receiving increased reimbursements--on \n     a per capita basis every one of those years, for a total of \n     almost $9 trillion over the entire decade. Even with the \n     savings in the Senate bill, we will still be spending more \n     money per beneficiary on Medicare in the coming decades, \n     though not quite as much as we would be spending if the bill \n     fails to pass.\n       America's seniors have a major stake in the health care \n     reform debate as the skyrocketing costs of health care are \n     especially challenging for those on fixed incomes. Not a \n     single penny of the savings in the Senate bill will come out \n     of the pockets of beneficiaries in the traditional Medicare \n     program. The Medicare savings inclued in H.R. 3590, the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, will positively \n     impact millions of Medicare beneficiaries by slowing the rate \n     of increase in out-of-pocket costs and improving benefits; \n     and it will extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by \n     five years. To us, this is a win-win for seniors and the \n     Medicare program.\n       The National Committee urges you to oppose the motion to \n     recommit the bill to the Finance Committee with instructions \n     to strike important Medicare provisions from health care \n     reform legislation.\n           Cordially,\n                                              Barbara B. Kennelly,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Thirdly, I wish to commend our colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski. Again, a lot has been said about her proposal dealing \nwith women's health. Consider these two statistics as we try to get \nthis right: Less than half the women in the United States have the \noption of obtaining health insurance through a job--less than half. \nThey are forced either to purchase expensive insurance in the \nindividual market or are dependent upon a spouse to provide health \ncare.\n  Right now, today, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, \nconservative, liberal, whether you live in Connecticut, Texas or \nMinnesota, consider this: A healthy 22-year-old woman can be charged \ninsurance rates 150 percent higher than a 22-year-old man in a similar \ncondition. Our bill before us ends that--ends that. If you defeat the \nMikulski amendment or recommit this bill, remember tonight or tomorrow, \nwhen the vote occurs, that 22-year-old woman and that 22-year-old man \nhave a differential as much as 150 percent in health care premiums. \nThat is what happens at this very hour. The Mikulski amendment changes \nthat as well in our bill, among other things.\n  Lastly--and then I wish to turn to my colleague from Minnesota--just \nto remind my colleagues, again, what Senator Baucus has done with his \ncommittee in the Finance Committee and what we did in the HELP \nCommittee to provide some meaningful advantages and help to people \nacross this country immediately. One, our bill will provide $5 billion \nin immediate Federal support for a new program to provide affordable \ncoverage to uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions. Coverage \nunder this program will continue until the new exchanges are operating \nover the next few years.\n  Secondly, the bill creates immediate access to reinsurance for \nemployer health care plans providing coverage for early retirees. \nAgain, this will help protect coverage, while reducing premiums for \nemployers and their retirees.\n  The bill also reduces the size of the doughnut hole immediately by \nraising the ceiling in initial coverage by $500 in 2010, the coming \nyear--immediately. This will guarantee a 50-percent price discount on \nbrand-name drugs and biologics purchased by low- and middle-income \nbeneficiaries in the coverage gap. That is immediate.\n  Fourth, our bill will offer tax credits immediately to small \nbusinesses to make employee coverage more affordable. That is not a \nyear or two or three from now, this is immediate. Tax credits of up to \n50 percent of premiums will be available to firms that choose to offer \nthe coverage as a result of the tax break.\n  Fifth, our bill will require insurers to permit children to stay on \nfamily policies until age 26. Right now, that ends at 23. Our bill \nextends it to 26 immediately, to have this benefit for people across \nthe country who have families and children today who are staying home \nlonger because of the absence of jobs out there for them.\n  Our bill will provide coverage for prevention and wellness benefits \nimmediately and exempt these benefits from deductibles and other cost-\nsharing requirements in public and private insurance coverage. Not in a \nyear, not 2 years, not 3 years but immediately when this bill becomes \nlaw.\n  Sixth, the bill would prohibit insurers from imposing lifetime limits \non benefits and will restrict annual limits as well.\n  The bill also would prohibit group health plans from establishing \neligibility rules of health care coverage that have the effect of \ndiscriminating in favor of higher wage employees.\n  In this bill, we also establish standards for insurance overhead to \nensure that premiums are spent on health benefits. We also require \npublic disclosure of overhead and benefit spending and require premium \nrebates from insurers that exceed established standards for overhead \nexpenses.\n  Lastly, it would create new Web sites to provide information on a \nfacilitated form of consumer choice of insurance options. And there are \nother immediate benefits to this legislation.\n  I think it is important, as we discuss the bill, that you understand \nthere are substantial and meaningful improvements. We have debated this \nbill and debated these issues for months and months on end. The time \nhas come to act. That is what we are proposing with this legislation.\n  With that, I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from \nMinnesota. I yield to him for any additional comments he may wish to \nmake.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership \non this bill. I want to talk about Senator Mikulski's amendment.\n  First, a little bit about some of the claims that have been made on \nthe floor today about Medicare. Senator Dodd pointed out that in the \nBush budget--the last Bush budget--there was a bigger cut to Medicare, \nbut not in the context of any kind of health care reform. Senator \nBaucus said it so well about what the cuts are. They are to hospitals, \nand the hospitals are fine with it. They are not jumping-up-and-down \nexcited about it, but they are fine with it because it comes in the \ncontext of health care reform.\n  We are covering 30 million more people. What does that mean to \nhospitals? When people come into the emergency room, they have \ncoverage. The hospitals get paid. That is the context in which we are \ndoing this; whereas, when President Bush was proposing those kinds of \ncuts, they were not in the context of insuring 31 million more people. \nWhen the uninsured were going into emergency rooms for the most \ninefficient care possible--and won't be now--it was costing every \nAmerican family $1,100 in additional insurance costs. So they are \ncomparing apples and oranges. We are doing so many things, and Senator \nDodd talked about some of the things this bill does. I want to talk \nabout Senator Mikulski's amendment, because women are among the most \nseverely disadvantaged in our current health care system. Right now, \nhealth insurance companies can and do discriminate against women solely \non the basis of their gender.\n  Right now, it is legal in many States--again, not in all States, and \nthis is why, when you are talking about getting health insurance from \nanother State, you have to be careful. In Minnesota, we have stronger \nregulations. In other States, you don't. In many States, it is legal to \ncharge women higher premiums, or deny them coverage at all, if they \nhave had a C-section. It is a preexisting condition. If they have been \nthe victim of domestic violence--in many States in this country an \ninsurance company can deny a woman coverage because she has been the \nvictim of domestic violence, because it is considered a preexisting \ncondition. That is wrong.\n  I am immensely pleased that under this bill, for the first time, \nwomen will have access to comprehensive health\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\nbenefits, including maternity care, without having to pay more than \ntheir male counterparts. But we can do even more for women's health in \nthis country.\n  Senator Mikulski's amendment improves the bill to make sure women can \nget the preventive screenings they need to stay healthy. Most \nimportant, the amendment will make sure that women have access to these \nlifesaving screenings at no cost. So it doesn't interfere with a woman \nand her doctor, as my distinguished colleague from Texas said a few \nminutes ago. It makes these screenings available at no cost. Why is \nthis important? Because right now, women are delaying or skipping \npreventive health care because they cannot afford it. That is not just \nbad for women's health, it is bad for our system because it drives up \ncosts unnecessarily. Even in Minnesota, where we generally do a good \njob at health care, there are women right now who are not getting the \ncare they need. They are skipping their annual exam because they are \nuninsured. Women who are uninsured are twice as likely not to get the \ncare they need.\n  Other women in Minnesota simply cannot afford the coverage they have \nnow. Since 2007, the number of women who have delayed or avoided \npreventive care because of cost has doubled. The economic crisis has \nonly made things worse. But the economic situation is no excuse. The \nreality is that women are forgoing preventive services that could save \ntheir lives because of the way insurance works now.\n  Make no mistake what that is about. From 2000 to 2007, the health \ninsurance companies saw their profits increase 428 percent. Women are \nforgoing preventive measures that could save their lives. Is this the \nkind of country we want to live in?\n  There was some good news yesterday. The CBO confirmed what many of us \nalready knew--that with the insurance market reforms and subsidies in \nour bill, women will be able to purchase better coverage at a lower \ncost than they would be paying without the bill. That is huge. With \nSenator Mikulski's amendment, we will go even further, guaranteeing \nthat women receive preventive care when they need it, without barriers. \nThese screenings catch potential problems such as cancer as early as \npossible. This saves lives and, by the way, it saves money.\n  For example, cervical cancer screenings every 3 to 5 years could \nprevent four out of every five cases of invasive cancer. Regular \nscreenings could prevent more than half of the cases of infertility. \nSenator Mikulski's amendment will give women the care they need when \nthey need it. This is a huge step forward for justice and equality in \nour country.\n  It is also a top priority for me that health reform includes another \ncrucial women's health service, which is access to affordable family \nplanning services. These services enable women and families to make \ninformed decisions about when and how they become parents. Access to \ncontraception is fundamental, a fundamental right of every adult \nAmerican, and when we fulfill this right, we are able to accomplish a \ngoal we all share--all of us on both sides of the aisle to reduce the \nnumber of unintended pregnancies. And so I believe that affordable \nfamily planning services must be accessible to all women in our \nreformed health care system.\n  We can't wait any longer, and I urge all of my colleagues to stand up \nwith us and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. My apologies to Senator Dodd. I guess I, as a freshman, \nam not necessarily familiar with all the rules. I think that means I \nmust yield the floor, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I yield to my good friend from Texas.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I didn't think there was a time agreement \nhere.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I had asked consent for a time agreement. I suspect we \nare going to have a lot of time to talk about the bill.\n  I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk principally about the \nMedicare cuts in this bill and make sure that people understand the \ncontext in which this takes place and what it means in terms of \nbenefits for seniors.\n  There has been a lot of parsing of language here in a way that I \nthink can perhaps obscure the real impact of these proposals.\n  First, let me say there is broad agreement that our health care \nsystem needs reform. But I thought the purpose of that reform was to \nlower costs and make it more affordable--not raise premiums, raise \ntaxes, and cut Medicare benefits.\n  Again, I say to our friends across the aisle, no one wants the status \nquo. But it is clear that our friends across the aisle are not \ninterested in any proposals from this side of the aisle, as \ndemonstrated by the party-line votes in the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee, and the product coming from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This is simply too important to do on a purely partisan basis. Yet \nthat seems to be the intention of the majority. The American people \nwant us to get this right because they understand this impacts 17 \npercent of our economy, and it affects all 300 million of us. This is \nimportant to them. As they have watched these debates and proposals, as \nthey have learned more about them, it is no mystery why public opinion \nfor these proposals has dropped like a rock. Again, it has dropped like \na rock.\n  First of all, on cost, they realize that the proposals as made have \nmasked the true cost of this bill, and there was celebration when the \nbill came in under $900 billion. Forget the fact it doesn't actually go \ninto effect until 4 years into the 10-year budget window, so it was \nonly 6 years of implementation; and never mind that it didn't include \nreversing the 23-percent cut in physician payments that go into effect \nat the first part of next year, unless Congress acts. That was left out \nintentionally to make this look cheaper than it is.\n  The Senate Budget Committee has pointed out that this bill, when \nfully implemented, would cost the American people $2.5 trillion. I have \nconstituents who asked me: Do you know what a trillion dollars is? They \nsay: I don't know. We used to talk about a million dollars being a lot \nof money, and then a billion dollars. Now we are into the trillions--\nhence, the bumper sticker ``don't tell Congress what comes after a \ntrillion,'' for fear we will spend it.\n  This bill, written by the majority leader behind closed doors, \nincreases taxes by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion on American families and \nsmall businesses during the worst recession we have had since the Great \nDepression. Unemployment is 10.2 percent, and it is perhaps headed \nhigher. This bill proposes to make it harder on businesses to retain \nemployees, or perhaps maybe someday hire employees and bring down that \nunemployment rate.\n  This is a job-killing bill. That is why the American people, the more \nthey learn about it, like it less and less. I predict that the longer \nthis debate goes on, the more they learn about it, the less they will \nfind to like about the bill for that and many other reasons.\n  This bill also, according to the CBO, increases health insurance \npremiums by $2,100 for American families purchasing insurance on their \nown. If you are fortunate and you have large group coverage, it is a \nlittle better. But for the millions who are not, it increases the cost \nof their insurance by $2,100 a year.\n  I want to focus primarily on the cuts in Medicare. When our \ncolleagues celebrate the fact that this comes back budget neutral, let \nme explain that mystery. That means you have raised taxes so much and \ncut Medicare benefits so much, you can claim it is budget neutral. I \ndaresay that is not cause for celebration. In order to create a $2.5 \ntrillion new entitlement program--and that is what this is, at a time \nwhen the unfunded liabilities of our current entitlement programs go \nsomewhere into the $40 trillion to $60 trillion range--this bill \nactually cuts $465 billion in payments from Medicare. These cuts \ninclude $135 billion to hospitals; $120 billion from 11 million seniors \non Medicare Advantage, including a half million--or to be more precise, \n523,000 Texans who depend on Medicare Advantage will see a cut in \nbenefits because of this proposal if it passes.\n  Mr. President, $15 billion will be cut from nursing homes, $40 \nbillion will be\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\ncut from home health agencies and $8 billion from hospice care.\n  You can try to parse those words and say we really are not cutting \nMedicare, but we are cutting Medicare Advantage. Indeed, the Obama \nadministration's own Actuary at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices said Medicare cuts of this size would hurt seniors' access to \ncare for several reasons.\n  First, let me start with Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage \nprovides benefits over and above Medicare fee for service. But I think \nwe need to understand that with regard to Medicare fee for service in \nmy State, the last time I checked, 42 percent of physicians will not \nsee a new Medicare patient because the payment rate is too low for the \ndoctors to be able to break even or maybe perhaps earn a small profit. \nAgain, 42 percent of Medicare patients are denied access to a doctor in \nmy State because Medicare payments are so low.\n  What we did a few years ago was pass the Medicare Advantage Program, \nwhich was created to give seniors choice. In other words, there has \nbeen so much celebration of the public option or the government-run \nplan. We have a government-run plan now--Medicare fee for service, \nwhich has, depending on where you read, somewhere between an 8- to 12-\npercent faulty payment rate. In other words, it pays somewhere around \n7.8 to 12.4 percent of bills it does not owe to people who do not \ndeserve it, diverting that money away from payment for beneficiaries.\n  We decided a few years ago to give Medicare beneficiaries a choice--\nsomething I thought we all were for--a choice that provided better care \ncoordination and better benefits. Today, 11 million seniors, including \nthe 532,000 I mentioned in Texas, have chosen Medicare Advantage. But \nthis bill, if passed in its current form, will take away health care \nbenefits from those 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage by cutting \n$118 billion from the program.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, the Congressional Budget Office \nacknowledged that Medicare Advantage cuts would mean fewer services, \nsuch as dental or vision.\n  Senator Mike Crapo asked this question:\n\n       So approximately half of the additional benefit would be \n     lost to those current Medicare Advantage policyholders?\n\n  Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf said:\n\n       For those who would be enrolled otherwise under current \n     law, yes.\n\n  So approximately half the additional benefit would be lost to those \ncurrent Medicare Advantage policyholders.\n  What happened to the President's promise that if you like what you \nhave now, you can keep it? This is another example of a promise that \nbreaks under this bill, in addition to the $2,100-per-family premium \nincrease for those who buy their insurance on the individual market.\n  Despite the fact that this bill cuts $465 billion from the Medicare \nProgram, it also fails to deal with draconian cuts that will go into \neffect in January, unless Congress acts, which will further ensure that \nseniors will be less likely to see a doctor in 2012. We all know this \nis sometimes called the doc fix, but this is basically a misguided \ndecision Congress made back in the late nineties to cut provider \nbenefits, thinking that they could do so and it would not have any \nimpact on access to care. But what it has done is while on one hand \nCongress can stand here and say: Yes, we kept our promise to seniors by \nproviding Medicare coverage, seniors are finding it harder and harder \nto find a physician who will actually see them because of those low \nreimbursement rates. This bill does nothing to cut the 23-percent cut \nin those benefits in 2012 which will have an extremely negative impact \non seniors' ability to see a doctor.\n  We know the majority leader tried, on a standalone bill, to address \nthis issue earlier. But it was not paid for. On a bipartisan basis, \nSenators in this body rejected sending a bill for $200 billion more to \nour children. We said we need to be responsible and pay for the bill.\n  Then the President said health care reform would be paid for by \ndealing with waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. But that is not what \nthis bill does. The Congressional Budget Office said the Reid bill only \nsaves $5.9 billion from reducing waste, fraud, and abuse--$5.9 billion \nin a bill which over a full 10 years of implementation will cost the \nAmerican taxpayers $2.5 trillion.\n  Instead of cutting Medicare, we should be addressing this problem. We \nknow it is a serious problem. The Obama administration found that there \nwas at least $47 billion in Medicare fraud, and that is a conservative \nestimate. According to Harvard professor Malcolm Sparrow, Medicare \nfraud may consume as much as 15 to 20 percent of the $454 billion \nMedicare budget. That means the amount lost to fraud each year in \nMedicare alone is $70 billion to $90 billion. As I mentioned, improper \npayment rates, depending on where you look, range anywhere from 7.8 \npercent of all Medicare payments paid improperly to as much as 12.4 \npercent, depending on where you look.\n  Defrauding Medicare has become so lucrative that even the Mafia and \nother organized criminals are getting into the act. According to the \nAssociated Press last month, members of a Russian-Armenian crime ring \nin Los Angeles were indicted for bilking Medicare of more than $20 \nmillion, and a week after the FBI issued search warrants for a Medicare \nfraud investigation in Miami, the body of a potential witness was found \nin the backseat of a car, riddled with bullets.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill which I hope our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle will look at as a way to change the \nparadigm in terms of the way we address this problem of Medicare fraud. \nRather than the pay-and-pursue model, we would have a model which would \nactually detect potential fraud on the front end by certifying payees \nand otherwise making sure that money is spent properly. We need to \nimplement commonsense solutions such as this to fix fraud in Medicare \nbefore we simply cut in half or cut $\\1/2\\ trillion out of benefits in \nprovider benefits to create a new entitlement.\n  We all understand Medicare is in miserable shape financially--\nmiserable shape. If nothing is done, Medicare will go broke in 2017, \naccording to the Medicare trustees. The Medicare part of entitlement \nproblems has unfunded liabilities--promises Washington made but cannot \nkeep and does not know how to pay for, nearly $38 trillion. Mr. \nPresident, $38 trillion is more than three times the current national \ndebt of $12 trillion, and $38 trillion translated into the burden on \nevery American family means that each American family owes $322,000--\nmore than most American families' homes are worth.\n  The bottom line is, it is simply irresponsible, without fixing \nMedicare, without fixing the fraud and the waste--which I know the \nPresiding Officer is as concerned about as I am--and without dealing \nwith the fact that Medicare promises coverage but denies access because \nof low payments, to pillage nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion from the bankrupt \nMedicare program to create a new budget-busting entitlement program.\n  There had been some talk on the floor about earlier attempts to \nreduce the rate of growth of Medicare. Interestingly, back in 2005, \nwhen there were some proposals to do just that--but, frankly, the \nnumbers paled in comparison: about $10 billion in cuts compared to $500 \nbillion in cuts--the majority leader called those cuts immoral. I have \na long list of comments made by our friends across the aisle which \nstand in stark contrast to the comments they are making today.\n  Frankly, we need to do something about the insolvency of Medicare. \nEven if we did not do anything else, that would be a great benefit to \nthe seniors to whom we promised health coverage but who are currently \ndenied coverage because of the problems I talked about.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee talked \nabout the sterling endorsements that come from a variety of Washington-\nbased advocacy groups. One of them is the AARP, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article about AARP dated October 27 at the conclusion of my \ncomments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, what this article demonstrates is that one \nreason AARP might be opposed to maintaining Medicare Advantage and\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\nbe for the cuts in benefits to current Medicare Advantage beneficiaries \nis because that group and its subsidiaries collected more than $650 \nmillion in royalties and other fees last year from the sale of \ninsurance policies, some of which are designed to fill that gap between \nMedicare fee for service and what it actually costs to get to see a \ndoctor. It is a conflict of interest for this association. Frankly, I \ndon't think its endorsement is worth the paper it is written on, just \nlike other associations that, contrary to the best interests of their \nmembers, have made a deal that is bad for the American consumer. The \nAmerican consumers know it. They know a bad deal when they see it--a \ndeal that includes increased premiums, higher taxes, and cuts in \nMedicare. Frankly, I think those people with such glaring conflicts of \ninterest should not be in the position of trying to endorse something \nthat is basically going to enrich them to the detriment of the American \npeople.\n  I plan to offer amendments about this bill's provisions as currently \nproposed to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from the Medicare Program. My first \namendment would make Medicare play by the same financial solvency rules \nas private insurers.\n  We hear our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about \ninsurance companies. I have no doubt that their desire is, frankly, to \ndo away with private sector involvement in the health coverage field, \nwhich leaves, of course, only the Federal Government--ultimately a \nsingle-payer system making decisions out of Washington, DC, that affect \nthe health care delivery of 300 million people--a bad idea.\n  My first amendment would make Medicare play by the same financial \nsolvency rules as private insurers. Because private insurers are owned \nby their shareholders and have fiduciary responsibilities, they could \nnot do business the way Medicare does. They could not tolerate high \nfraud, waste, and abuse rates. They could not function based on the \nsame risk-based capitalization that private insurance companies do. My \namendment would ensure that before we pillage $\\1/2\\ trillion from the \nMedicare Program to pay for yet another unsustainable entitlement \nprogram, the Medicare Program should be able to meet the same solvency \nand risk-based capitalization requirements private insurance plans \nmeet.\n  My second amendment will be to strike the unelected, unaccountable \nboard of bureaucrats known as the Medicare advisory board.\n  We have heard this Medicare advisory board extolled, but this is the \nsame kind of unelected, unaccountable board that we saw just a couple \nof weeks ago issued a new order or recommendation on mammograms based \non cost-benefit, which would have condemned some women between the age \nof 40 and 49, denied them access to a mammogram and, frankly, condemned \nthem to an early, premature death because of breast cancer. When you \nput all the power to determine the coverage and also payment in an \nunelected, unaccountable board, such as the Medicare advisory board, \nthen, frankly, you are going to get more of that rationing and that \nsame sort of cost-benefit analysis which is going to consign too many \nAmericans to a premature death because, frankly, the Federal Government \ndoesn't care and is not going to see them get access to care.\n  After the Reid bill pillages $465 billion from the Medicare Program \nto create a new entitlement, it sets up this new Medicare advisory \nboard, an unaccountable board of bureaucrats, to find more ways to cut \nbillions of dollars from Medicare. Unsurprisingly, patients, providers, \nand even Congress don't always agree with experts, including the ones \nwe have in place today. According to the Wall Street Journal, the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, created by Congress in 1997, has \nrecommended more than $200 billion in cuts in the last year alone, \nwhich lawmakers--that means Congress--has ignored.\n  Artificial and arbitrary budget targets leave little room for \ninnovation as well. What if we were to find a cure for Alzheimer's in \n2020 but because it would be too expensive, the Medicare advisory board \nwould say the Federal Government is not going to pay for it?\n  Some have said this independent board would be a way to insulate \nMedicare payment decisions from politics. But the very creation of the \nBoard was the result of a political deal with the White House that \ninsulated hospitals from future cuts.\n  I wish to close by saying I hope my colleagues will reconsider and \nvote for the McCain amendment, which will reverse the pillaging of $\\1/\n2\\ trillion from the Medicare Program to create a new entitlement \nprogram. We should fix Medicare's unfunded liabilities of nearly $38 \ntrillion and not steal from Medicare to create another unsustainable \nentitlement program that will, of course, have to be paid for by our \nchildren and grandchildren on top of all the other debt we are piling \non them. At a time of insolvent entitlement programs, record budget \ndeficits, and unsustainable national debt, this country simply cannot \nafford to spend $2.5 trillion on an ill-conceived Washington health \ncare takeover.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 27, 2009]\n\n              AARP: Reform Advocate and Insurance Salesman\n\n                             (By Dan Eggen)\n\n       The nation's preeminent seniors group, AARP, has put the \n     weight of its 40 million members behind healthcare reform, \n     saying many of the proposals will lower costs and increase \n     the quality of care for older Americans.\n       But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have been the \n     group's substantial earnings from insurance royalties and the \n     potential benefits that could come its way from many of the \n     reform proposals.\n       The group and its subsidiaries collected more than $650 \n     million in royalties and other fees last year from the sale \n     of insurance policies, credit cards and other products that \n     carry the AARP name, accounting for the majority of its $1.14 \n     billion in revenue, according to federal tax records. It does \n     not directly sell insurance policies but lends its name to \n     plans in exchange for a tax-exempt cut of the premiums.\n       The organization, formerly known as the American \n     Association of Retired Persons, also heavily markets the \n     policies on its Web site, in mailings to its members and \n     through ubiquitous advertising targeted at seniors.\n       The group's dual role as an insurance reformer and a broker \n     has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks from \n     congressional Republicans, who accuse it of having a conflict \n     of interest in taking sides in the fierce debate over health \n     insurance. Three House Republicans sent a letter to AARP on \n     Monday complaining that the group was putting its ``political \n     self-interests'' ahead of seniors.\n       GOP lawmakers point to AARP's thriving business in \n     marketing branded Medigap policies, which provide \n     supplemental coverage for standard Medicare plans available \n     to the elderly. Democratic proposals to slash reimbursements \n     for another program, called Medicare Advantage, are widely \n     expected to drive up demand for private Medigap policies like \n     the ones offered by AARP, according to health-care experts, \n     legislative aides and documents.\n       Republicans also question the high salaries and other perks \n     given to some top AARP executives, who would not be subject \n     to limits on insurance executives' pay included in the Senate \n     Finance Committee's health reform package. Former AARP chief \n     executive William Novelli received more than $1 million in \n     compensation last year.\n       ``We are witnessing a disturbing trend of handouts to \n     special interests like AARP,'' said House Republican \n     spokesman Matt Lloyd, referring to Democratic negotiations \n     over health reform. ``In return, AARP is lobbying for a \n     government-run health-care bill that will pad their own \n     executives' pockets at the expense of its own members and \n     other vulnerable seniors.''\n       AARP officials strongly dispute such allegations, arguing \n     that the group's heavy reliance on brand royalties allows it \n     to offer members a wide range of benefits--from lobbying for \n     seniors in Washington to discount travel packages and \n     financial advice. The organization notes that even though it \n     offers a Medicare Advantage plan, it has long advocated \n     curbing waste in that federal program.\n       ``We're a consumer advocacy organization; we're not an \n     insurance firm,'' said David Certner, AARP's director of \n     legislative policy. ``That drives everything we do. It's got \n     to be good for our members, or we don't endorse it.''\n       Added AARP spokesman Jim Dau: ``We spend far more time at \n     odds with private insurers than not.''\n       AARP's ties to the insurance business date to its founding \n     by former educator Ethel Percy Andrus, who started a group to \n     help retired schoolteachers find health insurance in the \n     years before Medicare; the effort led to the creation of AARP \n     in 1958.\n       Now, the group relies more than ever on payments from auto, \n     health and life insurers, according to financial statements. \n     From 2007 to 2008, AARP royalties from insurance plans, \n     credit cards and other branded products shot up 31 percent--\n     from less than $500 million to $652 million--making such fees \n     the primary source of revenue for the group last year, the \n     records show. AARP's annual\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\n     financial report shows that 63 percent of that, or about $400 \n     million, came from the nation's largest health insurance \n     carrier, UnitedHealth Group, which underwrites four major \n     AARP Medigap policies. Other carriers with AARP-branded plans \n     include Aetna Life Insurance, Genworth Life Insurance and \n     Delta Dental.\n       AARP is also a major powerhouse in Washington, spending \n     more than $37 million on lobbying since January 2008. The \n     organization's close ties with insurers have long attracted \n     criticism from politicians of both parties.\n       During the health-care debate of the early 1990s, then-Sen. \n     Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) held hearings lambasting the group's \n     business operations. Some Democrats criticized the group for \n     supporting the Bush administration's expensive Medicare \n     prescription-drug legislation in 2003.\n       Earlier this year, AARP and UnitedHealth said they were \n     halting the sale of ``limited benefit'' health insurance \n     policies after complaints from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-\n     Iowa) that the plans were marketed in a misleading way.\n       Dean A. Zerbe, a former Grassley senior counsel who is now \n     national managing director at the corporate tax firm Alliant \n     Group, argues that AARP's involvement in the sale of \n     insurance plans ``really hurts their credibility.''\n       ``Either you're a voice for the elderly or you're an \n     insurance company; choose one,'' Zerbe said. ``They put \n     themselves forward in the public arena as nonbiased \n     observers, but they're very swayed by business interests.''\n       Republicans renewed their attacks on AARP this year after \n     the group emerged as a vigorous defender of many of the \n     reforms under consideration by the Democrat-controlled \n     Congress. Nancy LeaMond, an AARP executive vice president, \n     appeared at a press conference Friday alongside House Speaker \n     Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce a new proposal for \n     plugging gaps in coverage of Medicare prescription benefits.\n       Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), who has asked AARP to provide \n     him with more details about its insurance-related businesses, \n     said he believes the group is ``misleading'' its members \n     about the alleged benefits of Democratic reforms. ``Right now \n     there's a feeling among seniors that AARP may not be entirely \n     forthcoming,'' he said.\n       AARP launched a ``fact check'' section on its Web site this \n     year to counter GOP criticisms of reform, including the \n     discredited ``death panels'' claim, and argues that wringing \n     savings out of Medicare and closing gaps in prescription \n     coverage will help older Americans.\n       Several top AARP officials also said they have no idea \n     whether the group might gain insurance business as a result \n     of the proposed reforms. ``We wouldn't know it, and we \n     wouldn't really care,'' Certner said. ``The advocacy is what \n     drives what we do here, and not the other way around.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand we have several Senators who \nwish to speak. First, the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, then \nSenator Hatch; Senator Cardin would be third. I don't want to tread on \nany toes. I say to Senator Cardin, there is a little bit of time \nconstraint.\n  We are alternating. We are respecting the alternating back and forth.\n  The Senator from Michigan is next, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I, first, thank our distinguished leader \non the Finance Committee. It is my pleasure to serve on the Senate \nFinance Committee. We have been working on this issue for well over a \nyear--2 years now. I very much thank the Senator from Montana and \nappreciate his leadership in getting us to this point because I don't \nthink we would have been here without his leadership. I very much \nappreciate that, as well as our leader, Senator Reid, who has worked \ntirelessly, and, of course, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and \nSenator Harkin from Iowa as well. We certainly appreciate their \nleadership.\n  The bottom line of the legislation in front of us is very simple. On \nbehalf of the American people, we have put forward a health care reform \nbill that will save lives, it will save money, and it will save \nMedicare. It does that in multiple ways.\n  I wish to spend just a few moments this evening talking about \nMedicare because there is a very significant amendment in front of us \nthat would undercut what we are trying to do to save Medicare. As we go \nthrough this next debate, as I have done many times, I am going to \ncontinue to talk about the ways in which we are saving lives and saving \nmoney.\n  The reality is, Medicare is a sacred trust with America's seniors, \nwith people with disabilities. Our health care reform efforts, both in \nthe House and the Senate, will help ensure that trust is never broken. \nThat is what this is all about. In fact, I don't think I could look my \n83-year-old mother in the eye, knowing how much she has benefited from \nMedicare, and be doing anything that would weaken Medicare--now or on \ninto the future.\n  We are going to extend Medicare solvency while providing better, more \naffordable care for America's seniors and people with disabilities. In \nfact, we are going to add 5 years to the Medicare trust fund solvency, \nwhich is extremely important. In the long run, I expect, as we go \nforward, as we bring down costs, as we save money, we will, in fact, be \nadding years to the trust fund by what we are doing.\n  We are going to crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare \nProgram and wasteful overpayments to insurance companies through a \nMedicare Advantage effort that essentially was set up to privatize \nMedicare--turn it over to primarily for-profit insurance companies.\n  Reform is going to make sure we have more affordable services for \nseniors. We are going to begin to close that doughnut hole, a gap in \nprescription drug coverage, right now. It was passed a number of years \nago--and I might indicate not paid for--and our effort is entirely paid \nfor. It does not add a dime to the national debt. In fact, it brings \ndown the deficit. But we are closing a gap in coverage on prescription \ndrugs by 50 percent. We are going to phase that in. We are going to \nkeep going until we get that completely closed.\n  We are going to make sure preventive services do not have a cost \nconnected with them--no deductible, no copay. We want people to be \ngetting the cancer screenings, the mammograms, the wonderful \ncolonoscopies, the other preventive services people need, as well as \nbeing able to have a yearly physical with their physician, without \ndeductibles and copays. We are going to aggressively attack fraud and \nabuse that raises Medicare costs for seniors and for taxpayers.\n  Reform is also about improving quality of care. It will move Medicare \ntoward a system of rewarding high-quality care, investing in \ninnovations, more efforts in primary care, family doctors, better \ncoordination of care, cutting down on duplication of tests and \nbureaucracy and all those things we so frequently complain about in the \nSenate--as we should.\n  It is going to make long-term care services more affordable. There is \nsuch a growing demand and need for long-term services.\n  It is going to eliminate the imminent physician payment cut that \nthreatens to stop seniors from having full choice of seeing their own \ndoctor. As my colleagues know, I am deeply committed to permanently \nfixing a flawed physician payment system, but in this bill we make sure \nthe 21-percent cut that is scheduled to take place next year does not \ntake effect, and we will continue. We are committed to working until we \ncompletely solve this problem.\n  It is not a surprise our Republican colleagues are opposing a plan \nthat actually protects Medicare, it actually protects Medicare benefits \nfor seniors, people with disabilities, and keeps Medicare finances in \nthe black for 5 additional years. Just months, 7 months ago, nearly 80 \npercent of the Republican House Members voted to end Medicare as we \nknow it by turning it into a voucher program that provides a fixed sum \nof money to pay to private insurance companies, which, by the way, has \nled--we are now trying to fix overpayments to private for-\nprofit insurance companies at the expense of Medicare and services for \nseniors.\n\n  A top AARP policy official called this scheme that was supported by \n80 percent of the House Republicans, just 7 months ago--called this \nscheme ``a very dangerous idea,'' saying it would raise costs for all \nbeneficiaries and lower the quality of care for less-affluent seniors, \nlower income seniors.\n  Now faced with a plan that actually strengthens Medicare, actually \nsaves Medicare for the future and makes sure money goes to Medicare \nbeneficiaries rather than to insurance companies in high payments, some \ncolleagues are pulling out all the stops to defend the health care \nstatus quo that sends hundreds of billions of dollars in overpayments \nto private insurance companies. That is, unfortunately, the result of \nthe McCain amendment, which I strongly oppose.\n\n[[Page S12056]]\n\n  Many Republicans are resorting to traditional scare tactics and \nfalsehoods, myths. We have heard this over and over. You can go to the \nAARP Web site and see the fact that, time after time, they have put up \nfalsehoods to try to scare seniors, which I think is outrageous. For \nproof of how politically motivated these attacks are on the President's \nproposal and our proposals to eliminate waste and insurance company \noverpayments in Medicare Advantage, you have to look no further than \nthe fact that a group of Republican Senators actually introduced a \nsimilar proposal as recently as this past May.\n  These kinds of distortions, the fear tactics that have been used, \nwould be offensive under any circumstance, but they are especially \ndisingenuous coming from a group of people who have a long history--a \nparty that has a long history of opposing Medicare and that very \nrecently tried to kill the program as we know it. Their most recent \nassault was just the latest in a war that Republicans have been waging \non the program since the beginning when a majority of them voted no on \neven establishing Medicare. The overwhelming majority of Republican \ncolleagues voted no.\n  Last time we had a Democratic President, leading Republicans across \nthe country launched a vicious attack on Medicare. They bragged about \nopposing the creation of the program in the first place. They called \nfor huge cuts to Medicare and even the ``elimination'' of entitlement \nprograms such as Medicare, as we know them. One even blamed seniors' \ngreed for Medicare's budget problems.\n  As we now debate this issue, I find it so interesting that colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are indicating that, after years of \nhistory of trying to cut, eliminate, change Medicare, Republicans \nhaving voted against even establishing Medicare, that somehow they are \nnow the protectors of Medicare. As AARP has said, there is nothing in \nthis proposal that is going to cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket \ncosts for seniors. They would not be supporting the efforts we have \nbeen involved with if, in fact, it did. I think we all know that.\n  President Obama and the Democratic majority in this Congress are \ncommitted to protecting and strengthening Medicare, a program we \ncreated--I should say my predecessors. I was not here. I was not \nfortunate enough to be here, but it was Democrats who created that \nprogram. I am very proud of it because it is one of the great American \nsuccess stories, Medicare and Social Security. It is a sacred trust \nwith our seniors, and our health insurers reform plan will ensure that \ntrust is never broken.\n  Health care reform is about saving lives, saving money, and saving \nMedicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator form Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am honored to be able to speak on the \nfloor on this very important set of issues. I rise in support of \nSenator McCain's motion to recommit in order to eliminate the Medicare \ncuts contained in the legislation.\n  I do have to say, having listened to my friend from Michigan--and she \nis a good person and good friend of mine--I have to say I do not see \nhow in the world taking $500 billion from Medicare is good for the \nMedicare Program. When you start talking about: We are going to find it \nin fraud, waste, and abuse, that is the biggest dodge that has been \nused for years and years. Frankly, it is not good for the Medicare \nProgram, it is not good for Medicare beneficiaries, and it is simply \nnot true. How can cuts of that magnitude, $500 billion, $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion, be good for the program?\n  I support Senator McCain's motion to recommit the Reid health care \nbill in order to eliminate the Medicare cuts contained in this \nlegislation. Throughout the health care debate, we have heard the \nPresident pledge not to ``mess'' with Medicare. Unfortunately, that is \nnot the case with the bill before the Senate, H.R. 3590, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care act. Interesting name. To be clear, the \nReid bill cuts Medicare by $465 billion to fund a new government \nprogram. Unfortunately, our seniors and the disabled are the ones who \nsuffer the consequences as a result of these reductions. Medicare is \nvery important to the 43 million seniors and disabled Americans covered \nby the program. Throughout my Senate service, I have fought to preserve \nand protect Medicare for both beneficiaries and providers. Medicare is \nalready in trouble today. The program faces tremendous challenges in \nthe very near future. The Medicare trust fund will be insolvent by \n2017, and the program has more than $37 trillion, almost $38 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities. So we are going to take $500 billion more out \nof Medicare? That doesn't make sense. Every senior in this country \nought to be up in arms about it.\n  The Reid bill is going to make a bad situation much worse. Why is \nthat the case? Again, the Reid bill cuts Medicare to create a new \ngovernment entitlement program. More specifically, the Reid bill will \ncut nearly $135 billion from hospitals, $120 billion from Medicare \nAdvantage, and almost $15 billion from nursing homes, more than $40 \nbillion from home health care agencies, and close to $8 billion from \nhospice providers. How can that be good for our seniors? These cuts \nwill threaten beneficiary access to care, as Medicare providers find it \nmore and more challenging to provide health services to Medicare \npatients. How can cutting $465 billion, almost $500 billion, out of \nMedicare strengthen the program? It defies logic. I do not know how \npeople can stand on this floor and make that statement. The people out \nthere have caught on to it. Senior citizens have caught on to it. All \nacross the country they are up in arms, and they should be.\n  In addition, the proposed legislation permanently cuts all annual \nMedicare provider payment updates. Hospitals, home health agencies, and \nhospice facilities would face even more annual reductions over the next \n10 years. Advocates of these reductions, known as ``productivity \nadjustments,'' will argue that today Medicare is overpaying certain \nproviders because current payment updates do not take into account \nincreases in productivity which actually reduce the cost of providing \nbeneficiaries health care services. Come on. To me these permanent \nproductivity adjustments will make it harder for Medicare providers to \nremain profitable, as Medicare payments fail to keep up with the cost \nof providing these health care services.\n  As a result of these payment reductions, I believe many doctors and \nother Medicare providers will stop seeing Medicare patients. In my home \nState of Utah, low Medicare reimbursement rates are already a serious \nproblem for beneficiaries and their health care providers. These \nadditional reductions will only make it more difficult. I want to \nstress to my colleagues that cutting Medicare to pay for a new \ngovernment program is irresponsible. Any reductions to Medicare should \nbe used to preserve the program, not create a new government \nbureaucracy or a new entitlement program. I believe it makes more sense \nto target the Medicare savings towards paying off Medicare's unfunded \nliabilities or preventing the program's future insolvency.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the Medicare Advantage \nProgram and how it is affected by the Reid bill. As I stated \npreviously, the Reid bill reduces Medicare by close to $500 billion. \nAlmost $120 billion comes out of the Medicare Advantage Program. During \nthe Finance Committee's consideration of the Baucus health bill, I \noffered an amendment to protect extra benefits currently enjoyed by \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries. Unfortunately, my amendment was \ndefeated. In other words, the President's pledge assuring Americans \nthat they would not lose benefits was not met by either the Finance \nCommittee bill or the Reid bill currently under consideration in the \nSenate. Here is how supporters of the Finance Committee bill justified \nthe Medicare Advantage reductions. They argued the extra benefits that \nwould be cut, such as vision care, dental care, reduced hospital \ndeductibles, lower copayments, and premiums, were not statutory \nbenefits offered in the Medicare fee-for-service program. Therefore, \nthese benefits did not count. Well, they counted for the seniors \nreceiving those benefits.\n  A few weeks back our President once again assured the American people\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\nthat they could keep their current health plan. Here is what he said:\n\n       The first thing I want to make clear is that if you are \n     happy with the insurance plan that you have right now, if the \n     costs you're paying and the benefits you're getting are what \n     you want them to be, then you can keep offering that same \n     plan. Nobody will make you change it.\n\n  I believe that promise should apply to all Americans, including those \nparticipating in the Medicare Advantage Program. Congress is either \ngoing to protect existing benefits or not. It is that simple. \nUnfortunately, under the Reid bill, if you are a beneficiary \nparticipating in Medicare Advantage, that promise does not apply to \nyou.\n  I have some history with the Medicare Advantage Program. I served as \na member of the House-Senate conference, as did the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee. We both served as members of the \nSenate conference committee which wrote the Medicare Modernization Act \nof 2003. Among other things, this law created the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. We did it because we wanted to provide health care choices to \nbeneficiaries living in rural America. And it did. Medicare+Choice \ndidn't do it. We knew it wouldn't do it. When conference committee \nmembers were negotiating the conference report, several of us insisted \nthat the Medicare Advantage Program was necessary in order to provide \nhealth care coverage choices to Medicare beneficiaries. At that time \nthere were many parts of the country where Medicare beneficiaries did \nnot have choice in coverage. In fact, the only choice offered to them \nwas traditional fee-for-service Medicare, a one-size-fits-all \ngovernment-run health program.\n  By creating the Medicare Advantage Program, we provided beneficiaries \nwith a choice in coverage and then empowered them to make their own \nhealth care decisions as opposed to the Federal Government making those \ndecisions for them. Today every Medicare beneficiary may choose from \nseveral health plans for his or her coverage. Medicare Advantage works. \nIt has worked. It will work in the future, if we don't louse it up with \nthis bill.\n  On the other hand, Medicare+Choice and its predecessors did not, \nbecause many plans across the country, especially in rural areas, were \nreimbursed at very low rates by the Medicare Program. I fear history \ncould repeat itself if we are not careful. Let me take a minute to talk \nabout Medicare+Choice. I represent a State where Medicare managed care \nplans could not exist due to low reimbursement rates. To address that \nconcern, Congress included language which was signed into law \nestablishing a payment floor for rural areas, but it was not enough. In \nfact, in Utah all of the Medicare+Choice plans eventually left because \nthey were all operating in the red. This happened after promises were \nmade that Medicare+Choice plans would be reimbursed fairly and that all \nMedicare beneficiaries would have access to these plans.\n  So during the Medicare Modernization Act conference, we fixed the \nproblem. First, we renamed the program Medicare Advantage. Second, we \nincreased reimbursement rates so that all Medicare beneficiaries, \nregardless of where they lived, be it in Fillmore, UT or New York City, \nhad choice in coverage. Again, we did not want beneficiaries stuck with \na one-size-fits-all government plan. Today Medicare Advantage works. \nEvery Medicare beneficiary has access to a Medicare Advantage plan. \nClose to 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries participating in the \nprogram are satisfied with their health coverage. But that could all \nchange should the health care reform legislation currently being \nconsidered become law. Choice in coverage has made a difference in the \nlives of more than 10 million individuals nationwide. The extra \nbenefits I have mentioned are being portrayed as gym memberships as \nopposed to lower premiums, copayments, and deductibles. To be clear, \nthe Silver Sneakers program is one that has made a difference in the \nlives of many seniors, because it encourages them to get out of their \nhome and remain active. It has been helpful to those with serious \nweight issues, and it has been invaluable to women suffering from \nosteoporosis and joint problems. In fact, I have received several \nhundred letters telling me how much Medicare Advantage beneficiaries \nappreciate this program.\n  Additionally, these beneficiaries receive other services such as \ncoordinated chronic care management, dental coverage, vision care, and \nhearing aids.\n  In conclusion, I cannot support any bill that would jeopardize health \ncare coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. I truly believe that if the \nbill before the Senate becomes law, Medicare beneficiaries' health care \ncoverage could be in serious trouble. We owe it to the 43 million \nAmericans, seniors and disabled who depend on Medicare, to reject the \nnonsensical Medicare cuts included in the Reid bill. We must have \nbetter solutions that will not hinder their ability to see the doctor \nof their choice.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 33 years. I pride myself for being \nbipartisan. I have coauthored many bipartisan health care bills since I \nfirst joined the Senate in 1977.\n  Let me be clear: I want a health reform bill to pass this Chamber, \nbut I want it to be a bipartisan bill that passes the Senate by 70 to \n80 votes. If a bill involving one-sixth of the American economy cannot \nget 70 to 80 votes, that bill has to be a lousy bill, especially if it \nis a partisan bill, like this one.\n  If we could do it in 2003, when we considered the Medicare \nprescription drug legislation, we can do it today. There has never been \na bill of this magnitude affecting so many American lives that has \npassed this Chamber on a straight party-line vote. In the past, the \nSenate has approved many bipartisan health care bills that have \neventually been signed into law. The Balanced Budget Act in 1997, which \nincluded the Children's Health Insurance Program; the Ryan White Act; \nthe Orphan Drug Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; and the \nHatch-Waxman Act are a few of these success stories, and I was a prime \nsponsor of every one of those bills. If the Senate passes this bill in \nits current form with a razor thin margin of 60 votes--or even 61, to \nbe honest with you--it would be so partisan it wouldn't even be funny. \nThis would be yet one more example of the arrogance of power since the \nDemocrats have secured a 60-vote majority in the Senate.\n  There is a better way to handle health care reform. First and \nforemost, it must be bipartisan. We stand ready and willing to work on \na bipartisan bill, without the restrictions that were placed on the \ndistinguished Senator who chairs the Finance Committee. It should be \nbipartisan. Second, we cannot erode the existing system that has \nprovided quality and affordable health care to most Americans for \ndecades. While we all agree that the current system should be improved, \nthis bill is certainly not the answer. If the Senate passes the McCain \nmotion to recommit, we can begin to work on a bipartisan health bill \nthat will eliminate the overwhelming Medicare payment reductions and at \nthe same time address the serious issues facing the Medicare Program in \nthe near future.\n  Look, we know that insurance should cover preexisting conditions. We \nknow if we use 50 State laboratories by giving the States the money to \naddress health care in accordance with their own demographics, not only \nwill states resolve their own health care issues but we also will be \nable to learn from the successes of these States.\n  We all know if we address medical liability reform and eliminate \napproximately 90 percent of the frivolous cases that are filed--costing \nanywhere from $54 billion to $300 billion a year in unnecessary costs--\nwe know those savings would help us pay for this bill.\n  We know there are so many things we could do on wellness and \nprevention that will work. I think all of us agree on most of these \nissues. Democrats could never agree on medical liability reform because \nthe personal injury lawyers--and there is a limited group in what used \nto be the American Trial Lawyers Association--are high funders of \nDemocratic races. So they are not willing to do anything about it. In \nfact, in the House bill, if you do not cooperate with the personal \ninjury lawyers, you lose your money. It is unbelievable.\n  We know there are a number of other things we could do that both \nsides could agree on that would cut costs. We are currently spending in \nthis country, without this bill, $2.4 trillion on\n\n[[Page S12058]]\n\nhealth care, all told. This bill will add, over a true 10-year period, \nanother $2.5 trillion to the cost. So it will result in almost $5 \ntrillion in health care spending. Why don't they admit it is going to \nbe at least $2.5 trillion? They do not admit it because for the first 3 \nor 4 years they count the taxes that are charged, but they do not \nimplement the program until 2014 in the Reid bill. It is 2013 in the \nHouse bill, and even 2014 in some aspects of the House bill. That is \nthe only reason they can say it is about $1 trillion. It is actually \n$2.5 trillion according to figures from the Senate Budget Committee, \nusing the figures of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I hate to see $500 billion come out of Medicare, at a time when \nMedicare is going to go insolvent by 2017 or 2018. I think it is \nabsurd. I think it is ridiculous. I do not blame the seniors for being \nupset, and they are very upset throughout this country. They have \nreason to be upset. I urge my colleagues to support the McCain motion \nto commit this bill, and let's get working on a truly bipartisan bill.\n  There are some of us who have the reputation of working with the \nother side in a bipartisan way. We want to do it. We want to get it \ndone. We want the vast majority of the people in this country happy \nwith the final bill. We want to have between 75 and 80 votes, as a \nminimum, to pass this bill. That way, there would be at least some \nassurance that it was a bipartisan bill and it might have a real chance \nto work. But if we pass this bill 60 to 40, let's be honest about it, \nyou know it is a lousy bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, for bringing forward a bill that has been long \noverdue on the Senate floor.\n  This is a historic moment as we debate health care reform. Many of us \nhave been looking forward to this moment for many years. As to this \nbill, the Congressional Budget Office has now confirmed, for the \noverwhelming majority of Americans, it will bring down their health \ncare insurance premiums.\n  This bill will bring down the growth rate of health care costs. It \nwill provide affordable options for millions of Americans who today \nhave been denied the opportunity to buy health insurance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us that it will insure 31 \nmillion Americans who otherwise would not have insurance, bringing down \nthe uninsured rate. And, most importantly, the Congressional Budget \nOffice--that objective scorekeeper; that is not Democrats, not \nRepublicans; this is the objective scorekeeper--tells us this bill will \nbring down the Federal deficit.\n  So it is a responsible bill, a bill that will provide affordable \ninsurance options for millions of Americans who are denied insurance \ntoday. It will reduce our deficit, and will start to get a handle on \nthe escalating cost of health care. It saves money. It saves lives \nthrough prevention and early detection of diseases, and by expanded \ncoverage. And it saves Medicare.\n  Why does it save Medicare? Because many of us who have been here for \na long time understand that the only way you can bring down the cost of \nMedicare is to bring down the cost of health care. That is exactly what \nthis bill does, providing for the long-term safety of Medicare for our \nseniors.\n  It also expands benefits for our seniors in prevention and helps to \nstart to fill the doughnut hole in prescription drug coverage. The \nunderlying bill moves us toward what we need to do in health care \nreform. It brings down health care costs. How? By managing diseases and \nunderstanding the way we pay for diseases today is where most of the \ncost in health care is. This helps us manage diseases. It expands \ninsurance coverage, which will bring down costs. It provides for \ninvestments in health information technology so we can bring down the \nadministrative costs, and it invests in wellness and prevention.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2791\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support the \nMikulski amendment, which will ensure women have access to essential \npreventive services. The leading causes of death for women are heart \ndisease, cancer, and stroke. Early screening for risk factors could \nprevent many of these deaths and lead to improved health and quality of \nlife for women. But despite the benefits of early screening, many \ninsurers do not cover them, and too often women skip them because the \ncosts are prohibitive. We know early detection of disease saves lives, \nand so we must ensure that needed preventive services are available to \nall Americans, regardless of gender.\n  I have long worked to improve access to preventive services. Knowing \nwhat we do now about the importance of prevention, it seems hard to \nbelieve that before 1998 Medicare did not cover cancer screenings or \nother preventive services. I am proud of a bill I authored in 1997 as a \nMember of the House of Representatives. It established the first \npackage of preventive benefits in traditional Medicare. It was part of \nthe 1997 Balanced Budget Act, and it would not have passed but for \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  Medicare now covers screenings for breast, colon, and prostate \ncancer, bone mass measurement for osteoporosis, diabetes testing \nsupplies, glaucoma, and more. Last year's bill, the Medicare \nImprovements for Patients and Providers Act, gave HHS the authority to \nexpand the list of covered services so that as new, highly effective \nprocedures are discovered, they can be made available to beneficiaries \nwithout having to wait the length of time for Congress to act. This \nbill wisely builds on the benefit package for seniors and expands it to \ncover all Americans as part of their insurance coverage. We are \nexpanding prevention and making sure it is available so all Americans \nwill have a better insurance product that will cover preventive \nservices.\n  Basic screenings can have an enormous impact on health and save money \nin the long run. Chronic disease incurs a huge cost for our health care \nsystem. Today, more than half of Americans live with at least one \nchronic condition, accounting for 75 percent of all health care \nspending each year. To bend the cost curve, we need to reduce the onset \nof chronic diseases before they become much more expensive to treat.\n  The American Cancer Society reports that the incidence of cervical \ncancer and mortality rates have decreased by 67 percent over the past \nthree decades. This is mainly attributable to the introduction of the \nPap test. The average cost for normal cervical screening in 2004 was \n$31. In contrast, the treatment for early-stage cervical cancer \naveraged $20,255, and the treatment for late-stage cervical cancer was \nalmost $37,000. Screening saves lives, saves money. The bill before us \ninvests in prevention. It will save money. It will save lives.\n\n  Breast cancer screening has also been shown to reduce mortality. \nEarly-stage diagnosis gives a 5-year survival rate of 98 percent, and \nstatistics compiled by the American Cancer Society indicate that 61 \npercent of breast cancers are diagnosed at this stage, largely due to \nmammographies and other early screening methods.\n  The bill before us guarantees coverage for a number of services to \npromote public health and wellness and to prevent devastating chronic \ndisease. Some of these measures include providing coverage for everyone \nfor services that have an ``A'' or ``B'' rating by the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. These tests and screenings are either recommended \nor strongly recommended and include screenings for osteoporosis, colon \ncancer, and would be covered with no cost sharing--a strong incentive \nfor people taking advantage of these screenings.\n  Covering immunizations recommended for adults by the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices of the CDC is also covered. \nPreventive care services and screenings for infants, children, and \nadolescents that are supported in comprehensive guidelines from the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration--all that is in the \nunderlying bill that will save us money and will save us lives.\n  In addition to these vital services, the women's preventive health \nservices must also be covered, the Mikulski amendment. The Mikulski \namendment extends the preventive services covered by the bill to those \nevidence-based services for women that are recommended by the Health \nResources\n\n[[Page S12059]]\n\nand Services Administration. HRSA, a division of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, has as its goal to improve access to primary \nand preventive care services to uninsured and underinsured individuals.\n  It focuses on maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS care, recruiting \ndoctors in underserved areas, health care in rural areas, and organ \ndonation. HRSA strives to develop ``best practices'' and create uniform \nstandards of care, including eliminating health disparities among \nminority populations.\n  Some of the additional services for women that will be covered under \nthe Mikulski amendment include mammograms for women under 50. In 2000, \nbreast cancer was the most common cancer affecting Maryland women, and \nnearly 800 women died from the disease, according to the Maryland \nDepartment of Health and Mental Hygiene. According to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation, 76.6 percent of women aged 40 and over had a mammography \nwithin the past 2 years. This amendment would ensure that all of these \nwomen would have access to mammography with no out-of-pocket cost.\n  Also covered under the Mikulski amendment are cervical cancer \nscreenings for all women, regardless of whether they are sexually \nactive, and ovarian cancer screenings--all those will be made available \nunder the Mikulski amendment. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause \nof cancer deaths among women in Maryland. General yearly well-women \nvisits would be covered; pelvic examinations, family planning services, \npregnancy, and post partum depression screenings, chlamydia screenings \nfor all women over 25. Chlamydia is the most prevalent sexually \ntransmitted disease diagnosed in the United States. Approximately 4 \nmillion new cases of this disease occur each year, and up to 40 percent \nof the women infected with this disease may be unaware of its \nexistence. It is the leading cause of preventable infertility and \nectopic pregnancy.\n  Also included are HIV screenings for all women regardless of exposure \nto risk. According to the Kaiser Foundation, among those women who are \nHIV positive, 33 percent of the women were tested for HIV late in their \nillness and were diagnosed with AIDS within 1 year of testing positive.\n  We need to do a better job here. This is International Aids Awareness \nDay. I think it is very appropriate we have the Mikulski amendment on \nthe floor today.\n  Studies reported by the Kaiser Foundation indicate that women with \nHIV experience limited access to care and experience disparities in \naccess, relative to men. Women are the fastest growing group of AIDS \npatients, accounting for 34 percent of all new AIDS cases in 2001, \ncompared with 10 percent in 1985. So this amendment will help in regard \nto that issue for our women.\n  Also included is sexually transmitted infection counseling for all \nwomen. Women disproportionately bear the long-term consequences of \nSTDs. Screenings for domestic violence are covered. The Maryland \nNetwork Against Domestic Violence reports that one out of every four \nAmerican women--one out of every four American women--reports she has \nbeen physically abused by a husband or a boyfriend at some time in her \nlife. Well, the Mikulski amendment provides screenings for domestic \nviolence.\n  Also included are overweight screenings for teens, gestational \ndiabetes screenings, thyroid screenings.\n  Much of the debate on health care reform has focused on quality--how \ndo we make our health care system work better and produce better \noutcomes for the money we spend. Ensuring that women have access to \npreventive services that are recommended by experts on women's health \nis absolutely essential to providing quality care.\n  This amendment protects the rights of a woman to consult with a \ndoctor to determine which services are best for her and guarantees \naccess to these services at no additional cost. Preventive health care \ninitiatives is one area I hoped we could all agree upon. The Senate has \na long history of bipartisan support for women's preventive services. I \nhope the string remains unbroken with this amendment.\n\n  I strongly support the efforts spearheaded by Senator Mikulski to \nextend the services that are covered for women. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this very important amendment that makes a good \nbill better. This bill is desperately needed. Let's vote for those \namendments that improve it, such as the Mikulski amendment, and let's \nmove forward with this debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Mikulski \namendment and to discuss the importance of preventive health care for \nwomen.\n  All women should have access to the same affordable preventive health \ncare services as women who serve in Congress.\n  The Mikulski amendment will ensure that is the case.\n  It will require plans to cover, at no cost, basic preventive services \nand screenings for women.\n  This may include mammograms, pap smears, family planning, and \nscreenings to detect heart disease, diabetes, or postpartum \ndepression--in other words, basic services that are a part of every \nwoman's health care needs at some point in life.\n  We often like to think of the United States as a world leader in \nhealth care, with the best and most efficient system. The facts do not \nbear this out.\n  The United States spends more per capita on health care than other \nindustrialized nations but has worse results.\n  According to the Commonwealth Fund, the United States ranks 15th in \n``avoidable mortality.'' This measures how many people in each country \nsurvive a potentially fatal, yet treatable medical condition. And the \nUnited States lags behind France, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Italy, \nAustralia, Canada, and several other nations.\n  According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \n24th in the world in healthy life expectancy. This measures how many \nyears a person can expect to live at full health. The United States \nagain trails Japan, Australia, France, Sweden and many other countries.\n  These statistics show we are not spending our resources wisely. We \nare not finding and treating people with conditions that can be \ncontrolled.\n  Part of the answer, without question, is expanding coverage. Too many \nAmericans cannot afford basic health care because they lack basic \nhealth insurance.\n  The Mikulski amendment, and providing affordable access to preventive \ncare, is another part of the answer.\n  Women need preventive care, screenings, and tests so that potentially \nserious or fatal illnesses can be found early and treated effectively.\n  We all know individuals who have benefited from this type of care.\n  A mammogram identifies breast cancer, before it has spread.\n  A pap smear finds precancerous cells that can be removed before they \nprogress to cancer and cause serious health problems.\n  Cholesterol testing or a blood pressure reading suggest that a person \nmight have cardiovascular disease, which can be controlled with \nmedication or lifestyle changes.\n  This is how health care should work: a problem found early and \naddressed early. The Mikulski amendment will give more women access to \nthis type of care.\n  Statistics about life expectancy and avoidable mortality can make it \neasy to forget that we are talking about real patients and real people \nwho die too young because they lack access to health care.\n  Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health shared the following \nstory, which comes from Dr. William Leininger in California.\n  He states:\n\n       In my last year of residency, I cared for a mother of two \n     who had been treated for cervical cancer when she was 23. At \n     that time, she was covered by her husband's insurance, but it \n     was an abusive relationship, and she lost her health \n     insurance when they divorced.\n       For the next five years, she had no health insurance and \n     never received follow-up care (which would have revealed that \n     her cancer had returned). She eventually remarried and \n     regained health insurance, but by the time she came back to \n     see me, her cancer had spread.\n       She had two children from her previous marriage--her \n     driving motivation during her last rounds of palliative care \n     was to survive long enough to ensure that her abusive ex-\n     husband wouldn't gain custody of her kids after her death. \n     She succeeded. She was 28 when she died.\n\n  Cases like these explain why the United States trails behind much of\n\n[[Page S12060]]\n\nthe industrialized world life expectancy. For this woman, divorce meant \nthe loss of her health care coverage, which meant she could not afford \nfollow up care to address her cancer, a type of cancer that is often \ncurable if found early.\n  This story shows the need to improve our system, so women can still \nafford health insurance after they divorce or lose their jobs, and it \nshows why health reform must adequately cover all the preventive \nservices that women need to stay healthy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Mikulski amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, is the pending business still the health \ncare reform bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is, and the motion to commit.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, Republicans and Democrats alike agree \nthat Congress needs to look at ways to reform our health care system. \nToo many Americans are uninsured, underinsured, or cannot afford the \nhealth insurance they have.\n  Reforming health care, which amounts to over 17 percent of our gross \ndomestic product, is no easy task, and it is a process that should not \nbe rushed. I believe Congress should move in an incremental approach to \nreforming health care. We are restructuring one-sixth of our national \neconomy with this bill, and we should be darn sure we know what we are \ndoing. I believe Congress should work in a bipartisan way to draft \nreform legislation instead of working in secret behind closed doors.\n  I support measures such as passing medical malpractice reform, \nallowing small businesses to band together to buy insurance, and \nallowing individuals to buy insurance across State lines. These \nstrategies will help lower costs, make insurance more affordable, and \nincrease coverage. That should be the goal of health care reform, and \nwe can do this without putting Washington bureaucrats and Members of \nCongress in control of our health care. This seems like a win-win \nsituation to me.\n  I also support the bill introduced earlier this year by Senators \nCoburn and Burr called the Patients' Choice Act which reforms the \nhealth care system. This bill helps States establish State-based \nexchanges, helps low-income families with health care costs, and \nimproves health care savings accounts. I have heard members of the \nmajority party claim that Republicans don't have a health care plan. \nThey couldn't be more wrong. We just don't have a 2,000-plus page bill \nas they do that will drive up premiums, cut Medicare by $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion, and raise taxes on all Americans. We just don't have a bill \nas they do that costs $2.5 trillion and will threaten the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren as they struggle to pay the debts we are \nleaving them.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to explain my concerns with the bill \nthat Senator Reid has laid out before us. Unfortunately, it is hard to \neven know where to start. As I said, this bill is over 2,000 pages \nlong. Its table of contents--the table of contents--is 13 pages long. \nIt was written behind closed doors by a small group of handpicked \npeople by the majority leader, so most of us in the Senate, and the \nAmerican people, had no idea what was in it before it was released. For \na majority party that billed itself as being transparent, they \ncertainly failed in writing this bill.\n  The bill we have before us changes the way health care is delivered \nin this country. It will affect every American regardless of whether \nthey have insurance, regardless of whether they are satisfied with \ntheir insurance, or even if they are on Medicare. We need to make sure \nwe know what we are doing and know what the long-term consequences are \nof any changes we make. At this point, I am not confident that we do.\n  This bill will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years when fully \nimplemented. It raises taxes by almost $\\1/2\\ trillion. It cuts almost \n$\\1/2\\ trillion from the Medicare Program. Yet it still leaves 24 \nmillion people uninsured. The bill jeopardizes the ability of Americans \nto keep their own doctor and will lead to the rationing of care.\n  The recent recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \non breast cancer screening should be a wakeup call to all Americans \nabout Washington bureaucrats meddling in their health care. Under this \nbill, health care premiums will rise, 5 million Americans will lose \ntheir employer coverage, and 15 million more will be added to Medicaid \nand the CHIP program. I think this is a move in the wrong direction.\n  Medicaid often underpays medical providers for treating patients \nwhich makes it hard for doctors who want to treat these patients and \nhard for patients to find doctors to treat them. We should be finding \nways to help people better afford private insurance, not simply adding \nthem to the public dole. This bill puts Washington bureaucrats and \nMembers of Congress in control over many aspects of our health care \nwhich should scare everyone within the sound of my voice.\n  For example, starting in 2014, Washington will require most Americans \nto prove they have health insurance or pay a penalty tax. The penalty \nwill be phased in over a couple of years, but in 2016, the penalty will \nbe $750 per person with a maximum of $2,250 for a family. These amounts \nare indexed in future years, however, so the penalty will continue to \nincrease.\n  If you aren't in one of the bill's special exemption categories, you \nwill have to prove that you and your family have insurance when you sit \ndown to fill out your taxes. If you don't, then you will get to send \nUncle Sam an additional $750 or $2,250 on April 15.\n  I know the authors of this bill will try to argue that since their \nbill leads to nearly universal coverage, most Americans would not be \naffected by this tax. That couldn't be further from the truth. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper, \nthis bill leaves 24 million Americans uninsured. Twenty-four million \nAmericans without insurance is not ``universal coverage'' or anything \nclose to it. Also, Members of Congress are going to be telling people \nwhat type of insurance they have to buy, and we will not even be giving \nevery American access to the cheapest plan on the market.\n  The bill requires that only four types of health care insurance can \nbe offered in the exchange: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. All the \nplans would have to offer certain benefits and meet certain criteria. \nHowever, the bill creates a special catastrophic plan for only special \ngroups of people: those under the age of 30 and those who don't have \naffordable coverage. It doesn't matter that many more people want this \nlevel of coverage. If they aren't under 30 or meet some type of income \neligibility test, they are just out of luck.\n  Catastrophic coverage is the right type of coverage for many \ndifferent types of Americans, including singles, younger people, and \nthe healthy. It is very likely to be the cheapest plan affordable on \nthe exchange. Think about this: a young woman in her thirties, she eats \nright, she exercises, doesn't smoke, takes good care of herself. She \nwants a catastrophic plan, and it is all she needs. Under this bill, \nshe couldn't buy into the catastrophic plan because of her age. Members \nof Congress tell her she isn't entitled to the cheapest plan on the \nmarket because she is too old. She is in her thirties. Or think of the \n29-year-old male who has been enrolled in this catastrophic plan in his \nearly twenties. On his next birthday, the Federal Government has a big \nbirthday surprise for him. He will get kicked out of the insurance plan \nhe has enjoyed for years and will be forced to join a more expensive \nhealth care plan. That is a wonderful birthday gift.\n  I don't think Congress's role is to require all Americans to buy \ninsurance. I don't think Washington bureaucrats and elected Members of \nCongress should be dictating what health care options are available for \nthe entire country.\n  I understand the importance of insurance. I think everyone should \nhave insurance, but I don't think it is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to force people to buy it or micromanage what insurance \nlooks like.\n  This bill also makes huge cuts in Medicare which will affect every \nsenior. The bill cuts--and we have heard it many times today--$465 \nbillion from the Medicare Program. These cuts would not be used to \nshore up the Medicare Program which will be insolvent in just about 8 \nyears. Instead, these cuts will be used to fund new government \nspending. This move further jeopardizes the viability of the Medicare \nProgram.\n\n[[Page S12061]]\n\n  I know AARP and the American Medical Association are trying to tell \nseniors these cuts will actually be good for the Medicare Program and \nthe program would not be harmed, but let's be honest. When you think \nabout it, does it really make any sense? Congress is going to cut $465 \nbillion from a program that is already facing bankruptcy, and it will \nsomehow make it stronger? If you believe that, I have some oceanfront \nproperty to sell you in Arizona.\n  Under this bill, hospitals will be cut, nursing homes will be cut, \nhealth home agencies will be cut, hospices will be cut, and Medicare \nAdvantage programs will be cut. By cutting the reimbursement rate for \nproviders, they are making it harder for seniors to find medical \nproviders to treat them. Plain and simple: Seniors will have the same \nbenefit, but if they cannot find anyone to treat them, then their \nbenefits don't do them any good, do they?\n  I have to tell my colleagues there isn't one medical provider who \nwalks in my office each year who is happy with their reimbursement rate \nunder Medicare. I cannot think of one. Hospitals are not happy. The \ndoctors are not happy. Hospice care providers who provide such valuable \nservices to dying Americans and their families are not happy. No one is \nhappy.\n  What do you think is going to happen to these reimbursements when the \ncuts go into effect? How happy will the providers be then?\n  Another problem with this bill is the creation of a government plan. \nI can say I do not support a government-run plan in any form. I have \nalready described the significant problems with Medicare and Medicaid. \nCreating a new government-run health program will lead to the same sort \nof problems that plague these plans.\n  I fear it will eventually undermine private insurance enough so we \nare left with a single-payer, government-run system. I have been in \nCongress long enough to know it will be a disaster for this country.\n  Finally, this bill imposes an unprecedented tax increase on \nAmericans. The tax hikes in this bill would start hitting Americans \nnext year, while the spending and benefits will not start, in many \ncases, until 2014. That is how the majority is hiding the true cost of \nthe bill--using 10 years of tax hikes to offset 6 years of spending.\n  Everybody knows tax increases are deadly in a fragile economy. But \nthat is not preventing the majority from pushing through $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in tax hikes in this bill. In further defiance of logic, these \ntax increases will actually drive up the cost of health care. I was \nunder the impression the goal of health care reform was to reduce \ncosts, not increase them.\n  As I mentioned earlier, if you have the misfortune of being \nuninsured, you will be further punished under this bill by paying a \npenalty tax. If you are an employer that hires a low-income worker and \ncannot afford to provide health insurance, you probably will be \npunished with a penalty tax. If you are an employer that offers \nretirees prescription drug coverage, your taxes will go up. If you have \nextremely high medical costs and use itemized deductions for medical \nexpenses to defray your costs, your taxes will go up. If you use a \nflexible spending account, health reimbursement account or health \nsavings account for over-the-counter medicines, your taxes will go up. \nIf you have a flexible spending account, it will be capped and then \nprobably disappear in a few years because of the high-cost plan tax, so \nyour taxes will go up.\n  This bill also creates a new marriage penalty in the Medicare payroll \ntax and uses the money to pay for a brandnew entitlement program. It \nalso imposes a new tax on cosmetic surgery. If a family is forced to \nliquidate a health savings account because of tough economic times, the \ngovernment will confiscate even more money.\n  The bill also imposes new taxes on brand-name drugs, medical devices, \nand health insurance, all of which will increase health care costs and \ndrive up premiums. Now that the government has succeeded in driving up \npremiums, the government will hit you again by taxing high-cost \ninsurance policies. It makes perfect sense--drive up the cost of \ninsurance premiums with new taxes and then tax them again for being too \ncostly.\n  We could have health care reform that reduces health care costs for \nfamilies and businesses. We could have health care reform that didn't \nraid $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare. We could have health care reform \nthat allows people who like the coverage they have to truly keep it. We \ncould have health care reform that doesn't drastically expand \ngovernment spending on health care or push people into government \nprograms. We could have health care reform that does not increase taxes \non the American people at the worst possible time, during a recession. \nWe could have health care reform that is done in the light of day \nrather than behind closed doors.\n  The American people deserve better, and we ought to defeat this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as I understand it, there are a couple \nSenators left, besides myself, Senator Sessions and Senator Burr. There \nmay be others, but I see them at the moment.\n  America's health care system is in a crisis. It is a crisis not just \nfor the 46 million Americans who lack health insurance; it is also a \ncrisis for those who have health insurance but are worried they cannot \nafford to keep it. It is also a crisis for those who are underinsured \nand those who have poor health insurance.\n  Rising health care costs affect families and American businesses. \nThat we know. Health insurance premiums continue to outpace wages and \ninflation by a large margin. Between 1999 and 2008, premiums for \nemployer-sponsored health benefits more than doubled. In that 9-year \nperiod, they increased 117 percent for families and individuals, and \nthey increased 119 percent for employers. In each case, both for \nfamilies and for employers, health insurance premiums doubled. Clearly, \nthat is outpacing wages. I think the margin is 5 or 6 to 1, with \npremiums going up compared with wages for Americans.\n  Health care coverage for the average family now costs more than \n$13,000 a year. If the current trend continues, by 2019, the average \nfamily plan will cost more than $30,000. That is over a 10-year \nperiod--from $13,000 for the average family today to $30,000 that \nfamily will pay then.\n  Annual health spending growth is expected to continue to outpace \naverage annual growth in the overall economy by 2 percent over the next \n10 years. Health care spending is going up faster than the economy is \ngrowing. Add to that the insult, frankly, that this year alone not only \nwould health spending increase 5 percent but GDP is expected to \ndecrease two-tenths of a percent. So the gap is widening even further.\n  Americans spend $4.5 million in health care every minute of every \nday. Think of that. We, in America, spend about $4.5 million in health \ncare every minute. That is $2.5 trillion a year. It is pretty hard for \nanybody to get his or hands around 1 trillion, but we are talking about \n$2.5 trillion that Americans spend on health care every year. Without \nreform, health care expenditures will increase to $4.4 trillion in just \nthe next 9 years. That would be more than one-fifth of our economy. So \nhealth care is taking a bigger and bigger bite out of our economy. \nThese are not just numbers.\n  Every 30 seconds, another American files for bankruptcy after a \nserious health problem. Think of that. Every year, about 1.5 million \nfamilies lose their homes to foreclosure. Why? Because of unaffordable \nmedical costs. In America, nobody should go bankrupt because they are \nsick. That is immoral.\n  These numbers tell us what we have to do. We have to do two things at \nonce. First, our health care reform bill must provide health care for \nmillions of Americans who today don't have health insurance. At the \nsame time, we must reduce the rate of growth in health care spending. \nWe must do both. To be successful, health care reform must rein in the \ncost of health care spending, and we must succeed. Millions of \nAmericans depend on it.\n  Our plan is to reduce the Federal budget deficit by $130 billion over \nthe next 10 years. Think of that. Many have said an economic recovery \nis through health care reform. We have to get control of our deficits. \nOne way to do that is to get control of our health care spending. The \nbill before us now reduces the deficit by $130 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\n  We need to go much further, clearly, but that reduction is sure a lot \nbetter than no reduction. At the same time, our plan would reduce the \nnumber of uninsured by 31 million. It would reduce the number of \nAmericans who are uninsured and, at the same time, we will cut the \nFederal budget deficit. So we are doing both.\n  This bill reins in costs through changes in spending, reforms how \nproviders deliver health care, and it changes the tax treatment of \nhealth care. Savings from this bill are estimated to total $106 billion \nin 2019. The CBO, Congressional Budget Office, which we all rely upon, \nexpects that, in combination, it would increase 10 to 15 percent in the \nnext decade; that is, savings growth, creative savings would grow by \nthat much. That is what CBO says. That is a strong rate of savings. \nThose are all provisions to control the excessive growth in health care \nspending.\n  Our plan also reevaluates the tax treatment of health care. The \ncurrent Tax Code includes numerous health care subsidies and \nincentives. The current tax treatment of certain health care expenses \nencourages people to spend more on health care than they need to. Why? \nBecause there is no limit under the law, none; that is, all employer-\nprovided health care benefits in America today are totally tax free. \nThe more the benefits are, if a company wanted to provide not only a \nCadillac policy but diamond and gold benefits--great benefits--it is \nnot needed tax free. That tends to encourage excessive health care \nspending. These indirect health care costs totalled nearly $200 billion \nin 2008. That makes health care the largest Federal tax expenditure. \nHealth care today is the largest Federal tax expenditure. Our laws \nchanged about 60 years ago and moved in that direction, limiting \nsubsidies for expensive insurance plans. Our bill limits incentives to \noverspend on health care. Our bill will help to slow the growth of \nhealth care spending.\n  Also, the CBO, in a letter they sent to the Congress yesterday, \nconcluded there is about--this provision, the tax on so-called Cadillac \nplans, would result in a reduction in premiums those persons would \notherwise pay--a reduction of, I think, about 5 to 7 percent. There has \nbeen a lot of concern in this body and beyond this body that that \nprovision--the Cadillac plan provision--would raise costs for those \nfolks who have those plans. The CBO concluded that the premiums for \nthose kinds of plans would be reduced, I think, by 5 to 7 percent, \nrather than compared with current law. Several parts of our plan have \nthe effect of reducing costs. I mentioned excess tax on high-cost \ninsurance premiums, and that is a powerful one.\n  Our plan also caps flexible health savings accounts. It puts a cap on \nthem so it is not unlimited. There is no cap, so the Tax Code tends to \nencourage excessive use of that provision.\n  Our plan would also conform with the definition of qualified medical \nexpenses, the definition used by the itemized deduction for medical \nexpenses. That, too, will help.\n  Reducing existing tax expenditures for health care costs is one of \nthe best ways to slow the growth of health care spending. We could use \nour code, all the tools available. Our goal is not only to reduce costs \nbut also improve quality. There are many provisions in the bill that \naccomplish that result, which would improve the quality of health care. \nA lot of people hear us talk about how costly health care in America is \ntoday. It is costly--too costly. There is a lot of waste. We are \nenacting provisions to cut out the waste.\n  I sense some Americans are thinking: Gee, maybe they are going to cut \nmy Medicare benefits and reduce the quality back there in Washington, \nwhere they are worried about excessive health care costs. The exact \nopposite is the case. All the provisions in here enhance the quality of \nhealth care. The list is very long. One that immediately comes to mind \nis additional spending for primary care doctors. We all know they are \nunderpaid in America. They are not taking Medicare patients, and they \nare going out of practice, especially in rural areas. This legislation \nadds 10 percent additional payment to primary care doctors in each of \nthe next 5 years. That will help primary care doctors continue to \npractice.\n  I might mention that health information technology will also help \nimprove quality. There are lots of demonstration projects and pilot \nprojects to improve quality through bundling, care organizations, \nreining in excessive readmission rates some hospitals have. We also \nhave an outfit that compares how drugs work compared with other \nprocedures. All that is going to help address quality.\n  I want folks to know that while we are reducing costs--that is true \nbecause costs have to be reduced--we are also increasing the quality of \nhealth care in America. There are many other incentives in this bill \nthat I don't have time to mention tonight that accomplish that result.\n  In response to the excise tax on high-cost insurance, insurance \ncompanies will offer lower cost plans that fall under the thresholds. I \nthink that is one of the reasons why premiums for those folks will \nfall. This will give consumers a lower cost alternative. These plans \nwill still have the minimum level of benefits that will be required by \nlaw under the health care system.\n  Other changes to the tax treatment of health expenses will also help \nindividuals make more cost-effective health care decisions. For \nexample, our plan would require employers to tell their employees the \nvalue of their health insurance.\n  That reminds me two of the other provisions for increasing \ntransparency so hospitals tell people what they charge for various \nprocedures. I think the same should also apply to physicians so people \nhave a better idea what they will pay or their insurance company will \npay for these procedures.\n  As I said, our plan will require employers to tell their employees \nthe value of their health insurance. This will help people to know how \nmuch they are actually spending.\n  I mentioned changes to flexible savings accounts, health savings \naccounts, and the definition of ``medical expenses.'' That will all \nhelp. It will also help to reduce costs by increasing competition. That \nhas not been mentioned enough on the floor. This bill increases \ncompetition. We all know that in too many of our States, there are too \nfew health insurance companies. In my State of Montana, Blue Cross/Blue \nShield provides at least half the market. There is another company that \nis basically the rest. In some States, Blue Cross has the entire \nmarket. It is wrong. There is not enough competition. The exchange we \nare putting in place will encourage competition.\n  Do you know what else will encourage competition? That is all the \ninsurance market reforms--all of them--telling companies they cannot \ndeny coverage based on a preexisting condition, telling companies they \ncannot rate according to health status, dealing with rules in the \nStates, which means when you go to buy insurances--especially as an \nindividual--there will be competition based on price. Companies will \nbasically offer many of the same products, but they cannot deny \ncoverage for preexisting conditions. The effect of that will be prices \nshould come down because there will be more competition when insurance \ncompanies base it on price.\n  Then there is the public option. That is another addition. That is in \nthis bill. We don't know if it will or not. There are a lot of ways we \nhelp provide competition. It will help more competition, and \ntransparency will help more competition. Competition is going to help \nbring down the costs.\n  Our bill will reduce costs also by reforming health care delivery \nsystem--I mentioned a lot of that already--including how we pay for \ndoctors.\n  The bill is balanced. It finds savings in health care outlays--\nsavings that are realistic, that make sense. It looks to reduce health \ntax expenditures. That is a fancy term for deductions. The bill reduces \nthe Federal deficit in the first 10 years. That point needs to be \ndriven home. This bill reduces the Federal deficit in the first 10 \nyears and the subsequent 10 years will have a positive effect bringing \ndown the budget deficit. In fact, CBO says the second 10 years of our \nplan will cut the deficit by a quarter of a percent of the gross \ndomestic product. That is about $450 billion. That is nearly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in deficit reduction.\n  We need to remember the cost of doing nothing is unacceptable. \nBasically, we have two choices in life: try\n\n[[Page S12063]]\n\nor do nothing. To ask the question is to answer it. Of course, we \ntried. Our Nation is in crisis. We have a health care crisis. It is a \nformidable task. It is exceedingly complex and difficult. But we have \nan obligation to try, at least try, to fix it.\n  If we try, then that poses a second question. If we try, we ask the \nquestion: Do we try our best or not? The answer is obvious: We try our \nbest.\n  This legislation is a combination of a year or two of work by folks \nin the medical profession, of health care economists--Americans who are \ntrying to find ways to get control of costs and improve quality. There \nare not a lot of new ideas here. They are ideas that have been \npercolating around for the last year or two. Some are in Massachusetts, \nsome in other States. Some of it is going into integrated systems, such \nas Geisinger and Intermountain. The idea of bundling is already \npracticed by other institutions. There is not a lot that is terribly \nnew.\n  We are pulling together, we are helping establish a policy in our \ncountry that comes up with a plan, a system in America that allows \ndoctors and patients to have total free choice. They choose. We are \nhelping doctors with the best evidence, the best information so they \ncan focus on the patient care even more than they are now. We are \ncutting down the budget deficits. That is very important. And we are \nalso helping Medicare by extending the solvency of Medicare another 5 \nyears. These are things we pulled together and have to do.\n  I very much hope we can move on and get this legislation passed and \nwork with the House and the President signs a bill that we can start \nfinally putting together something of which we will be very proud. Our \ncountry does not have a health care system today. It is a free-for-all. \nIt is a free-for-all for all kinds of groups. This is the first effort \nto get something together that works, giving doctors and hospitals and \npatients the choice they want to have and they should have. We are also \nbringing costs down and improving quality of health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. It is one of the most well-reasoned \nstatements we have had. And rightfully so. No one worked harder on this \nmatter than Senator Baucus. I appreciate his dedication, hard work, and \nthe way he handles that Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 2:15 p.m. \ntomorrow, Wednesday, December 2, be for debate with respect to the \npending Mikulski amendment and the McCain motion to commit; that during \nthis period, Senator Reid or his designee be recognized to offer an \namendment as a side-by-side to the McCain motion, and Senator Murkowski \nor her designee be recognized to offer an amendment as a side-by-side \nto the Mikulski amendment; that the debate time be divided equally \namong the four principals listed above; that no other amendments or \nmotions to commit be in order during the pendency of these amendments \nand motion; that at 2:15 p.m. tomorrow, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the above noted in the following order; that prior to each \nvote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form, and after the first vote, the remaining votes in the \nsequence be 10 minutes in duration; further, that all amendments and \nmotion provided under this consent require an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold for adoption, and that if those included in the agreement do \nnot achieve that threshold, then the amendments and motion be \nwithdrawn:\n  Mikulski amendment No. 2791; Murkowski amendment regarding preventive \ncare; Reid or designee amendment regarding Medicare; McCain motion to \ncommit regarding Medicare.\n\n  Mr. President, before I put this to a final consent request, let me \nsay, we have been trying to get some votes today. It would be very good \nif we could move this bill along, have some votes tomorrow afternoon. \nWe would have four votes. We have two amendments pending. This, in \nfact, would dispose of those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill have to object, I wish to say to my good friend, the majority \nleader, I thought over the last couple of hours we would be able to get \nconsent to have votes on the Mikulski and Murkowski amendments. But I \nhad indicated to him, and I want to say publicly, that we have a number \nof speakers interested in speaking on the Medicare issue and the McCain \nmotion. So I will not be able to lock in the McCain motion or the side-\nby-side that I gather under this consent request my good friend, the \nmajority leader, may offer.\n  I would still like to be able to get the two votes earlier referred \nto--the Mikulski and Murkowski amendments--but regretfully I cannot \neven lock those in right now. But I want to do that as soon as possible \nso at least we can get those two votes at some point reasonably early \nin the day and turn back to debate on the McCain motion.\n  I might say, we want to vote on the McCain motion. We certainly have \nno desire to delay that vote. But we do have a number of people who \nwant to speak to it. With that understanding and with the point I want \nto make to my good friend that I want to get the two amendments by \nMikulski and Murkowski locked in as soon as possible, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few thoughts as we go \nforward on the health care debate and remind our colleagues what we \nhave been hearing at the town meetings that most of us have been having \naround the country and what people are concerned about.\n  Part of it is they think we don't have a very good perspective on \nwhat is going on in America. They are not happy with us. They think we \nare losing our fiscal minds, that we are ignoring the fact that we are \nfacing a soaring debt. We passed on top of the debt we already had an \n$800 billion stimulus package--$800 billion--the largest spending bill \nin the history of America on top of all our other baseline bills.\n  Our baseline appropriations bills, not even including the additions \nby the stimulus, are showing double-digit increases. These increases \nare far more than President Bush ever had, and he was criticized for \nreckless spending. He never had the kind of baseline spending increases \nthat were passed a few months ago, a few weeks ago in some cases.\n  This year, as of September 30, we acknowledged and accounted for a \n$1.4 trillion budget deficit in 1 year--1 year, $1.4 trillion, \nSeptember 30. The Republicans never had a deficit so large in 1 year. \nAnd in the next year, it is projected to be over $1 trillion, and \ncontinue to average $1 trillion each year over the next 10 years. In \nthe 8th, 9th, and 10th years of the President's 10-year budget, the \ndeficit goes up. It does not ever go down, it continues to go up. \nTherefore, we end up with a huge debt. That is according to our own \nCongressional Budget Office hired by the Congress--approved by the \nmajority of our colleagues who are, of course, Democrats. They approve \nthe Budget Director, and he tries to do a pretty good job of giving us \nhonest numbers.\n  This is what the numbers show. In 2008, we had $5.8 trillion in debt \nin America since the founding of the Republic. By 2013, 5 years down \nthe road, that will double to $11.8 trillion. And in 10 years, the 10-\nyear budget the President submitted to us--I did not submit this \nbudget, President Obama submitted it and it was passed by the \nCongress--increases that debt to $17.3 trillion, tripling the debt of \nAmerica in 10 years. That is what the people are very concerned about, \namong other things.\n  What does all this pending mean also? It means government power, \ngovernment reach, government domination, government takeover. People \nare concerned about it. They are asking: Are you not getting the \nmessage? What is the matter with you? That is what I am hearing. I \nthink people have a right to be concerned.\n\n  One of the issues I have raised is the fact that the interest on the \ndebt in 2009 was $170 billion for 1 year--that is for interest alone. \nBy 2019, interest on the debt, according to CBO, in 1 year, will be \n$799 billion. That number is higher than the budget for defense. It is \nlarger than any other program. We\n\n[[Page S12064]]\n\nspend about $100 billion a year on education, and $40 or so billion on \nhighways. But in 10 years, we will be spending $800 billion on interest \nalone. And how much of that is owned by foreign governments, many of \nwhom are not our friends and not our allies?\n  So even the President has said this debt is unsustainable. The \neconomists say it is unsustainable. Every politician I know of says \nthat it is unsustainable. Yet we continue outrageous spending, and in \nthe midst of this financial tempest, what do we now have before us? The \npromise of a $2.5 trillion new health care program--$2.5 trillion as it \nwill cost when fully implemented.\n  The question I have heard asked of the President, and I have heard \nasked of the Democratic leadership and the Congress: But, Congressman, \nSenator, we don't have the money. What do you say about that?\n  They say: Oh, don't worry. We have this great new program that is \ngoing to help you in so many ways. We are going to spend a lot of \nmoney, true, but it is going to be deficit neutral. My goodness, it is \nnot even going to be budget neutral, it is going to save us $130 \nbillion in 10 years. Will you guys just relax? Don't worry about it. We \nare going to save $130 billion. Thank us. We are going to give you this \nprogram, save $130 billion, and you will get a lot more health care out \nhere--still with 24 million uninsured, but we will have a lot of money \nspent to help you with your health insurance, they will say.\n  The President said he would not sign a bill into law that would add \none single dime to the national debt. Well, people say: How are you \ngoing to do that? That sounds pretty good, if we can make that happen. \nHow are we going to do it? Well, the answer is we are going to raid \nMedicare, we are going to raise taxes, and we are not going to pay the \ndoctors who do our work. There will be $494 billion in tax increases, \n$465 billion in Medicare cuts--and Medicare is already on a glide path \nto insolvency by 2017--and a $250 billion shortfall for our physicians. \nThose are payments they have been promised and they thought they were \ngoing to get as part of this fix.\n  So I would just make the point that we can give everyone in America a \nnew car if we just raised taxes and raided Medicare. That would be \npretty easy, wouldn't it? Anything can count as deficit-neutral if you \nraise taxes high enough. So this is not a deficit-neutral program. Just \nbecause we raise taxes, does it have to be that we should prioritize \nfirst to use that money to start a new program? What about addressing \nthe shortfall in highway funding that we are hearing so much about? \nWhat about the cost of our effort in Afghanistan? What about other \nexpenses we have? What about saving Medicare, a program our seniors \ndepend on? If we are going to raise taxes, why don't we use the money \nfor that? Who says we have to raise taxes to start a new program?\n  Well, I suggest to you that based on the omission of doctors fix \nalone we don't have a $130 billion surplus in this bill. The fact that \nit is unpaid for, we have a $130 billion net deficit because the bill \nfails to pay $250 billion in doctor fees that I predict we will \neventually pay, one way or another. The way we have done it in the past \nis we have just socked it to the debt. We have just paid the doctors, \nraised no revenue, and changed the law. We have just paid them and \nincreased our debt that much each year.\n  So I say these are not sound numbers. I am telling you, the American \npeople's instincts are right about this. We are not being responsible \nabout how we manage the people's business, promising that this bill is \ngoing to be better for everybody. But let me ask for the average \nAmerican who is doing the right thing, who is struggling and scraping \ntogether money to make insurance premiums each month, will that person \npay less for their health care? CBO basically says no. If that \nindividual is not in an employer-provided group plan already, if he's \namong those who are already paying the highest costs for health care in \nthe country, then he is one of the people who are going to pay as much \nas 10 to 13 percent more under this bill than he currently pays.\n  Will health care, as a percentage of our total economy, our total \nGDP, will it be reduced by this bill, therefore getting more health \ncare at a better cost? Not according to the scoring we have seen. In \nfact, just the opposite is the case. If this bill passes, a larger \npercentage of our GDP will go to health care than before.\n  So I just raise concerns. This is a plan to create an entirely new \ngovernment-dominated health care plan. This is a new program. How are \nwe going to do it? By raiding Medicare, raising taxes, and not paying \ndoctors, among a bunch of other flimflammery that is in the bill. We \ntalk about this public option. Well, Senator Baucus says we may not \nhave a public option. It is in the House bill, and it is in this bill \nthat is on the Senate floor.\n  So we don't have the money for a monumental new health care program. \nWe could do a lot of things to improve health care in America that \ncould help contain the rising cost of health care, that could be done \nin a way that would not diminish the circumstances we are in today. \nWhat about Medicare? Do you remember when President Bush proposed \nfixing Social Security and many Senators--Democrats as well as \nRepublicans--said: Well, President Bush, if you want to do something, \nwhy don't you fix Medicare? That is the one in the biggest trouble?\n  In truth, Medicare is sinking faster than Social Security. Medicare \nwill decline by 2017 and go into deficit. We have a shortfall in \nMedicare now. What we should do is focus on Medicare every way that we \ncan to create efficiencies and more productivity, contain growth and \ncost and extend that period of time before it goes in default. The last \nthing we should be doing is taking $465 billion from Medicare. It is \nonly going to accelerate its decline. That is common sense.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to read a letter I received from one \nof my constituents--Mr. Bill Eberle in Huntsville, AL. He said:\n\n       I strongly urge you to vote against the health care bill \n     passed by the House. The worst part of this bill is that much \n     of the cost will be paid by cuts to Medicare. I am 68 years \n     old, and I have paid into Medicare for 40 years believing \n     that it would cover much of my health care costs when I \n     became 65. Now I am being told that the government has found \n     people who need coverage more than I do, and they will cut \n     the care for which I have paid for 40 years in order to cover \n     people who have paid nothing. It is not the government's \n     money. The money belongs to those of us who have paid into it \n     for so many years and we are watching as it is being taken \n     from us.\n\n  Well, I think that is a pretty fair statement of it. Medicare is \nheading to insolvency in 2017. We have had a number of proposals to try \nto help on that front. We haven't had much support from our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle even for modest fixes.\n  I remember one bill that was going to reduce Medicare spending by $10 \nbillion over 5 years, and you would have thought we were going to \nsavage the whole program, although we were trying to make it more \nsustainable in the long run. It was a big mess. But now we are talking \nabout $465 billion being taken from Medicare.\n  So, Mr. President, Medicare is a big problem. We need to work hard to \nbring it under control and honor our seniors who have been paying into \nthis program and not drawing a dime from it on the promise that when \nthey turned 65 they would start being able to draw on Medicare and it \nwould take care of their health care needs in their senior years. That \nwas a solemn commitment. Before we start some monumental new program, \nwe need to make sure we are prepared to honor that commitment because \nthey paid their money. They have paid their money. So if we raise \ntaxes, why shouldn't we pay the Medicare bill first? If we raise taxes, \nwhy shouldn't we pay our doctors the money we owe them or some of the \nother priorities that we have in our country?\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly that the American people are sending \nus the right message. They are acting like good public-minded citizens \nwould. They are seeing a reckless new spending program that they \nrightly anticipate will grow and grow and grow and expand far beyond \nall the projections we have today; that it will result in a government \ntakeover of a whole large portion of our economy, and they have not \nbeen impressed that the government can run these kinds of things very \neffectively and they are not in\n\n[[Page S12065]]\n\nfavor of it. So they are rightly concerned, and that is why polling \nnumbers show the American people don't favor this legislation.\n  I think their instincts are right. I think we should listen to them.\n  I appreciate the effort to improve health care in America. I support \na number of reform provisions, some of which are in this bill, but \nothers could be a part of this bill to make health care more \naffordable, more effective, and help people who are having a hard time \nfinancing their insurance premiums. But the truth is, the bill doesn't \nreally reduce the premium cost for most people. Many people who are \npaying their bills today are not going to get any reduction. In fact, \nthey may see an increase. So for these reasons, I oppose the \nlegislation, I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe Senator Durbin may be coming to \nthe floor. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, all day, we have been debating the \nhealth care reform bill, which has been a matter worked on in the \nSenate and the House for a solid year. I wish to salute the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, who joined with several other Senators in, I \nunderstand, 61 separate meetings talking about this bill, in an effort \nwhich did not bear fruit as they hoped but was a bipartisan effort to \ncome up with some solution to our health care situation in America. I \nhope we can still reach some bipartisan accommodation before this bill \npasses.\n  At this point in time, only one Republican Senator has voted for any \nform of Senate health care reform and that was Senator Snowe in the \nSenate Finance Committee. We hope others will join us before this bill \ncomes to final passage in the Senate, but that is the reality of the \npolitical situation.\n  The bill before us is over 2,000 pages long. Some have criticized its \nlength. I defy anyone to write down, in 2,000 pages or less, a \ndescription of the current medical system in America. I think it would \ntake many more pages to explain the complexity of the situation. But \npeople across America understand a few basics.\n  Health insurance is reaching the point where it is not affordable. \nFamilies cannot afford to pay for it anymore, businesses cannot. Fewer \npeople have coverage at their workplace, and many who go out into the \nopen market cannot afford to pay the premiums. Today we have reached a \npoint where our COBRA plan, which is health insurance for those who \nhave lost their job--we provided a helping hand to many unemployed \npeople across America--it expired today. It picked up two-thirds of the \npremiums. I ran into people who said, even with the two-thirds picked \nup by the Federal Government, I still cannot afford it. So it is \nunderstandable that health insurance is no longer affordable, and it is \nnot getting any better.\n  In the last 10 years, health insurance premiums have gone up 131 \npercent. We estimate that, in the next 8 years, the cost of health \ninsurance will double. In 8 years, it is anticipated that families will \nspend up to 45 percent of their income on health insurance. That is not \nsustainable.\n  So the starting point is to find ways to bring down cost. The \nCongressional Budget Office gave us a report yesterday and said we are \non the right track. I can come up with other ideas which I think might \nbe more helpful, but this is the art of the possible. I think we are \nmoving toward a model which will start to bring down costs.\n  The second thing we do that is critically important is, we expand \ncoverage so it reaches 94 percent of Americans. Currently, there are \nabout 50 million Americans without health insurance. These are people \nwho are unemployed, folks who work at businesses that cannot afford \nhealth insurance or folks out on their own who cannot afford to pay for \ntheir own health insurance. We now reach a point with this bill where \n94 percent of Americans have coverage. That is a good thing.\n  We also do it in a fiscally responsible way because this bill, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, which is the neutral \nreferee in this battle, according to that office, we will save, in the \nfirst 10 years of this bill, $130 billion or more from our deficit. It \nwill be the biggest deficit reduction of any bill considered by \nCongress. In the second 10 years, they estimate $650 billion in \nsavings. To think we have $\\3/4\\ trillion dollars in deficit reduction \nin this health care reform says to me, in the eyes of the Congressional \nBudget Office and most observers, it is a fiscally responsible bill.\n  There is a section of the bill which I think is critically important \ntoo. Many people with health insurance find out that when they need it \nthe most it is not there. The health insurance companies will deny \ncoverage, saying they are dealing with preexisting conditions that were \nnot covered, there is a cap on the amount they will pay, your child is \nnow age 24 and is not covered by your family plan. All these things are \nexcuses for health insurance companies to say no. When they say no, \nthey make more money. We start eliminating, one by one, these perverse \nincentives for health insurance companies to say no.\n  We give consumers and families across America a fighting chance, when \nthey actually need health insurance, that it will be there. Two out of \nthree people filing for bankruptcy today in America file because of \nmedical bills. That reflects the reality, that we are each one accident \nor one diagnosis away from a medical bill that could wipe out our life \nsavings. The sad reality is 74 percent of people filing for bankruptcy \nbecause of health care bills have health insurance, and it turns out it \nis not worth anything. When they needed it, it failed them.\n\n  We need to move to a point where the health insurance companies are \nheld accountable, where when you pay premiums for a lifetime, the \npolicy is there to cover you when you need it. That is what this is \nabout.\n  We eliminate some of the most egregious discrimination in insurance \npremiums. The insurance industry is one of two businesses in America \nexempt from antitrust laws. So they literally get together, they \ncollude and conspire when it comes to setting premium costs and \nallocating markets, and they can do it legally under the McCarran-\nFerguson Act. Because of that, what they have done is to create \ndiscrimination against some people--women, certain age groups, people \nliving in certain places--when it comes to premiums. We eliminate, by \nand large--not completely but by and large--this type of \ndiscrimination.\n  The other point that has been raised repeatedly is about Medicare. \nThere is a pending amendment by Senator McCain. As a Democrat, we take \ngreat pride in Medicare. It was a Democratic President, Lyndon Baines \nJohnson, who led a Democratic Congress in passing it. Very few, if any, \nRepublicans supported it. Over the years, it has been a program we have \nstood behind as a party because we believe it has provided so much \nwell-being for 45 million American, now today, seniors.\n  This bill starts to move us toward a place where you can basically \nsay there is a sound economic footing for Medicare in the future. If we \ndon't do something today, in 7, 8, or 9 years, the Medicare Program \ncould go bankrupt. If we wait 5 years to do it, imagine what we will \nhave to do then.\n  This bill moves in the direction of making Medicare more sound by \neliminating some of the waste that is currently in the program.\n  There was a time when our friends on the other side joined us in \nsaying this program could be more efficient. But now the McCain \namendment says basically there should be no cuts in Medicare, even if \nthe cut is in wasteful spending. Senator McCain has a strong record on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, but I think his amendment goes too far \nwhen it comes to Medicare. I hope that we can defeat it or that he will \nreconsider it.\n  The last point I want to make is that this debate will continue. We \nhope to move to amendments. If we get to a point where we are dealing \nwith filibusters and slowdowns in an effort to run out the clock and \nmake us all leave on Christmas Eve with the job not finished, many of \nus are going to get tired\n\n[[Page S12066]]\n\nof that approach. If there are honest amendments offered in good faith, \ndebated, and brought for a vote, that is what the Senate is about. But \nif we continue to delay indefinitely the consideration of these \namendments, our patience will grow thin, and we will have to move this \ntoward a point where the bill is honestly considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12066-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 301 of S. Con. Res. 13, the 2010 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, aggregates, and \nother appropriate levels and limits in the resolution, and make \nadjustments to the pay-as-you-go scorecard, for legislation that is \ndeficit-neutral over 11 years, reduces excess cost growth in health \ncare spending, is fiscally responsible over the long term, and fulfills \nat least one of eight other conditions listed in the reserve fund.\n  I have already made one adjustment pursuant to section 301(a) on \nNovember 21, for S.A. 2786, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3590. I now \nfile further changes to S. Con. Res. 13 pursuant to section 301(a) for \nS.A. 2791, an amendment to clarify provisions relating to first dollar \ncoverage for preventive services for women. I find that that in \nconjunction with S.A. 2786, this amendment also satisfies the \nconditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund to transform and \nmodernize American's health care system. Therefore, pursuant to section \n301(a), I am further revising the aggregates in the 2010 budget \nresolution, as well as the allocation to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on a subject that \nmany Members of Congress--Democrats and Republicans--have had an \nabiding interest in over the years.\n  Throughout this week, delegates from countries around the world will \ngather in Cartagena, Colombia, to participate in the Second Review \nConference of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on \nTheir Destruction.\n  The Cartagena review conference would have been the perfect \nopportunity for the Obama administration to announce its intention to \njoin the 156 other nations that are parties to the treaty, including \nour coalition allies in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In fact, every member of NATO and every country in our hemisphere, \nexcept Cuba, is a party to the treaty. The United States is one of only \n37 countries that have not joined, along with Russia and China.\n  By announcing our intention to join the treaty in Cartagena, this \nadministration would have signaled to the rest of the world that the \nUnited States is finally showing the leadership that has been wanting \non these indiscriminate weapons that maim and kill thousands of \ninnocent people every year.\n  The U.S. military is the most powerful in the world. Yet we have seen \nhow civilian casualties in Afghanistan have become one of the most \nurgent and pressing concerns of our military commanders, where bombs \nthat missed their targets and other mistakes have turned the populace \nagainst us.\n  Despite this, one of the arguments the Pentagon makes for resisting \ncalls to join the Mine Ban Treaty is to preserve its option to use \nlandmines in Afghanistan, even though we have not used these \nindiscriminate weapons since 1991.\n  Since the Pentagon has never voluntarily given up any weapon, \nincluding poison gas, which President Woodrow Wilson renounced in 1925, \nperhaps this is to be expected.\n  But can anyone imagine the United States using landmines in \nAfghanistan, a country where more civilians have been killed or \nhorribly injured from mines than any other in history?\n  A country which, like our coalition partners, is itself a party to \nthe treaty?\n  A country where if we used mines and civilians were killed or injured \nthe public outcry in Afghanistan and around the world would be \ndeafening?\n  Can anyone imagine this President, who has been awarded the Nobel \nPeace Prize which only a few years ago was awarded to the International \nCampaign to Ban Landmines, having to publicly defend such a decision?\n  I wonder if anyone at the Pentagon has thought of the military and \npolitical implications of that.\n  Last Tuesday, the State Department spokesman announced that the \nadministration had completed a review on its landmine policy and had \ndecided to continue supporting the Bush administration's policy, which \nwas, in key aspects, a retreat from the policy of President Clinton.\n  This was a surprise to me and others, as I had encouraged the \nadministration to conduct such a review and then heard nothing for \nmonths. In fact, I had spoken personally with President Obama about it \njust a few weeks before.\n  I did not hesitate to express my disappointment, as did many others. \nThereafter the State Department corrected itself, and announced that a \n``comprehensive review'' is continuing and reaffirmed its earlier \ndecision to send a team of observers to the Cartagena review conference \nthis week.\n  It is unfortunate that the State Department spokesman misspoke. \nHowever, the administration's approach to\n\n[[Page S12067]]\n\nthis issue until this past weekend had been cursory, half-hearted, and \ndeeply disappointing to those of us who expected a serious, thorough \nreexamination of this issue.\n  One hopes that an administration that portrays itself as a global \nleader on issues of humanitarian law and arms control recognizes this \nis an opportunity.\n  A serious review should begin by examining the extensive history of \nthe negotiations that led to the treaty, and the technical issues that \nwere debated and addressed.\n  It should involve consulting our allies, like Great Britain and \nCanada, whose militaries have operated in accordance with the treaty's \nobligations for a decade, including with our forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, to determine what their experience has been.\n  It should involve consulting with the Pentagon, of course, but also \nwith retired senior U.S. military officers and diplomats, many of whom \nhave expressed support for the treaty.\n  It should involve consulting with Members of Congress, and with the \nhumanitarian and arms control communities who have extensive expertise \non all aspects of the treaty and its implementation.\n  Unfortunately, none of these obvious steps was taken. Instead, an \nopaque process involving limited consultations with the Pentagon simply \nresulted in a regurgitation of the Bush administration's talking \npoints.\n  That is not what we expected of this administration, and I welcome \nthe announcement that a comprehensive review will be carried out.\n  The United States has not exported anti-personnel mines since 1992.\n  We have not produced anti-personnel mines since 1997.\n  And the United States has not used anti-personnel mines since 1991--\nwhen many of them malfunctioned.\n  In effect, we have been in de facto compliance with the treaty for 18 \nyears, with the exception of not yet destroying our stockpile of mines.\n  And in the interim we have invested millions of dollars to develop \nalternatives to indiscriminate landmines, to replace them with \nmunitions that include man-in-the-loop technology, so they are not \nvictim-activated.\n  Indiscriminate landmines, whether persistent mines or those that are \ndesigned to self-destruct or deactivate, are nothing more than booby \ntraps. They cannot distinguish between an enemy combatant, a U.S. \nsoldier, a young child, or a woman out collecting firewood. They do not \nbelong in the arsenal of any modern military.\n  I have supported President Obama and I look forward to supporting him \non many issues in the future. I believe this can be one of those \nissues.\n  I am confident that after a proper review is conducted, and the \nPresident considers the equities, he will conclude, as our allies have, \nthat the humanitarian benefits of banning anti-personnel landmines far \nexceed their limited military utility. Ultimately, this is a decision \nPresident Obama will need to make himself, as President Wilson did \nalmost a century ago.\n  I want to commend the Government of Colombia, a country where \nlandmines have taken and continue to take a terrible toll on civilians, \nfor hosting the review conference. Colombia joined the treaty years \nago.\n  I also appreciate that the State Department has sent a team of \nobservers to Cartagena. I hope they use this opportunity not only to \nhighlight the hundreds of millions of dollars the U.S. has provided for \nhumanitarian demining and assistance for mine victims over the years, \nbut also to learn from the delegations of countries that are parties to \nthe treaty.\n  I want to pay tribute to the leadership of Canada, and my friend \nLloyd Axworthy, who as Foreign Minister showed the extraordinary vision \nand leadership that culminated in the Mine Ban Treaty, and to the other \nnations that have joined since then.\n  The treaty has already exceeded the expectations of even its \nstrongest advocates. The number of mine casualties has decreased \nsignificantly. The number of countries producing and exporting mines \nhas plummeted.\n  And at the same time, none of the arguments of the treaty's naysayers \nhave come to pass.\n  The United States is the most powerful nation on Earth. We don't need \nthese indiscriminate weapons any more than our allies who have \nabandoned them.\n  We have not used landmines for many years. We should be leading this \neffort, not sitting on the sidelines.\n  It is time for the United States to join the right side of history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12067-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12067-S12068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANTI-KLEPTOCRACY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on November 16, 2009, the New York Times \npublished an article entitled ``A U.S. Visa, Shouts of Corruption, \nBarrels of Oil,'' that describes corruption in Equatorial Guinea, which \nis a major oil producing country. Specifically, the article highlights \nthe comings and goings of Teodoro Obiang, son of Equatorial Guinea's \nPresident, who is also the country's agriculture minister.\n  Mr. Obiang has been a regular traveler to southern California, where \nhe owns an estate reportedly worth some $35 million. He also, according \nto the article, owns a private jet and various luxury automobiles.\n  How, one might ask, did he acquire such extraordinary wealth, in a \ncountry where many children die before the age of 5? Perhaps he is an \nexceptionally talented businessman, as Equatorial Guinea's Washington \nlobbyists have suggested, who, when he isn't running the agriculture \nministry on a modest government salary, is earning huge profits that \ncan be legitimately explained. It is fair to say that at least, and \nprobably more, likely is that he has used his family connections to \nsteer a portion of the country's oil revenues into his own pockets.\n  Mr. Obiang's case is not unique. To the contrary, it is a common \npractice in countries where the extraction of natural resources--\nwhether oil, gas, timber, or minerals--is the primary source of income. \nFrom Angola to Kazakhstan, government officials and their families have \nabused their power and influence to enrich themselves by siphoning off \na portion of the proceeds of the revenues from concessions and leases \nfor the extraction of natural resources, and from the sale of the crude \noil or raw timber or minerals.\n  Billions of dollars that could otherwise have been used to meet the \nbasic needs of the people in these countries--health and education--\nhave instead gone into foreign bank accounts, including in the United \nStates. The beneficiaries have enjoyed lives of comfort and privilege, \nwhile their people live in squalor.\n  The land where oil is drilled, or where gold, cobalt, columbite-\ntantalite, and other valuable minerals are mined, or where the forest \nis cut down, is often left in ruins. Soil and water poisoned by oil \nspills and other toxic chemicals, and drought from deforestation, is \nleft for those who have nowhere else to live, and for future \ngenerations.\n  It is often also the revenues from the exploitation of natural \nresources that fund the purchase of weapons that fuel civil wars over \ncontrol of those same resources in these counties. The protracted \nconflict in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nwhere thousands of civilians, and particularly women and girls, have \nbeen brutalized, is a prime example.\n  Those who have protested this type of corruption, environmental \ndestruction and waste, and exposed the theft by government officials of \nincome from natural resources that is rightfully owed to the people of \nthese countries, have often been harassed, arrested, tortured, and even \nkilled. I remember Ken Saro-Wiwa, who courageously led peaceful \nprotests against the environmental devastation caused by oil spills and \ngas flaring in Nigeria's delta region. He was ultimately hanged, \ndespite last minute appeals from people around the world, by the \ncorrupt and cruel dictator Sani Abacha. That was in 1995, but the \ncorruption, waste, and abuses continue today in countries where too \noften the rule of law does not apply to those in power.\n  In 2004, President Bush issued Presidential Proclamation 7750, which \nsuspended entry to the U.S. of current and former public officials \nwhose corrupt acts have or had serious adverse effects on the national \ninterests of the United States.\n  In 2007, I included a similar but more targeted provision in the \nState and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, currently section 7086 \nof Public\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\nLaw 111-8, which requires the Secretary of State to deny admission to \nthe United States to any foreign government official and their \nimmediate family members who the Secretary has credible evidence have \nbeen involved in corruption related to the extraction of natural \nresources.\n  The purpose of the law is clear: If you, as a government official or \na member of your immediate family, are involved in the corrupt \nexploitation of natural resources, you are not welcome in the United \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, despite, I believe, well-intentioned people at the \nState Department who support the goals of the law, it has not been \napplied as vigorously as it could and should be.\n  They do not have the resources to conduct their own investigations, \nso they rely on other agencies like the Departments of Justice and \nHomeland Security, which do not always share information and have their \nown standards of proof. The fact that someone like Mr. Obiang is \ntraveling freely to and from the United States, I believe makes a \nmockery of the law.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Senators of both parties have spoken \nout about the corrosive effects of corruption. We saw the effects of it \nin our own assistance program in Iraq, where no-bid contracts and lax \noversight resulted in enormous fraud and waste of taxpayer funds, and \nwe are witnessing the effects of rampant corruption in the Afghan \nGovernment.\n  It is overdue for the State Department to apply section 7086 with the \nvigor that Congress intended. It is about promoting good governance, \nthe rule of law, the sustainable use of natural resources, and stopping \nthe squandering of revenues from the extraction of those resources that \nare urgently needed to help reduce poverty. It is time to apply the law \nin a manner that resonates far and wide in support of each of those \ngoals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12068-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ELIMINATING THE TERROR GAP\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the shootings at Fort \nHood, TX, law enforcement officials and policymakers continue to piece \ntogether the string of events that preceded this tragedy. Although \ninvestigations of the shootings are in the early stages, a number of \ntroubling details have already come to light. In December 2008, Major \nHasan became the subject of a Joint Terrorism Task Force, JTTF, \ninvestigation after intelligence agencies intercepted his e-mail \ncommunication with a known radical cleric, Anwar al-Awlaki. After \nreviewing the e-mails and concluding that Major Hasan was not engaged \nin terrorist activities, the JTTF investigator and supervisor did not \nshare the information regarding Major Hasan, and he was not placed on a \nterrorist watch list. While the lack of information sharing between the \nJTTF and other agencies is problematic, it is just as alarming to see \nthat the Federal Government would have been unable to prohibit Major \nHasan's firearm purchase even if he had been flagged on a terrorist \nwatch list. Again, even if a gun background check had revealed that \nMajor Hasan was on a terrorist watch list, nothing in current law could \nhave prohibited the firearm transfer unless he fell into another \ndisqualifying category. In other words, being on a terrorist watch list \ndoes not prevent someone from purchasing a gun.\n  This ``terror gap'' in Federal law that prevents the Federal \nGovernment from stopping the sale of firearms or explosives to a known \nor suspected terrorist must be eliminated. To close this loophole, I \nsupport S.1317, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous \nTerrorists Act, which was introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg, D-NJ. \nI am a cosponsor of this common-sense legislation because it would \nauthorize the Attorney General to deny the transfer of a firearm when \nan FBI background check reveals that the prospective purchaser is a \nknown or suspected terrorist and the Attorney General has a reasonable \nbelief that the purchaser may use the firearm in connection with \nterrorism. To protect the rights of American citizens, this bill would \ndirect the Attorney General to issue guidelines describing when the \nauthority to deny gun purchases could be used, and it would protect the \nprivate information contained in the terrorist watch lists. This \nlegislation also includes due-process safeguards that would allow any \nindividual whose firearms or explosives license application has been \ndenied to bring legal action to challenge the denial.\n  I have long supported sensible gun safety laws and strict enforcement \nof those laws to help stem the tide of crimes committed with firearms. \nI believe Congress can and should pursue legislative solutions to \nprevent gun violence, and that includes passing legislation that \neliminates the ``terror gap.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12068-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12068-S12069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUILD AMERICA BONDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a great success story \nthat not a lot of people have heard about. It is the story of a program \nthat's helping create jobs and solve a lot of problems at the same \ntime. It is the story of Build America Bonds.\n  These bonds came about from a piece of legislation I introduced last \nyear as a way to shore up our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, and, \nat the same time, put people back to work.\n  In my home State of Oregon, infrastructure projects have proven to be \nan economic engine. People get back to work building a bridge, for \nexample, and all the businesses near the construction site get more \nactivity from the people who need their services. Then, once the \nproject is finished, private investment follows that public investment. \nThat bridge makes it easier for folks to get to work or take their kids \nto school, and communities grow.\n  Now, when I initially proposed Build America Bonds, I thought they \nwould sell $10 billion worth, but the most recent report on the bonds \nhas shown they are selling like hotcakes. Build America Bonds dollars \nare flowing into local communities, creating jobs and helping to \nstrengthen America's infrastructure.\n  To date more than $50 billion worth of these innovative bonds have \nfunded hundreds of projects in 38 States: fixing our roads and bridges, \nrebuilding our schools, and upgrading our utilities.\n  For example, in Oregon's Dayton School District they have already \nused Build America Bonds to employ up to 150 people building and \nremodeling classrooms. By using Build America Bonds, the school \ndistrict saved an estimated $1.2 million in interest costs.\n  The city of De Pere, WI, was able to use Build America Bonds and \nlower its financing cost by 2.3 percent, allowing it to move forward \nwith plans to upgrade roads, sewers, and buildings. The city's finance \ndirector, Joseph G. Zegers, told Business Week magazine that without \nBuild America Bonds, ``some projects might not be done,'' and ``There \nwould be less employment.''\n  Recently, the CBO highlighted other benefits from Build America \nBonds. In an October report, the CBO found that tax-credit bonds, like \nBuild America Bonds, can be more cost-effective than tax-exempt bonds. \nThe report also concluded that because these bonds are more attractive \nto investors they are more efficient at raising capital.\n  Not only are these funds being raised efficiently, they are being put \nto work quickly. Due to Federal spending guidelines, all bond funds \nmust be spent within 2 years of the bond being issued. This means that \nmoney is not only flowing into projects, it is being spent in the short \nterm, funding projects and putting people back to work with little \ndelay.\n  Before these bonds started being issued, the market for normal \nmunicipal bonds was frozen. It was very hard to sell municipal bonds, \nbut that didn't mean the need for financing infrastructure wasn't still \nthere.\n  Build America Bonds have changed that.\n  These bonds provide the option of a tax credit to investors or \nFederal subsidy to issuers of 35 percent of the interest earned over \nthe life of the bond. This has proven to be a strong incentive and \nopened up new markets for State and local governments, giving \nfinanciers a new and profitable opportunity to invest in America.\n  Build America Bonds have also gained support from the private sector, \nincluding the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of \nManufacturers.\n  While this program has given local governments a powerful new tool in \nfighting the recession, time is running\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\nout. These bonds can only be issued until the end of 2010 and I urge \ncommunities to take advantage of this landmark program. Although there \nis no limit on the number or amount of bonds that can be issued, the \nclock is ticking and the end of 2010 will be here before you know it.\n  I am not surprised that Build America Bonds are reinventing the \nmunicipal bond market. They are a good deal for investors and our \ncommunities. They have freed up financing for badly needed \ninfrastructure construction, and ensured long-term economic growth.\n  I would also like to highlight the Recovery Zone Build America Bonds \nprogram. Recovery Zone Bonds are much like Build America Bonds but are \ndesigned to help communities most adversely affected by the recent \nrecession.\n  These highly targeted bonds offer an even more generous subsidy of 45 \npercent of the interest to investors. Treasury allocates these bonds \nbased on employment declines in 2008. So, the harder an area is hit, \nthe more Recovery Zone Bonds it can issue, creating jobs where they are \nneeded most.\n  In some cases, these bonds will make the difference between whether \nthese projects come to fruition or not. In other cases, they will lower \nthe cost of projects and allow the community to reinvest those savings \nin other projects.\n  As with Build America Bonds, Recovery Zone Bonds will only be issued \nuntil the end of 2010. That is why I am encouraging communities facing \nhigh unemployment to take advantage of the billions of dollars \navailable in Recovery Zone Bonds.\n  I also encourage my colleagues in Congress to begin working now to \ncontinue the success of Build America Bonds. As Congress struggles to \nfind funding for a new transportation bill, innovative approaches like \nBuild America Bonds should be part of the solution.\n  The Build America and Recovery Zone Bond programs are working. They \nare providing much needed jobs to folks in our communities while \nstrengthening essential infrastructure. They have given investors a \nprofitable opportunity to invest in America. They are giving our \nchildren better schools, building energy efficient power grids, \nproviding cleaner water and better roads. In short, they work.\n  Build America Bonds are examples of how Congress can innovate \ncreative solutions to rebuild our country and our economy. I urge my \ncolleagues and our constituents to use them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12069-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ANNE SLAUGHTER ANDREW\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I thank you very much for allowing me to \nexpress my support for Anne Slaughter Andrew.\n  The strong relationship between the United States and Costa Rica is \none of mutual respect, shared democratic principles, and a commitment \nto protecting Costa Rica's abundant natural resources. Costa Rica is a \nworldwide leader in green energy and sustainability--it currently \ngenerates more than 90 percent of its electricity from sustainable \nsources and has committed to being carbon neutral by 2021.\n  In recommending my fellow Hoosier, Ms. Andrew, I have the benefit of \nbeing able to speak from personal experience. When I was Governor of \nIndiana, I appointed her to the Indiana Natural Resources Council, an \norganization which engages in the conservation of Indiana's natural \nresources and park lands. That is one of many positions in Ms. Andrew's \nprofessional life that demonstrates her strong commitment to \nenvironmental conservation and clean energy initiatives.\n  Although Costa Rica covers only 0.01 percent of the Earth's landmass, \nit is home to approximately 5 percent of the Earth's biodiversity. The \nUnited States is committed to protecting this biodiversity through \nconservation efforts that contribute to the stabilization of Costa \nRica's economy.\n  Ms. Andrew's leadership and involvement with The Nature Conservatory, \nTNC, in multiple capacities, including as a member of the President's \nAdvisory Council, has spanned a decade and is a strong testament to her \nunwavering commitment to the preservation of Costa Rica's--and our \nplanet's--natural resources.\n  Her most recent endeavor as principal of New Energy Nexus has placed \nher at the cutting edge of the clean energy economy. These combined \nexperiences render her uniquely qualified to represent the United \nStates as it looks to strengthen partnerships with Costa Rica in the \nfield of green energy initiatives. Her service also includes founding \nand directing Anson Group LLC, a biotech consulting company that she \nco-led towards sustained growth and national recognition.\n  The post of Ambassador to Costa Rica carries with it the significant \nresponsibility of managing the diplomatic personnel in country and \noverseeing the safety of the estimated 1 million Americans who visit \nCosta Rica each year and the thousands of Americans who live there full \ntime. In her career, Ms. Andrew has demonstrated herself to be a \nskilled manager who is highly capable of undertaking this \nresponsibility.\n  I have confidence that Ms. Andrew, if confirmed, will uphold our \ncountry's strong relations with Costa Rica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12069-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD AIDS AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, today is World AIDS Awareness Day. We \ndedicate this day to educating Americans and citizens all over the \nworld about the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and promoting awareness and \nprevention of this disease.\n  Despite advances in medical technology and treatment options, racial \nand ethnic minorities and young gay men continue to suffer in \ndisproportionate numbers. African Americans account for 12 percent of \nthe U.S. population, but make up almost half of the 1 million Americans \nliving with HIV/AIDS. Black youth and young adults between the ages of \n13 to 24 make up 55 percent of all reported HIV infections. Also, Black \nwomen account for almost 70 percent of all new female AIDS cases. It is \nalso the main cause of death for both Black men and women between the \nages of 25 to 44.\n  We continue to make considerable progress in caring for citizens with \nHIV/AIDS and in raising awareness, but today I call upon my colleagues \nto join me in demanding that we do even more. I was proud to support \nthe expansion of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Program in the \nSenate, a bill which President Obama recently signed into law. This \nimportant piece of legislation makes investments in care and treatment \nservices, and also funds prevention and outreach programs--programs \nthat will be improved and augmented by the sweeping health care reforms \ncurrently under consideration by the Senate. As we move forward, I will \ncontinue to work to promote awareness, education, and prevention of \nHIV/AIDS, and will be an ardent supporter of programs that care for \nthose afflicted by this disease.\n  World AIDS Awareness Day is a chance for citizens of the United \nStates and people all over the world to get proactively involved by \ngetting educated, and by promoting treatment and testing of HIV/AIDS. \nTogether, we can beat this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12069-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12069-S12070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE--TREATY\n\n  The following executive report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KERRY, from the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n[Treaty Doc. 111-4: Protocol Amending Tax Convention with France with 1 \n             declaration and 1 condition (Ex.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Landrieu, \nto introduce legislation to make permanent a critical tax incentive \ncurrently being utilized by our Nation's small businesses, which will \nenable them to continue to make vital investments in new plant and \nequipment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, included a \ncrucial provision that extended enhanced small business expensing at \n$250,000 through 2009. My legislation would make the incentive \npermanent and, in turn, provide valuable assistance to America's 26 \nmillion small firms that represent over 99.7 percent of all employers.\n  I have long championed enhanced section 179 expensing, which allows \nsmall businesses to elect to deduct the cost of qualifying property in \nthe year it was purchased, rather than to recover such costs through \ndepreciation deductions over a number of years. In 2007, I introduced \nlegislation to make permanent section 179 expensing, and in 2008, \nCongress, as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, allowed small \nbusinesses in Maine and across the Nation to expense up to $250,000 of \ntheir investments, including the purchase of essential new equipment.\n  Congress further reinforced the necessity of this legislation by \nextending the provision through 2009 in the ARRA. Unfortunately, the \nARRA extension was written to last just 1 year, as a result, in 2010, \nabsent additional action, small firms will be able to expense just \n$134,000 of new capital investment. The provision will be further \nreduced to $25,000 in 2011, and instead of being able to write off more \nof their equipment purchases immediately, firms will have to recover \ntheir costs over 5, 7, or more years.\n  Small businesses continue to struggle as a result of the current \nrecession, and many are having trouble finding capital to make job-\ncreating new investments. We simply cannot allow this pattern to \ncontinue, Accordingly, my bill would allow small businesses to continue \nexpensing up to $250,000 of new investment permanently. By permitting \nsmall businesses to write off more of their equipment purchases today, \nthey will retain substantial savings instead of waiting 5, 7, or more \nyears to recover their costs through depreciation. Additionally, this \nwill save them the vital time that is required to\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\ncomply with complex and confusing depreciation rules. Accordingly, this \nprovision encourages stable investment in new equipment that will \ncontribute to continued productivity and growth in the business \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There begin no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, after the speech by the Senator from \nIllinois, I feel compelled to make a few comments. One, he challenged \nus a little bit to do a bill in 2,000 pages or less. I am one of those \npeople who do not think it can be done in less. I do not think there \nare nearly enough pages there to solve the biggest problem in the \nUnited States for every American.\n  People are not comprehending how big health care is. The bill we are \ndoing will affect 100 percent of the people in America. I do not know \nif we have ever had a bill before that affected 100 percent of the \npeople--100 percent of the people, 100 percent of the professions, 100 \npercent of the businesses. This is big. Everybody has a role in health \ncare, and we are trying to condense it into 2,000 pages and make it \nseem a lot simpler than it is.\n  The reason our side has been saying you need to take this a step at a \ntime and get it right is because that gives up some of the right. There \nare over 200 references in the 2,000 pages that say the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services will solve that particular problem; in other \nwords, put in the details. We do not have nearly the details in there \nto actually run health care for America. Without the details, we do not \nknow what the devil is, and that is the difficulty. So we really ought \nto break it down a step at a time.\n  One step I really think would calm America down is if we did Medicare \nas a separate step. That way we could assure seniors that Medicare was \ngoing to be for Medicare. Yes, there are savings in Medicare. Yes, \nMedicare is going broke. Use the savings for Medicare. It seems pretty \nsimple to me.\n  One of the things they are complaining about is the doc fix we have. \nWe are not paying doctors adequately to be willing to take Medicare \npatients. Of course, we are not paying them adequately to take Medicaid \npatients either. But we are not paying them right. It would cost about \n$250 billion to fix that.\n  Well, if we are talking about $464 billion worth of savings in \nMedicare, why not use that $250 billion to fix that problem so we have \ndoctors. I do not care what kind of insurance you have, I do not care \nhow much you pay for the insurance, if you cannot see a doctor, you \nreally do not have insurance. That is what seniors are being faced \nwith. That is what Medicaid people are being faced with.\n  Medicaid--well, that is another piece that ought to be maybe a step \nbecause 40 percent of the doctors will not take a Medicaid patient \nbecause they are not being paid adequately for it. If you are not paid \nadequately, you go broke. They are small businesses. They are affected \nby this bill in more than one way. They have to provide what we are \nsaying is a government requirement for the minimum insurance they have, \nand they also have to live with whatever rules we put in there and \nwhatever pay fixes we put in there.\n  On the government option, one of the things CBO said was, the only \nway that would ever bring down costs is if the government fixes prices \nfor the doctors, for the hospitals. Well, we are kind of doing that in \nthis bill for Medicare because we are telling nursing homes they are \ngoing to take a big cut. Nursing homes do not have a lot of margin, and \nif nursing homes go broke, people have to go a long ways, sometimes--in \nWyoming, anyway, and Colorado, wherever we have rural populations--they \nmay have to go a long way to see their loved one. They may not even be \nable to do it. So we have to keep those small nursing homes in business \nas well.\n  So we ought to do this in steps and get it right. That is one of the \nproblems that the Group of 6 ran into. We were not given the time. We \nallocated about 13 different areas to go through. I think we made it \nthrough 5 completely and probably 3 fairly completely, and the rest we \nwere just asking basic questions. With any business, it looks pretty \neasy until you scratch the surface a little bit, and when you scratch \nthe surface, you find out that every job out there is fairly \ncomplicated. If you have never done it before, and you are trying to \ncome up with 2,000 pages worth of laws to govern that, you are probably \ngoing to get it wrong.\n  That is what the doctors are telling us. That is what the other \nproviders are telling us. This bill has it wrong, in a lot of places, \nenough places that it is going to cause a crisis in America if this \nbill passes the way it is.\n  We have never passed a major bill in this body with just one side \nvoting for it. If that were to happen, the other side would take \npotshots at anything that turned out to be something that had not been \ncomprehended when the bill was written. And there will be plenty of \nthat in here.\n  But just as important, the American people will not have confidence \nin it. They do not have confidence in us now--either side. I think that \nis what the elections in Virginia and New Jersey said. That is what the \ntea parties are saying. They are saying: We don't trust any of you. \nThrow the whole bunch out. Start over.\n  Well, we need to stop and get their confidence. Just steamrolling \nfrom one side, even if they have the 60 votes, is not going to do that. \nI have been saying that since we started. It is something so important \nthat we have to get it right, and we do not have it right in this bill \nbecause there are a whole bunch of things, over 200, where we said to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services: You figure that one out. \nWell, that is going to be thousands of pages, and it is going to be \ndone by an unelected bureaucrat. It is not going to be approved by this \nbody.\n  We ought to take the responsibility for getting those things right. \nAnd we can. Yes, it takes time. Yes, we have a lot of things to do. But \nI am in agreement that health care is the most important thing we have \nto do. But we ought to take the time to get it right.\n  There are a lot of ideas out there that would--in fact, one of the \nthings that always upsets me when they say: So where is the Republican \nversion? Well, I have been working on this thing for about 4 years. I \nhave been working on it, actually--health care--ever since I got on the \ncommittee over 13 years ago, but for the last 4 years pretty \nintensively.\n  Senator Kennedy and I sat down and worked out principles we wanted to \nhave. The principles are still the principles we are talking about \naround here. We want to make sure people are covered in catastrophic \nsituations. We want to make sure preexisting conditions are taken care \nof. We want to make sure they have portability when they go from one \njob to another. The list goes on and on. We reached agreement. He was \nbusy working on the Higher Education Act because it was way past due \nfor being reauthorized, so I was kind of released to go talk to \neverybody on health care. I worked that. I worked both sides of the \naisle, finding out ideas they had, and boiled it down to a 10-step \nplan.\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\n  I did a tour with my 10-step plan to see what kind of problems there \nwere with it and was really pleased with the reception. Yes, I learned \nsome things that needed to be done differently than what I thought. But \nif you will check my Web site, there is a 10-step plan that is a bill \nthat covers the things we have been promising people they would have. I \nwould not suggest doing it in one package. I would suggest doing it in \nseveral steps, not necessarily 10 steps, which are what are in there. \nBut it would bring down the cost of health care insurance. That is the \nbiggest thing I hear from people out there: Bring down my cost.\n  Now, everybody has been real pleased with this CBO clarification that \ncame out that said the costs were not going to rise. They did not say: \nDon't let them rise. They said: Bring them down. Bring them down. They \nsaid: We don't mind covering a whole bunch of other people, but don't \nincrease my costs as a result. This bill increases their costs as a \nresult.\n  There is a way to do it. There are four different bills on the \nRepublican side. And then there is a really bipartisan bill that \nSenator Wyden and Senator Bennett worked out, and I think there are \nabout 15 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. Those are all ways that \nthis could be solved. But they are not in the bill. Since Senator Wyden \nwas left out of that part of the process, I am not even sure it could \nbe considered partisan because you have to include all from one party.\n  But, at any rate, there are alternates out there. When we did the \nhealth care bill, which took weeks of doing the amendments, because it \nis very hard to do something in an amendment process and get it right--\nit is easier in the committee than it is here on the floor--but in the \ncommittee, we put up one of those as an alternative. We only took one \nvote to vote the whole thing down. They only had to criticize about 3 \nparts of 20 to get enough enthusiasm against it to be able to win. All \nthe votes were 13 to 10, pretty much.\n  So we said: Wait a minute. That is not a good idea for us. They \nshould have to take a look at these germs of ideas that are in all \nthese different sections. So we started putting them up one at a time. \nWe still lost most of them 13 to 10. There were a couple of them that \ndid finally pass.\n  But we need to get into a mode of working across the aisle, like \nSenator Kennedy and I did on so many bills. In fact, I think we set \nsome records, probably, not just when I was chairman of the committee \nbut when he was chairman of the committee. We were on our way to \ngetting a bunch done.\n\n  Anyway, deficit reduction. I heard Senator Durbin talk about deficit \nreduction, and if this bill reduces the deficit. You have to be honest. \nIf you use phony accounting, you can show huge deficits being reduced. \nThat means leaving out some things that aren't in the bill, but they \nare going to be costs we have to cover. For instance, the doc fix, $250 \nbillion. It is not in there. They say we will fix it for 1 year and \nthen we will hold them hostage again for another year so we can get \nthem to join us on something else. That is not the right way to do \nbusiness. We ought to fix the thing and if we have all of this extra \nmoney in Medicare, that would solve some problems for Medicare.\n  On Medicaid, we are about to dump a whole bunch more people onto the \nMedicaid system. It is nice we are going to be able to do that, but \nthere are some other ways we can take care of those same people and \nmake sure they have insurance, and they would have insurance that \ndidn't have the same stigma as Medicaid. One of the stigmas I am \ntalking about is the doctors not willing to take them. If you can't see \na doctor, you don't have insurance. If we dump all of these people on a \nsystem that already won't take the patients, how many of them are going \nto be able to see a doctor? So we could eliminate that stigma. In fact, \nthat is what we did in the SCHIP in Wyoming. We made a provision so \nthat it could go through the private market. When they go through the \nprivate market--or when they don't go through the private market, a \nproblem a kid has if their dad is working, they have insurance; if he \nis not working, they don't have insurance, or if it is mom. Under the \nWyoming one, when they go through the private market they know they \nhave it for a year. That is the way it ought to be. That is the way \nMedicaid should be. Of course, you have to sign up for it. Right now \nyou don't have to sign up. You go to the hospital, you get your fix, \nand we pay for it, or the State pays their share. We are dumping a huge \nliability on the States, so it is a real problem.\n  The States are very concerned. Right now they are having budget \nproblems almost across the entire United States. They are saying, so \nwhat are you going to dump on us? Well, our Gang of 6 asked that \nquestion and we got this overall CBO score on how much it was going to \ncost the States as a whole, but we didn't want to know how much it was \ngoing to cost as a whole. Every one of us has to answer to our State, \nso we asked for it to be broken down and they broke it down. It was \nkind of interesting. I had to call my Governor and explain to him how \nmuch he was going to have to come up with, even under the extra \nprotection we were trying to build in for States. But the next day we \ngot another breakdown. I said, so did CBO change their score? No, they \ndidn't, but we manipulated the numbers a little bit differently. Well, \nthey manipulated the numbers for Nevada and New York, and I think that \nis in the bill too. Their excuse for it was that Nevada and New York \nare particularly hard hit by the recession. Well, one of our \ncomplaints--and part of the phony accounting--is that this doesn't even \ngo into effect for 4 more years, so how would we know that in 4 more \nyears Nevada and New York would be the hardest hit? How do we know it \nwon't be Wyoming and Colorado? So the formulas ought to be formulas \nthat are going to work for everybody all of the time, not just for some \nof the leadership.\n  There are some flaws in here we need to take a look at and we need to \nclear up. I am not going to keep everybody much longer because I want \nto go hear the President speak too and I apologize for the time I have \ntaken. But once in a while a speech gets me kind of concerned and I \nhave to expound a little bit on it and I think the people of America \nneed to know. Actually, I think the people of America have figured this \nout. I think that is why there were problems in August and I think that \nis why we are not going home on the weekends, because we don't want \npeople to hear what the people at home are saying. I was home over the \nThanksgiving weekend and I got an earful, and I like what I am doing. I \ndon't think I like what is happening in the bill.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and thank the President, so the \nSenator from Oklahoma can speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming made some references to the \nAugust recess and what happened during that time. I admire the Senator \nfrom Wyoming so much for the time he has spent on this issue. I, \nfrankly, have not spent much time on this issue. We are kind of a \nproduct of our own committees in the Senate, but I do remember--and \nsome people have forgotten--that during the August recess it was not \njust health care, it was also the cap-and-trade bill, because these are \nthe bills that were passed right down party lines.\n  I have to disagree with the Senator from Wyoming in one respect and \nthat is the people during the August recess were not upset with the \nRepublicans. They were upset with the Democrats because the one bill in \nmy State of Oklahoma is referred to as socialized medicine. They have a \nhard time believing that the government is going to be able to run \nanything better than what we have today. I know those in this Chamber \nwho represent States up in the far north recognize that the hospitals, \nthe Mayo Clinics, and some of those in the northern tier, are filled \nwith people from Canada. They have come down to America because they \ncan't get what they wanted in Canada. So I kind of looked around and \nthe people in Oklahoma seem to understand that if it doesn't work in \nDenmark, if it doesn't work in the United Kingdom, and if it doesn't \nwork in Canada, why would it work in the United States? The answer is \nclearly that it wouldn't.\n  The other issue that was prominent at that time was the issue of \nglobal warming. Six years ago I made the\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\nstatement that the notion that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, \nCO2, cause global warming is probably the greatest hoax ever \nperpetrated on the American people. I know that more and more people \nare using the hoax statement now. The reason that was such a big issue \nwas it passed again in the House, right down party lines--this was the \nWaxman-Markey bill--that would have been a tax increase on the American \npeople of well over $300 billion a year. That translates in my State of \nOklahoma to about $3,000 a family, a tax-paying family. It is something \nwe were not going to let happen and we still are not, but that is a \nreality. I wish to remind my fellow Senators: You may think that August \nis a long time ago. You may think that since we have been in the \nshelter of these halls here in the Senate that people have forgotten \nabout those two issues, and they haven't forgotten. However, I have to \nsay that is not why I am here tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12092-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO BILLY JOE DAUGHERTY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I lost a very dear friend of mine named \nBilly Joe Daugherty a few days ago. I never thought I could sit in one \nchair for 4 hours, but I did this past Monday. Yesterday they had a \nmemorial for Billy Joe.\n  He is a guy who as a very young man came to Tulsa, OK. He built one \nof the largest churches in the Nation. He has been all throughout the \nSoviet Union--at that time it was the Soviet Union--and throughout the \nworld, and he has been saving souls. This guy was just fantastic. When \nhe died last week, he was only 57 years old. I sat there--I actually \nsat there, I say to the Chair, for 4 hours in one chair. I didn't think \nI would be able to do that because I normally am not that patient. But \nas people started giving talks and the eulogies, the best was saved \nuntil last. Billy Joe Daugherty was married for 35 years or so to his \nwife Sharon. She gave the most beautiful, long speech about her life \nwith Billy Joe Daugherty. Then, one by one, the kids--four kids: John, \nPaul, Sarah, and Ruthie--stood up and gave tributes. I was thinking: My \nprayer is that when--my wife and I have been married--two weeks from \nnow it will be 50 years. We have 20 kids and grandkids. By the way, we \nhad all 20 kids and grandkids at one table for Thanksgiving, something \nthat many people are not aware is even possible in this day and age. \nBut my prayer is that when my time comes and I am gone, that my kids \nwill revere me as much as Billy Joe Daugherty's kids revered him.\n  I remember back in 1978--Billy Joe died last week when he was 57--he \nwould have been about 26, 27 years old. I was mayor of the city of \nTulsa. I was elected for the first time. I served three 2-year terms. I \nam a morning person. I don't do very well at night. In the morning I \nperform pretty well. I had a policy--and I lived it all the way through \nthose three terms as mayor of Tulsa--that I would open up the city hall \nat 6 o'clock in the morning and I would make sure no one else was \nthere--no security, nobody else--and stay until 8 o'clock so that \neveryone knew they could come down and visit with the mayor for 2 hours \nevery day if anyone wanted.\n  Not many of them got up that early. The first visitor I had back in \n1978 was kind of a skinny kid, who came in and said, ``I'm Billy Joe \nDaugherty, and I want to pray with you.'' That is the first time I ever \nmet the guy. I cannot tell you that he came by every week for those 6 \nyears, but he was a regular who was always showing up. We did pray for \neach other, for our families, and for the city of Tulsa.\n  I can remember a favorite verse that he used most of the time, a most \ncommon verse, the 23rd Psalm:\n\n     The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.\n     He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:\n     He leadeth me beside still waters.\n     He restoreth my soul:\n     He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name \n           sake.\n\n  The path of righteousness. Billy Joe was led by Jesus down the path \nof righteousness probably two, three decades ago. I cannot tell you how \nmany thousands of people Billy Joe has led down that path of \nrighteousness.\n\n     Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n     I will fear no evil: For thou art with me;\n     Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.\n\n  I am sure that when Billy Joe went through that valley of the shadow \nof death, he probably, knowing him, wasn't even walking. He was \nprobably running because he knew what was on the other side.\n\n     Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine \n           enemies;\n     Thou annointest my head with oil; My cup runneth over.\n\n  Here was the good part. Billy Joe said this:\n\n       Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of \n     my life.\n\n  He might have changed that and said: Surely goodness and mercy and \nSharon will follow me all the rest of my days. Whatever it was, they \ndid it together. He led a life--in 57 short years--that accomplished \nmore than most people who will live to be a hundred.\n  The final words of that verse were:\n\n     And I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever.\n\n  I could look at you folks here today and tell you I don't think Billy \nJoe Daugherty is in heaven, I know Billy Joe Daugherty is in heaven. He \nis looking down at us and thinking two things. First, he is saying: If \nyou only knew what I know now. And then you have to keep in mind the \nother thing--Billy Joe is in a different time zone now, and he probably \nsaid that in just a wink of time, we will all be together. I have every \nexpectation that will happen.\n  So this is not to say goodbye to Billy Joe Daugherty; this is to say, \nso long, we will see you soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/01/senate-section/article/S12092-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
