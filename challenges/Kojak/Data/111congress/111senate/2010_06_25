Mr. President, today there are about 1 million people in \nAmerica who are terribly disappointed at what took place yesterday--1 \nmillion people. That is 1 million in one category. There are hundreds \nand hundreds of thousands of others who are disappointed because of \ndifferent things done to them yesterday as a result of the Republicans \nnot supporting legislation. It was fully paid for.\n  The statements made by Republicans after this bill was rejected by \nthem are simply without any fact.\n  There were efforts made to work with Republicans. We cut the size of \nthe bill. We paid even for things we had never paid for before. We \ndecided to do that in an effort to get help for millions of Americans.\n  One of the things we paid for was something called FMAP, which is \nmoney we would direct to the States that they could use for police, \nfire, teachers, nurses--to stop layoffs from taking place there. That \nwas rejected.\n  There are numerous editorials around the country rejecting what the \nRepublicans did yesterday, and there are headlines in virtually every \nnewspaper of America:\n  LA Times: ``Senate GOP Blocks Jobless Aid Extension.''\n  Business Week: ``Republicans Thwart Bill With Unemployment Aid, \nBuyout Tax Boost.''\n  Boston Globe: ``Filibuster Halts Bill Boosting Jobless Benefits, Aid \nto States.''\n  McClatchy Newspapers: ``GOP Blocks Jobless-Benefit Extension \nBreaks.''\n  USA TODAY: ``Senate GOP Again Blocks Bill Extending Jobless Benefits, \nTax Breaks.''\n  Those tax breaks were for middle-class Americans.\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\n  The Seattle Times: ``Republicans Continue Blockade of Federal Aid \nBill.''\n  The Republicans in the Senate have made the decision to do everything \nthey can to turn the country upside down, to do everything they can to \nstop any economic recovery because they think it may help Barack Obama, \nit may help some of their people trying to run for Senate seats around \nthe country. So they figure, as bad as they can make the economy, the \nbetter off they will be.\n  That is a pretty difficult view for people who are Senators. The \nPresiding Officer is a Senator from the State of Oregon, and that is \nhis prime responsibility, to take care of that State. But, also, as a \nUnited States Senator, he has to be concerned with what goes on in the \nother 49 States. That is our job, that is our role, that is the way we \nwere constitutionally designated.\n  The bill they rejected yesterday creates jobs. As the headlines say, \nit closes corporate loopholes. The bill yesterday that was rejected by \nthe Republicans would stop jobs from being outsourced from American \ncompanies getting tax breaks by creating jobs overseas. Those jobs \nshould be created here. That was rejected by the Republicans.\n  The bill that was before the Senate was a bill that would help small \nbusinesses grow and allow them to hire once again, to be the engine \nthat runs our country. Big businesses should not be rewarded for \nshipping jobs overseas when there are so many at home desperate for a \npaycheck.\n  I have read a number of these stories. They are heartbreaking. I read \nthe Nevada clips today. There was a statement from one man there in \neffect saying: What is going on back there? This is not a partisan \ngame. I need money to take care of my family. I need my unemployment \ncheck. I have tried to find work. I can't find work.\n\n  But that had no bearing on the Republicans yesterday because they, as \nwe learned in the health care debate, want everything that Obama does \nto be his Waterloo. Everything in this bill was paid for with the \nexception of unemployment compensation--about which there has always \nbeen a bipartisan recognition it is an emergency or they wouldn't be \nasking for unemployment benefits.\n  The Republicans were even unwilling to allow us to bring up the bill \nfor debate. They wanted to stop debate, stop further discussion of this \nbill. We could not invoke cloture to allow the debate to go forward. \nEvery Republican voted against it.\n  I was surprised by statements of some coming to the floor afterward \nto say: Yes, but I was in favor of the unemployment benefits.\n  Let's be clear about all the good things a ``yes'' vote enables our \ncountry to do with this legislation. It would have allowed the Senate \nto pass this. It could have gone to the President for signature. A \n``no'' vote stopped us from doing things to help regular guys on the \nstreet, people who are desperate for help.\n  Think of this one: The extension of a tax deduction for tuition. \nThere are young men and women all over America today getting excited \nabout going to school or going back to school. Because of what was done \nby the Republicans yesterday, there will be young men and women unable \nto go to school. They are going to have to stay out until the economy \ngets better, until their dad gets a job and mom gets a job because the \ntuition tax deduction is not going to be around. What a disappointed \ngroup of young men and women we are going to have. As sad as it is, \nsome of those kids will never go to college because of this.\n  This legislation has allowed tax benefits for working men and women \nof this country, allowed for a deduction for property taxes. We didn't \ndo it yesterday. It is not available now.\n  Teachers around America would have been able to deduct, with their \nincome tax, not much--$250 a year to get a tax credit for the pencils \nand paper and stuff they buy every year.\n  As you know, having been around teachers, as we all have, they spend \nlots of their own money for supplies for the kids. Yesterday, the \nRepublicans took that small $250-a-year deduction away from these \nteachers, all teachers.\n  Build America Bonds. Reading the Nevada clips today, because those \nmonies are shrinking, there are not as many people making application \nfor those Build America Bonds programs. This has been such a stimulus \nfor our country since we passed that in the economic recovery act. And \nwe are running out of money there. The bill yesterday would have \nprovided $4 billion, all paid for--no running up the deficit, all paid \nfor. That was rejected by the Republicans. They said no. That $4 \nbillion would have multiplied into many more dollars because if you \nhave a contract worth $2 or $3 million, people go to work, they can buy \ngroceries, they can buy shoes. It stimulates the businesses all over \nthe community. But the Republicans said no to that.\n  State and local governments are begging for these moneys. \nInfrastructure is down. We need to do water and sewer projects, street \nprojects. But the Republicans said no.\n  Legislation was rejected yesterday on an extension of the small \nbusiness lending provisions that would provide low-cost loans to small \nbusinesses. The Republicans yesterday unanimously said no.\n  The bill provided $2\\1/2\\ billion for State wage assistance programs. \nStarting in the Clinton administration, there was always talk by the \nRepublicans and by everybody--not just the Republicans--about shouldn't \nwe do more than provide welfare to people? Shouldn't we provide a way \nthat, if they are on welfare, they can go to work? That is what this \nmoney is about. Those programs have been terminated, programs that have \nworked so well to have people go from welfare to work. Yesterday, the \nRepublicans said no unanimously; let them stay on welfare; they do not \nneed to learn how to work; they do not need to transfer to a job.\n  This legislation that was rejected yesterday provided tax credits for \nresearch and development. A lot of companies, especially small \ncompanies, cannot do the research and development they need to do \nunless they get some kind of a tax incentive to do it. It will not be \ndone.\n  This bill provided $5 billion--all paid for--in new market tax \ncredits. What this meant is that investments could be made in \neconomically distressed areas. They exist in Oregon. They exist in \nNevada. They are going to continue to exist without any improvement \nbecause of the rejection by the Republicans yesterday.\n  Everything I have talked about creates jobs, and to have the \nRepublicans come to the floor and say: We reject it because of the \ncost--it was rejected because they do not believe that middle-class \nAmerica deserves a break; that all of the breaks should go to the fat \ncats.\n  Right now, as a result of the Republicans rejecting this legislation, \nsomeone who is working for minimum wage will continue to pay more taxes \npercentage-wise than Warren Buffet or one of the multibillionaires on \nWall Street. They will pay more of a percentage of their income than \none of those very rich people.\n  In this legislation, we had a provision to extend the first-time home \nbuyers tax credit so that people who already qualified can buy a home--\nrejected. They even rejected a provision we had in this legislation so \nthat someone who is called away to fight in Afghanistan or Iraq--we had \na provision in this bill to allow them to make up the difference \nbetween their military pay and the pay in their job so they would not \nlose their home, as they have done, and put a tremendous burden on \nspouses left at home.\n  One thing my friends on the other side of the aisle should be very \nproud of is they protected corporate interests yesterday. They did that \nbig time. They are betting on our country to fail. That is a sad \ncommentary.\n  We are going to continue. A bill is on the floor now. It is another \nbill to create jobs, small-business job creation. We have worked hard \nto get that done--Senator Landrieu, Senator Baucus, Small Business, \nFinance--and we will have a vote on that Monday. Again, it is being \nblocked by the Republicans, blocking us from even going to it. So we \nwill need 60 votes Monday to allow us to debate whether this country \nneeds small businesses to create jobs. We should be on that bill today \nso people could start offering amendments and do something productive. \nBut, no, what will happen on Monday is they will probably vote for it,\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nand then they will get the 30 hours to sit around and look at each \nother and do nothing. That is what the rules of the Senate allow. So \nthey have accomplished more of their wasting time to prevent the Obama \nadministration and the rest of us from accomplishing something good for \nthe country. We are going to continue to try. We have to do that in \nspite of the obstructionism of the Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/25/senate-section/article/S5461-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I have also secured $15 \nmillion since 2006 for the Fish and Wildlife Service to restore salt \nponds to tidal wetlands in the Bay.\n  It is necessary to ensure that these funds continue to be \nappropriated and are spent on the most important projects for the \necosystem and public benefit.\n  To that end, this legislation will prioritize funding for projects \nthat will protect and restore vital estuarine habitat for migratory \nwaterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and restore water quality \nand rearing habitat for fish; and ensure public benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 566\n\n       Whereas on June 10, 2010, violence erupted between ethnic \n     Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities in the southern city of Osh, \n     Kyrgyzstan, and later spread to the city of Jalalabad, \n     leaving at least several hundred dead and thousands injured;\n       Whereas the outbreak of violence forced as many as 400,000 \n     people to flee their homes, including an estimated 100,000 \n     women and children who face desperate conditions along the \n     Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border;\n       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and \n     other United Nations agencies estimate that the violence \n     could directly or indirectly affect more than 1,000,000 \n     people;\n       Whereas the displacement of ethnic Uzbeks and continuing \n     instability in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan could \n     destabilize the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan and \n     undermine the legitimacy of the referendum on constitutional \n     reform scheduled for June 27, 2010;\n       Whereas the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan, which \n     came to power in April 2010 following large-scale opposition \n     protests against the regime of former president Kurmanbek \n     Bakiyev, has yet to fully extend its authority in the south \n     and build the capacity necessary to address underlying \n     political, social, and economic tensions;\n       Whereas Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in Osh have retreated into \n     largely self-segregated neighborhoods, creating the potential \n     for a permanent division into ethnic enclaves that could \n     impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance and jeopardize \n     the long-term stability of the country;\n       Whereas rioting and violence in southern Kyrgyzstan could \n     spread to other areas in the Ferghana Valley, which spans the \n     countries of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, and \n     further exacerbate inter-ethnic competition for resources in \n     the region;\n       Whereas protracted instability in Kyrgyzstan and the wider \n     region could provide a safe haven for extremists and criminal \n     networks and obstruct efforts to combat the drug trade;\n       Whereas stability in Kyrgyzstan and the broader Central \n     Asia region, which borders Afghanistan, Iran, China, and \n     Russia, is important to the national security interests of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Central Asia plays a vital role in the United \n     States strategy for Afghanistan, including the transit center \n     at Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan that forms an \n     integral part of the northern supply route for North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and United States-led coalition \n     operations in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas promoting stability, respect for human rights, and \n     economic and political reform in Central Asia are important \n     priorities for the United States;\n       Whereas economic growth and democratic political \n     development in Central Asia would provide a foundation for \n     improved cooperation with the United States in confronting an \n     array of global challenges, from nonproliferation and \n     counter-narcotics to energy security and climate change; and\n       Whereas the potential for escalating violence in Kyrgyzstan \n     concerns not only the United States and the people of \n     Kyrgyzstan, but also the countries in the region and the \n     international community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to call upon all parties in Kyrgyzstan to refrain from \n     violence and attend to the civilians who have been displaced \n     or injured as a result of the violence, paying particular \n     attention to the ethnic Uzbek population along the \n     Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border;\n       (2) that the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan should--\n       (A) take immediate steps to restore order, the rule of law, \n     and the democratic process;\n       (B) address the underlying political, social, and economic \n     tensions that divide Kyrgyz society for all citizens of \n     Kyrgyzstan, regardless of ethnic background; and\n       (C) bring to justice those responsible for the recent \n     violence;\n       (3) to support calls for a full and fair investigation into \n     the causes of the violence in southern Kyrgyzstan;\n       (4) to welcome the commitment of more than $32,000,000 of \n     the United States Government to Kyrgyzstan for programs \n     supporting humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and community \n     stabilization;\n       (5) to commend the Government of Uzbekistan for cooperating \n     with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and other \n     international nongovernmental organizations in meeting the \n     urgent needs of Uzbek refugees;\n       (6) that the Government of Uzbekistan should maintain an \n     open border in order to ensure that the displaced and \n     vulnerable populations seeking refuge in Uzbekistan may avail \n     themselves of emergency humanitarian assistance and \n     protection services;\n       (7) to call upon the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe to help restore calm and order \n     through--\n       (A) strengthening the democratic institutions of \n     Kyrgyzstan;\n       (B) encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms;\n       (C) establishing a framework for dialogue among the ethnic \n     communities; and\n       (D) promoting confidence building measures between the \n     Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan and ethnic communities; \n     and\n       (8) to commend the efforts of relief organizations and all \n     persons responding to the immediate humanitarian needs of \n     those displaced by the recent outbreak of violence in \n     Kyrgyzstan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/25/senate-section/article/S5462-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5462-S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PERMANENT RADIO FREE ASIA AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this Act as ``RFA'')--\n       (A) was authorized under section 309 of the United States \n     International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6208);\n       (B) was incorporated as a private, non-profit corporation \n     in March 1996 in the hope that its operations would soon be \n     obviated by the global advancement of democracy; and\n       (C) is headquartered in Washington, DC, with additional \n     offices in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Phnom Penh, Seoul, Ankara, and \n     Taipei.\n       (2) RFA broadcasts serve as substitutes for indigenous free \n     media in regions lacking free media outlets.\n       (3) The mission of RFA is ``to provide accurate and timely \n     news and information to Asian countries whose governments \n     prohibit access to a free press'' in order to enable informed \n     decisionmaking by the people within Asia.\n       (4) RFA provides daily broadcasts of news, commentary, \n     analysis, and cultural programming to Asian countries in \n     several languages, including--\n       (A) 12 hours per day in Mandarin;\n       (B) 8 hours per day in 3 Tibetan dialects, Uke, Kham, and \n     Amdo;\n       (C) 4 hours per day in Korean and Burmese;\n       (D) 2 hours per day in Cantonese, Vietnamese, Laotian, \n     Khmer (Cambodian), and Uyghur; and\n       (E) 1\\1/2\\ hours per week in Wu (local Shanghai dialect).\n       (5) The governments of the countries targeted for these \n     broadcasts have consistently denied and blocked attempts at \n     Medium Wave and FM transmissions into their countries, \n     forcing RFA to rely on Shortwave broadcasts and the Internet.\n       (6) RFA has provided continuous online news to its Asian \n     audiences since 2004, although some countries--\n       (A) routinely and aggressively block RFA's website;\n       (B) monitor access to RFA's website; and\n       (C) discourage online users by making it illegal to access \n     RFA's website.\n       (7) Despite these attempts, RFA has successfully managed to \n     reach its online audiences through proxies, cutting-edge \n     software, and active republication and repostings by its \n     audience.\n       (8) RFA also provides forums for local opinions and \n     experiences through message boards, podcasts, web logs \n     (blogs), cell phone-distributed newscasts, and new media, \n     including Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, and YouTube.\n       (9) Freedom House has documented that freedom of the press \n     is in decline in nearly every region of the world, \n     particularly in Asia, where none of the countries served by \n     RFA have increased their freedom of the press during the past \n     5 years.\n       (10) In fiscal year 2010, RFA is operating on a $37,000,000 \n     budget, less than $400,000 of which is available to fund \n     Internet censorship circumvention.\n       (11) Congress currently provides grant funding for RFA's \n     operations on a fiscal year basis.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) public access to timely, uncensored, and accurate \n     information is imperative for promoting government \n     accountability and the protection of human rights;\n       (2) Radio Free Asia provides a vital voice to people in \n     Asia;\n       (3) some of the governments in Asia spend millions of \n     dollars each year to jam RFA's shortwave, block its Internet \n     sites;\n       (4) Congress should provide additional funding to RFA and \n     the other entities overseen by the Broadcasting Board of \n     Governors for--\n       (A) Internet censorship circumvention; and\n       (B) enhancement of their cyber security efforts; and\n       (5) permanently authorizing funding for Radio Free Asia \n     would--\n       (A) reflect the concern that media censorship and press \n     restrictions in the countries served by RFA have increased \n     since RFA was established; and\n       (B) send a powerful signal of our Nation's support for free \n     press in Asia and throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 3. PERMANENT AUTHORIZATION FOR RADIO FREE ASIA.\n\n       Section 309 of the United States International Broadcasting \n     Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6208) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(2), by striking ``, and shall further \n     specify that funds to carry out the activities of Radio Free \n     Asia may not be available after September 30, 2010'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (f);\n       (3) by redesignating subsections (g) and (h) as subsection \n     (f) and (g), respectively; and\n       (4) in subsection (f), as redesignated--\n       (A) by striking ``The Board'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) Notification.--The Board'';\n       (B) by striking ``before entering'' and inserting the \n     following: ``before--\n       ``(A) entering'';\n       (C) by striking ``Radio Free Asia.'' and inserting the \n     following: ``Radio Free Asia; or\n       ``(B) entering into any agreements in regard to the \n     utilization of Radio Free Asia transmitters, equipment, or \n     other resources that will significantly reduce the \n     broadcasting activities of Radio Free Asia.'';\n       (D) by striking ``The Chairman'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(2) Consultation.--The Chairman''; and\n       (E) by inserting ``or Radio Free Asia broadcasting \n     activities'' before the period at the end.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 566) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the situation in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 566) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 566\n\n       Whereas on June 10, 2010, violence erupted between ethnic \n     Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities in the southern city of Osh, \n     Kyrgyzstan, and later spread to the city of Jalalabad, \n     leaving at least several hundred dead and thousands injured;\n       Whereas the outbreak of violence forced as many as 400,000 \n     people to flee their homes, including an estimated 100,000 \n     women and children who face desperate conditions along the \n     Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border;\n       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and \n     other United Nations agencies estimate that the violence \n     could directly or indirectly affect more than 1,000,000 \n     people;\n       Whereas the displacement of ethnic Uzbeks and continuing \n     instability in the southern part of Kyrgyzstan could \n     destabilize the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan and \n     undermine the legitimacy of the referendum on constitutional \n     reform scheduled for June 27, 2010;\n       Whereas the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan, which \n     came to power in April 2010 following large-scale opposition \n     protests against the regime of former president Kurmanbek \n     Bakiyev, has yet to fully extend its authority in the south \n     and build the capacity necessary to address underlying \n     political, social, and economic tensions;\n       Whereas Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in Osh have retreated into \n     largely self-segregated neighborhoods, creating the potential \n     for a permanent division into ethnic enclaves that could \n     impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance and jeopardize \n     the long-term stability of the country;\n       Whereas rioting and violence in southern Kyrgyzstan could \n     spread to other areas in the Ferghana Valley, which spans the \n     countries of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, and \n     further exacerbate inter-ethnic competition for resources in \n     the region;\n       Whereas protracted instability in Kyrgyzstan and the wider \n     region could provide a safe haven for extremists and criminal \n     networks and obstruct efforts to combat the drug trade;\n       Whereas stability in Kyrgyzstan and the broader Central \n     Asia region, which borders Afghanistan, Iran, China, and \n     Russia, is important to the national security interests of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Central Asia plays a vital role in the United \n     States strategy for Afghanistan, including the transit center \n     at Manas International Airport in Kyrgyzstan that forms an \n     integral part of the northern supply route for North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and United States-led coalition \n     operations in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas promoting stability, respect for human rights, and \n     economic and political reform in Central Asia are important \n     priorities for the United States;\n       Whereas economic growth and democratic political \n     development in Central Asia would provide a foundation for \n     improved cooperation with the United States in confronting an \n     array of global challenges, from nonproliferation and \n     counter-narcotics to energy security and climate change; and\n       Whereas the potential for escalating violence in Kyrgyzstan \n     concerns not only the United States and the people of \n     Kyrgyzstan, but also the countries in the region and the \n     international community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\n       (1) to call upon all parties in Kyrgyzstan to refrain from \n     violence and attend to the civilians who have been displaced \n     or injured as a result of the violence, paying particular \n     attention to the ethnic Uzbek population along the \n     Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border;\n       (2) that the Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan should--\n       (A) take immediate steps to restore order, the rule of law, \n     and the democratic process;\n       (B) address the underlying political, social, and economic \n     tensions that divide Kyrgyz society for all citizens of \n     Kyrgyzstan, regardless of ethnic background; and\n       (C) bring to justice those responsible for the recent \n     violence;\n       (3) to support calls for a full and fair investigation into \n     the causes of the violence in southern Kyrgyzstan;\n       (4) to welcome the commitment of more than $32,000,000 of \n     the United States Government to Kyrgyzstan for programs \n     supporting humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and community \n     stabilization;\n       (5) to commend the Government of Uzbekistan for cooperating \n     with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, UNICEF, and other \n     international nongovernmental organizations in meeting the \n     urgent needs of Uzbek refugees;\n       (6) that the Government of Uzbekistan should maintain an \n     open border in order to ensure that the displaced and \n     vulnerable populations seeking refuge in Uzbekistan may avail \n     themselves of emergency humanitarian assistance and \n     protection services;\n       (7) to call upon the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe to help restore calm and order \n     through--\n       (A) strengthening the democratic institutions of \n     Kyrgyzstan;\n       (B) encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms;\n       (C) establishing a framework for dialogue among the ethnic \n     communities; and\n       (D) promoting confidence building measures between the \n     Provisional Government of Kyrgyzstan and ethnic communities; \n     and\n       (8) to commend the efforts of relief organizations and all \n     persons responding to the immediate humanitarian needs of \n     those displaced by the recent outbreak of violence in \n     Kyrgyzstan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/25/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. REID.
