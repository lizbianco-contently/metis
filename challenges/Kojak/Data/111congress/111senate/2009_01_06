Mr. President, on the Fourth of July of the year 1851, the \nlegendary statesman Daniel Webster, himself a former Senator, laid the \ncornerstone for the Senate Chamber where we now gather. He said:\n\n       Be it known that on this day the Union of the United States \n     of America stands firm.\n\n  Today marks the 150th year that this Chamber has housed the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  When Vice President John Breckinridge gaveled the 34th Congress open \nin this Chamber in 1859, our Republic had a population of one-tenth \nwhat it is today. There were just 64 Senators. Each Senator enjoyed a \nlittle more leg room, and that is an understatement. Many of these \ndesks we see behind me, and behind the Republican leader, are from the \noriginal Senators of this country. They are real old. This Chamber, for \n150 years, has served as the primary working space for most Members. \nThe first session held here 150 years ago began as it did today, with \nthe Vice President of the United States administering the oath of \noffice to new Members.\n  Today, nine new Senators joined what many have said, and I agree, is \nthe greatest deliberative body the world has ever known--certainly the \ngreatest legislative body. So I extend my warmest welcome and \ncongratulations to Senator Mark Udall of Colorado, Senator Tom Udall of \nNew Mexico, Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of \nNew Hampshire, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, Senator Jim Risch of \nIdaho, Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Senator Jeff Merkley of \nOregon, and Senator Mark Begich of Alaska.\n  To the profound challenges we face, these nine men and women bring \nvast judgment and experience at all levels of Government and public \nservice. I am confident every one of them will serve their States and \nour Nation with distinction and pride.\n  It was just 2 years ago this inaugural day of Congress that we \nheralded a new majority for Democrats in both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, but in the Senate that was a very tenuous majority. We \nbegan with 51, but Tim Johnson became very ill and the crowded \nDemocratic primary field left us oftentimes short of an outright \nmajority and far short of the 60 votes needed to prevent filibusters \nand pass legislation. Although we made substantial progress in the \n110th Congress, partisanship with divided Government too often ruled \nthe day.\n  I have said from the day the election was over, we are looking \nforward. We are not going to be concerned about the previous 8 years, \nwe are concerned about the next 8 years. Since 2006, we Democrats have \nreceived a net gain of 14 Senate seats, 45 to 59. Just 2 weeks from \ntoday, Barack Obama will become the 44th President of the United \nStates. We are ready to answer the call of the American people by \nputting the past 8 years behind us and delivering the change our \ncountry desperately needs.\n  We are grateful to begin anew with a far more robust Democratic \nmajority. But both parties learned an important lesson over the past 2 \nyears: When we allow ourselves to retreat into the tired, well-worn \ntrenches of partisanship, when we fail to reach for common ground, when \nwe are unable, in the words of President-elect Obama, to disagree \nwithout being disagreeable, we diminish our ability to accomplish real \nchange.\n  To my Republican counterpart, Senator McConnell, and all Republican \ncolleagues, a number of whom I have called and personally visited with, \nI say to them: With American troops fighting two wars overseas, we are \ntogether in all of this. With the American people suffering a \nstaggering economic crisis here at home, we are in this together. With \nthe middle class struggling to make one paycheck last until the next \none, we are in the middle of this together. With health care, college \ntuition, and retirement more expensive and harder to reach than ever, \nwe are in this together. With our climate in crisis and energy prices \nrising and falling unpredictably, we are in this together.\n  Some may fear the depth of the challenges we face, but I remind them \nthat adversity is no stranger to this Chamber or to our country. In \nAmerica and in this Chamber, we have never failed to persevere and \nultimately to prosper. In this Chamber, our Union came unraveled and \nwas mended, great wars were declared and peace has been celebrated. \nHere, our most fundamental freedoms were challenged, upheld, and \nexpanded. In this Chamber for 150 years we have watched things happen.\n  In more recent years, we watched the passing of the New Deal by \nRoosevelt, Truman's Fair Deal, Kennedy's Great Frontier, and Johnson's \nGreat Society. Over these many years, we have outlawed child labor, \nbrought electricity to the western frontier, and ensured a college \neducation for those who serve in uniform.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday to go to the funeral of Claiborne \nPell, a man of wealth, a patrician, a man who went to the finest \nschools in America but dedicated his life to public service so that \nother people who were not in his situation could be educated. That is \nwhere the Pell grants came from--Claiborne Pell, a very aristocratic \nman who devoted his life to public service.\n  We have done those things right here in this Chamber. Of course, we \npassed, after long, hard struggles and much anxiety, the Civil Rights \nand Voting Rights acts.\n  There is no question that the challenges ahead of us are staggering. \nI do not think anyone would disagree. But I am confident that if we \nrenew, in this body, our commitment to bipartisanship, the 111th \nCongress will be a tremendous success.\n  Just a short way from here yesterday afternoon--and I don't remember \nthe exact time, 3 o'clock or something like that, or 3:30--we had a \nbipartisan meeting of the leadership of the House and Senate. It was a \nwonderful meeting, with an exchange of ideas. The President-elect was \nhere. I was very impressed. I heard Senator McConnell say to him: There \nare some things I need to talk to you about. Senator Obama said to him, \nwhen the meeting broke up: Let's talk now. I assume they talked \nsometime in the next little bit. But that is what we need: the ability \nto talk to each other.\n  There is no script that can be written where Senator McConnell and I \nwill agree on everything that happens here. But there is a script being \nwritten today that says that even though we disagree on things that \ntake place in this body, we can do it in a way that is constructive and \nworks toward the good of our country. The State of Kentucky is much \ndifferent from the State of Nevada--they are two different States. That \nwas the genius of our Founding Fathers, that this Senate, which came \nabout by reason of the\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\nGreat Compromise in 1787 in Philadelphia, has allowed people to work \ntogether. Even though the State of Kentucky has more people than the \nState of Nevada and the State of California has more people than the \nState of Nevada, the State of Nevada has as much power in the Senate as \nKentucky and California.\n  I have confidence we can work together. I am convinced that Senator \nMcConnell and I--our critics and the press can call us a lot of names \nand make suggestions, but one thing they cannot say about us is we are \nnot experienced. We have been through a lot of political wars. We are \nready to take on whatever wars face us.\n  I say to my friend, Senator McConnell, I have every confidence we \nwill be able to move this country forward.\n  We need to have the 111th Congress a tremendous success, and we can \ndo that. In the coming days, my fellow Democrats and I will introduce \nour priorities for this Congress. It happens every Congress. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will introduce their \nlegislative priorities. We look forward to developing dialog between \nthe two sides of the aisle to see if we can meet somewhere in the \nmiddle.\n  This day marks not just the 150th year of this Chamber but also the \n50th year of the service of Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia. For \n50 years he has been a Senator, but he has been a Member of Congress \nfor 56 years because he served in the House before he came here. It is \nno secret, when it comes to reverence for the Senate, we have all \nlearned a lot--I have learned a lot--from President Byrd's love of this \nbody. I also have learned a lot from Senator Byrd of his desire for all \nAmericans to appreciate that little document we call our Constitution. \nSo on this the 50th anniversary of Senator Byrd's service, I express \npublicly my affection and admiration for this good man and wish him \nwell in this Congress.\n  For our nine new Members sworn today and for all Americans, I offer a \nfew of Senator Byrd's words which he delivered to a meeting of new \nSenators about 12 years ago, when he said:\n\n       After 200 years, [the Senate] is still the anchor of the \n     Republic, the morning and evening star in the American \n     constitutional constellation.\n       It has weathered the storms of adversity, withstood the \n     barbs of cynics and attacks of critics. It has provided \n     stability and strength for the nation during periods of civil \n     strife and uncertainty, panics and depressions.\n       In war and peace, it has been the sure refuge and protector \n     of the rights of states and of a political minority. And, \n     today, the Senate still stands--the great forum of \n     constitutional American liberty.\n\n  So said Senator Byrd 12 years ago.\n  Today is a new chapter in history. It begins today. Each of us has \nthe honor of taking part in it in some way. We here in the Senate have \nthe ability to help write that history.\n  As the work starts, the words of Daniel Webster return to mind: ``Be \nit known that on this day the Union of the United States of America \nstands firm.'' I believe that.\n  I have just a few other brief remarks.\n  As my colleagues are aware, two Democratic U.S. Senate seats--one \nfrom Illinois and the other from Minnesota--are currently vacant. I \nwill briefly address these two unusual circumstances because of the \ninquiries we have all had.\n  First, the Illinois seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama. \nAlthough I do not know Mr. Burris personally--I hope to meet him in the \nnext few days--he has served the State of Illinois in elective office \nover many years. Mr. Burris and his advisers were welcomed to the \nCapitol this morning by Sergeant at Arms Terry Gainer, who was chief of \npolice in Chicago, so they have known each other for a long time. They \nthen had a gracious meeting with the Secretary of the Senate, Nancy \nErickson, and Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin, who informed them \nthat Mr. Burris is not in possession of the necessary credentials from \nthe State of Illinois. A court case in Illinois is pending to determine \nwhether Secretary of State Jesse White is obligated to sign this \ncertification. We are awaiting that court decision. If Mr. Burris takes \npossession of valid credentials, the Senate will proceed in a manner \nthat is respectful to Mr. Burris while ensuring there is no cloud of \ndoubt over the appointment to fill this seat.\n\n  I also understand that Mr. Burris will likely give testimony to the \nIllinois State Assembly impeachment proceedings in the next few days, \nthese proceedings pending against Governor Blagojevich. We await that \nproceeding as Senators as well.\n  As to Minnesota, I know a little bit about close elections. I am only \ngoing to talk about two of them because I have had a number of them. I \nlost one by 524 votes. It was a statewide election for the Senate. That \nwas traumatic, to lose that race to Paul Laxalt, one of the historic \nSenators from Nevada--but of course for this country because of his \nvery close personal relationship with President Reagan. Paul Laxalt and \nI are close personal friends, but I lost that vote by 524. We went \nthrough a recount. I didn't file any lawsuits. There were no \nchallenges. As hard as it was--and it was hard because that is really \nthe first thing I had ever lost--I lost the race. All over the country, \nDemocrats were winning these Senate seats and I lost in Nevada, but I \nhad to give up because I had no chance of winning.\n  I won the second by 428 votes. One reason John Ensign and I are \nsoulmates is because our politics are so different, but our friendship \nis as good as it gets. That was a tough election, a bitter election \nthat John Ensign and I went through. We had a recount in Nevada that \nwas ongoing. John Ensign made a decision that it was a waste of time; I \ncan't win the election. Before the recount was completed, John Ensign \ncalled me--I was having dinner with my wife--and said: You are going to \nbe the next Senator. I thought when he made that phone call, gee, this \nis some kind of good guy. I didn't handle my loss nearly as well as he \ndid. I remember that.\n  Anyway, John Ensign filed no challenges, didn't complete the recount, \nthere were no lawsuits. And John Ensign is now a Member of the Senate. \nI am fortunate to have a number of good friends, but, boy, he is a \nfriend, and I think if you ask him he would say the same.\n  So I say to my friend Norm Coleman, watch what I have said and watch \nwhat has taken place in the past. The Senate race in Minnesota was very \nclose. It was very, very close--one of the closest in history. The \nbipartisan State Canvassing Board and Minnesota's election officials \nhave done an exemplary job in handling the recount. There were no \nallegations of partisanship or unfairness from either side that I am \naware of, and I followed it every day for 6 weeks.\n  Even close elections, though, have winners. I can testify to that. \nAfter all votes have been fairly counted, Al Franken is certified as \nthe winner by the State Canvassing Board, and he is the Senator-elect \nfrom Minnesota. Democrats will not seek to seat Senator-elect Franken \ntoday. We understand the sensitivity on both sides to an election this \nclose.\n  This is a difficult time for former Senator Coleman and his family. I \nacknowledge that. He is entitled to the opportunity to proceed however \nhe feels appropriate. But for someone who has been in the trenches on a \nnumber of these elections, graciously conceding, as his friend John \nEnsign did, would be the right step. This can't drag on forever, and I \nunderstand that. I hope former Senator Coleman and all our Republican \ncolleagues will choose to respect the will of the people of Minnesota. \nThey have chosen a new Senator, Al Franken, and his term must begin and \nwill begin soon.\n  I repeat, I look forward to this year, hoping that next year at this \ntime we will be here talking about many things we have been able to \naccomplish.\n  As I have said on this floor, if we accomplish things, there is \ncredit to go around to everyone. If we do not accomplish anything, \nthere is blame to go around to everyone. That is not where I want to \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S8-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8-S9]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following \ncommunication:\n\n       A communication from the Director of the Federal Register, \n     National Archives, transmitting, pursuant to law, a report \n     relative to the Certificates of Ascertainment of the electors \n     of the President and Vice President of the United States.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on January 1, Claiborne Pell died. \nClaiborne Pell was a Senator from Rhode Island, the longest serving \nSenator from that State, a Senator whose name is known by most college \nstudents and by most people who care about education in America because \nhe was largely responsible for helping to create in 1973 what we now \ncall the Pell grant, a Federal scholarship that follows students to the \ncollege of their choice. It was originally called the Basic Educational \nOpportunity Grant, but Pell grant is a lot easier to say. It is a \nremarkable success in our country. He deserves to be remembered for \nthat success.\n  I knew him as a staff member when I came here with Senator Howard \nBaker, who was here just a few hours ago as we were sworn in. That was \n42 years ago. I knew him as Education Secretary in 1991 and 1992.\n  The American higher education system is, at a time when we worry \nabout some of our institutions, one of our great secret weapons in \nAmerica, one of our great strengths. One reason for that is because of \nFederal grants and loans.\n  It all started not with the Pell grant but just at the end of World \nWar II with the GI bill for veterans. It was a college scholarship. \nActually, it was an educational scholarship the veterans could spend \nwherever they wished, and the ``wherever they wished'' point is the \nimportant point because many of those men and some women who came back \nfrom World War II used their GI bill money to go to high school. Some \nused it to go to college in other countries of the world.\n  No one said you can't go to the University of Delaware or you must go \nto Notre Dame or you can't go to Brown University or you can't go to a \nHistorically Black College. The GI bill for veterans followed the \nstudent to the college of that student's choice.\n  It was not universally popular. The president of the University of \nChicago, Mr. Hutchins, said at the time that it would create a campus \nfull of hobos because college at that time was for a very limited \nnumber of Americans.\n  At the end of World War II, only 5 percent of Americans 25 and older \nhad completed at least 4 years of college. But today, according to the \nmost recent figures, that figure is six times that. Nearly 30 percent \nof Americans have completed 4 years of college.\n  First, the GI bill after World War II, then the Pell grant in 1973, \nthen the various loans the Federal Government allows for students. So \ntoday, 60 percent of the men and women who go to American colleges and \nuniversities have a Federal grant or Federal loan to help them pay for \ncollege.\n  It is never easy to afford college. The average tuition at a 4-year \nprivate school is about $25,000 today, and you add to that your living \nexpenses. It is important to remember that an average tuition at a 4-\nyear public university is about $6,500, and the average tuition and \nfees for community colleges is $2,400.\n  So Senator Pell, by his leadership and his work as chairman of the \nEducation Subcommittee of our Health, Education, and Labor Committee, \nhelped add to the legacy of the GI bill for veterans and helped make it \npossible for so many Americans to go to college.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks and honor Senator Pell with a thought \nabout our future. I have always wondered why if the Pell grant was such \na good idea for colleges, why don't we try it for kindergarten through \nthe 12th grade.\n  We seem to overlook the fact that American students can choose their \ncollege and the money follows the student to the college. It might be \nNashville Auto Diesel College. It might be Harvard University. But we \ndon't give the money to the school, we give it to the student to decide \nwhere to go. That was a happy accident that happened with the GI bill, \nand it was a happy accident that happened in 1973.\n  I remember saying to one distinguished Member of this body: You know, \nthe Pell grant is a voucher.\n  This Senator recoiled from that and said: I am opposed to vouchers.\n  I said: But you are not opposed to the Pell grant, are you?\n  And she said: Well, no, that is different.\n  I would argue that is not different at all. What we have done in \nkindergarten to 12th grade is give the money directly to institutions, \nand we, in that sense, create local educational monopolies and limit \nthe amount of competition in choice.\n  We can look at our experience with higher education and see how it is \ngenerally considered to be by far the best in the world. We not only \nhave the best colleges and universities in the world, we have almost \nall of them. Then we look at our system of kindergarten through the \n12th grade.\n  The Presiding Officer has been Governor of his State. He worked hard \non charter schools. We have all tried many different ideas to try to \nimprove kindergarten through 12th grade, but we have never quite seemed \nto be able to make it as effective as our success with higher \neducation.\n  That is why in 2004 I suggested on the Senate floor that we try the \nidea of a Pell grant for kids. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record following my remarks the remarks I made on the Senate \nfloor on May 17, 2004, about Pell grants for kids.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, to summarize them, they were simply \nthis: Why not look to the example of our higher education system and \ntry it with kindergarten through the 12th grade? The Pell grants for \nkids I proposed was to give every single child from a middle- or low-\nincome family a $500 scholarship that would follow them to the school \nor other accredited academic program of their choice. These would be \nnew Federal dollars so no district would see its share of money from \nWashington cut, and it would give less wealthy families many of the \nsame choices that families with money already have.\n  As one example, across our country we see art and music lessons cut \nin schools. As budgets get tight, they are the first things that are \ncut. The kids who go to the schools from the areas that have less money \nfrom property taxes and less money from sales taxes are not able to \nhave the art and music courses. If they had a $500 Pell grant for kids, \nthey might take it to an afterschool program for art or afterschool \nprogram for music, or the parents might get together and go to the \nschool the children attend and say: Look, there are 20 of us with these \n$500 Pell grants. We will all come here if you hire an art teacher part \ntime or a music teacher part time. It would give parents some consumer \npower, it would give children opportunities, and it would give schools \nwith less money more money.\n  This is an idea I hope we can seriously consider as we look ahead to \nthe future of American public education. We should recognize that there \nare a great many school districts with children who have less money and \nless of a tax base than others and that we have had a wonderful example \nwith the GI bill for veterans and with Pell grants in colleges and \nuniversities.\n  So why not try it in a limited way to see if it would help improve \nopportunity and education in kindergarten through the 12th grade as it \nhas in college.\n  My main purpose today is to honor Claiborne Pell. He served 36 years \nwith distinction. He contributed greatly to the opportunities of \neducation in America. He did it with dignity, and he did it with \nintelligence. We respect\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nhim, we miss him, and we honor his legacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       A half century after Brown v. Board of Education, education \n     on equal terms still eludes too many African-American school \n     children. Secretary of Education Rod Paige has called \n     America's persistent racial achievement gap ``the civil \n     rights issue of our time.''\n       By the 12th grade, only one in six black students and one \n     in five Hispanic students are reading at grade level. Math \n     scores are equally disturbing. Only 3 percent of blacks and 4 \n     percent of Hispanics test at proficient levels by their \n     senior year. By another standard, about 60 percent of \n     African-American children read at or below basic level at the \n     end of the 4th grade, while 75 percent of white students read \n     at basic or above at the end of the 4th grade.\n       There is still a huge achievement gap among African-\n     American children and white children. The No Child Left \n     Behind Act's system of standards and accountability is \n     creating a foundation for closing the gap. But funding \n     disparities between rich and poor--too often minority \n     children attend poorer schools--school districts remain a \n     stubborn contributor to inequality. Between 1996 and 2000, \n     poor students fell further behind their wealthier peers in \n     seven out of nine key indicators, including reading, math and \n     science.\n       These outcomes cry out for a different model, one that \n     helps address funding and equality without raising property \n     taxes; that introduces entrepreneurship and choice into a \n     system of monopolies; and that offers school districts more \n     federal dollars to implement the requirements of No Child \n     Left Behind with fewer strings--in other words, more federal \n     dollars, fewer federal strings, and more parental say over \n     how the federal dollars are spent.\n       Does this sound too good to be true? I would suggest it is \n     not.\n       Look no further than our nation's best-in-the-world higher \n     educational system. There we find the Pell grant program, \n     which has diversified and strengthened America's colleges and \n     universities by applying the principles of autonomy and \n     competition. This year, $13 billion in Pell grants and work \n     study and $42 billion in student loans will follow America's \n     students to the colleges of their choice. This is in sharp \n     contrast to the local monopolies we have created in \n     kindergarten through the 12th grade education, where dollars \n     flow directly to schools with little or no say from parents.\n       That is why I am proposing Pell Grants for Kids, an annual \n     $500 scholarship that would follow every middle- and low-\n     income child to the school or other accredited academic \n     program of his or her parent's choosing. These are new \n     federal dollars, so no district would see a cut in its share \n     of Washington's $35 billion annual appropriations for K-12, \n     and increases in funding for students with disabilities would \n     continue. Armed with new purchasing power, parents could \n     directly support their school's priorities, or they could pay \n     for tutoring, for lessons and other services in the private \n     market. Parents in affluent school districts do this all the \n     time.\n       Pell Grants for Kids would give less wealthy families the \n     same opportunities--an example is the Holiday family in \n     Nashville, Tennessee.\n       Raymon Holiday is a 6th grader who recently won the \n     American Lung Association of Tennessee's clean air poster \n     contest. I was there when he won the 10-speed bicycle you get \n     for winning this poster competition. I met his father, an art \n     major, and his grandfather, a retired art teacher. They told \n     me his great-grandfather was a musician. So you can see where \n     Raymon Holiday gets his instincts. His grandfather, the \n     retired art teacher, lamented to me that art classes are \n     usually the first to go when school budgets are cut. With \n     Pell Grants for Kids, in a typical middle school of 600 \n     students, Raymon might be one of 500 middle- or low-income \n     students who qualify to receive a $500 Pell grant. His middle \n     school would see a $250,000 increase in funding. Raymon would \n     be assured of art lessons.\n       The Pell grant model also encourages great American \n     entrepreneurship. Enterprising principals, like Raymon's \n     principal, might design programs to attract parental \n     investment: advanced math classes, writing workshops, after \n     school programs, English lessons--whatever is lacking due to \n     funding constraints.\n       Surveys continue to show that while Americans are concerned \n     with the state of public education, most support their own \n     child's public school.\n       Herman Smith, superintendent of schools in Bryan, Texas, \n     would welcome the $6 million that would accompany 13,500 \n     eligible Bryan students--90 percent of his district. Bryan is \n     right next door to College Station, home of Texas A where, \n     according to Smith, their budget cuts are larger than Bryan \n     dreams of spending for new programs and personnel. Property \n     values there are double those in Bryan, as is the per-pupil \n     expenditure. Not surprisingly, Bryan's population is almost \n     half African-American or Latino, while College Station is \n     three-quarters white.\n       With 30 million American school children eligible for Pell \n     Grants for Kids, my fellow fiscal conservatives are probably \n     raising an eyebrow. But please listen. Every year, Congress \n     appropriates increases in funding for kindergarten through \n     the 12th grade. What I am offering here is a plan to earmark \n     most of these new dollars--aside from increases in spending \n     for children with disabilities--for parents to spend on \n     educational programs of their choice. Otherwise, we will \n     continue to invest in the same bureaucracies that have \n     disappointed poor and minority families for too long.\n       Pell Grants for Kids could be implemented gradually, \n     starting with kindergarten and 1st grade at an initial cost \n     of $2.5 billion. If the program had been in place during \n     President Bush's first two years in office, the extra $4.5 \n     billion spent on K-12 education--again, not counting another \n     $3 billion for children with disabilities--would have \n     created $500 scholarships for all nine million middle- and \n     low-income students through the 3rd grade.\n       We have had 50 years to deliver an American education on \n     equal terms to all students. But a baffling commitment to the \n     status quo has prevented us from living up to Brown's noble \n     legacy. This anniversary presents the perfect opportunity to \n     inaugurate a new era, one that uses the strategy that helped \n     to create the best colleges to help create the best schools. \n     Let us start with Pell Grants for Kids and move on from there \n     ``with all deliberate speed.''\n       I would like to make several additional remarks about Pell \n     Grants for Kids.\n       As I mentioned, the idea is a pretty simple one--\n     significantly new federal dollars, fewer federal strings, and \n     more say by parents about how the money is spent.\n       To give you an idea of how much money that would be, I have \n     taken a quick look at my home state of Tennessee. Tennessee \n     has 938,000 students in kindergarten through the 12th grade. \n     Pell Grants for Kids would be eligible to all those students \n     who are from families below the state median income. The \n     state median income for a family of four in Tennessee is \n     about $56,000. So for families who have an income of $56,000 \n     or below, each of their children would have a $500 \n     scholarship that would follow that child to the school or \n     other approved academic program of his or her parents' \n     choice.\n       In June I hope to introduce a piece of legislation, \n     hopefully with a bipartisan group of senators. In July, Sen. \n     Gregg and I have already discussed a hearing, which we will \n     have in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \n     And then perhaps next year, the President of the United \n     States might want to make this a part of his budget.\n       I believe it is time in this country to recognize we need \n     to give poor and middle-income parents more of the same \n     choices of educational opportunities wealthier families have \n     and that we may be able to do this without harming our public \n     schools. We have had, since World War II, scholarships that \n     have followed students to the educational institutions of \n     their choice, and they have done nothing but help to create \n     opportunity and create the best system of colleges and \n     universities in the world. I think we ought to use the same \n     idea to try to create the best schools in the world.\n       We estimate about 60 percent of all of Tennessee students \n     would be eligible for a $500 Pell grant. In some of the rural \n     counties where there are a great many poor children, it might \n     be 90 percent of the students. In other places--such as \n     Davidson County, Maryville, and Oak Ridge--it might be a \n     smaller percentage.\n       But all in all, there should be about 562,000 students in \n     Tennessee who would be eligible. This would bring an \n     additional $281 million to Tennessee for K-12 education, and \n     parents would have a say over how that money is spent.\n       Often when this issue comes up and we talk about spending \n     more federal dollars for local schools, the senators on my \n     side of the aisle get a little hot under the collar. We do \n     not want to spend any more federal money for local schools. \n     On the other hand, when we say let's give the parents more \n     say on how the money is spent, the collars get a little hot \n     on the other side of the aisle because they are reluctant to \n     give parents more choice.\n       This is a conflict of principles. It is the principle of \n     equal opportunity--giving parents more choices. But there is \n     another valid principle on the other side. It is called ``e \n     pluribus unum.'' We have public schools, common schools, to \n     teach our common culture, and we do not want to harm them. It \n     is a proper debate in this body to say--let's ask questions, \n     if we are giving parents more say, more choices. Will that \n     harm our common schools? And there is a proper way to ask in \n     this Senate: Can we wisely spend that much more money? This \n     is quite a bit more money.\n       Fully funded, Pell Grants for Kids programs would cost $15 \n     billion in new federal dollars a year. It would add about \n     $500 to the $600 we now spend on each of the children in \n     America today from the federal government. Only about 7 or 8 \n     percent of the dollars we spend on children comes from the \n     federal government. So it would be about a 70 percent \n     increase in federal funding for every middle- or low-income \n     child fully funded.\n       We are proposing to do this over a long period of time. \n     Basically, to add to the new money that we would appropriate \n     every year for K-12 and give most of that to Pell Grants for \n     Kids. This would create more equality in funding for poor \n     districts. It would especially help African-American and \n     minority kids. It would provide extra dollars to implement \n     the standards of No Child Left Behind, and it would introduce \n     for the first time into our K-12 system the principle that \n     has created\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\n     the best colleges in the world--the idea of letting money \n     follow students to the institution of their choice.\n       Over the next several weeks, I will be discussing this with \n     individual senators. I have not prepared a piece of \n     legislation yet because I don't want to stand up and say: \n     here it is, take it or leave it. Let's say one team says no \n     choice and one team says no money, then we are back where we \n     were. I am looking for ways to advance the debate.\n       I don't believe we are going to be spending much more money \n     through the federal government in the same way we are doing \n     it today. A lot of senators, and I am one of them, do not \n     want to spend more federal dollars through programs that have \n     lots of federal controls. We have seen the limit of command \n     and control from Washington, D.C., with No Child Left Behind. \n     That program will work. But I don't believe we can expect to \n     give many more orders from Washington to make schools in \n     Schenectady, Nashville, and Anniston, Alabama and Sacramento, \n     better. That has to happen in local communities.\n       The right strategy is significantly new federal dollars \n     with fewer federal strings and more parental say about how \n     those dollars are spent. This does not have to be a \n     Republican versus Democrat idea. I am not the author of this \n     idea.\n       In 1947, the G.I. bill for Veterans was enacted. Since that \n     time, federal dollars have followed students to the colleges \n     of their choice. Today, 60 percent of America's college \n     students have a federal grant or loan that follows them to \n     the college of their choice.\n       When I was president of the University of Tennessee, it \n     never occurred to me to say to the Congress: I hope you do \n     not appropriate any money for children to go to Howard \n     University or Notre Dame or Brigham Young or Vanderbilt or \n     Morehouse or the University of Alabama. We give people \n     choices. Or put it another way, in my neck of the woods, what \n     if we told everyone where they had to go to college? What if \n     we said, Sen. Sessions, you have to go to the University of \n     Tennessee. We said to young Lamar Alexander: You have to go \n     to University of Alabama. Civil wars have been fought over \n     such things.\n       That is exactly what we do in K-12. We give people choice \n     and have created the best colleges in the world. We give them \n     no choices, and we have schools that we wish were better. So \n     the idea would be to try what worked for colleges here in K-\n     12.\n       I said I was not the only one to think of this. There was \n     the G.I. bill for Veterans--that was bipartisan--after World \n     War II; maybe the best piece of social legislation we ever \n     passed in the history of our country.\n       In 1968, Ted Sizer, perhaps the most renowned educator in \n     America today, proposed a poor children's Bill of Rights: \n     $5,000 for every poor child to go to any school of his or her \n     choice, an LBJ power-of-the-people, liberal, Democratic idea \n     at the time. In 1970, President Nixon proposed, basically, \n     giving grants to poor children to choose among all schools. \n     The man who wrote that speech for President Nixon was a man \n     named Pat Moynihan. He was a U.S. Senator. In 1979, he and \n     Sen. Ribicoff, two Democrats, introduced essentially exactly \n     the idea I am proposing today. In fact, in 1979 Sens. \n     Ribicoff and Moynihan proposed amending the Federal Pell \n     Grant Act and simply applying it to elementary and secondary \n     students.\n       At that time, when the Pell grant was $200 to $1,800, a 3rd \n     grader could get a Pell grant, or if you were a high school \n     student and you were poor, you could get a Pell grant.\n       Senator Moynihan said to this body in 1979: ``Precisely the \n     same reason ought to apply to elementary and secondary \n     schooling--if, that is, we are serious about educational and \n     pluralism and providing educational choice to low- and \n     middle-income families similar to those routinely available \n     to upper income families.''\n       This was the impulse behind the basic educational \n     opportunity grants program as enacted by Congress in 1972. He \n     was talking about Pell grants. It was the impulse by the \n     presidential message to Congress which I drafted in 1970 \n     which proposed such a program. It is the impulse to provide \n     equality of educational opportunity to every American, and it \n     is as legitimate and important an impulse at the primary and \n     secondary school level as it is at the college level.\n       I am going to strongly urge my colleagues not to make a \n     reflexive reaction to this idea because, on the one hand, it \n     has too much money, or on the other hand, it has some choice. \n     Think back over our history and think of our future and \n     realize we have the best colleges and we do not have the best \n     schools. Why don't we use the formula that created the best \n     colleges to help create the best schools?\n       I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \n     Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks Sen. \n     Moynihan's statement in the Senate in 1980, and following \n     Sen. Moynihan's remarks, an article which I wrote for the \n     publication Education Next, which is being published this \n     week, entitled ``Putting Parents in Charge.''\n       This article goes into some detail about the Pell Grants \n     for Kids proposal. I look forward over the next several weeks \n     to working with my colleagues, accepting their ideas and \n     suggestions about how we improve our schools.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk (John Merlino) proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S11-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11-S12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FIFTY YEARS IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my multivolume history of the Senate, I \nnoted that the Senate is ``the anchor of our republic.'' It is, I \nwrote, ``the morning and evening star in the American constitutional \nconstellation.'' Today, I recall those words because I am even more \nconvinced that the Senate still stands as the great forum of \nconstitutional American liberty.\n  For five decades--that is a pretty long time--I have seen this Senate \nweather the storms of adversity, withstand the barbs of cynics and the \nattacks of critics as it provided continuous stability and strength to \nour great country during periods of strife and uncertainty. The Senate \nhas served our country so well because great and courageous Senators \nhave always been willing to stay the course through the continuum and \nto keep the faith. The Senate will continue to do so as long as there \nare Members of the Senate who understand the Senate's constitutional \nrole and who zealously guard the Senate's powers.\n  It has been said that this institution--meaning the Senate--has a \nlife of its own. That may be true. I also know from my 50 years of \nservice in this Chamber that the life of the Senate is rooted in the \ncharacter of the men and the women who serve in the Senate. During my \nfive decades of service here, I have had the high honor and the great \nprivilege of serving with some of the finest and a few of the greatest \nSenators in history. This distinguished list includes my mentors, \nSenator Richard Brevard Russell, Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson, Senator \nJohn Calhoun Stennis, and Senator Mike Mansfield. It includes the great \nMargaret K. Smith, who never for a moment hesitated to follow her \nconscience. It includes Barry Goldwater, and it includes Phil Gramm, \nboth of whom were spear carriers for the Reagan revolution. It includes \nthose giants of the Senate, Howard Baker and Mark Hatfield, both of \nwhom exemplified stunning political courage. And of course any list of \ngreats must include our own beloved Ted Kennedy, who went from being a \nbitter adversary in the beginning of my years to my dearest friend. It \nhas been an honor and a great privilege to have served with these \nSenators and with so many others who have contributed and who still \ncontribute to the Senate to make it the great institution it has \nbecome. I hope and I pray to the Good Lord that in my 50 years here, I \nhave also made a small but positive contribution, and I pray that I \nwill continue to do so.\n  Because of the good people of West Virginia, my half century--my 50 \nyears--of service in this Chamber has allowed the foster son of an \nimpoverished coal miner from the hills of southern West Virginia--and \nthe wife of that coal miner to have a son--to have the opportunity to \nwalk with Kings, to meet with Prime Ministers, and to debate with \nPresidents. I have had the privilege not only to witness but also to \nparticipate in much of America's history. From the beginning and the \napex of the Cold War to the collapse of the Soviet Union, from my \nopposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act to my role in securing the \nfunds for the building of the memorial to Martin Luther King, from my \nsupport for the war in Vietnam to my opposition to Mr. Bush's war with \nIraq, I have served here, and I have loved every second of every \nblessed minute of it.\n  My half century of service in the great Senate has also allowed me to \nexperience profound changes in this institution. Unfortunately, not all \nof them have been for the best.\n  During my tenure, especially in recent years, this Chamber has become \nbitterly partisan. All of us already know this, so I will not belabor \nthe point other than to say we should do better. I will point out that \nwe should do something about the vitriol before it destroys the Senate \nand the people's faith in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\n  If anyone thinks I am exaggerating, I will give just one example. The \nfilibuster is a prime guarantee of the principle of minority rights in \nthe Senate. The filibuster is a device by which a single Senator can \nbring the Senate to a halt if that Senator believes his cause is \njust. But our partisan warfare has often transformed this unique, \nfundamental Senate tool into a political weapon which has been abused. \nAs a result, there have lately been efforts to abolish it. If this \nshould ever happen, a vital and historic protection of the liberties of \nthe American people will be lost, and the Senate will cease to function \nas the one institution that has provided protection for the views and \nthe prerogatives of a minority.\n\n  I lament the ever-increasing costs of running for a Senate seat. In \n1958, Jennings Randolph and I spent a combined $50,000 to win the two \nSenate seats in West Virginia. Today, Senators can expect to spend \nabout $7 million. Too much of a lawmaker's time, too much of a \nlawmaker's energy is now consumed in raising money for the next \nelection or to pay off the last one.\n  I lament that too many legislators in both parties continue to regard \nthe Chief Executive in a roll much more elevated than the Framers of \nthe Constitution ever intended. The Framers of the Constitution did not \nenvision the Office of the President of the United States as having the \nattributes of royalty. We as legislators have a responsibility to work \nwith the Chief Executive, but it was intended for this to be a two-way \nstreet, not a one-way street. The Senate must again rise and be the \ncoequal branch of Government which the Constitution of the United \nStates intended it to be.\n  I lament the decline of the thoroughness of Senate committee \nhearings. In its classic study, ``Congressional Government,'' Woodrow \nWilson pointed out that the ``informing function of Congress is its \nmost important function.'' This was revealed in 1973 when, after 8 days \nof hearings and after hours upon hours of questioning, L. Patrick Gray, \nPresident Nixon's nominee to be Director of the FBI, revealed that \nWhite House counselor John Dean had lied--lied--lied--to FBI \ninvestigators, thus beginning the unraveling of the Watergate coverup. \nToday, we have the knowledge this could not happen with the time \nrestrictions that are in place on the Senate's hearings.\n  I am pleased to say that during my half century in the Senate, there \nhave also been positive changes in the Senate. I will mention a few. \nThe first is the Senate has become more open and the Senate has become \nmore constituent friendly. This was highlighted in 1986 when television \ncameras were finally installed and the American people all across this \ncountry could watch their Senators debate the issues of the day on C-\nSPAN. I am proud to have been a part--though a small part--but a part \nof that innovation.\n  During my tenure, the Senate has become more open and it has become \nmore diverse. When I came here in 1959, there was only one--one female \nSenator. In the 111th Congress, there are 17 women in the Senate. In \nthe 50 years prior to my service, not a single--not one African \nAmerican was elected to the Senate. During my 50 years here, three \nAfrican Americans have been elected to the Senate. This is a small \nnumber, but one of those three has now been elected to the highest \noffice in the land--President of the United States. So, my fellow \ncolleagues, we have come a very, very, very long way.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by simply acknowledging it has been a \nwonderful 50 years serving in this ``great forum of constitutional \nAmerican liberty.'' I only wish my darling wife, who now sings in the \nheavenly choir above, were here today to say with me that I look \nforward--yes, look forward to the next 50 years. Amen. Amen.\n  That concludes my remarks.\n  I yield the floor and I say good night to the Chair and all the \npeople here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S12-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MINNESOTA SENATE RACE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, the opening of a new Congress is always \nan important moment in the life of our Nation. Every time a gavel falls \non a new legislative term, we are reminded of the grandeur of the \ndocument we are sworn to uphold. We are grateful to the citizens of our \nrespective States--in my case the people of Kentucky--who give us the \nopportunity to serve. We are thankful once again that the U.S. \nConstitution has endured to guarantee the freedom and the prosperity of \nso many for so long.\n  The growth of our Nation over the years is one of the most remarkable \nfeats of man, and it was far from inevitable. When Congress first \norganized under the Constitution, the United States consisted of 11 \nStates and 3 million citizens. Today, more people than that live in \nKentucky alone. Yet despite a bloody Civil War, the arrival of millions \nof immigrants, economic collapse, World Wars, social unrest, and the \nlong-delayed realization of America's original promise of equality for \nall, we have come together as a body and as a nation. We have not just \nendured these things, we have flourished, and that is well worth \nremembering and celebrating as the 111th Congress convenes.\n  As we meet in January of 2009, America faces many serious challenges. \nNone is more urgent than our troubled economy. President-elect Obama \nwas one of those who recognized the gravity of the current troubles \nearly on. He reassured many by fielding a solid team of economic \nadvisers. He agrees with Republicans that we should put more money in \nthe pockets of middle-class American families by cutting their taxes, \nand he has proposed working with Republicans to create jobs and to \nencourage long-term economic stability with a massive domestic spending \nbill the details of which Members of Congress and the American people \nare increasingly eager to see.\n  After a long and rough campaign season, it is encouraging for many \nAmericans to see that the two parties in Washington are in broad \nagreement about something so important to their daily lives. And \nRepublicans will work with President-elect Obama to make sure that as \nwe consider this legislation the taxpayer is not taken for a ride.\n  All of us agree the economy needs help. We are concerned and \ntaxpayers are concerned. But if we are going to appropriate an \nunprecedented amount of money from the Treasury for this spending bill, \nit is absolutely essential that we determine up front whether the \nspending is going to be wasteful or wise.\n  Specifically, the American people should have at least a week, and it \nlooks as if we will have more than that, to see what this enormous \nspending plan includes. President Clinton proposed a $16 billion \nstimulus package in his first year in office. Congress, back in 1993, \nrejected it for being too expensive. Now Democrats in Congress are \nproposing a stimulus that would\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\ncost taxpayers more than 50 times what President Clinton's would have \ncost.\n  This potentially $1 trillion bill would be one of the largest \nspending bills in U.S. history. It would increase the deficit by a half \ntrillion dollars overnight and deepen an already enormous national \ndebt.\n  Before we all agree to it, the American people need to see the \ndetails. They need to be able to see for themselves whether this is \nmoney well spent. If lawmakers think it is, then they need to make a \nconvincing case to the people who are paying for it.\n  Now, 16 years ago we rejected a similar stimulus the size of the \nMinnesota State budget. We should not be rushed into voting for a bill \nthat, by any estimate, will be bigger than all 50 State budgets \ncombined, especially when many of the jobs it promises will not even \nmaterialize for another year. If we are serious about protecting the \ntaxpayer, these projects will be awarded through a fair and open \nprocess and allowed to compete with other priorities in the budget. We \nshould encourage, not discourage, questions about this bill in a \nreckless rush to meet an arbitrary deadline. We should be open to new \nideas aimed at protecting the taxpayer.\n  Here are three new ideas worth considering: Congressional Democrats \nhave talked about sending hundreds of billions of dollars to the \nStates. If we loan those funds rather than give them away, States will \nbe far less likely to spend the money frivolously, and the taxpayer \nwould have greater assurance their money is well spent.\n  Idea No. 2: Congress has had nearly 1 year to review the fiscal 2009 \nspending requests. These remaining bills now make up a $400 billion \nOmnibus appropriations bill. This is a bill that meets the level of \nspending proposed for the stimulus, and it is a bill that could pass \nCongress by Inauguration Day. If speed is one of the goals, it strikes \nme that passing the omnibus achieves that goal.\n  Idea No. 3, middle-class tax relief: One way to get more money into \npeople's pockets quickly is to increase the size of their paychecks \nimmediately. An immediate 10 percent cut in taxes for nearly 30 million \nAmericans would provide a significant jolt to the economy that all of \nus want. These are ideas on which both parties could agree. Each of \nthem is designed to protect and empower the taxpayer. So let's consider \nthem. But either way the American people should be in on this spending \nplan because the potential for waste and abuse is enormous.\n  Now, some loose-lipped local politicians have already described the \ngrant as ``free money'' from Washington. Others openly hope to use it \non frivolous pet projects that no sensible taxpayer would sign off on \nif they had a choice. The American people do not want to be pick-\npocketed. They do not want to be taken advantage of. They want a real \nreturn on their investment, and all of us should be eager to show that \nwe understand the difference.\n  President-elect Obama has said a stimulus plan will have to create \njobs, have an immediate impact, and lead to the strengthening of the \nlong-term economy. Republicans agree, and we will help to ensure just \nthat by insisting on scrutiny and oversight in the face of pressure on \ncongressional Democrats from interest groups and local politicians.\n  Here is an issue on which the Republicans and Democrats can work \ntogether for a positive result for the American people. My hope is that \nonce we achieve it, we will have a model to build on for the remainder \nof the 111th Congress. The opportunities for cooperation are numerous. \nThroughout his campaign, President-elect Obama spoke about the \nimportance of a strong national defense. He spoke of the need to reduce \nthe national debt. He vowed to go through the budget line by line to \ncut wasteful programs. He pledged to cut taxes on virtually all \nAmericans and on small business. And he promised to put America on the \npath to energy independence within the next 10 years. These are all \ngoals Republicans support. At this moment, nothing should stand in the \nway of our achieving them together.\n\n  I have told the new President I am eager to work with him. I have \ntold him he can expect cooperation on the confirmation of qualified \nnominees to key Cabinet posts so the American people do not have to \nworry about a power vacuum at places such as the Pentagon, the State \nDepartment, Treasury, or Homeland Security. I have discussed with him \nsomething he already knows but which is worth repeating on the first \nday of the new Congress. When it comes to new Presidents, history \noffers a clear path, a clear path to success and a clear path to \nfailure.\n  Some new Presidents have chosen to work with the other party to \nconfront the big issues of the day that neither party is willing or \nable to tackle on its own. Others have decided they would rather team \nup with members of their own party and focus on narrow, partisan issues \nthat only appeal to a tiny sliver of the populace but which lack the \nsupport of the American mainstream.\n  In my view, the choice at this particular moment is clear. If the new \nPresident pursues the former course, our chances of achieving a \npositive for the American people will be strong. The parties will \ncontinue to disagree. This is good for democracy, but political \nconflict is not an end in itself. At this moment we have an opportunity \nto show the American people, and we know that.\n  The majority leader has mentioned that this year the opening of \nCongress coincides with two important anniversaries. The first is \nSenator Byrd's 50th anniversary. This feat of longevity has no equal in \nthe history of this body, and this is quite fitting for a Senator who \nhas no equal in the history of this body.\n  When Robert Carlyle Byrd took the oath of office on January 5, 1959, \nhe could not have known that he would be the longest serving Senator in \nU.S. history or that he would one day write this body's definitive \nhistory. But through the support of his beloved Erma, his legendary \ndevotion to our Constitution, and his tireless will to improve the \nlives of the people of his State, the senior Senator from West Virginia \nhas accomplished a remarkable feat, and today we honor him for it.\n  The other anniversary we commemorate today is no doubt dear to \nSenator Byrd's heart because 150 years ago this very month the Senate \nmoved from its old home down the hall, where we had the reenactment of \nthe swearing in of new Senators today--its old home down the hall, to \nthe room we are in now. This transition meant far more in its day than \nthe mere packing of books and rearranging of desks because back then, \nas now, every expansion of the Capitol has come with a fresh \nrealization of the great adaptability of the U.S. Constitution and is \nfurther proof of its greatness.\n  According to the Congressional Record, the man who was selected to \nspeak on the occasion of the Senate's relocation in 1859 was John \nBreckenridge, a Democrat and a Kentuckian who served as Vice President \nunder President Buchanan.\n  In his remarks, Breckenridge offered an eloquent lesson on the \nhistory of the Senate and, after paying appropriate tribute to the \nheroes of the Revolution, he made an intriguing suggestion to the \nSenators of his day. Breckenridge suggested that the Senators of 1859 \nhad an even greater responsibility than the Senators of 1789 because, \nas he put it, ``the population, extent, and the power of our country \nsurpass the dawning promise of its origin.''\n  If this was true in 1859, it is truer still in 2009. Americans have \nseen quite vividly over the past 8 years, and even over the past few \nmonths, that the challenges which confront America and our response to \nthose challenges have a powerful effect on the wider world.\n  Not a single Member of this body is unaware of the profound impact of \nhis or her decisions. And that is why not a single Senator in this body \nwishes anything but the best to President-elect Obama.\n  Despite party differences, all of us feel a certain institutional \npride in having one of our own in the White House. And every American \nwill feel a special national pride when, for the first time in our \nNation's history, an African American man raises his hand to recite the \noath of office from the Capitol steps.\n  The President-elect has promised leadership that sees beyond the \npolitics of division. But that responsibility\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\ndoes not rest with the President alone. It rests with all of us. Before \nInauguration Day, there is the opening of this 111th Congress. This too \nis a great civic ritual. And this too should renew our optimism about \nthe future of America and our optimism about achieving something \nimportant for the American people over these next 2 years. Now is our \nchance to deliver--not just in word, but in deed. This is a solemn \ncharge. For some, it might cut against the grain. But if we are to have \na future worthy of our past, it is a charge that must be kept.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the approaching hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee on the nomination of Eric Holder to be Attorney \nGeneral, I thought it might be useful to frame some of the issues and \nput them into perspective, at least my perspective, in advance of the \nhearings, and to advise Mr. Holder in some greater detail than our \nbrief meeting, when he paid his courtesy call a few weeks ago, to \ndiscuss some of those issues so he would be in a better position to \nrespond.\n  I begin with the view that I wish to be helpful to President-elect \nObama in his dealings with the enormous problems which face our Nation. \nI have come to know President-elect Obama in his capacity as Senator \nfor the last 4 years. His office is right down the hallway. I consider \nhim a friend, and certainly we are in need of action on some of the \nenormous problems our Nation faces. We approach these problems in the \ncontext of our constitutional roles. The Constitution, in article I, \ngives certain powers to the Congress and, in article II, certain powers \nto the executive branch. The core of our constitutional Government is \nchecks and balances so we have that responsibility to have oversight \nand to give our candid judgments. Frequently, it is more helpful to say \nno than to say yes. When we deal with the position of Attorney General, \nwe have a role which is significantly different from other Cabinet \nofficers.\n  For example, Cabinet officers carry out the President's policies on a \nwide variety of issues and, to an extent, so does the Attorney General. \nBut the Attorney General has a significantly different role in his \nresponsibility to the people and to the rule of law. Senator Leahy and \nI wrote extensively on this subject, published last October in \nPolitico.\n  Some Attorneys General have been very compliant with the \nadministration and have not fared very well historically. Attorney \nGeneral Harry Daugherty was sullied by the Teapot Dome scandal. \nAlthough ultimately cleared, he resigned amid allegations of \nimpropriety. We had the Attorney General during the administration of \nPresident Roosevelt, Attorney General Homer Cummings, who yielded to \nthe court-packing plan, certainly not the sort of institutional \nintegrity which we would look for in an Attorney General. Some \nAttorneys General have been very diligent. Perhaps the best example is \nAttorney General Elliot Richardson, who resigned rather than fire \nSpecial Prosecutor Archibald Cox during the administration of President \nNixon, and Deputy Attorney General Bill Ruckelshaus followed suit.\n  In today's press, there are reports about the distinguished career of \nAttorney General Griffin Bell, who just died. One of the hallmarks of \nAttorney General Bell's career was his willingness to say no to \nPresident Carter, who had appointed him. President Carter, it is \nreported, wanted a certain prosecution brought. Attorney General Bell \nsaid that it wasn't an appropriate matter for a criminal prosecution. \nAttorney General Bell advised President Carter that the way he would \nget that prosecution brought would be to appoint a compliant Attorney \nGeneral, that he would resign before he would undertake that \nprosecution.\n  We have seen, regrettably, with the administration of Attorney \nGeneral Alberto Gonzales, yielding to the Executive will without \nupholding the rule of law; the hearings conducted by the Judiciary \nCommittee, for which I was ranking member, over the termination of U.S. \nattorneys; the attitude of Attorney General Gonzales on habeas corpus, \ntestifying that there was no positive grant of habeas corpus in the \nConstitution, notwithstanding the explicit clause which says habeas \ncorpus may be suspended only in time of rebellion or invasion. So this \nis a very key and critical appointment.\n  The Attorney General also has enormous responsibilities in advising \nthe President more generally on the scope of Executive authority. Mr. \nHolder will doubtless be questioned at some length on the issue of the \nterrorist surveillance program, warrantless wiretaps, and the meaning \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; and where does \ncongressional authority under article I stop on the flat prohibition \nagainst wiretaps without warrants, contrasted with the Executive's \npower as Commander in Chief under article II; and what are the Attorney \nGeneral designate's views on attorney-client privilege restrictions, a \nmatter which he initiated in 1999 and which has seen further \nrestrictions in the Thompson memorandum and subsequently. Last Congress \nI introduced legislation to try to deal with that. There is also the \nreporter's privilege issue, where the Department of Justice has opposed \nthe privilege for reporters where they have been held in contempt. A \nNew York Times reporter was held in jail for some 85 days after the \nsource of the confidential disclosure had been addressed. These are \njust a few of the issues which we will be looking at in the \nconfirmation hearings of Attorney General Holder.\n  With respect to Mr. Holder, specifically, he has had an outstanding \nacademic and professional record--I acknowledged that early on--\nprestigious college and law school, Columbia; a judge of the District \nof Columbia Superior Court; involved in Department of Justice \nprosecution teams; and later served as Deputy Attorney General. But \naside from these qualifications on Mr. Holder's resume, there is also \nthe issue of character. Sometimes it is more important for the Attorney \nGeneral to have the stature and the courage to say no instead of to say \nyes.\n  There are three specific matters which will be inquired into during \nthe course of Mr. Holder's confirmation hearing. The first one involves \na highly publicized pardon, the Marc Rich pardon. Mr. Holder testified \nhe was ``not intimately involved'' in the Rich pardon and he assumed \nthat regular procedures were being followed. But when you take a look \nat some of the details as to what was disclosed in the hearing by the \nHouse of Representatives and in the hearing in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, which I chaired 15 months after the pardon, Mr. Holder met \nprivately with Mr. Rich's attorney. According to Mr. Holder's own \ntestimony, he tried to facilitate a meeting between the prosecutors in \nthe Southern District of New York and Rich's attorney. Rich's attorney, \nMr. Quinn, testified that Mr. Holder advised him to go straight to the \nWhite House rather than through the pardon office, which is the regular \nprocedure. Mr. Quinn produced an e-mail from himself to a colleague \nwith the subject line ``Eric,'' in which he noted that ``he says go \nstraight to the WH, also says timing is good. We should get it in \nsoon.''\n  That is not conclusive, but these are matters to be inquired into. \nThe pardon attorney was opposed to the pardon, but he never issued a \nrecommendation because he didn't think the pardon was under serious \nconsideration. Then the White House requested Mr. Holder's opinion, and \nhe is quoted as saying that he was ``neutral, leaning towards \nfavorable'' on the pardon.\n  On this case of the record, with the very close connections between \nMr. Rich and very sizable contributions to the Clinton library and very \nsizable contributions to President Clinton's party, these questions \ninevitably arise and have not been answered satisfactorily. During the \ncourse of the hearings, both in the House and in the Senate, where I \nchaired the full committee hearing, the claim of executive privilege \nwas made. We face a little different situation when we are looking at a \nconfirmation hearing for Attorney General, in terms of the legitimate \nscope of Senators' inquiry which will be pursued. It ought to be \nfocused on the fact that the charges against Rich were very serious. \nThey involved tax evasion, fraud, trading with the enemy,\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nwith Iran. It should also be emphasized that the U.S. attorney who \nprosecuted the case was opposed to the pardon and, in fact, refused to \nmeet with Mr. Rich.\n  The second issue which requires a hearing on the issue of character \nand the determination as to whether Mr. Holder was yielding to the \nPresident to give him or the Vice President a conclusion they wanted to \nhear was the issue of the appointment of an independent counsel on the \nallegations that Vice President Gore engaged in fundraising from the \nWhite House in violation of Federal law.\n  Mr. Holder, in his capacity as Deputy Attorney General, was advising \nAttorney General Reno. Attorney General Reno came to the conclusion \nthat independent counsel ought not to be appointed. The House of \nRepresentatives committee filed this report:\n\n       . . . the failure of the Attorney General to follow the law \n     and appoint an independent counsel for the entire campaign \n     finance investigation has been the subject of two sets of \n     Committee hearings. FBI Director Louis Freeh and the Attorney \n     General's hand-picked Chief Prosecutor, Charles LaBella, \n     wrote lengthy memos to the Attorney General advising her that \n     she must appoint an Independent Counsel under the mandatory \n     section of the Independent Counsel Statute. . . .\n\n  That mandatory section does not leave it to the discretion of the \nAttorney General, but the Attorney General declined to appoint \nindependent counsel.\n  In hearings conducted before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee, which \nI chaired, Attorney General Reno was questioned extensively on the \nevidence, which showed that hard money was being discussed as the \nmatter of fundraising to be undertaken by Vice President Gore.\n  Attorney General Reno did not consider a very critical piece of \nevidence written by a man named Strauss who had attended the meetings. \nThe Strauss memo contained the notation of a certain percentage of hard \nmoney and a certain percentage of soft money. Attorney General Reno did \nnot consider that because, as she testified, it did not refresh the \nrecollection of Mr. Strauss.\n  Well, there are a number of exceptions to the hearsay rule. One is \nwhen a piece of paper is reviewed by a witness and it refreshes his \nprior recollection, and another is when the witness testifies that the \nnotes were made contemporaneously with the discussion and it \nconstitutes prior recollection recorded, which is an exception to the \nhearsay rule and the witness does not have to remember what had \noccurred.\n  That critical piece of evidence was not considered by Attorney \nGeneral Reno. So here again are issues which are appropriate for \ninquiry on the character issue.\n  On the issue of whether Mr. Holder will exercise sufficient \nindependence, Vice President Gore sought to explain to the FBI that he \nwas out of the room a good bit of the time of the discussion because, \nas he had put it, he had consumed a lot of iced tea on that occasion. \nWell, these are matters which the independent counsel statute was \ndesigned to deal with, to conduct a further investigation, to consider \nall of the ramifications, and not to show favoritism because the \nsubject of an investigation happened to be the Vice President of the \nUnited States. Mr. Holder's role in advising the Attorney General on \nthat matter, his role as Deputy Attorney General, is an appropriate \nmatter for inquiry.\n  The third issue to be inquired into involves the hearings on the so-\ncalled FALN organization, the Armed Forces of Puerto Rican \nNationalists. The FALN was an organization linked to over 150 bombings, \nthreats, kidnappings, and other events which resulted in the deaths of \nat least six people and the injuries of many more between 1974 and \n1983. Four of the persons who received clemency were convicted of \ninvolvement in the $7 million armed robbery of a Wells Fargo office.\n  In the face of this kind of conduct, and in the face of a report by \nthe pardon attorney in the Department of Justice, the actions of Deputy \nAttorney General Holder were very extensive in what eventuated in the \ngranting of clemency.\n  The Department of Justice sent the matter back for another \nevaluation, apparently dissatisfied with the recommendation of the \npardon attorney that the clemency application ought to be denied.\n  On this second occasion, according to press accounts, the submission \nby the pardon attorney ``made no specific recommendation'' regarding \nclemency, but it did reflect that the FBI and two U.S. attorneys' \noffices opposed clemency. Notwithstanding that record, clemency was \ngranted. It is an appropriate matter for inquiry to see specifically \nwhat role Mr. Holder played.\n  Senator Hatch, who was the chairman of the committee at that time, \nhad this to say about the conclusion:\n\n       President Clinton, who up to this point had only commuted \n     three sentences . . . offered clemency to 16 members of FALN. \n     This to me, and really almost every Member of Congress, was \n     shocking.\n\n  Senator Leahy joined in the criticism of the grant and raised the \nquestion about the failure of the Department of Justice to contact the \nvictims. The matter came before the Senate, which rejected and \ncriticized the grant of the clemency by a vote of 95 to 2.\n  All of these matters relate to judgment and relate to whether Mr. \nHolder had the kind of resoluteness displayed by Attorney General \nGriffin Bell or Attorney General Elliot Richardson to say no to his \nsuperior.\n  In raising these concerns, I am raising questions. I will approach \nthese hearings next week--a week from Thursday--with an open mind to \ngive Mr. Holder an opportunity to explain his conduct and his actions \nand to see if, on the totality of the record, he displays the requisite \ncharacter and judgment and can justify the actions in these sorts of \nmatters which would warrant the confidence of the Judiciary Committee, \nreally representing the confidence of the American people.\n  After our experience with Attorney General Gonzales, and given the \nexperience of other Attorneys General in the past and the very critical \nrole which they play in upholding the rule of law, these are the sorts \nof issues which ought to be aired. Mr. Holder ought to have his day in \ncourt, so to speak--the hearing before the Judiciary Committee--to see \nif he can state the case which would warrant his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a detailed statement be \nprinted in the Record at this point in full. What I have tried to do is \nto summarize a more detailed statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Holder Floor Statement\n\n       With the Judiciary Committee hearings approaching on the \n     nomination of the Attorney General-designate Eric H. Holder, \n     Jr., I think it would be useful to put some of the issues \n     into perspective, at least my perspective. I begin with the \n     view to help President-elect Obama deal with the enormous \n     problems facing our nation. I worked with then-Senator Obama; \n     I had an office close to his on the 7th floor of the Hart \n     Building, and consider him a friend. I sent a congratulatory \n     letter after the election and was pleased to get his \n     telephone call to discuss working together in the new year.\n       The fundamentals of our continuing relationship will be \n     governed by the Constitution. Separation of powers and checks \n     and balances are the basic precepts of dealings between the \n     Congress (Article I) and the Executive (Article II). My \n     record demonstrates my willingness to cross party lines when \n     I consider it appropriate--frequently to my own political \n     disadvantage.\n       The Constitution requires the President's choice for \n     Attorney General to be confirmed by the Senate--specifically, \n     with the Senate's ``advice and consent.'' On June 13, 2005, \n     in the context of a possible Supreme Court nomination, \n     Senator Leahy described his opinion of the role of the Senate \n     as prescribed by this clause stating: ``The Constitution \n     provides that the President `shall nominate, and by and with \n     the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint' judges. \n     For advice to be meaningful it needs to be informed and \n     shared among those providing it. . . . Bipartisan \n     consultation would not only make any Supreme Court selection \n     a better one, it would also reassure the Senate and the \n     American people that the process of selecting a Supreme Court \n     justice has not become politicized.'' (Cong. Rec. S6389) \n     Senator Leahy's statement is at least relevant, if not \n     equally applicable, to Mr. Holder's nomination. History \n     demonstrates that presidents who seek the advice of members \n     of the Senate prior to submitting a nomination frequently see \n     their nominees confirmed more quickly and with less \n     controversy than those who do not. A recent example is that \n     of President Clinton who consulted with then-Chairman Hatch \n     prior to nominating Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Justice \n     Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court. Both nominees were \n     confirmed with minimal controversy.\n       In contrast, on the nomination of Mr. Holder, President-\n     elect Obama chose not to\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n     seek my advice or even to give me advance notice, in my \n     capacity as Ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \n     which is his prerogative. Had he done so, I could have given \n     him some facts about Mr. Holder's background that he might \n     not have known, based on my experience on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee. For example, in 1999, I chaired a Senate \n     Judiciary Committee oversight task force that investigated \n     whether the Department of Justice fulfilled its \n     responsibilities in investigating the Waco siege, Chinese \n     nuclear spying, and alleged campaign-finance abuses by \n     Democrats during the 1996 elections. As part of that \n     investigation, I chaired six hearings before the Judiciary \n     Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n     Courts, during which we heard from numerous witnesses and \n     reviewed many documents. The insight gained during that \n     investigation might have been valuable to President-elect \n     Obama, because Mr. Holder was Deputy Attorney General (DAG) \n     of the Justice Department from 1997 until 2001 and, \n     therefore, played a pivotal role in determining the level and \n     scope of the Justice Department's investigation of these \n     important matters. I also chaired the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee's 2001 hearing on the controversial pardons of \n     international fugitives Marc Rich and Pincus Green. During \n     that hearing, the Committee heard testimony from Mr. Holder \n     on his role in those pardons. I will describe some of the \n     details on those matters shortly. Based on my role on those \n     investigations, I could have provided President-elect Obama \n     with information on Mr. Holder that he might not otherwise \n     have had and might have found useful.\n       Seeking to be helpful to the new administration does not \n     necessarily mean agreement on all matters. Sometimes saying \n     ``no'' may be more helpful, but may not appear to be at the \n     time.\n       I acknowledge the many good features about Mr. Holder's \n     education and professional background. He received his B.A. \n     from Columbia University in 1973 and his J.D. from Columbia \n     Law School in 1976. Following law school, Mr. Holder pursued \n     a career in public service, first as a trial attorney in the \n     Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice, then \n     as an Associate Judge for the Superior Court of the District \n     of Columbia, next as the United States Attorney for D.C., and \n     then as Deputy Attorney General and, for a short period, as \n     Acting Attorney General. Following his tenure at the \n     Department of Justice, Mr. Holder joined the D.C. office of \n     Covington & Burling, LLP as a partner.\n       In addition to the accomplishments on a nominee's resume, \n     however, there is a critical qualification of character in \n     upholding principles when tempted to yield to expediency by \n     being a ``yes man'' to please a superior or to accommodate a \n     friend. As Chairman Leahy and I noted in an op-ed we co-\n     authored last October and published in Politico, \n     ``[I]ndependence is also an indispensable quality in an \n     attorney general. . . . Regrettably, we have seen what \n     happens when an attorney general ignores this basic tenet and \n     considers the president, not the American people, as his \n     principal. We must ensure that the rule of law never plays \n     second fiddle to the partisan desires of political \n     operatives.''\n       American history provides several examples of Attorneys \n     General whose independence was tested; some succumbed to \n     being ``yes men'' and some resolutely said ``no.'' One \n     example of an Attorney General who may have been swayed by \n     political pressure was Harry M. Daugherty (51st Attorney \n     General under Presidents Harding and Coolidge, 1921-1924). In \n     1924, the Senate launched an investigation into the failure \n     of the Attorney General to prosecute those implicated in the \n     Teapot Dome Scandal, which was headed by Democratic Senator \n     Burton K. Wheeler of Montana. The investigation included an \n     examination of Mr. Daugherty's involvement in the scandal and \n     why he failed to prosecute the Secretary of the Interior and \n     others implicated. Although Mr. Daugherty was eventually \n     cleared of all charges, his failure to aggressively prosecute \n     those involved, combined with allegations that he obstructed \n     justice by trying to block the congressional investigation, \n     resulted in a loss of confidence in him. Mr. Daugherty \n     resigned in March 1924, prior to the conclusion of the \n     investigation.\n       Another example is that of Homer S. Cummings (55th Attorney \n     General under President Franklin Roosevelt, 1933-1939). \n     Frustrated with several Supreme Court decisions declaring New \n     Deal programs unconstitutional, President Roosevelt asked Mr. \n     Cummings to secretly draft a bill that would have added one \n     new judge for every judge who refused to retire at age 70. \n     This proposal, which came to be known as the ``court-packing \n     plan,'' could have created as many as six vacancies on the \n     Supreme Court as well as a number of lower court vacancies. \n     The resulting legislation was widely criticized as an overt \n     political plan to circumvent the Supreme Court. The plan was \n     never enacted, in part, because Justice Owen Roberts, who had \n     traditionally voted against New Deal legislation, started \n     voting with the ``liberal'' wing and upholding such measures. \n     Justice Roberts' apparent about-face in jurisprudence is \n     known as ``the switch in time that saved nine.''\n       A third and possibly the most egregious example is that of \n     John N. Mitchell (67th Attorney General under President \n     Nixon, 1969-1972). In 1974, Mr. Mitchell was indicted for \n     conspiracy, obstruction of justice, giving false testimony to \n     a grand jury, and perjury, for his role in the Watergate \n     break-in and cover-up. He was convicted of these charges in \n     1975 and sentenced to two-and-a-half to eight years in \n     prison.\n       In contrast, probably the most memorable example of an \n     Attorney General who did not bend to political pressure is \n     that of Elliot L. Richardson (69th Attorney General under \n     President Nixon, 1973). On October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered \n     Richardson to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald \n     Cox. Mr. Richardson and his deputy attorney general, William \n     D. Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the order.\n       Another example is President Lincoln's attorney general, \n     Edward Bates (26th Attorney General, 1861-1864). Even in the \n     midst of the Civil War, Bates did not hesitate to express \n     independent judgment. Bates disagreed with President Lincoln \n     on a number of issues that arose from the war, including \n     Lincoln's desire to allow West Virginia to be admitted as a \n     state. In part because he was unable to convince Lincoln to \n     agree with him, Mr. Bates resigned from office.\n       The Attorney General is unlike any other cabinet officer \n     whose duty it is to carry out the President's policy. The \n     Attorney General has a corollary, independent responsibility \n     to the people to uphold the rule of law. Chairman Leahy and I \n     mentioned this responsibility in the aforementioned Politico \n     op-ed stating, ``[t]he attorney general's duty is to uphold \n     the Constitution and the rule of law, not to circumvent them. \n     The president and the American people are best served by an \n     attorney general who gives sound advice and takes responsible \n     action, rather than one who develops legalistic loopholes to \n     serve the partisan ends of a particular administration.''\n       After our recent experience with Attorney General Gonzales, \n     it is imperative that the Attorney General undertake and \n     effectuate that responsibility of independence. Mr. Gonzales \n     left office accused of politicizing the Justice Department, \n     failing to restrain Executive overreaching, and being less \n     than forthcoming with Congress. Even before becoming Attorney \n     General, we now know that he pushed Attorney General Ashcroft \n     to approve the President's surveillance program over the \n     objections of high-level Justice Department officials. Once \n     in office, he either abdicated his responsibility to \n     subordinates or was complicit in the questionable firings of \n     several U.S. Attorneys, depending on which of his statements \n     one accepts as true. And, he repeatedly defended aggressive \n     Administration positions that appeared dismissive of Congress \n     and the Courts. Indeed, in his zeal for the Administration's \n     policy on detainees, he even questioned the constitutional \n     basis for habeas corpus review. On January 18, 2007, when he \n     testified before the Judiciary Committee, it was astounding \n     to hear his claim that ``there is no express grant of habeas \n     in the constitution.'' When I pressed him on the point, he \n     replied ``the constitution does not say every individual in \n     the United States or every citizen is hereby granted or \n     assured the right to habeas. It simply says the right of \n     habeas corpus shall not be suspended.'' Later, the Detroit \n     Free Press editorialized: ``The moment when Alberto Gonzales \n     proved he was just wrong for the job of U.S. attorney general \n     came . . . after Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked him about \n     the constitutional guarantee of criminal due process, known \n     as habeas corpus.'' I am convinced that many of Attorney \n     General Gonzales' missteps were caused by his eagerness to \n     please the White House.\n       Similarly, when Mr. Holder was serving as DAG to President \n     Clinton, some of his actions raised concerns about his \n     ability to maintain his independence from the president. The \n     most widely reported incident involved the aforementioned \n     controversial pardon of fugitive Marc Rich. Mr. Rich fled the \n     country in 1983 after a federal grand jury in New York \n     returned a 51-count indictment against him, his partner, and \n     his company, which included allegations of tax evasion, \n     fraud, and trading with the enemy (Iran, during the hostage \n     crisis). Those charges carried a maximum sentence of 300 \n     years in prison. On January 20, 2001, President Clinton \n     granted Rich a pardon that did not follow the regular pardon \n     procedures. Mr. Rich never appeared for trial, had attempted \n     to ship subpoenaed documents out of the country, and was \n     still a fugitive. Prior to his pardon, he had been listed on \n     the FBI's ``Ten Most Wanted'' fugitives list. Further \n     tainting his pardon was the fact that his ex-wife wife had \n     donated large sums to the Democratic Party ($867,000), to the \n     Clinton Library ($450,000) and had donated $66,300 to \n     individual Democratic candidates.\n       On February 8 and March 1, 2001, the House Committee on \n     Government Reform held two hearings on the pardons of Rich \n     and others made during President Clinton's final days in \n     office. On February 14, 2001, I chaired a full Judiciary \n     Committee hearing on the controversial pardons. At the \n     Judiciary Committee hearing, Roger Adams, DOJ's Pardon \n     Attorney, testified that ``none of the regular procedures . . \n     . were followed'' with regard to the Rich and Green pardons.\n       Mr. Holder testified that he was not ``intimately \n     involved'' in the Rich pardon, and that he assumed that the \n     regular procedures were being followed. Mr. Holder said that, \n     the night before the pardon was granted, White House Counsel \n     Beth Nolan contacted him to ask his position on the pardon \n     request. Mr. Holder stated that he had reservations about the \n     pardon request since Mr. Rich was still a fugitive and \n     because it was clear that the prosecutors involved would\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n     not support the request, but he ultimately told Ms. Nolan \n     that he was ``neutral, leaning towards favorable'' on the \n     request. He testified that one factor influencing his \n     decision was the assertion that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud \n     Barak had weighed in strongly in favor of the request; \n     therefore, the granting of the request might have foreign \n     policy benefits. He made no inquiry, however, as to whether \n     that was true.\n       Notwithstanding, based on these hearings, serious questions \n     have been raised regarding Mr. Holder's candor while \n     testifying before Congress. (Jerry Seper, Holder Testimony on \n     Pardon Questioned, The Washington Times, Dec. 18, 2008) In \n     response to a question from Congressman Burton, Mr. Holder \n     testified that he had ``only a passing familiarity with the \n     underlying facts of the Rich case.'' (The Controversial \n     Pardon of International Fugitive Marc Rich: Hearing Before \n     the House Comm. on Govt. Reform, 107th Cong. 193 (2001) \n     (statement of Mr. Eric Holder)) Despite this assertion, \n     correspondence with the Justice Department obtained by the \n     House Committee and testimony from other witnesses shows \n     that, 15 months before the pardon, Mr. Holder met privately \n     with Mr. Rich's attorney and received a presentation about \n     what Mr. Rich's defense believed were flaws in the \n     government's case. (Id. at 175-76) Further, according to Mr. \n     Holder's own testimony, he tried to facilitate a meeting \n     between the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York \n     and Rich's attorney, Mr. Jack Quinn, over a year before the \n     pardons were granted. (President Clinton's Eleventh Hour \n     Pardons: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, \n     107th Cong. 31 (2001))\n       Allegations have also been raised that Mr. Holder was \n     responsible for the deviation from normal pardon procedures. \n     Allegedly, Mr. Quinn wrote to and spoke with Mr. Holder \n     several times between November 2000 and the night of January \n     19, 2001, and primarily relied on him for guidance and \n     information rather than the pardon office. Mr. Quinn \n     testified that Mr. Holder advised him to go straight to the \n     White House rather than through the pardon office, and Mr. \n     Quinn produced an email from himself to a colleague with the \n     subject line ``eric'' in which he noted that ``he says go \n     straight to wh. also says timing is good. we shd get in \n     soon.'' (The Controversial Pardon of International Fugitive \n     Marc Rich: Hearing Before the House Comm. on Govt. Reform, \n     107th Cong. 640 (2001) (email from Jack Quinn)) Mr. Holder \n     denied that he told Mr. Quinn to go straight to the White \n     House (Id. at 204) and maintained that he thought the regular \n     pardon procedures were being followed; however, he admitted \n     that he never spoke to anyone either in the pardon office or \n     in his own office about whether the Rich pardon petition had \n     been received. (President Clinton's Eleventh Hour Pardons: \n     Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 107th Cong. \n     30 (2001).\n       Finally, Mr. Holder testified that he had at least one \n     conversation with Mr. Quinn about a potential Attorney \n     General position in Al Gore's possible administration while \n     the Rich pardon was pending, and that he was sending Mr. \n     Quinn the resumes of people on his staff and asking for his \n     help in finding them jobs after Clinton left office. (The \n     Controversial Pardon of International Fugitive Marc Rich: \n     Hearing Before the House Comm. on Govt. Reform, 107th Cong. \n     202 (2001)) Mr. Holder noted, however, that the actions he \n     took with regard to the Rich pardon were done after the \n     election had been decided in favor of President George W. \n     Bush when the Attorney General position was no longer an \n     option.\n       While serving as DAG, Mr. Holder also was intimately \n     involved in the decision-making process that resulted in \n     Attorney General Janet Reno rejecting the Department of \n     Justice and FBI task force's recommendation to appoint an \n     independent counsel to probe the allegations of fund-raising \n     abuses by Vice President Al Gore during the 1996 presidential \n     campaign. (David Johnston, Reno Aides Recommend Against \n     Outside Counsel, Austin American-Statesman, Nov. 22, 1997; \n     Deputy Attorney General Holds Justice Department Weekly Media \n     Availability, FDCH Political Transcripts, Dec. 18, 1997; US \n     Seeks to Verify Chinese Campaign Influence, The Bulletin's \n     Frontrunner, Feb. 13, 1998; John Bresnahan, Hatch May Hold \n     New Hearings to Pressure Reno on 1996 Campaign Finance \n     Violations, Roll Call, May 11, 1998; Michael Kirkland, Reno \n     Gets Advice from Freeh on Gore Probe, United Press \n     International, July 27, 2000) The House Committee on \n     Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Governmental \n     Affairs both conducted extensive investigations of the fund-\n     raising activities. Both Committees found significant \n     evidence of wrongdoing and recommended that the Attorney \n     General appoint an independent counsel to investigate \n     further. In its report on the investigation, the House \n     Committee wrote: ``the failure of the Attorney General to \n     follow the law and appoint an independent counsel for the \n     entire campaign finance investigation has been the subject of \n     two sets of Committee hearings. FBI Director Louis Freeh and \n     the Attorney General's hand-picked Chief Prosecutor, Charles \n     La Bella, wrote lengthy memos to the Attorney General \n     advising her that she must appoint an Independent Counsel \n     under the mandatory section of the Independent Counsel \n     Statute. . . . Until an independent counsel is appointed in \n     this matter, the American people cannot be assured that the \n     same standards of justice will be applied to the President \n     and Vice-President as apply to every other citizen.'' \n     (Investigation of Political Fundraising Improprieties and \n     Possible Violations of Law, Interim Report, H.R. Rep. No. \n     105-829, Sixth Rep., Vol. 1, at 3 (1998))\n       Following these two Committees' investigations, I chaired a \n     special task force to examine whether the Justice Department \n     fulfilled its responsibilities in investigating these \n     matters. That lengthy investigation of the campaign finance \n     scandal included six hearings before the Judiciary \n     Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n     Courts and brought to light important, previously unknown \n     information, including the fact that campaign task force head \n     Robert Conrad (who replaced Charles LaBella as the head of \n     the task force) also had recommended that Attorney General \n     Reno appoint a special prosecutor in addition to the prior \n     recommendations of FBI Director Louis Freeh and Mr. LaBella.\n       After reading Mr. Conrad's report, which was only provided \n     to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena, I discovered that \n     Mr. Conrad also had recommended the appointment of a special \n     counsel. I questioned Attorney General Janet Reno during a \n     Judiciary Committee hearing about a number of Mr. Conrad's \n     findings to determine whether a special prosecutor was \n     required. For example, Mr. Conrad's report raised questions \n     as to the veracity of Vice President Gore's statements about \n     fund raising telephone calls he made from the White House. \n     According to federal law, if the money Gore raised through \n     the calls was so-called ``soft money,'' it was not \n     a contribution and was not prohibited from being raised on \n     federal property. But, if it was so-called ``hard money,'' \n     then Gore may have violated the law. Mr. Conrad had \n     questioned Gore about the issue, and Gore contended that \n     he did not know that hard money was to be raised. But, the \n     question remained as to what Gore knew when he made the \n     calls.\n       I questioned the Attorney General at some length about the \n     specific facts that had been produced in the investigation of \n     Gore's statements. For example, there was evidence that four \n     witnesses testified about a meeting on November 21, 1995, \n     where Gore was in attendance, where they discussed raising \n     hard money. Evidence of this meeting supported the conclusion \n     that Gore knew hard money was the objective prior to making \n     the phone calls. (The 1996 Campaign Finance Investigations: \n     Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 106th Cong. \n     107-09 (2000)) I questioned Reno extensively about the fact \n     that she discounted the evidence from David Strauss, who was \n     the deputy Chief of Staff for Gore, who had made \n     contemporaneous notes at this November 21, 1995 meeting about \n     the discussion. Strauss had written: ``Sixty-five percent \n     soft, thirty-five percent hard,'' showing that hard and soft \n     money had been discussed at the meeting. Strauss later said \n     he could not remember what was discussed at the meeting. Reno \n     did not consider Strauss' notes because he said they did not \n     refresh his recollection. (Id. at 108) I pointed out to Reno \n     that Strauss' notes constituted competent evidence as an \n     exception to the hearsay rule as ``prior recollection \n     recorded.'' It was not determinative that Strauss said he did \n     not remember even after he looked at his notes since the \n     notes were valid evidence of ``prior recollection recorded.'' \n     (Federal Rule of Evidence 803(5)) I asked Reno if she was \n     familiar with the rule of evidence ``prior recollection \n     recorded'' and her responses indicated that she was not. (The \n     1996 Campaign Finance Investigations: Hearing Before the \n     Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 106th Cong. 108-09, 112-113 \n     (2000)) She apparently did not understand the difference \n     between ``recollection refreshed'' and ``prior recollection \n     recorded.''\n       In my legal judgment, the evidence supported the \n     appointment of Independent Counsel as recommended by Freeh, \n     LaBella, and Conrad--especially if the Straus's notes had \n     been considered. Further investigation by Independent Counsel \n     was warranted to determine if favoritism had been shown to \n     the Vice President. Press reports indicate that Reno \n     consulted Holder throughout the investigation.

The FALN organization had been linked to \n     over 150 bombings, threats, kidnappings, and other events \n     which resulted in the death of at least six people and the \n     injury of many more between 1974 and 1983. (Clemency for FALN \n     Members: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, \n     106th Cong. 1 (1999) (statement of Chairman Hatch)) For \n     example, four of the persons who received clemency were \n     convicted of involvement in the $7.2 million armed robbery of \n     a Wells Fargo office in 1983 (half of the money reportedly \n     ended up with the Cuban Government and\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\n     was used to train and finance the robbers). (Edmund H. \n     Mahony, Clinton-Era Sentence Reductions Could Trip Holder's \n     Confirmation, The Hartford Courant, Dec. 28, 2008) The grant \n     of clemency was opposed by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons, the Fraternal Order of Police, victims of the FALN \n     bombings, and two United States Attorneys. (Clemency for FALN \n     Members: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, \n     106th Cong. 1 (1999) (statement of Chairman Hatch)) In \n     addition to the concerns over granting clemency to persons \n     convicted of being involved in terrorist activities, serious \n     allegations have been raised that the normal clemency process \n     was not followed.\n       The FALN pardon process had an unusual beginning. In 1993, \n     a mass letter writing campaign was started to urge the \n     release of the FALN terrorists. The imprisoned terrorists did \n     not recognize the right of the U.S. government to hold them \n     in custody and refused to personally petition for clemency; \n     therefore, their attorneys petitioned on their behalf. One of \n     these attorneys was Dr. Luis Nieves-Falcon, who was later \n     identified as an FALN member. (Threat Assessment, U.S. Dept. \n     of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, FBI Counterterrorism \n     Center, June 30, 1999. See also Draft Threat Assessment, U.S. \n     Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, FBI \n     Counterterrorism Center, July 22, 1998) Although prisoners \n     typically file individual petitions for clemency, then-DAG \n     Philip Heymann's office agreed to treat the attorney-\n     signed petitions as valid petitions.\n       The White House received thousands of letters from the \n     Puerto Rican community advocating for the release of the \n     terrorists, and three Puerto Rican Members of Congress, Jose \n     Serrano, Luis Gutierrez, and Nydia Velaquez, pushed for a \n     meeting with the White House to advocate for clemency. In \n     July 1994, then-Pardon Attorney Margaret Colgate Love met \n     with pro-clemency attorneys, and in 1995, she met with \n     religious leaders seeking clemency. In the spring and fall of \n     1996, Jack Quinn, the White House Counsel, also met with pro-\n     clemency activists.\n       In December 1996, Margaret Love sent a report to the White \n     House recommending against clemency for the FALN prisoners. \n     (Hearing on Clemency for FALN Members Before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, 105th Cong. 149 (Appendix, Letter from \n     Margaret Colgate Love to Charles F.C. Ruff, July 25, 1997)) \n     Later that month, White House officials met with pro-clemency \n     religious leaders. White House and DOJ officials continued to \n     meet with pro-clemency activists and the lawyers for the \n     terrorists throughout 1997, 1998 and 1999, until they were \n     pardoned on August 11, 1999.\n       Mr. Holder met with the Puerto Rican Members of Congress on \n     November 5, 1997. At the meeting, Mr. Holder asked how the \n     prisoners had changed. Congressman Gutierrez promised to \n     supply in writing a statement from the prisoners on that \n     subject. After the meeting, Mr. Holder directed the Pardon \n     Attorney who replaced Margaret Love in November, Roger Adams, \n     to follow-up with Congressman Gutierrez's staff, since, \n     according to the Pardon Attorney's notes, ``[w]e are getting \n     ready to finish up our report and recommendation fairly soon, \n     and would like to have the statement on repentance to \n     include.'' (Roger Adams' Notes on DAG Holder's Meeting with \n     Puerto Rican Congressmen, Nov. 5, 1997. Roger Adams' follow-\n     up telephone call notes for Enrique Fernandez and Doug \n     Scofield.)\n       Mr. Holder had at least two additional meetings with pro-\n     clemency advocates. On March 26, 1998, he met with President \n     Carter's pro-clemency representative, and on April 8, 1998, \n     he met with pro-clemency religious leaders. According to \n     notes from this meeting, the religious leaders provided a \n     mixed message as to whether the FALN terrorists had renounced \n     the use of violence. (Memorandum to file from Roger Adams on \n     meeting with FALN supporters, April 8, 1998) The leaders \n     provided Mr. Holder with a statement that the prisoners would \n     sign to show how they had changed. The statement, however, \n     did not contain a clear renunciation of violence. (SJC \n     Archive Document: Statement from the Puerto Rican Political \n     Prisoners)\n       In the summer of 1999, Pardon Attorney Roger Adams \n     allegedly submitted to the White House a second document on \n     the FALN clemency, referred to as the ``options paper.'' \n     According to press accounts, this paper ``made no specific \n     recommendation'' regarding clemency, but it did reflect that \n     the FBI and two U.S. Attorney's Offices opposed clemency. \n     (Hearing on Clemency for FALN Members Before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, 105th Cong. 94-95 (statement of Chairman \n     Hatch); David Johnston, Clinton Went Against Advice on \n     Clemency, Orlando Sentinel, Aug. 27, 1999) A recent press \n     report cites an unnamed administration official who states \n     that Mr. Holder recommended the grant of clemency and asserts \n     that Mr. Holder's recommendation in favor of commutation \n     accompanied Mr. Adams' ``options paper.'' (Edmund H. Mahony, \n     Clinton-Era Sentence Reductions Could Trip Holder's \n     Confirmation, The Hartford Courant, Dec. 28, 2008) Mr. \n     Holder's alleged recommendation in favor of the commutations \n     contrasted with opposition by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons, the Fraternal Order of Police, victims of the FALN \n     bombings, and two United States Attorneys. In August, the \n     terrorists were granted clemency.\n       On September 14, 1999, the Senate passed a joint resolution \n     by a vote of 95-2 stating that President Clinton should not \n     have made this grant. (S.J. Res 33, 106th Cong. (1999)) The \n     House passed a similar resolution on September 9, 1999, by a \n     vote of 311-41. (H. Con. Res. 180, 106th Cong. (1999))\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee held two hearings on the \n     FALN commutations, one on September 15 and another on October \n     20, 1999. At these hearings, ten members of the Committee, \n     both Republicans and Democrats, expressed their concern over \n     these grants of clemency. Chairman Hatch stated in his \n     opening statement before the Committee: ``President Clinton, \n     who up to this point had only commuted three sentences since \n     becoming President, offered clemency to 16 members of the \n     FALN. This to me, and really almost every Member of Congress, \n     was shocking. And, quite frankly, I think I am joined by a \n     vast majority of Americans in my failure to understand why \n     the President, who has spoken out so boldly in opposition to \n     domestic terrorism in recent years, has taken this kind of an \n     action.'' Clemency for FALN Members: Hearing Before the \n     Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 106th Cong. 1 (1999) \n     (statement of Chairman Hatch) Then-Ranking Member Leahy \n     agreed stating: ``I did not agree with the President's \n     recent clemency decision . . . (Id. at 6 (statement of \n     Sen. Leahy))\n       Mr. Holder testified at the October 20th hearing, but he \n     refused to answer a number of questions citing executive \n     privilege. As summarized in recent press accounts, he \n     ``conceded that bombing victims were not consulted about \n     clemency, but declined to answer substantive questions, \n     including why the Office of the Pardon Attorney issued two \n     inconsistent reports and why those getting sentence \n     commutations were never pressed to provide information about \n     fugitive co-defendants.'' (Edmund H. Mahony, Clinton-Era \n     Sentence Reductions Could Trip Holder's Confirmation, The \n     Hartford Courant, Dec. 28, 2008) Mr. Holder did testify, \n     however, that the 1996 recommendation against clemency \n     existed and that following the report there were ``subsequent \n     communications'' between DOJ and the White House. (Clemency \n     for FALN Members: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the \n     Judiciary, 106th Cong. 97, 122 (1999) (statement of Eric \n     Holder, Deputy Attorney General)) Asserting executive \n     privilege, he would not discuss the ``options paper'' or \n     state if that document contained a recommendation. (Id. at \n     97, 120-21)\n       During the hearing, the Judiciary Committee also learned \n     that victims and groups opposing clemency were not consulted \n     prior to the grant of clemency. A number of Senators \n     articulated their concern over this lack of consultation, \n     which prompted Senator Leahy to send a letter to Attorney \n     General Reno after the hearing expressing his concern over \n     the clemency process and, in particular, his alarm that the \n     victims of the FALN terrorists were not contacted prior to \n     the grant of clemency. He wrote: ``I was troubled to learn \n     through both press reports and testimony at a recent \n     committee hearing that victims of some of the bombings \n     perpetrated by the FALN were not consulted or even contacted \n     with regard to the clemency offers made to some members of \n     that organization. Indeed, one victim reported that he \n     learned of the clemency offers through a relative who had \n     heard media reports.'' (Id. at 139 (letter from Senator Leahy \n     to Attorney General Reno))\n       The timing of the FALN clemency was especially curious \n     given then-recent threat assessments issued by the Justice \n     Department. In October 1999, Attorney General Reno released a \n     five-year interagency counterterrorism and technology crime \n     plan that acknowledged the threat posed by the FALN \n     terrorists. The report stated that, ``Factors which increase \n     the present threat from these groups [the FALN and Los \n     Macheteros] include . . . the impending release from prison \n     of members of these groups jailed for prior violence.'' \n     (Five-Year Interagency Counterterrorism and Technology Crime \n     Plan, Unclassified Edition, Department of Justice, Sept. \n     1999) Since this report was issued by the DAG's office, Mr. \n     Holder was questioned about the report at a press conference. \n     He stated that the report was talking about ``the possibility \n     that people from among other groups, the FALN, were going to \n     be released over the next few years.'' (Email from Patrick \n     O'Brien with Talking Points and Press Conference Excerpts, \n     Oct. 21, 1999)\n       Another matter worthy of consideration during the hearing \n     concerns the circumstances of Margaret Love's departure from \n     the Pardon Office. Margaret Love served as Pardon Attorney \n     from 1990 to November 1997. Ms. Love, 20-year veteran of the \n     Department, was removed from office by Mr. Holder based on \n     charges of mismanagement after she recommended against the \n     commutations of the FALN terrorists and shortly after Mr. \n     Holder was confirmed as DAG in July 1997. She was replaced by \n     Roger Adams, a member of Mr. Holder's staff. I believe \n     questions surrounding her removal from office should be \n     raised with Mr. Holder.\n       It is significant that, on these three matters, Mr. Holder \n     overruled the advice of career professionals. With regard to \n     the Rich and Green pardons, Mr. Holder told White House \n     counsel Beth Nolan that he was ``neutral, leaning towards \n     favorable'' on the pardon despite the express opposition of \n     the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the \n     career attorneys who prosecuted the case, and the FBI. \n     Further, prior to Mr. Holder's statement to Ms. Nolan, pardon \n     attorney Roger Adams had contacted Mr. Holder to express his \n     concerns regarding\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\n     Rich's fugitive status and the charges for arms trading.\n       In the FALN commutations matter, press accounts indicate \n     the Mr. Holder submitted a recommendation in favor of those \n     clemency requests even though the initial recommendation by \n     Pardon Attorney Margaret Love opposed the commutations and \n     the grants were opposed by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons, the Fraternal Order of Police, victims of the FALN \n     bombings, and two United States Attorneys.\n       Finally, while the record is unclear as to Mr. Holder's \n     precise role in the campaign finance investigation, it is \n     clear that Attorney General Reno consulted Mr. Holder on \n     these matters and that the recommendations of the heads of \n     the campaign finance special task force, Charles LaBella and \n     Robert Conrad, as well as the recommendation of FBI \n     Director Louis Freeh, for the appointment of Independent \n     Counsel were overruled.\n       These matters require further questioning. In two of them, \n     Mr. Holder appears to be serving the interests of his \n     superiors. There is an underlying issue about Mr. Holder not \n     following the recommendations of career attorneys. As Senator \n     Leahy and I noted in our op-ed ``the attorney general must be \n     someone who deeply appreciates and respects the work and \n     commitment of the thousands of men and women who work in the \n     branches and divisions of the Justice Department day in and \n     day out, without regard to politics or ideology, doing their \n     best to enforce the law and promote justice.'' It is to be \n     expected that politically appointed federal officers will not \n     always follow the advice of career staff, but this pattern is \n     troubling.\n       In raising these concerns, I am not passing judgment on the \n     nominee. I am prepared to give Mr. Holder a full opportunity \n     to explain his past actions and convince the Committee and \n     the Senate that his record warrants confirmation. Indeed, it \n     may be helpful for him to have advance notice of these \n     specific concerns of mine to give him notice so he can \n     prepare for the hearing. With considerable experience in \n     confirmation hearings, including eleven Supreme Court \n     nominations, I have learned to keep an open mind without \n     prejudgment until the nominees have had their ``day in \n     court''--that is in the Judiciary Committee hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S20]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SEC INVESTIGATION INTO PEQUOT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT TRADING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Finance Committee, under the \nchairmanship of Senator Grassley in the 109th Congress, and the \nJudiciary Committee, under my chairmanship in the 109th Congress, \nconducted an extensive inquiry into allegations of insider trading. The \nissue is succinctly framed in a letter which I wrote to Christopher \nCox, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in a letter \ndated December 24, 2008. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthis letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The matter could be most succinctly articulated by \nquoting from parts of this letter as follows:\n\n       Dear Chairman Cox:\n       Senator Charles Grassley and I have already issued public \n     findings concerning the Securities and Exchange Commission's \n     . . . investigation into Pequot Capital Management's . . . \n     suspicious trading.\n\n  Referring to insider trading.\n\n       These findings also criticized the original Office of \n     Inspector General's report, which essentially ignored former \n     SEC investigator Gary Aguirre's complaints of political \n     influence in the Pequot investigation . . . after the new SEC \n     Inspector General, David Kotz, largely agreed with our \n     findings and recommended disciplinary action against Mr. \n     Aguirre's supervisors up to the Director of Enforcement, the \n     SEC selected an initiating official who, in a matter of days, \n     found that disciplinary action was unwarranted. That official \n     was described in press accounts as an Administrative Law \n     Judge, and it was not until further inquiry that the SEC \n     admitted she was not acting in a judicial capacity in issuing \n     her decision. I am now writing because recent events provide \n     the SEC with an opportunity to make good on its Pequot \n     investigation, despite having . . . closed the case in \n     November 2006.\n       . . . The investigation centered, in part, on evidence that \n     David Zilkha, a Microsoft employee who joined Pequot in April \n     2001 and separated from Pequot in November 2001, may have \n     given Arthur Samberg, Pequot's CEO, inside information \n     regarding Microsoft.\n       Documents recently filed in a Connecticut divorce case \n     (Zilkha v. Zilkha) disclose that Pequot has made or promised \n     to make payments of $2.1 million to Mr. David Zilkha. On \n     December 1, 2008, and December 16, 2008, Pequot and Pequot \n     CEO Arthur Samberg filed motions for protective orders, and \n     the state court has scheduled the hearing on those motions \n     for January 16, 2009.\n       On December 10, 2008, Senator Grassley and I requested from \n     Pequot and Mr. Samberg all records related to the payments to \n     Mr. Zilkha, as well as an explanation of the payments. On \n     December 17, 2008, Mr. Samberg responded that the payments to \n     Mr. Zilkha were for the purpose of ``settling a civil claim \n     related to his employment and termination by Pequot.'' Mr. \n     Samberg enclosed a few documents, but we have requested \n     additional records, and have asked for a complete production.\n       Given the troubled history of this case, the SEC should \n     also be seeking answers as to any payments made to Mr. Zilkha \n     by Pequot. I therefore write to strongly urge the SEC to \n     consider filing pleadings in the Connecticut action, so that \n     the court will have all relevant information when it \n     considers the Pequot and Samberg motions for protective \n     orders.\n\n  In essence, we have serious allegations of insider trading. We have \nthe Inspector General of the SEC recommending serious disciplinary \naction. We have the matter being papered over by the SEC on what \npurported to be new conclusions reached by the administrative law judge \nwhere, in fact, the individual was not an administrative law judge. And \nnow we find $2.1 million in payments or promised payments to an \nindividual who may have been in the position to provide insider \ninformation. The matter is coming before a court in a domestic \nrelations case, but that provides an opportunity to find those facts.\n  This letter has not been answered, and I am taking this occasion to \nput it into the Congressional Record in the hopes that we may have some \naction by the SEC which will be calculated to get to the bottom of this \nmatter. Certainly, this is something that ought to be of major concern \nto the Securities and Exchange Commissioners, to the Chairman, and to \nthe SEC, generally.\n\n  The Finance Committee and the Judiciary Committee, through the \nefforts of Senator Grassley and myself, have gone to very substantial \nlengths to deal with this issue. Oversight by the Congress is very hard \nto pick up these complex matters and get into them, but a lot of work \nhas been done, and we are still undertaking to try to get to the bottom \nof the allegations of insider trading. The issue now has turned to be \ngreater than insider trading on one specific matter, but to the \nintegrity of the SEC itself, in pursuing these kinds of allegations and \nin following the facts wherever they may lead.\n  Chairman Cox has limited additional tenure, but there is sufficient \ntime for him to act if he will, and if he will not, Senator Grassley \nand I may seek to intervene ourselves. This is something which is the \nprimary responsibility of the SEC, and it would be my hope that \nChairman Cox would act on this matter to intervene, file an amicus \nbrief, find out what the facts are on that $2.1 million to get to the \nbottom of these serious allegations of insider trading.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 24, 2008.\n     Hon. Christopher Cox,\n     Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F. \n         Street, N.E., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cox: Senator Charles Grassley and I have \n     already issued public findings concerning the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') bungled investigation into \n     Pequot Capital Management's (``Pequot'') suspicious trading. \n     These findings also criticized the original Office of \n     Inspector General's report, which essentially ignored former \n     SEC investigator Gary Aguirre's complaints of political \n     influence in the Pequot investigation. You welcomed our \n     findings and worked to implement our recommendations. \n     Nonetheless, after the new SEC Inspector General, David Kotz, \n     largely agreed with our findings and recommended disciplinary \n     action against Mr. Aguirre's supervisors up to the Director \n     of Enforcement, the SEC selected an initiating official who, \n     in a matter of days, found that disciplinary action was \n     unwarranted. That official was described in press accounts as \n     an Administrative Law Judge, and it was not until further \n     inquiry that the SEC admitted she was not acting in a \n     judicial capacity in issuing her decision. I am now writing \n     because recent events provide the SEC with an opportunity to \n     make good on its Pequot investigation, despite having \n     precipitously and unjustifiably closed the case in November \n     2006.\n       In 2006, the SEC closed its investigation of April 2001 \n     trading by Pequot in Microsoft stock. The investigation \n     centered, in part, on evidence that David Zilkha, a Microsoft \n     employee who joined Pequot in April 2001 and separated from \n     Pequot in November 2001, may have given Arthur Samberg, \n     Pequot's CEO, inside information regarding Microsoft.\n       Documents recently filed in a Connecticut divorce case \n     (Zilkha v. Zilkha) disclose that Pequot has made or promised \n     to make payments of $2.1 million to David Zilkha. On December \n     1, 2008, and December 16, 2008, Pequot and Pequot CEO Arthur \n     Samberg filed motions for protective orders, and the state \n     court has scheduled the hearing on those motions for January \n     16, 2009.\n       On December 10, 2008, Senator Grassley and I requested from \n     Pequot and Mr. Samberg all\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n     records related to the payments to Mr. Zilkha, as well as an \n     explanation of the payments. On December 17, 2008, Mr. \n     Samberg responded that the payments to Mr. Zilkha were for \n     the purpose of ``settling a civil claim related to his \n     employment and termination by Pequot.''

I therefore write to strongly urge the SEC to \n     consider filing pleadings in the Connecticut action, so that \n     the court will have all relevant information when it \n     considers the Pequot and Samberg motions for protective \n     orders. Please respond as to whether the SEC will take such \n     an action. I also ask that you notify me immediately if the \n     SEC reopens its investigation or takes any enforcement action \n     in light of this new evidence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to address two \nsubjects, the first will be about Israel and the second about the \npassing of Griffin Bell.\n  All of us are deeply concerned with the conditions in the Middle \nEast, most recently in the last 12 days, the actions in Gaza, the loss \nof human life and the conflict.\n  But there is a necessary perspective we all must understand. In \nNovember of 2007, I stood at the last Israeli outpost overlooking Gaza. \nIn fact, if you watch Fox or CNN or NBC or ABC tonight, where you will \nsee those reports coming from, I stood on that very spot just a little \nover a year ago.\n  Also, I went to Sderot, the Israeli settlement outside Gaza, that \nsince mid year last year has received 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 missile attacks, \nrandom attacks coming out of Gaza dropping on this Israeli settlement \nfor no reason at all but the absolute ability or desire to terrorize \nthe Israeli people and destroy that settlement.\n  What Israel has done by moving into Gaza is a major military \noperation. In some reports that you see on television or you read about \nin the papers, you would think it was unprovoked and unnecessary. The \nopposite is true. It has been provoked for 15 months by Hamas in Gaza. \nThe Israelis have finally drawn a line in the sand and they have moved \nin to try to protect the best interests of their citizens.\n  For perspective, Gaza and Sderot are a little bit like Arlington and \nWashington. You are not talking about a large land mass, you are \ntalking about a very narrow, tight area. It would be similar to South \nCarolina and Georgia lobbing missiles back and forth.\n  What would happen if one of those States did it? We would immediately \nreact to protect our citizens and protect their lives and their \nlivelihoods. That is what Israel is doing.\n  I pray every night that somehow and some way we can be a catalyst for \nultimately a lasting peace in the Middle East. But surrendering to \nterrorism or the acts of terrorism such as Hamas has been taking out on \nthe Israeli people is no way to go. I support the Nation of Israel. I \nbelieve they are doing the right thing to confront head-on the terror \nthat has been imposed on them.\n  It should not be lost on any of us that the supplies that have gotten \ninto Gaza through what is known as the Eisenhower Passageway, which is \nfrom Egypt into Gaza, have been military materials being flown in and \nthen taken in through tunnels basically by operatives of Iran. Just as \nwhat happened in Lebanon a year ago with Hezbollah and the Lebanese, \nthe same thing is happening today between Gaza and the Palestinians and \nthe Israelis.\n  The catalyst for the conflict is another nation, Iran. It wants to \ndiffuse the focus on its producing of nuclear weapons and instead keep \nturmoil in the Middle East to use it to its benefit.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I take very seriously \nmy responsibility to look upon every nation in this world as a nation \nwe should respect, as a nation we should dialogue with, and as a nation \nwe should work with. But we cannot and we must not turn our head away \nfrom a nation that is causing terror to be invoked against innocent \npeople such as Iran is doing against Israel through the Palestinians in \nGaza.\n  So I hope and pray these difficulties end tonight. I hope and pray \nthere is not another loss of life. But as long as Hamas is unwilling to \nenter into a meaningful peace, a meaningful effort to stop the terror, \none that can be trusted and verified, then Israel is doing precisely \nwhat it should be doing in the best interests of its people. It is \ndoing no less than we in this Congress and America would do were we \nattacked in the same way in the same time. In the first part of my \nremarks, I stand in solidarity with the people of Israel in hope and \nprayer that the hostilities end but not because of surrender; because \nultimately we confront terror and get people to lay down their arms, \nnot for a day, not for a cease-fire but for generations to come.\n  The second subject is, for me, a very sad subject but also a subject \nthat brings a lot of joy to my heart. There is a great American by the \nname of Griffin Bell, known to many people in this room. I know you, \nMr. President, being a former Attorney General in the State of \nColorado, are familiar with Griffin Bell's record and jurisprudence in \nthe United States for the last 75 years.\n  Griffin Bell first rose to prominence in America when Jimmy Carter \nbrought him from Georgia to become the Attorney General of the United \nStates of America. He brought him in at a critical time in our \ncountry's history because Griffin Bell had done unbelievable things as \na lawyer during difficult times in the South.\n  Griffin Bell was the man whom Andy Young and the civil rights \nleadership of Atlanta and Ivan Allen, the mayor of Atlanta, turned to \nto write the plan for the desegregation of the Atlanta public schools. \nIt was Griffin Bell who, as a lawyer but more so as a human being, \nworked through the difficult stress of those times of integration and \nthe enforcement of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, to see to it \nthat separate but equal ended and equal access to education prevailed \nfor all.\n  He did it in a way where Atlanta was one of the few major cities in \nAmerica that had no violence, no conflict, and no academic loss because \nof the imposition of the desegregation guidelines that were imposed by \nthe courts.\n  Griffin Bell did something no one thought could be done. It was \nbecause of his ability to do that and find common ground and find \nunderstanding that Jimmy Carter brought him to Washington, DC, and \nappointed him Attorney General.\n  When Griffin left and went back to his law firm of King & Spalding in \nAtlanta, there was not a single thing that happened in our major \ncapital city and our State for four decades that Griffin Bell was not a \nmajor player and a major part of.\n  During Olympics, when they came to Atlanta in 1996 and there were \ndifficulties, to whom did the Olympic committee go to weed through the \nminefield of Washington to get the security assistance necessary for \nthe Olympics and Atlanta? It was Griffin Bell.\n  When there was a company that was in need of a forensic audit by a \nlegal man who would come in and clean up a problem in their company, \nsuch as E.F. Hutton did, whom did they call? They called Griffin Bell. \nFor the better part of the last six decades, Griffin Bell has been the \nmost prominent lawyer in the State of Georgia and I would suggest one \nof the most prominent lawyers in the United States of America. His mark \nhas been left on countless hundreds of thousands of lives in our \ncountry. Sadly, at 9:45 a.m. yesterday morning in Piedmont Hospital, \nGriffin Bell passed away. I know where he is now. He is in heaven and \nhe is looking down. He would be the last person to want anybody in the \nSenate or the House or anywhere else bragging about him. But I sing his \npraise for the greatness he did for our State and the greatness he did \nfor his country.\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\n  To his children and to his wife, I pass on my sincere condolences and \nmy thanks for the support they gave to a great father and a great \nGeorgian, Griffin Bell.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S21-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this evening I have the privilege of joining \nmy friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, \nto say a few words about our esteemed predecessor, Senator Claiborne \nPell.\n  Senator Pell served 36 years in the Senate--the longest serving \nSenator in the history of Rhode Island. He was elected in 1960, along \nwith his friend and young Democrat John F. Kennedy. They brought a new \nspirit, a new vision, new hope to America. He served until 1997, when I \nhad the distinct honor and, indeed, privilege of succeeding him as a \nSenator from Rhode Island. He was an extraordinary gentleman, and he \nwill be missed by all Rhode Islanders and, indeed, by this Senate.\n  I was honored yesterday to be asked by Nuala Pell to say a few words \nat his services in Newport, RI. First, I obviously pointed out that \nClaiborne's public service was sustained and inspired by his wife and \nhis family. Nuala and all of their children were the support, comfort, \nand the meaning in his life. We owe them our thanks as well for his 36 \ndistinguished years of service in the Senate.\n  Claiborne Pell was a remarkable individual. He was born to great \nwealth and privilege, but he had an abiding affinity for the average \nguy. I sense that part of that was at a critical moment in his life, \nbefore Pearl Harbor, when the war clouds were gathering in Europe and \nAsia. He had graduated from Princeton, but he knew he had to serve. \nBecause of his prestige, because of his family, he could easily have \nsecured a safe posting somewhere. He chose instead to join the U.S. \nCoast Guard as an enlisted cook, to sail the North Atlantic on deadly \nconvoy routes bringing needed supplies to Great Britain. There, he \nworked with other young Americans, without pretense, without \npreference. There, he understood the great talent, the great power of \nAmericans, that if they had opportunity, if they could better \nthemselves through education, they would be extraordinarily important \nto this Nation and they would be able to provide a better life for \ntheir families. They could, indeed, seize and realize the American \ndream.\n  Many people had that experience in World War II, but Claiborne used \nto it shape his entire public life. He served in the diplomatic corps, \nbut by 1960 he was committed to serving the people of Rhode Island, and \nhe entered the primary against two venerable, well-known, distinguished \nRhode Island Democrats, Dennis J. Roberts, former Governor, and J. \nHoward McGrath, former U.S. Senator, a former Solicitor General, former \nAttorney General in the Truman administration. Young Claiborne Pell won \nbecause he struck a cord with the people of Rhode Island, because he \nwas able to translate his feeling for opportunity, for the privilege \nthat education bestows on every person, to the people of Rhode Island. \nHe and Nuala campaigned and won, and then for 36 years they served with \nsuch distinction, with such honor, and brought such credit to our \nState.\n  He is best known as the author of the Pell grant, which provides \ngrants to students to go to higher education, but he did so much more \nin the field of education. He was involved in numerous reauthorizations \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. He labored over these \nprovisions to make sure young Americans were prepared for college. He \nwas also the author of the national sea grant college grant. Just as we \nhave land grant colleges dating back to the Moral Act of the 1860s, \nClaiborne said we should have a sea grant act that would allow the \nsciences of the oceans, maritime sciences, to be taught, to be \nexplored, to be investigated on college campuses.\n  He did so much. In addition to his dedication to education, he also \nwas the creator of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National \nEndowment for the Humanities in 1965. He understood that in the great \nsweep of time, our military power might fade, our economic power might \nfade, but the power of our ideals, as expressed in our literature, in \nour arts, would continue to move the world. And in order to make that \naccess possible, not for the well-to-do but for everyone, he created \nthe notion of a National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities.\n  Thinking back in preparation for my words yesterday, I thought of how \noften his life intersected with mine, starting at 10 years old in 1960. \nI saw the motorcade rushing by my grammar school with John F. Kennedy \nand Claiborne Pell in those final days of the campaign. But in regard \nto the National Endowment for the Arts, my first exposure to theater--\nand I was the proud son of working-class Cranstonians in Cranston, RI--\nwas Project Discover in which Trinity Repertory Company brought \nstudents in to see an act from Richard the II. That was all part of the \nvision Claiborne had of giving people an opportunity to explore the \narts, to find their talent. He did it remarkably well.\n  Today, these two institutions endure. They provide access for \nmillions of Americans to the arts, to the humanities. They have \nencouraged creativity, and all of it is a tribute to Claiborne Pell.\n  He was perhaps most recognized in international affairs for his \nstaunch support of the United Nations. Yesterday, one of the eulogists, \nPresident Clinton, pointed out that every time he saw Claiborne Pell, \nas President, Claiborne would take out from the back pocket a worn copy \nof the U.N. Charter which he carried and point out to him the value of \nthe United Nations, the value of collective security. He was there in \nSan Francisco in 1945 when the U.N. was created. He was there in New \nYork City 50 years later for its 50th anniversary.\n  But his notion of a powerful America leading the world, not standing \napart from it, his notion that our values, our system, our commitment \nto human decency would prevail in the face of Soviet totalitarianism \nand other forms of totalitarianism was wisdom of the ages. In his \nservice on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he not only espoused \nthose views, every day he reminded us our destiny would take us far \nbeyond what simply a military operation or our economic power might \nbecause of our ideals, because of our commitment to multinational \nsupport of creating a world community--a remarkable man.\n  He was someone who left and has left an indelible mark on Rhode \nIsland and Rhode Islanders. As I mentioned yesterday, I had the \nprivilege of witnessing this profound bond so many times. We have a \nparade each Fourth of July in Bristol, RI. It is the largest parade in \nRhode Island. One hundred thousand people, which is about a tenth of \nthe population of our State, gathers for it. It is the oldest \nconsecutive Fourth of July parade in our country. To walk in that \nparade is a great honor. But to walk with Claiborne Pell is an \nextraordinary experience. For the first few steps, you pretend the \ncheers are for you, but that quickly fades because, mile after mile, \npeople rush up and say: Thank you, Senator Pell. Thank you, Senator \nPell. Thank you for the help when I needed it. Thank you for the Pell \ngrant. Thank you for being the ideal public servant. Then you would see \nparents lift toddlers and say: There goes a great man, Claiborne Pell.\n  Well, he has touched us and he has made us so much better. I had the \nrare privilege and opportunity yesterday to say, on behalf of the \npeople of Rhode Island, something all of my fellow citizens wanted to \nsay as soon as they heard the news, as soon as they realized the great \nlight of Claiborne Pell had dimmed; and those are two simple words: \nThank you, Senator Pell.\n  Mr. President, now I would like to yield the floor to my colleague \nand friend, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who is someone who is molded in \nthe image of Claiborne Pell, someone who understands, as Senator Pell \ndid, that opportunity is the engine that drives\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nAmerica, that our great skills have to be harnessed to a higher \npurpose. It is such a privilege and pleasure to serve with him. And not \nonly that, but he has been a dear and personal friend of the Claiborne \nPell family for many years, indeed generations. I yield to my \ncolleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President. And I say to Senator Reed, \nthank you.\n  I rise in honor of a great friend and mentor. I look around me at a \nroom that just this morning was filled with Senators. It was a crowded \nSenate floor, with packed galleries, as a group of bright and promising \nnew Senators began their careers, with all that joy and hope.\n  Now, as my senior Senator, Jack Reed, and I speak, the room is quiet, \nthe galleries are mostly empty, and colleagues are gathering in \nremembrance because yesterday Rhode Island saw the sunset on a Rhode \nIsland era with the funeral of our friend, Senator Claiborne Pell.\n  I am deeply honored by Senator Reed's kind words, and he has a unique \nposition as the successor to Senator Pell.\n  It must be an interesting feeling to have served in the Senate for 36 \nyears, to have loved this institution, to have accomplished \nextraordinary work in this institution, and then to walk away and leave \nyour seat to a new, young Senator to replace you.\n  Senator Pell had great confidence in Senator Reed from the very \nbeginning. He was, indeed, able to assure that there was no primary to \nsucceed a seat that was open for the first time in 36 years, and it was \nbecause of his confidence in Jack Reed that he put in that effort. I \nknow firsthand how extraordinarily proud he was of the Senator Jack \nReed has shown himself to be.\n  We in Rhode Island are a little, tiny State, but over the years we \nhave had some towering and remarkable Senators. Claiborne Pell, \nobviously, was one. John Chafee was one. John O. Pastore was one. \nTheodore Francis Green was one. Even the gentleman once known as the \ngeneral manager of the United States, Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, \nwas a towering presence. Certainly, Senator Reed has shown himself to \nhave joined that pantheon. I probably have another 10, 20 years of work \nbefore I get there, but I will keep trying. But certainly Senator Reed \nis in that category, and I am deeply honored by his kind words.\n  Many in this body knew Claiborne Pell and served with him. I wish to \nsay on behalf of Rhode Islanders who watched the service yesterday how \ngrateful we are to Majority Leader Reid, Majority Whip Durbin, \nClaiborne Pell's dear friends, Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden, and Senators \nPat Leahy, Dick Lugar, Orrin Hatch, Chris Dodd, Jeff Bingaman, John \nKerry, and Joe Lieberman, all of whom honored Senator Pell by attending \nthe funeral. Of course, I give special thanks to President Bill \nClinton, who came to Rhode Island, a place where he is beloved, and \nspoke for his departed friend.\n  Senator Pell was there for me in my own career at key junctures in so \nmany important ways, and I should give him credit and in front of all \nmy colleagues express my deep gratitude for what he did. He recommended \nme to President Clinton for appointment as U.S. attorney. After I \nserved my term as U.S. attorney, I ran for attorney general. I served \nwith the Presiding Officer, Senator Salazar of Colorado, as an attorney \ngeneral.\n  I had a three-way primary for attorney general. Claiborne Pell \nendorsed me in the primary. He actually did a television ad with me. In \nhis 36 years in the Senate, he wanted no part ordinarily of primaries. \nFor two people he got involved in a primary and endorsed a candidate. \nOne was me. The other was Congressman Patrick Kennedy. It is almost \nunimaginable what a difference it made in my fledgling campaign, my \nfirst bid for elective office in the Democratic primary to have a man \nof Senator Pell's towering reputation stake his reputation on me and \nexpress that kind of confidence. It is something for which I am \nindebted to him and to his memory and to his family forever.\n  To me and to so many people in the Ocean State, Claiborne Pell was a \nmentor and an example, a leader whose vision, grace, and authentic \nkindness left an indelible imprint.\n  He was born in New York City in 1918, and he first came to the Senate \nin 1961, after a colorful primary battle, described by Senator Reed, \nthat pitted him as an essential unknown against two established \nDemocratic powerhouses: Dennis J. Roberts and J. Howard McGrath, \ncontending for the seat that was being vacated by Theodore Francis \nGreen.\n  It did not look good. Pell was the ultimate outsider. He was so much \nthe underdog in that race that John F. Kennedy, who was running for \nPresident at the time--and who knew Claiborne quite well because he was \na dear friend of Mrs. Kennedy, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, and was in \nRhode Island a good deal because of her family associations with Rhode \nIsland; so he knew Claiborne Pell quite well--he called him the least \nelectable man in America.\n  At his funeral yesterday, I saw Pell buttons from that race back in \n1961 on mourners' lapels.\n  The Providence Journal described the race that ensued as ``the first \nmodern political campaign the state had seen.'' Senator Pell invested \nhis own money in television ads and polling, and he won the Democratic \nprimary. He was the first unendorsed candidate in the history of Rhode \nIsland to ever win a Democratic primary.\n  He went on to win the general election. He won it by the largest \nmargin ever at the time, 69 percent of the vote. To his great \nsatisfaction, more Rhode Islanders voted for Claiborne Pell in that \nelection than voted for John F. Kennedy--so much for being the ``least \nelectable man in America.''\n  The fact that John F. Kennedy road on Claiborne Pell's coattails was \na point Claiborne Pell, in his quiet way, loved to remind President \nKennedy of whenever the opportunity presented itself.\n  Of course, Rhode Island, in that election, got its first look at the \none-of-a-kind political temperament that was to define Senator Pell for \nthe rest of his life: courteous, innovative, and always quietly \nhumorous.\n  Senator Pell looked back on that election in an interview with the \nNew York Times, and he said this:\n\n       I remember my first campaign. My opponent called me a cream \n     puff. That's what he said. Well, I rushed out and got the \n     baker's union to endorse me. Frankly, I think a little bit of \n     humor is sorely lacking now.\n\n  How many people in today's politics being called a cream puff would \ngo out and get a baker's union endorsement rather than trying to find \nsome other way to hit back?\n  Claiborne Pell believed, as he once told the Providence Journal, \nsomething that is so important:\n\n       [T]hat government--and the federal government in \n     particular--can, should and does make a positive impact on \n     the lives of most Americans.\n\n  He lived by that observation, and certainly Senator Pell's positive \nimpact on the lives of the people he served will be remembered for \ngenerations.\n  Two years after taking office, Senator Pell sponsored legislation \nthat became the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant, now known, thanks \nto its champion, as the Pell grant. At the time, the Nation's colleges \nwanted Federal aid for themselves, but Senator Pell wanted the aid to \ngo directly to students.\n  He enlisted in the Coast Guard 4 months before Pearl Harbor, serving \nin the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and after that he used the \nGI bill scholarship to get an advanced degree from Columbia University.\n  The GI bill showed him the transformative power of a college \neducation, and Claiborne Pell resolved then that all Americans would \nhave the opportunity for a college education that he and millions of \nveterans had received after World War II.\n  So every year in September a new group of students goes off to \ncollege, and we see anew the work of Senator Pell, enlivening millions \nof young Americans who use Pell grants to pursue their dreams. In 2008, \nthis Pell Grant Program was nearly 5.6 million grants, worth $16.4 \nbillion--all from his idea.\n  I am delighted the distinguished Senator from Colorado is presiding \nat this moment because I remember in Rhode Island a few years ago I was \nat an event with a number of Senators, and\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nthe distinguished Senator from Colorado, now our Interior Secretary \ndesignate, was present. Senator Pell came to the event. He was very \ndisabled, and he came in a wheelchair. I went over to greet him. \nSenator Salazar--I say to the Presiding Officer, you will remember \nthis--also came over to greet him. He took his hand, and he told him: \nSenator, my brother and I went to college because of the Pell Grant \nProgram. Now here I am standing in front of you as a Senator, thanks to \nthe vision and foresight you showed years ago--your vision that every \nAmerican should have the dream of higher education at their disposal. I \nsay to the Presiding Officer, you were then in your first term as a \nnewly elected Senator.\n  It was an unforgettable moment, I say to the Presiding Officer. It \nhappened because Senator Pell understood the difference that higher \neducation could make in the lives of America's young people--from a \nyoung Ken Salazar from rural Colorado, to toddlers across this country \nnow who will seize the opportunities of America in years to come \nbecause of this man.\n  Senator Pell knew that the arts, too, could transform lives. He \nauthored the landmark legislation that gave rise to the National \nEndowments for the Arts and the Humanities. These institutions have \nsecured a place for the culture and the arts in the public life of this \nNation. Over the years they have helped bring poetry, drama, dance, \npainting, sculpture, song, literature, and history to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Of course, we New Englanders are deeply indebted to Senator Pell for \nhis passion for public transportation and in particular for his long \nfight to develop for the Northeast corridor a transit system to support \nthe cities of today and tomorrow. As we face the challenges of rising \nenergy costs, economic recession, and urban stresses on our congested \nhighways, Americans will rely more heavily than ever on systems such as \nAmtrak. Senator Pell's foresight again has served us well.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator Pell is remembered for his big ideas. In \nRhode Island, we remember him also for his gentle, generous spirit. He \nhad lived all over the world. He had been honored with medals from at \nleast 18 different nations. But Newport, RI, was always home. In both \nhis personal and his political life, he was a consistent model of \ncivility and kindness to his fellow Rhode Islanders--always, without \nfail--even sometimes at his peril.\n  For example, in his final bid for reelection in 1990, Senator Pell \nreportedly insisted on warning Congresswoman Claudine Schneider, his \nRepublican opponent, every time he was about to air a new television \nad. He told his campaign staff that he would not permit a self-\npromoting press release to go out, chiding: ``No, no, no, we never \nboast.''\n  In a debate I remember watching, he was given two huge political \nsoftball opportunities. One, he was asked to criticize his opponent, to \ncritique her capacity to defeat him and serve in the U.S. Senate. The \nonly thing he had to say was she has been a very fine Congresswoman. \nThen he was asked what his most significant legislative achievements \nhad been during the previous term that had helped Rhode Islanders. He \nsaid:\n\n       You know, I really can't think of one right now. My memory \n     is not as good as it should be.\n\n  One would think those answers would be lethal politically, but Rhode \nIslanders loved it and they loved him for it because he was as genuine \nand as authentic as a man could be. I guess one of the great lessons of \nhis life is that voters don't want you to be perfect; they want you to \nbe you. They want you to be authentically who you are and from there to \nfight for them, and he certainly lived that. For his authenticity and \ngentleness of spirit, Claiborne Pell was beloved by all of us in the \nOcean State who were privileged to know him or work with him or learn \nfrom his example.\n  We all will miss him deeply. To his wife Nuala, to his children, Toby \nand Dallas, and their families, and to the families of his departed \nchildren, Bertie and Julie, I know I join my distinguished senior \nSenator and all in this body and indeed all of America in holding them \nin our thoughts and prayers.\n  As his family reminded us last week, Senator Pell summarized his role \nas a Senator with seven simple words: Translate ideas into actions and \nhelp people. Would that all of us could have ideas as big as Claiborne \nPell's and the strength, grace, persistence, and courage to translate \nthem into action.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, would it be in order for me, before I begin \nmy remarks, to compliment the Presiding Officer for his nomination to \nbe Cabinet Secretary, the Secretary of the Interior, and wish him very \nwell before the Senate in being confirmed and serving in that position? \nI guess that question doesn't need a response. I certainly hope it is \nin line for me to be able to say that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S23-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S23-S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GAZA RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KYL.

The first thing the resolution does is to \nremind people why the State of Israel had to act.\n  Last February, on a trip to the Middle East, I visited the Israeli \ntown of Sderot, which is about 3 miles from the border of Gaza, and I \nlearned from the town's mayor of the toll taken on the residents of \nthis town and neighboring cities from more than 8 years of rocket \nattacks by the Hamas terrorists. At the police station, I saw rack \nafter rack of these spent rockets, the remains of the rockets that had \nbeen launched by Hamas against the civilian population of this city. In \nfact, about 15 minutes after we departed the city, one of these Hamas \nlaunched a Qassam rocket--identical to the hundreds we had seen at the \npolice station--which fell on an Israeli home in town, destroying it. \nThankfully, no one in that attack was harmed.\n  Is there any doubt that if the United States were suffering an attack \nfrom just across the border similar to this, that we wouldn't react to \nstop that from happening? I think there is no question that we would \nact to stop this terrorism. It is our hope that the resolution would \nexpress our acknowledgment that a nation has the right to defend \nitself, that Israel has had to respond to this, to more than 6,300 \nrocket and mortar attacks on its citizens since it fully withdrew from \nGaza in the year 2005. In fact, this town has been suffering for over 8 \nyears from these attacks.\n  The second point the resolution makes is that there is no equivalency \nbetween the actions of Hamas and Israel in this case. Israel conducts \nits military operations to spare innocent life. They have specifically \ntargeted Hamas command centers and security installations and rocket-\nlaunching sites, weapons stockpiles, and weapons smuggling tunnels. \nThey have tried very hard to avoid civilian casualties. In fact, Israel \nhas transmitted very specific warnings to Gazans. They have dropped \nleaflets and made phone calls to targeted areas to warn citizens to \nleave because an attack is imminent. This, of course, even means they \nlose the element of surprise and potentially put the lives of Israeli \nsoldiers at risk. But Israel believes it is important where possible to \navoid jeopardizing innocent life--quite the opposite from Hamas, which \ndeliberately and cynically fires rockets from civilian areas to make it \nmore difficult for Israel to target the terrorists and to increase the \nlikelihood of civilian casualties when Israel does take action.\n  Hamas has ignored a plea by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on \nApril 28 that:\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\n       Civilian areas in Gaza should not be used as a base from \n     which to launch its actions against Israel.\n\n  Dozens of mosques in Gaza have been turned into weapons storage \nfacilities and Hamas command centers. In fact, an airstrike on a mosque \nin the Tel El Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City last Wednesday set off \nnumerous secondary explosions caused by the arms that had been \nstockpiled in the mosque.\n  Finally, Hamas openly admits that it uses women and children as human \nshields. A leading member of Hamas told Al-Aqsa TV on February 29, \n2008:\n\n       For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry . \n     . . This is why they have formed human shields of the women, \n     the children, the elderly, and the mujahedeen, in order to \n     challenge the Zionist bombing machine.\n\n  While targeting terrorists, Israel works to avoid a humanitarian \ncrisis for ordinary Gazans as well. During the first week of Israel's \noperations, it facilitated the delivery to Gaza of 400 trucks loaded \nwith more than 2,000 tons of food and medicine. This is not easy when \nyou are in the middle of military operations. Ten ambulances and two \nthousand blood units were transferred to Gaza just in that week. More \nthan 80 Palestinians have entered Egypt for treatment, in addition to a \ndozen or more who have entered Israel. On January 5, more than 93,000 \ngallons of industrial diesel fuel and gasoline for vehicles was \ntransferred into Gaza from a fuel depot in Israel. By the way, that \nfuel depot comes under constant attack from terrorists in Gaza, as does \nthe place where the electricity is generated for Gaza, which, of \ncourse, makes absolutely no sense.\n  Finally, this resolution speaks to calls for a cease-fire. Many \nvoices in the so-called international community have been heard \npleading for an immediate cease-fire, although I think it is \ninstructive that one never hears those voices condemning rocket attacks \nby Hamas terrorists.\n  I believe the path to a halt in the violence is clear. A cease-fire \nis appropriate if and when it is durable and sustainable. A cease-fire, \non the other hand, that would allow Hamas to rearm and rebuild its \nsupport in Gaza is, of course, not acceptable. Hamas cannot be given a \ncease-fire that only serves to provide it breathing room to regroup and \nthen a month or 2 months or 3 months from now start firing its rockets \nand missiles again.\n  The United Nations could play a constructive role, but it must resist \nthe temptation that it all too often falls into, and that is that of \nmoral equivalency. I point to the press statement of the Security \nCouncil on December 28 which, among other things, said the parties \nshould ``stop immediately all military activities.'' This is dangerous \nmoral equivalency. Only one party to the violence carries out \n``military activities.'' The other party--Hamas--terrorizes and murders \ninnocent people. That is why the only Security Council resolution that \ncould be acceptable in this situation--and I say this with the \nunderstanding that the Security Council is meeting as we meet here \ntoday--is one that affirms Israel's right to defend itself and calls on \nHamas to immediately stop its terrorist activity.\n  I add that a Security Council resolution should look to all of those \nwho support Hamas--primarily and most significantly Iran. For years, \nIran has been the source of money, training--including training at the \nfacilities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran itself--and \nweapons to Hamas. Hamas's relationship with Iran is so close that the \nEgyptian President said this past May that Hamas rule in Gaza means \nthat Egypt has a ``border with Iran.''\n  Since Israel launched its military operation against Hamas, Iran has \nannounced stepped-up arms shipments. Senior Iranian clerics have \norganized recruiting drives to send Iranians to Hamas's aid. Just \nyesterday, a senior Iranian cleric announced that it had recruited \n7,000 Iranians to join the cause of Hamas. Yet the international \ncommunity has taken no action to counter Iran's support of Hamas \nterrorists.\n  A U.N. Security Council resolution sanctioning Iran for its \nassistance to Hamas would send an important message and would be a good \nplace to start, as would unilateral sanctions by the United States.\n  Let me conclude by quoting the Washington Post columnist Charles \nKrauthammer, who recently wrote one of the most precise and succinct \nobservations on the situation in Gaza that I have read. He wrote:\n\n       Some geopolitical conflicts are morally complicated. The \n     Israel-Gaza war is not. It possesses a moral clarity not only \n     rare, but excruciating.\n\n  The Reid-McConnell resolution we expect to be introduced shortly will \nbe an important reaffirmation of the bond between Israel and the United \nStates. It is one forged on the basis of common values and the \ntragically shared experience of terrorism. By passing this resolution, \nwe are saying to the Israeli people: We stand with you, and we support \nyou in defending yourselves against terrorist attacks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish first to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for the statement he has just \nmade, which was characteristically straightforward, clear, principled, \nand passionate, about what is involved in the current crisis in Gaza \nand the opportunity this Congress has to not just stand with our ally, \nIsrael--which is critically important at this moment--but to take yet \nanother stand against terrorism for the rule of law, for democracy, and \nfor the peaceful settlement of disputes. I could not agree more with \neverything Senator Kyl has said. I wish to add just a few words in this \nregard.\n  As Senator Kyl has indicated, the United Nations Security Council was \nto convene shortly after 5 this afternoon, about an hour ago. I presume \nit has convened to hear speakers and consider resolutions on what is \nhappening in Gaza today. Secretary of State Rice has gone there to \nspeak on behalf of the United States, which indicates the importance of \nthese deliberations. She will carry with her the policy of our \nGovernment since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza that I think has been \nstrong and principled and consistent with the best of American values \nand, of course, consistent with our national security interest in the \nglobal war on the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 because what is \nhappening in Gaza is yet another battle front in the larger war against \nIslamist extremism and terrorism. It is, in another sense, also another \nbattle front in the conflict going on within the Muslim world between \nthe extremists and fanatics and terrorists and the majority of people \nwho are more moderate, more law-abiding, obviously not violent and want \nto live a safe and a better life.\n  The Government of the United States has been very clear in \narticulating a policy which I presume and have confidence will be \nexpressed in these Security Council deliberations tonight and the days \nto follow. No one wants to see violence occur. Yet, as Senator Kyl has \nsaid so eloquently, when a country such as Israel has been attacked \nliterally thousands of times with rockets fired from Gaza at innocent \ncivilians over a period of years, a cease-fire is negotiated and it \ngoes on for approximately 6 months--negotiated with great help from \nEgypt--and then Hamas breaks the cease-fire and begins firing rockets \nagain, the Government of Israel, our democratic ally, essentially said: \nEnough is enough; we are not going to tolerate this anymore, coming as \nit is from Hamas which is an openly avowed terrorist group with the aim \nof destroying the State of Israel.\n  In response to the violence, there is a natural reflex reaction heard \noften in world councils, and undoubtedly will be heard at the United \nNations Security Council at this hour and the hours to follow, that \nthere ought to be a cease-fire. I think we all have to ask ourselves: \nWhat is the end of a cease-fire? Of course, we don't like to see \nviolence occurring, but let's remember this is being done by Israel in \nthe exercise of the right of self-defense.\n  The Government of the United States--being President Bush and \neveryone else who has spoken--has made very clear that, yes, the United \nStates wants a cease-fire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas \nregarding Gaza but not just a cease-fire for the sake of a cease-fire \nthat one side may follow and the other may not and that simply leads \nnowhere but back to the conflict that has been occurring.\n  The U.S. Government has been very clear and principled about the fact \nthat the cease-fire our Government seeks is\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\none that is durable and sustainable; in other words, that represents a \nreal resolution of some of the issues in conflict and that also deals \nwith the smuggling into Gaza of additional weapons which are being used \nto attack innocent civilians in Israel.\n  I know Secretary Rice will be expressing exactly this position. Yes, \nAmerica wants a cease-fire but, no, not one that leads nowhere. We want \na cease-fire that is durable and sustainable and will include a ban on \nsmuggling, activities to carry out a ban on smuggling of weapons by \nHamas in Gaza.\n  I am very pleased, very encouraged that as the initial action of this \nSenate this year, the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, are working together in a bipartisan way--\ntotally bipartisan way--to bring before this body, hopefully in the \nnext day or two, a resolution that does exactly what Senator Kyl has \nsaid: to express our unwavering commitment to the security, well-being, \nand survival of the State of Israel and recognizing its right to act in \nself-defense to protect its citizens against terrorism, that will \nreiterate again that Hamas must end the rocket and mortar attacks \nagainst Israel and hopefully do what the Palestinian Authority has \ndone, which is to accept the right of Israel to exist and renounce \nterrorism and to begin to work toward a two-state peaceful solution.\n  This resolution really will, in essence, I think, say, as Senator Kyl \nhas said, in this hour of crisis to the people of Israel, our allies, \nthat we will stand with you, and also say to the peace-loving \nPalestinian people that we stand with you, too, and we continue to \nsupport a two-state solution--Israel and a Palestinian state--living in \npeace one against the other, but the Government of the United States--\nthe Secretary of State, the President, but the Secretary of State who \nis at the United Nations is not speaking simply for the executive \nbranch of Government but that the Senate, and we have reason to believe \nour colleagues in the other body, the House, will have an opportunity \nto say to not just the Israelis we stand with you, but to say to the \nworld community that we as the representatives of the people of \nAmerica, across party lines, stand together with Secretary Rice as she \nexpresses the position of our Government: Yes, a cease-fire, but only \none that is sustainable and durable and deals with the smuggling of \nadditional weapons into Gaza. This will be critically important.\n  I thank our leaders on both sides. I thank Senator Kyl for the work \nhe has done. Again, it has been a privilege to work with him.\n  I also say in a larger context that there is a lot of speculation \nabout why Hamas broke the cease-fire and initiated the rocket fire \nagainst Israel deeper into Israel than they have ever done before. I do \nthink, as Senator Kyl suggested, that the answer to that question \nprobably comes as much or more from Tehran than it does from Gaza City \nand Hamas; that Hamas has become an agent of the Iranian Government. It \nis trained and supplied by the Iranians and secondarily by the Syrians. \nTherefore, there is a larger conflict being played out.\n  Iran is noted by our State Department to be the most significant \nstate sponsor of terrorism. The leaders of Iran regularly not only call \nfor the extermination of the State of Israel, but also lead tens of \nthousands in Tehran and elsewhere in Iran in chants of ``death to \nAmerica, death to America.'' We have long since learned from the \nlessons of history that you cannot simply ignore statements that seem \nso extreme and fanatical that they are unbelievable because very often \nthe people making them do believe them, and given the chance, as we \nhave seen from Osama bin Laden in recent times, who told us throughout \nthe nineties exactly what he intended to do--he happened to have done \nit on 9/11, but he did it earlier in other places--we have to take \nthese threats seriously.\n  I want to say that a precipitous cease-fire simply for the sake of a \ncease-fire will allow Hamas to claim a victory. A victory for Hamas is \nnot simply a victory for Hamas; it is a victory for Iran. And a defeat \nfor Hamas, which is in reach if we allow the Israeli action to \ncontinue, is a defeat for Iran and a victory for the United States and \nfor the forces of democracy as against terrorism and for the forces of \nmoderation and the rule of law in the Islamic world as against \nfanaticism and violence.\n  This is all that is being played out. This is why I am so encouraged \nthis resolution is coming forward. It is, yes, a statement of support \nfor our ally Israel, but it is also a statement of policy for the \nMembers of the Senate, across party lines, and I hope with an \noverwhelmingly positive vote that says the security of the United \nStates is on the line in how this conflict ends. We cannot let it end \nin a way that strengthens Hamas and Iran.\n  I repeat, there has been a lot of speculation: Did Hamas break the \ncease-fire because of the end of the Bush administration? There has \nbeen some interesting speculation that has said the best thing that \ncould happen for the incoming Obama administration is that Hamas be \ndefeated here because then whatever happens between the new \nadministration and Iran, Iran will not approach that next chapter with \na sense of triumphant, but the country would have seen one of its major \nclients and agents of terrorism defeated.\n  We have the opportunity to speak to all that on this resolution in \nthe days ahead. Most immediately, I hope we will speak to the Members \nof the Security Council and in the most direct way say: We stand with \nPresident Bush; we stand with Secretary Rice. This is not simply the \nposition of a few people at the top of the executive branch of our \nGovernment. This position the American Government has taken with regard \nto the crisis in Gaza is the position embraced by an overwhelming \nmajority of Members of both parties of both Houses.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S25-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S25-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PAROCHIAL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized for a period \nof time. The majority leader has been very gracious to offer me an \nopportunity to have some discussions about some amendments that he is \ngoing to possibly allow on a bill that he is going to introduce this \nevening.\n  I wanted to take some time now rather than later so that we would not \nkeep staff here, and that way we could be efficient with our time. I \nwant to talk about several things. I want to preface it with a \nstatement, that I have been very pleased to see a man I respect a great \ndeal, even though not in office as of yet, but the President-elect, be \nvery firm in the principles he outlined as he ran for President and now \nis about to be sworn into that office.\n  One of the themes that has characterized his campaign and has \ncharacterized him ever since I have known him has been the idea of hope \nand change. So I, like many other Americans, look forward in great \nanticipation to the leadership that will be brought forth in the next \nfew weeks and what that means to the millions of Americans who are \ngoing to look to Washington this month with a level of hope and \nexcitement that we have not seen in this country in decades.\n  While most of the attention is going to be focused on the White \nHouse, the institution at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, this \nCongress, will arguable have a greater role in determining whether \nPresident-elect Obama's invocation of change is remembered as an \nelection slogan or a true new era in American politics. My hope and \nprayer is it is a new era.\n  While many commentators have noted, with some justification, the \nconcepts such as hope and change were never defined much and were not \ngiven a specificity during the campaign, I believe the American people \nhave already defined those concepts very clearly in their hearts and \nminds.\n  I believe what hope, change, and optimism represent to the average \nvoter is very simple: It is a real expectation that Washington will be \ndifferent. Voters have not undergone an ideological\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nshift nearly so much as they are demanding that Government be more \ncompetent, that we be more mature, that we be less corrupt, and that we \nbe less selfish. That last part is one of the things that has driven us \nto do things that are not very good. The concept of self-promotion, the \nconcept of promoting one's career at the expense of our country.\n  I believe what both parties in Congress must do, and do very quickly, \nis ask themselves the hard question of why Congress has a historic low \napproval rating of 9 percent. Why do we have an approval rating of 9 \npercent? That is according to a recent Rasmussen Poll.\n  Both parties are accustomed to analyzing what they and the other \nparty did right or wrong in recent election cycles, but yet neither \nparty has come to terms with the fundamental public rejection of how \nCongress as an institution has governed and behaved in recent decades.\n  In many respects the American people understand us far better than we \nunderstand ourselves. While politicians tend to believe the public is \nput off by ideologic debate, what alienates voters is the truly \ndebilitating division in Congress between statesmen and those who view \nreelection as the ultimate goal.\n  Careerism is not driven by any set of ideas but by pure parochialism \nand the short-term pursuit of power for power's sake. The real \ndivision, then, that blocks progress and commonsense solutions is not \nbetween ideas or parties but between every Member's self-promoted \ninterests.\n  The American people understand this intuitively, which is why \nCongress has had historic low approval ratings long before we entered \nthis recession. What the public knows is that a Congress that debates \nideas tends to develop the best solutions, while a Congress that is \ndriven by careerism and parochialism builds bridges to nowhere and \nfails to conduct oversight over entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac.\n  In short, the American people can handle serious debate, but they \ncannot handle incompetence, corruption, stupidity, and self-interest \nput above that of the Nation. Congress's handling of an economic \nstimulus bill will no doubt be an early test. Although the policy may \nbe suspect, Congress seems willing to try to avoid embarrassing the new \nPresident by turning the package into an orgy of parochial porkbarrel \nspending. He said today there will be no earmarks in the stimulus \npackage.\n  Congress's real test, though, will come next and will be repeated \nhundreds of times over the next 4 years with each piece of legislation. \nSo far Congress has signaled little desire for a long-term commitment \nto change. Some would ask why would I say that? I would say that \nbecause here in a little while this evening we are going to reintroduce \na bill that nobody knows right now how many other bills it has in it--\nthat is going to be the first order of business of this Congress--that \nallocates $10 billion, some to some very worthy projects but tons of \nthat money to projects that do not have a priority anywhere close to \nwhat we ought to be doing.\n  This is an omnibus lands bill that indulges the worst habits of a \nparochial Congress. The bill, which is a holdover from the last \nCongress, includes such things as a $3 million road to nowhere through \na wildlife refuge, a $1 billion water project--$1 billion--designed to \nassure that 500 salmon will be repopulated. It does not take long to \ndivide 500 salmon into $1 billion to see that what we have is $2 \nmillion a salmon. They are worth more than gold. There is $3.5 million \nto give to the City of St. Augustine, FL, so they can prepare a \ncelebration 6 years from now to recognize their 450th birthday. I \nhardly see, in the midst of the economic times we face, how that can be \na priority for the Nation as a whole. I know it is a priority from a \nparochial standpoint, but is it in the best interest of the Nation?\n  It has been claimed that this bill is noncontroversial, and it should \npass essentially without amendment, without debate. However, it is to \nnote that over 100 different organizations on both the left side of the \npolitical spectrum and the right side of the political spectrum are \nopposed to this bill because it is controversial, a point noted by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n  The earmarks in this bill have angered many groups, as has the \nsignificant, anti-energy, more foreign dependence on oil programs that \nare in this bill. This bill contains a provision that will eliminate \n8.8 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves, proven reserves, \ntoday that we will not be able to take for our consumption. What that \nmeans is we are going to import 8.8 trillion feet of natural gas \nbecause we are going to say: You cannot have this.\n  It also contains 300 million barrels of proven oil that we are no \nlonger going to take. We just went from $146 oil to $35 oil, $40 today. \nIf we have learned anything, we ought to be about as much energy self-\nsufficiency as we can. The controversy over whether we get off fossil \nfuels is a debate for another time. But no one can deny the necessity \nof us discontinuing sending our fortunes to countries that are \nsupplying us oil and are also ultimately our enemies.\n  The energy resources walled off by this bill will match the annual \nproduction levels of our two largest natural gas-producing States, \nAlaska and Texas. My worry about bringing this bill--and, again, I am \nthankful the majority leader has reached out that we might be able to \noffer amendments--is, what does this send as a signal to the American \npublic? Here is what it sends. It says: There may be change in the \nWhite House, but there is absolutely no change in Congress. Why would \nwe bring a bill that is going to spend $10 billion of our money--at \nleast $9 billion of that is not a priority in terms of the priorities \nfacing this Nation--why would we bring that to the floor as the first \norder of business of the 111th Congress? The only reason we could be \nbringing it to the floor is because it makes us look good at home with \nmultiple parochial projects.\n  If our country has a failing that will cripple us forever, it is the \nfact that we have allowed parochialism, not the oath we saw all new \nMembers and newly reelected Members take today, where we uphold the \nConstitution. What we do is, we uphold the future of our own political \ncareers.\n  History is interesting. The 1994 Republican revolution unraveled not \nbecause they made a lot of big mistakes--some were made--but because \nRepublicans made a ton of little mistakes they didn't realize they were \nmaking. The new and expanded majority will realize that with greater \nnumbers comes a greater share of the responsibility and blame for \nwhatever happens in this country. If we go back to that 9-percent \napproval rating, it has to do with this: Congress, we don't believe you \nare going to do at every turn, at every opportunity, what is in the \nbest long-term interests for this Nation. And we are going to prove it. \nBecause this bill ultimately will probably pass out of this Chamber and \nbe passed, and we are going to spend, at a time when we are going to \nhave a $1 trillion deficit this year, another $800 billion trying to \nstimulate the economy. We are going to say: Priority doesn't matter but \nparochialism does. Looking good at home matters more than the long-term \ninterests of the country, matters more than the financial future of our \ngrandchildren--my political career, my party, me, me, me.\n  The historical basis of our country is built on sacrifice. It is \nbuilt on sacrifice by one generation for the generations that follow. \nOur political history used to be that as well. My worry, my concern is \nwe can't live up to the hope and the change the President-elect has set \nbefore us. By bringing this bill to the floor as the first order of \nbusiness in the 111th Congress, we have confirmed to the American \npublic that business as usual is business as usual, that we don't \nrecognize the severity of the situation we find ourselves in, that we \nare not going to change our habits, that we will continue to promote \nthose things that promote us rather than promote the long-term good and \nbenefit of the country. It is pure selfishness. It is saying what I \nwant and what I need and my political future or my State has to come \nabove the long-term interests and the best interests of this wonderful \ncountry.\n  The real challenge doesn't come from any of the parties. It comes \nfrom parochialism. The public has told Congress it is time to start \nacting in the best interest of the country rather than the best \ninterest of our next election. The\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nsooner Congress realizes change requires a cultural shift in both \nparties, the sooner that change will come.\n  I would like to spend a moment outlining a few components of this \nbill. We have not actually gotten to see the bill, but I have been told \nby the majority leader that we have added, I think, 12 or 13 other \nbills to it. But from what we have known in the past, let me go through \nand explain to the American public what is in this bill.\n  The national parks today face a severe shortage of money to maintain \nthem at their current level. It is about $9.8 billion. In this bill we \nadd four new national parks. The U.S. Arizona Memorial in Hawaii is \nsinking. The visitors center is sinking. We haven't put the money in to \nrepair it, but yet we are going to create more national parks that will \nfurther dilute the maintenance budget of the National Park Service so \nwe can't even maintain what we have. We have a $700 million backlog \njust on The National Mall in Washington. We didn't address any of that \nin terms of the priority of fixing that. Yet we are going to add four \nnew national parks.\n  We are going to add 10 new heritage areas. It is great for us to \nprotect and think about the environment. But we never talk about how \nthat impacts property rights, one of the rights given to us as our \nNation was created. We are going to threaten that area. We are going to \nthreaten through eminent domain. We are going to threaten through \ncouncils that will impact individual ownership of what you can do with \nyour own property because you might be in proximity to a heritage area. \nWe have 14 studies that would create or expand future national parks; \nin other words, 14 more. That is what we are funding in this bill. We \ndon't have the money to take care of the parks we have today, but yet \nwe are going to put into this and spend money to potentially create 14 \nmore.\n  There are 17 provisions in this bill that will totally prohibit any \nexploration, oil extraction, coal extraction, natural gas extraction \nfrom 2.98 million acres in this country, many of which have proven \nreserves underlying. There are 53 rivers that are designated or \nportions of which are designated as scenic rivers. We have a great \nscenic river in Oklahoma called the Illinois. I am glad it is a scenic \nriver. But with scenic river designation comes a trampling on the \nrights of people who are far away from it. We didn't change scenic \nrivers designation in light of our energy needs. Once a river is \ndesignated a scenic river and we need to move natural gas or a coal \nslurry or oil from point A to point B, we are totally prohibited from \never doing that on a scenic river. So it is another strike at any sort \nof increasing in our independence on energy because we are going to \ndesignate scenic rivers. Why not designate scenic rivers with an option \nto make sure we don't handcuff ourselves when it comes to energy?\n  There are 65 new Federal wilderness areas. Here is an important \nmatter we came across as we studied this bill. In the United States \ntoday, right now, before this bill, there are 107 million acres of \nwilderness. All the developed land--cities, suburbs, towns--across the \nwhole rest of the country is only 106 million acres. We are going to be \nadding to that and limiting our opportunity to the resources we have.\n  There are 1,082 pages in the bill. I understand it is now 1,200 \npages. There are 1.2 million acres in Wyoming that are withdrawn from \nmineral leasing and exploration. There are 1.93 million acres of \nFederal wilderness land. There are 3 million additional acres withdrawn \nfrom leasing and energy exploration. There are 331 million barrels of \noil that we know are there and we are never going to take. We are just \ngoing to help those who drive up our energy costs because we are going \nto know it is there but we can't touch it because we are going to make \nit off-limits. There are 592 spending and 15 new State and local water \nprojects. There is nothing wrong with State and local water projects, \nas long as they are a priority, but these are earmarked, specific \nprojects for specific Members. There is $10 billion of total spending \nmoney we don't have. We are going to borrow it.\n  There are 8.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that we know is \nthere that we will never touch. What the Department of Interior tells \nus is there is much more there, but these are the proven reserves.\n  I will end my conversation, only to be continued in a more thorough \nmanner as the bill actually comes to the floor by asking the American \npublic: What would they hope we would do in terms of trying to change, \ntrying to meet what they see as the problems in front of us? Would it \nbe that we would be about passing things that are small but make us \nlook good that we can't pay for or would it be that we should attend \nand address the pressing and also long-term needs of the country?\n  It is about trust. The reason we have a 9-percent approval rating is \nbecause we are not trusted. We are addicts. We are self-indulgent \naddicts over our power.\n  My query to the body and to the American people is, will you hold us \naccountable? You have to do an intervention with us, each one of us, \nevery time we are home: Are you being a good steward with the limited \ndollars we have? Are you making choices that may not look good for you \nas a politician but are truly the best choice for the country? Are you \nputting yourself second and our country first? Are you acting as a \nstatesman or are you acting as somebody who wants to get reelected?\n  The real paradox is, with trust comes confidence. With that \nconfidence comes the involvement and support of the very people we \nactually do represent.\n  We have a choice. I hope the introduction of this bill does not \nportend that we will not take President-elect Obama's lead and offer \nthe American people real hope, real change, that we will get away from \nour addicted self-indulgence to look good at home and start making the \nhard, tough decisions that will right our ship and put our country \nfirst. Anything less than that says the people who took their oath \ntoday and those of us who have taken it before, we violate it. We raise \nour hand and put one on the Bible and say we will uphold it, but then \nwhen it comes to the first tough choice, look good at home or do what \nis in the long-term best interests of the country, we swivel, we back \ndown, and we opt for the short term, the self-aggrandizement, and the \nstroke on our own back. We are better than that. The people in this \nbody are better than that.\n  My hope is we can prove to the American people over the next 6 to 9 \nmonths that we got the message, that it is about making the tough \nchoices. It is about doing what is right in the long term. It is not \nabout what makes us or our party look good; it is about what is best \nfor the country as a whole.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend and congratulate one \nof the best and brightest gentlemen I have ever had the privilege of \nemploying. That man is Mr. Charles Kieffer who has served as staff \ndirector of the Senate Appropriations Committee for the last 2 years, \nand as deputy staff director for 6 years prior to that.\n  Chuck Kieffer is a marvel of intelligence, wisdom, tact, coolness, \nand an extraordinary knowledge of appropriations and budget matters. He \nis personable, polite, and a pleasure to work with. He has been \ninvaluable to me, to the leadership of the Senate, and to all\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nthe members of the Senate Appropriations Committee. In a time of \ncontinual wrangling over the appropriations process, tight budgets, \nveto threats, and differences between the House and Senate, Chuck has \nbeen a steady leader and a working dynamo. We have been extremely \nfortunate to have the right man as staff director in very difficult \ntimes.\n  Chuck also serves as the chief clerk of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee which funds the agencies that merged to form this cabinet \nlevel department. In the aftermath of September 11, Chuck provided key \nadvice and direction about the wisest ways to protect against future \nterrorist attacks and address the staggering destruction in New York \nState and at the Pentagon. He has worn the two hats of staff director \nof the full Appropriations Committee and clerk of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, which I continue to chair, with grace and with ease.\n  This really should come as no surprise. Despite his youth and \nunassuming demeanor, Chuck has served five Presidents, beginning with \nPresident Carter.\n  Before he joined my Appropriations staff, Chuck worked at the Office \nof Management and Budget during the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, \nand George W. Bush administrations.\n  In 1978 Chuck began his government service as a Presidential \nmanagement intern at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. \nFrom 1978-1985 he served as a budget analyst for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. From 1985-1990 Mr. Kieffer was special \nassistant to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. From \n1990-1995, he served as chief appropriations analyst for the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and from 1995-2001 he was acting associate \ndirector of legislative affairs at the OMB until he joined my staff as \ndeputy staff director of the Appropriations Committee in 2001. In 2001, \nChuck Kieffer won the Robert G. Damas Public Service Award.\n  As I step aside as chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the \ncoming days, I am thankful that Chuck has agreed to stay by my side as \nthe chief clerk of the subcommittee on Homeland Security. We can all \nsleep a little more soundly knowing that such a talented person as \nChuck Kieffer is helping to adequately and effectively fund the \nDepartment charged with keeping Americans safe from harm here at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S28-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             50TH ANNIVERSARY OF SENATOR BYRD'S SWEARING IN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today we begin the 111th Congress. As it is \nevery two years, this is a moment for new beginnings, but also an \nopportunity to bid farewell to some dear friends of ours as they move \non to the next chapters in their remarkable lives.\n  While it is always a joy to see this moment--to see the pride visible \nin not only the Members' faces, but their families' as well--this \nyear's is especially poignant for me.\n  Each of the men and women who have taken this oath during my time in \nthis institution has made an impression on me--influencing my life, my \nwork--in one way or another.\n  But 50 years ago this week, two Members were sworn in--one who is \nhere today and another who remains here in spirit--each of whom had a \nsingularly important impact on me:\n  My father, Thomas Dodd, who represented my State of Connecticut, and \nour esteemed colleague and friend from West Virginia, Robert C. Byrd.\n  I was only a boy then, but I remember that moment as if it were \nyesterday, seated with my family in the gallery above, as we looked \ndown on my father, as he began what would turn out to be the final \nchapter in a public life--a life that had already taken him from \nNorwich, CT, to Washington, DC, as an FBI agent and lawyer at the \nDepartment of Justice; to Germany where he served as a prosecutor at \nthe famous Nuremberg Trials, before returning to our Nation's Capital \nto serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Fifty years later, I take no small amount of pride in noting that in \neach of these endeavors, my father proved to be ahead of his time--an \nadvocate for universal health care, a proponent of sensible gun safety \nlaws, an early voice warning of the effects of violence on TV and the \ndangers of drug addiction; and an insistent defender of those whose \nhuman rights were being denied.\n  Indeed, it would not take long before a fellow freshman made his own \nmark, becoming not only this body's President pro tempore and the \nlongest-serving Member in its history, but the undisputed master of \nthis body's arcane parliamentary procedures, an award-winning author \nand historian and the foremost champion of sunlight in government.\n  Today, as the whole world watches these historic moments, we should \nnote that it was Robert Byrd who staved off the threat that the Senate \nmight become ``the invisible branch of government'' by ensuring that \nour proceedings be televised.\n  Some two-and-half decades ago, when I was sworn in myself, it was my \ncolleague from West Virginia who handed me a small book--a pocket-sized \nConstitution. For all I know, he did this for every freshman Senator.\n  His message was simple: as a Member of the Senate, you are a \ntemporary custodian of this document.\n  And so, I kept that book. For 28 years, I have carried it with me in \nmy back pocket--Saturday, Sunday, every day of the week to remind \nmyself how important this document is, the values and the principles \nthat are incorporated in it.\n  Senator Byrd has put it better than anyone: ``The limits that the \nConstitution places on how political power is exercised have ensured \nour freedom for more than two centuries.''\n  Each of these men taught me, in different ways, that we cannot defend \nand protect the vision of the Framers if we are ignorant of the \nConstitution's history and the rule of law.\n  And so today, as we look forward to the 111th Congress and all that \nwe hope to achieve, may we also remember this gift that was given to \nall of us in the 86th Congress all those years ago. May it continue to \nshine for many, many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S28-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S28-S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant, particularly in \nlight of our economic times. To respect the efforts of those who took \nthe opportunity to share their thoughts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through an address set up specifically for this purpose to \nthe Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily \nresolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, \nand Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their \nstruggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and \nrecommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem \nand find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My wife and I are retired with fixed retirement incomes and \n     our IRAs and annuities. We live about six miles from Moscow. \n     We are now limiting our trips to town and will reduce/\n     eliminate the travel we had planned this summer. We use our \n     Ford 500 that gets about 29MPG instead of our pickup as much \n     as possible. Our home is heated with wood pellets, but we \n     wonder if wood pellets will be available next fall because of \n     the failing timber industry.\n       We have little hope that gas prices will decrease. Both of \n     the Presidential candidates have bought into the global \n     warming hoax and do not want to develop our oil resources. We \n     expected it of the Democrat candidate but are very \n     disappointed in John McCain's position. It is difficult to \n     believe that he thinks the liberal environmental industry \n     will vote for him because he claims to be an \n     ``environmentalist''.\n       We feel that [the candidates] should visit ANWR and see \n     that it is not like the Grand Canyon. It is a frozen desert \n     where the oil resource could be developed with little impact. \n     We encourage you to help change positions on oil development. \n     [Our country] will miss a golden opportunity if they do not \n     use the ``drill here, drill now, pay less'' position. Thank \n     you for asking for our opinion.\n                                           Ned and Arleen, Moscow.\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       I was thrilled to hear that there was a venue for public \n     input to the increasing energy prices. I drive a VW Jetta, \n     which gets great gas mileage, and I have a decent job, but \n     the price of gasoline has caused me to reconsider many things \n     that weren't really hard decisions before. I have begun \n     buying generic items and do not visit my favorite coffee hut \n     as often because it is not `on my way' to work, therefore \n     requiring more gas, and for the price of my favorite latte, I \n     could buy a gallon of gas. I am beginning to classify \n     everything as whether it is a need or a want, and \n     dramatically cutting out the want. The problem is that many \n     of the needs are becoming expensive. My son's day care has \n     now increased their prices to cover their increased fuel \n     costs. Food has become expensive, prompting my husband and me \n     to start a garden. I have often wondered how others manage \n     when they work minimum wage jobs, and have a family to \n     support. To some extent, I am glad that prices have \n     escalated, because it makes us address this issue and become \n     more environmentally responsible. It also forces us to become \n     more self-reliant, both as individuals and as a nation.\n       I would love to see public transportation become more \n     available, however I am not sure how feasible or cost \n     efficient that would be given how spread out we are. Even \n     here in Idaho Falls, I am not sure how well that would work. \n     I work for the INL, so of course I am going to suggest \n     further research into nuclear energy and the possibilities \n     there. It is always frustrating to hear that Congress will \n     not pass a budget, forcing labs to function under continuing \n     resolutions that prevent new research from starting. This is \n     research that could change the way that we, as a nation, look \n     at energy, and reduce our dependence on oil. Hybrid vehicles \n     present an interesting potential, but the purchase price is \n     not an incentive to buy one. Is there a way to provide \n     incentives to automakers that produce these vehicles? This \n     could allow them to produce and sell these vehicles at a \n     lower cost, and then make them more attractive to the \n     consumer. These are just a few suggestions.\n       Thank you for the work that you and the committee are \n     investing in this issue.\n                                              Brandy, Idaho Falls.\n       I am a resident of Bingham County and would like to share \n     my story on how the high energy prices are affecting me and \n     my family. I am an INL employee and have to travel to and \n     from work, a total time of about one and a half hours every \n     day. If I have to drive to work it will cost $80 a week; if I \n     ride the INL bus, it is $22.50 a week. Still a portion of my \n     paycheck goes to travel. I pay approx. $1,150 a month in \n     utility and energy bills. I make on average $2,500 a month. \n     The rest goes to mortgage groceries and supplies for the \n     family, i.e. diapers, wipes, baby food etc. . . . We all have \n     houses and yards to upkeep, to keep sprinklers working, grass \n     trimmed and weed free, and that costs money. I have had to \n     scale back my plans with my family dramatically to upkeep my \n     assets. There will be no vacations this year, no more trips \n     to the local drive-in for ice cream after a hot day, and \n     certainly no running through the sprinkler to conserve on the \n     water bill. My wife (who is from Fiji) has not been able to \n     see her family for six years now. We were planning a family \n     trip this year to see them. Well, not anymore; a six thousand \n     dollar trip for a family of four is unheard of. Guess we will \n     have to see what next year brings. My property taxes rose \n     from $1,400 to $1,850 this year. Did not we pass a bill last \n     year generating a fund to lower this sort of thing? I \n     certainly did not benefit from that.\n       The city council in Blackfoot is working on getting a \n     windmill turbine farm set up in the Wolverine canyon, east of \n     Blackfoot. I am in favor of that if we were to actually \n     benefit from it. From what I gather the power that generates \n     from these turbines will be sent to California. If we have to \n     wake up every day to look at these turbines, then we at least \n     need to benefit from them! I have worked out at the INL Site \n     for about four years now; I work around the only test reactor \n     in the world. Every day, when I walk around it, I wonder, why \n     cannot we have a reactor to generate power for all of \n     southeast Idaho? Let us bypass Idaho and Utah Power and \n     anyone else that sends power to us and generate our own. We \n     will not be damming up rivers causing problems for the salmon \n     habitat or building turbines that could hurt the bird \n     migration. Or causing some other environmental issue with the \n     way wildlife runs its course. Let us build a generation \n     reactor in the desert at the INL that will provide power to \n     all of southeast Idaho. This could probably be the cleanest \n     source of energy we have ever used. Let us open up Alaska to \n     drill for oil, become more dependent on ourselves instead of \n     foreign oil.\n     Joshua.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to direct comments to you on \n     a specific topic of great concern.\n       My wife and I are nearing retirement (currently 58 years \n     old), and our home is paid for. However, our home was built \n     in the 1970s under a program promoted by Utah Power & Light, \n     which encouraged constructing total electric homes using \n     ceiling cable heat. UP even gave monthly energy \n     ``discounts'' for being total electric. Later . . . much \n     later . . . those discounts were deemed to not promote energy \n     efficiency and were taken away. Even though Idaho electric \n     rates remain relatively low, our home of 2,100 sq ft costs \n     over $300 a month to heat in the winter. We are concerned \n     that increasing energy rates will force us out of our home \n     when we are no longer working fulltime. No incentives are \n     provided for conversion and with ceiling cable there is no \n     duct-work to convert a furnace to . . . so natural gas or \n     propane is not economically feasible.\n       Solution--Construct a nuclear power plant on the desert of \n     the INL. Find a willing commercial owner, provide some US \n     government incentives to build a new version to use as a \n     model nationwide, offer an incentive to Idahoans on the grid \n     to get a discount & sell the rest of the power to Utah, \n     Nevada & California. Speed the process of approval & \n     construction. Sell bonds to help build it but do something.\n       I know it is an overly simplistic suggestions but we need \n     to do something about energy in this country or our economy \n     will grind to a near standstill.\n     Ted.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like everyone else in America, higher energy costs affect \n     me more every day as the price of everything I purchase \n     climbs. I am very frugal and have been barely make ends meet \n     as it is. It makes me physically sick with worry when I think \n     about the future. What is going to happen when I cannot \n     afford to pay my bills? Who do I stop paying first? Do I stop \n     paying my rent? My utilities? What about all the medical \n     bills I owe? (I have no medical insurance . . . but that is \n     another letter for another day.) Will I lose my home? Will I \n     get sued by my creditors and then get my wages garnished? \n     What about the $100 I pay every month to the Social Security \n     Administration for an overpayment of my disability benefits? \n     What will happen to me when I cannot afford to pay that? I \n     cannot be optimistic anymore and think somehow someone will \n     save the day. No one has offered up any realistic solutions \n     that I have heard. Getting a tax break for the summer will \n     not do a whole lot of good when [other prices remain high due \n     to] the price of oil in the preceding 12 months. Making the \n     oil companies pay more taxes will not solve the problem.\n       It just makes my blood boil to listen to [politicians] \n     sugar-coat our problems. This country is in crisis. The \n     powers that be have chosen to put their heads in the sand \n     over the environment and now it is too late to find a \n     ``green'' solution to the immediate energy needs of our \n     country. We need to drill for oil . . . now. It is sickening \n     that after all that has happened in our past with regard to \n     our dependence on foreign oil that we find ourselves here. \n     President Bush thinks he's going to win the war on terror by \n     sending our troops to die in the Middle East? The terrorists \n     will defeat us by using our dependence on them. While \n     everyone looks for a bomb and we lose our civil liberties one \n     by one, they will steal our way of life.\n       When I got my stimulus rebate check, I spent it all and \n     went to a family reunion. It occurred to me as I was coming \n     home that it is very likely that I will not be able to go \n     next year, or any year in the foreseeable future. It will \n     simply cost too much. The only reason I could afford it this \n     year is because of that rebate check. I cannot imagine that I \n     will have the ability to save enough money to go next year \n     because it will cost too much to put a roof over my head and \n     food on my table.\n       So, Mr. Crapo, my story is simple. The state of the nation \n     makes me afraid and angry.\n     Kathy.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I own and my wife operates a child day-care in \n     Idaho Falls, Idaho. Since the price of fuel has spun out of \n     control and with no resolution in the near future we are \n     actively attempting to sell or will shut the doors on the \n     business in the next two month. The price of fuel is driving \n     everything else up so high that we need to raise our prices \n     to make up for the increases and we are in many cases simply \n     pricing ourselves out of our customers ability to pay. Many \n     of our customers [have to choose] between day care or paying \n     for fuel, grocery, natural gas, etc. In many cases, one of \n     the parents quit their job to stay home with the kids and \n     simply tighten up their belts and live with the minimums. If \n     I did not have a good job working for a subcontractor to the \n     DOE and had enough income to take care of the day to day and \n     not depend on the business, I would be in bankruptcy court.\n       The fuel cost drives not only our vehicles; it drives every \n     aspect of our day to day lives. I am worried that if a \n     radical solution is not set into motion that we will be \n     looking at a depression in this country. My grandparents went \n     through the first one, and I hope that my family will not \n     have to see similar times. Allowing a small population of the \n     world to control the vast majority by controlling them with \n     out-of-control energy prices is not right. I have a problem \n     with so few becoming so wealthy while so many suffer. We have \n     vast oil resources in the lower 48, and we all know the \n     resources that are in Alaska. The Alaskan pipeline did not \n     destroy the landscape or cause the caribou to go extinct like \n     some of the environmentalists would like us to believe. Maybe \n     we should allow our government that is funded by our tax \n     dollars to step in and get involved with the refining of oil \n     in our country and quit depending on someone who actually do \n     not like us very much for our energy. We need to use what we \n     have and we need to not allow the activist groups to tie our \n     hands when we want to use it. If anyone even mentions \n     drilling in Alaska the activist groups go crazy and it make\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\n     me wonder who is funding these groups to keep our hand tied. \n     The short term fix is to use the oil that we are setting on \n     while we work on the research and development required to \n     assist or solve the long term problem.\n     David.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator, I could sit here and gripe about the high energy \n     costs. However, I regard the problem as a collective problem, \n     not something one sector or another of the economy has done. \n     We are all aware of how the costs are spiraling out of \n     control, and there are things we can all do to mitigate the \n     pinch in our wallet. Every one of us is guilty to varying \n     degrees. Consider the following:\n       First, each of us needs to be a lot more concerned with \n     conserving. We can all make one trip instead of three to the \n     store. We can carpool. We can reduce some of our recreational \n     activities to use less fuel getting there and while there. \n     Turn off the lights. Use the energy efficient light bulbs. \n     Use mass transit. The list goes on and on.\n       Second, Congress has got to work out a balanced approach to \n     energy availability. Hydro power is still the most efficient, \n     but has been hogtied by the environmentalists who not only do \n     not want new power production, and even want to remove power \n     production that is in place. Nuclear power has been similarly \n     placed into the nether land of total environmental disfavor. \n     The record of these two sources is not perfect, but they are \n     not guilty of producing greenhouse gasses and making the \n     Arabs richer and richer either. They have a place in our \n     infrastructure, and Congress needs to make it happen before \n     we give away all our wealth to Islamic radicals and \n     Communists. Begin a plan to reduce and eliminate foreign \n     import of oil, then make it stick.\n       Third, Congress needs to greatly improve incentives for \n     domestic production of oil. Use the oil shale resources we \n     have all over the country. Allow drilling in areas where the \n     likelihood of new fields is good, with a great deal of care \n     nevertheless. Use clean coal production methods for power.\n       Fourth, Congress should tax the windfall profits of the oil \n     companies. Use that money for refunds to vehicle owners and \n     taxpayers. There is no excuse on God's green earth for an oil \n     company to make more profits in a fiscal quarter than the GNP \n     of 80% of the world's nations in a year.\n       O.K. I have run out of time, but not ideas. I just wanted \n     you to know we are all in this together, and either we solve \n     it together, or the mess will get worse and worse. All of you \n     in Congress need to quit quibbling and do something.\n     Lon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity of letting you know of how the \n     high costs of fuel/energy are impacting me.\n       I feel lucky--I have a good job and make above average pay. \n     However, I am at a point in my life when I need to be able to \n     save for retirement. My wife and I have raised our children \n     and have recently been able to start saving for retirement. \n     With the current prices of fuel, we are not able to save as \n     needed to ensure that we will have the required funds to \n     retire.\n       I have discussed the high price of fuel with several \n     contract workers. They are not planning any type of vacation \n     travel and, in most cases, are fearful of the future. Most \n     are not even sure that they will be able to take care of \n     their necessities if prices continue to skyrocket.\n       There is a business here in Idaho Falls that purchases \n     plasma. I watched a news report detailing how busy they \n     currently are. Many who are selling their plasma are doing it \n     just to make ends meet. The place is so busy that they are \n     turning people away.\n       I worry about my own children. The future is bleak. Never \n     in my life have we had such a dim outlook--not in America.\n       It is time for drilling (in an environmentally safe way). \n     It is time for nuclear power to come out of the closet. We \n     need to quit letting the environmentalists run this great \n     country. I am an avid outdoors man. I love Idaho. I live here \n     for the beauty and activities related to the outdoors. I have \n     faith that we can fix the problems and move forward. I do not \n     believe that we have to ruin the outdoors to make things \n     right.\n       Thanks for your help\n     David.\n                                  ____\n\n       When BEA was granted contract of Idaho National Laboratory, \n     [the lab director] held a meeting and asked what they could \n     do to improve the INL. My reply was to better inform the \n     public about nuclear energy and the benefits. During these \n     trying times we are facing, and the extremes of the future, \n     we must have extreme plans to counteract. The only solution \n     is to minimize our use of natural resources. How do we do \n     this? Every structure, school, home, office, storehouse, etc. \n     shall be converted to electricity derived from nuclear power \n     generating facilities. All of the natural resources shall be \n     reserved for transportation and emergency needs. No longer \n     can the government not be in direct competition with private \n     affairs. When it is for the better of the people then it is \n     the right thing to do. Nuclear energy is the only solution. \n     We need to inform the public and gain support for a cleaner \n     more efficient future. I am excited to be involved with any \n     help I can provide with this matter.\n     Roy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a hospice nurse and my patients rely on me to make \n     home visits so they can have the care they need and deserve \n     at the end of their lives.

Mr. President, it is with great admiration and \nrespect that I take this time to recognize one of Kentucky's most \ndistinguished citizens, Roman Catholic Bishop John McRaith, who retired \nas the third Bishop of the Diocese of Owensboro.\n  Bishop McRaith's service over the last 26 years in the Diocese of \nOwensboro--which consists of 32 counties with 79 parishes, 3 high \nschools, 2 middle schools and 13 elementary schools--has made him a \nlegacy in the community.\n  In addition to being a large diocese, Owensboro Diocese is one of the \nmore diverse dioceses--home to a large number of Hispanic Catholic \nimmigrants, along with a priesthood that recruits men from Latin \nAmerica, Asia, and Africa. The work done by Bishop McRaith and the \npriests at Owensboro Diocese has increased church attendance to levels \nthat are considered among the highest in the Nation.\n  Bishop McRaith has left his community a better place because of the \nauthenticity and kindness of his services and faith. While I am sad to \nsee him retire, I am comforted knowing that those who learned from him \nwill continue the good work that he displayed each day. On behalf of \nall of those who are part of the Owensboro Diocese, I thank Bishop John \nMcRaith for the grace and strength he brought to western \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S30-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRIET CORNELL\n\n Mrs. CLINTON.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stronger Economy, Stronger \n     Borders Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should enact, and \n     the President should sign, legislation to strengthen the \n     economy, recognize the heritage of the United States as a \n     nation of immigrants, and amend the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) by--\n       (1) providing more effective border and employment \n     enforcement;\n       (2) preventing illegal immigration; and\n       (3) reforming and rationalizing avenues for legal \n     immigration.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, as we begin the 111th Congress, we will \ntry, once again, to enact comprehensive immigration reforms that have \neluded us in the past several years. With an administration that \nunderstands the critical necessity of meaningful reform and that \nunderstands the policy failures of the last 8 years, I am hopeful that \nthe new Congress can finally enact legislation consistent with our \nhistory as a nation of immigrants.\n  The majority leader has included immigration reform as among the \nlegislative priorities for the new Congress. I look forward to working \nwith him, Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain, and others interested in \nworking toward the goal of immigration reform.\n  In 2006 and 2007, Congress attempted to pass practical and effective \nreforms to our immigration system. In 2006, the Senate did its part and \npassed legislation, only to be thwarted by those in the House of \nRepresentatives who opposed dealing with the issue in a meaningful way. \nIn 2007, the House passed legislation only to have it blocked in the \nSenate by Republican Members opposed to effective reform.\n  If our immigration policies are to be effective and play a role in \nrestoring America's image around the world, we must reject the failed \npolicies of the last 8 years. We cannot continue to deny asylum seekers \nbecause they have been forced at the point of a gun to provide \nassistance to those engaged in terrorist acts. We cannot continue to \nlabel as terrorist organizations those who have stood by the United \nStates in armed conflict. We must not tolerate the tragic and needless \ndeath of a person in our custody for lack of basic medical care. We \nmust ensure that children are not needlessly separated from their \nparents and that family unity is respected.\n  We must move beyond the current policy that is focused on detaining \nand deporting those undocumented workers who have been abused and \nexploited by American employers but does nothing to change an \nenvironment that remains ripe for these abuses. We must protect the \nrights and opportunities of American workers and, at the same time, \nensure that our Nation's farmers and employers have the help they need. \nWe should improve the opportunities and make more efficient the \nprocesses for those who seek to come to America with the goal of \nbecoming new Americans, whether to invest in our communities and create \njobs, to be reunited with loved ones, or to seek freedom and \nopportunity and a better life. We must also live up to the goal of \nfamily reunification in our immigration policy and join at least 19 \nother nations that provide immigration equality to same-sex partners of \ndifferent nationalities. And I believe we would be wise to reconsider \nthe effectiveness and cost of a wall along our southern border, which \nhas adversely affected the fragile environment and vibrant cross-border \nculture of an entire region. Such a wall stands as a symbol of fear and \nintolerance. This is not what America is about and we can do better.\n  Those who oppose a realistic solution to address the estimated \nmillions of people currently living and working in the United States \nwithout proper documentation have offered no alternative solution other \nthan harsh penalties and more enforcement. The policies of the last 8 \nyears, which have served only to appease the most extreme ideologues, \nmust be replaced with sensible solutions. I am confident that our \ncountry and our economy will be far more secure when those who are \ncurrently living in the shadows of our society are recognized and \nprovided the means to become lawful residents, if not a path to \ncitizenship.\n  As President-elect Obama's administration considers immigration \nissues, I look forward to working closely with them and with the \nSenate's leadership to find the best solutions. President-elect Obama's \nnominees to lead the Department of Homeland Security and the Department \nof Labor understand very well the importance of sensible border \npolicies and the importance of workers' rights. The American people \nlook to all of us to forge a consensus for immigration reform that \nrejects the extreme ideology that has attended this issue and prevented \nreal progress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Levin, Mr. Begich, Mr. \n        Carper, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Schumer, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 10.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Healthy People 2010 sets forth a reduction of \n     unintended pregnancies as an important health objective for \n     the Nation to achieve over the first decade of the new \n     century, a goal first articulated in the 1979 Surgeon \n     General's Report, Healthy People, and reiterated in Healthy \n     People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention \n     Objectives.\n       (2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (referred to in this section as the ``CDC'') included family \n     planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health \n     Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has \n     one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among \n     industrialized nations.\n       (3) Each year, nearly half of all pregnancies in the United \n     States are unintended, and nearly half of unintended \n     pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (4) In 2006, 36,200,000 women, more than half of all women \n     of reproductive age, were in need of contraceptive services \n     and supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, and nearly \n     half of those were in need of public support for such care.\n       (5) The United States has some of the highest rates of \n     sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among industrialized \n     nations. In 2006, there were approximately 19,000,000 new \n     cases of STIs, almost half of them occurring in young people \n     ages 15 to 24. According to the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention, in addition to the burden on public health, \n     STIs impose a tremendous economic burden with direct medical \n     costs as high as $14,700,000,000 each year in 2006 dollars.\n       (6) Contraceptive use can improve overall health by \n     enabling women to plan and space their pregnancies and has \n     contributed to dramatic declines in maternal and infant \n     mortality. Widespread use of contraceptives has been the \n     driving force in reducing unintended pregnancies and sexually \n     transmitted infections (STIs), and reducing the need for \n     abortion in this nation. Contraceptive use also saves public \n     health dollars. For every dollar spent to provide services in \n     publicly funded family planning clinics, $4.02 in Medicaid \n     expenses are saved because unintended births are averted.\n       (7) Reducing unintended pregnancy improves maternal health \n     and is an important strategy in efforts to reduce maternal \n     mortality. Women experiencing unintended pregnancy are at \n     greater risk for physical abuse.\n       (8) A child born from an unintended pregnancy is at greater \n     risk than a child born from an intended pregnancy of low \n     birth weight, dying in the first year of life, being abused, \n     and not receiving sufficient resources for healthy \n     development.\n       (9) The ability to control fertility allows couples to \n     achieve economic stability by facilitating greater \n     educational achievement and participation in the workforce.\n       (10) Contraceptives are effective in preventing unintended \n     pregnancy when used consistently and correctly. Without \n     contraception, a sexually active woman has an 85 percent \n     chance of becoming pregnant within a year.\n       (11) Approximately 50 percent of unintended pregnancies \n     occur among women who do not use contraception.\n       (12) Many poor and low-income women cannot afford to \n     purchase contraceptive services and supplies on their own. \n     The number of women needing subsidized services has increased \n     by more than 1,000,000 (7 percent) since 2000. A poor woman \n     in the United States is now nearly 4 times as likely as a \n     more affluent woman to have an unplanned pregnancy. Between \n     1994 and 2001, unintended pregnancy among low-income women \n     increased by 29 percent, while unintended pregnancy decreased \n     by 20 percent among women with higher incomes.\n       (13) Public health programs, such as the Medicaid program \n     and family planning programs under title X of the Public \n     Health Service Act, provide high-quality family planning \n     services and other preventive health care to underinsured or \n     uninsured individuals who may otherwise lack access to health \n     care.\n       (14) Medicaid has become an essential source of support for \n     the provision of subsidized family planning services and \n     supplies. It is the single largest source of public funds \n     supporting these services. In 2001, the program provided 6 in \n     10 of all public dollars spent on family planning services. \n     In 2006, 12 percent of women of reproductive age (7,300,000 \n     women ages 15 to 44) looked to Medicaid for their care and 37 \n     percent of poor women of reproductive age rely upon Medicaid.\n       (15) Approximately 1,400,000 unintended pregnancies and \n     600,000 abortions are averted each year because of services \n     provided in publicly funded clinics. In 2006, Title X (of the \n     Public Health Service Act) service providers performed more \n     than 2,400,000 Pap tests, 2,400,000 breast exams, and \n     5,800,000 tests for sexually transmitted diseases, including \n     652,426 HIV tests and 2,300,000 Chlamydia tests. One in 4 \n     women who obtain reproductive health services from a medical \n     provider do so at a publicly funded clinic.\n       (16) The stagnant funding for public family planning \n     programs in combination with the increasing demand for \n     subsidized services, the rising costs of contraceptive \n     services and supplies, and the high cost of improved \n     screening and treatment for cervical cancer and sexually \n     transmitted infections has diminished the ability of clinics \n     receiving funds under title X of the Public Health Services \n     Act to adequately serve all those in need. At present, \n     clinics are able to reach just 41 percent of the women \n     needing subsidized services. Had Title X funding kept up with \n     inflation since fiscal year 1980, it would now be funded at \n     $759,000,000, instead of its fiscal year 2007 funding level \n     of $283,000,000. Taking inflation into account, funding for \n     Title X in constant dollars is 63 percent lower today than it \n     was in fiscal year 1980.\n       (17) While the Medicaid program remains the largest source \n     of subsidized family planning services, States are facing \n     significant budgetary pressures to cut their Medicaid \n     programs, putting many women at risk of losing coverage for \n     family planning services.\n       (18) In addition, eligibility under the Medicaid program in \n     many States is severely restricted, which leaves family \n     planning services financially out of reach for many poor \n     women. Many States have demonstrated tremendous success with \n     Medicaid family planning waivers that allow States to expand \n     access to Medicaid family planning services. However, the \n     administrative burden of applying for a waiver poses a \n     significant barrier to States that would like to expand their \n     coverage of family planning programs through Medicaid.\n       (19) As of December of 2008, 27 States offered expanded \n     family planning benefits as a result of Medicaid family \n     planning waivers. The cost-effectiveness of these waivers was \n     affirmed by a recent evaluation funded by the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services. This evaluation of six waivers \n     found that all family planning programs under such waivers \n     resulted in significant savings to both the Federal and State \n     governments. Moreover, the researchers found measurable \n     reductions in unintended pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\n       (20) Although employer-sponsored health plans have improved \n     coverage of contraceptive services and supplies, largely in \n     response to State contraceptive coverage laws, there is still \n     significant room for improvement. The ongoing lack of \n     coverage in health insurance plans, particularly in self-\n     insured and individual plans, continues to place effective \n     forms of contraception beyond the financial reach of many \n     women.\n       (21) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money. Not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (22) Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. Research \n     confirms that easier access to emergency contraceptives does \n     not increase sexual risk-taking or sexually transmitted \n     diseases.\n       (23) The available evidence shows that many women do not \n     know about emergency contraception, do not know where to get \n     it, or are unable to access it. Overcoming these obstacles \n     could help ensure that more women use emergency contraception \n     consistently and correctly.\n       (24) A November 2006 study of declining pregnancy rates \n     among teens concluded that the reduction in teen pregnancy \n     between 1995 and 2002 is primarily the result of increased \n     use of contraceptives. As such, it is critically important \n     that teens receive accurate, unbiased information about \n     contraception.\n       (25) The American Medical Association, the American Nurses \n     Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Public Health Association, and the Society for Adolescent \n     Medicine, support responsible sex education that includes \n     information about both abstinence and contraception.\n       (26) Teens who receive comprehensive sex education that \n     includes discussion of contraception as well as abstinence \n     are more likely than those who receive abstinence-only \n     messages to delay sex, to have fewer partners, and to use \n     contraceptives when they do become sexually active.\n       (27) Government-funded abstinence-only-until-marriage \n     programs are precluded from discussing contraception except \n     to talk about failure rates. An October 2006 report by the \n     Government Accountability Office found that the Department of \n     Health and Human Services does not review the materials of \n     recipients of grants administered by such department for \n     scientific accuracy and requires grantees to review their own \n     materials for scientific accuracy. The GAO also reported on \n     the Department's total lack of appropriate and customary \n     measurements to determine if funded programs are effective. \n     In addition, a separate letter from the Government \n     Accountability Office found that the Department of Health and \n     Human Services is in violation of Federal law by failing to \n     enforce a requirement under the Public Health Service Act \n     that Federally-funded grantees working to address the \n     prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including \n     abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, must provide \n     medically accurate information about the effectiveness of \n     condoms.\n       (28) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of \n     Medicine, the American Medical Association, and the Office on \n     National AIDS Policy stress the need for sex education that \n     includes messages about abstinence and provides young people \n     with information about contraception for the prevention of \n     teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted \n     diseases.\n       (29) A 2006 statement from the American Public Health \n     Association (``APHA'') ``recognizes the importance of \n     abstinence education, but only as part of a comprehensive \n     sexuality education program . . . APHA calls for repealing \n     current federal funding for abstinence-only programs and \n     replacing it with funding for a new Federal program to \n     promote comprehensive sexuality education, combining \n     information about abstinence with age-appropriate sexuality \n     education.''\n       (30) Comprehensive sex education programs respect the \n     diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n     and will complement and augment the sex education children \n     receive from their families.\n       (31) Over 60 percent of the 56,300 annual new cases of HIV \n     infections in the United States occur in youth ages 13 \n     through 24. African American and Latino youth have been \n     disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In \n     2005, Blacks and Latinos accounted for 84 percent of all new \n     HIV infections among 13 to 19 year olds and 76 percent of HIV \n     infections among 20 to 24 year olds in the United States even \n     though, together, they represent only about 32 percent of \n     people in these ages. Teens in the United States contract an \n     estimated 9,000,000 sexually transmitted infections each \n     year. By age 24, at least 1 in 4 sexually active people \n     between the ages of 15 and 24 will have contracted a sexually \n     transmitted infection.\n       (32) Approximately 50 young people a day, an average of two \n     young people every hour of every day, are infected with HIV \n     in the United States.\n       (33) In 1990, Congress passed the Medicaid Anti-\n     Discriminatory Drug Price and Patient Benefit Restoration Act \n     to ensure that Medicaid receives the lowest drug prices in \n     the marketplace. Congress intentionally protected the \n     practice of pharmaceutical companies offering charitable \n     organizations and clinics nominally-priced drugs. As an \n     unintended consequence of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, \n     birth control prices have skyrocketed for millions of women \n     who depend on safety net providers for their birth control. \n     Birth control that previously cost only $5 to $10 per month \n     is now prohibitively expensive, running as much as $40 or $50 \n     a month. Many family planning health centers have absorbed \n     much of this price increase, further straining already \n     limited resources. As the economic crisis worsens, women and \n     their families are increasingly turning to health care safety \n     net providers, such as family planning health centers, for a \n     reliable source of care.\n\n             TITLE I--TITLE X OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide a permanent deduction for State and local \ngeneral sales taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \npermanently correct an injustice in the tax code that has harmed \ncitizens in many States of this great Nation.\n  State and local governments have various alternatives for raising \nrevenue. Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a \ncombination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income \ntaxes have been able to offset some of their federal income taxes by \nreceiving a deduction for those State and local income taxes. Before \n1986, taxpayers also had the ability to deduct their sales taxes.\n  The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not \nhave to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to \none level of government should not also be taxed by another level of \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, citizens of some States were treated differently after \n1986 when the deduction for State and local sales taxes was eliminated. \nThis discriminated against those living in States, such as my home \nState of Texas, with no income taxes. It is important to remember the \nlack of an income tax does not mean citizens in these States do not pay \nState taxes; revenues are simply collected differently.\n  It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the \nrevenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing \nthe same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not \ntreat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing \ntax collection methods, and it should not provide an incentive for \nStates to establish income taxes over sales taxes.\n  This discrepancy has a significant impact on Texas. According to the \nTexas Comptroller, extending the deduction would save Texans a \nprojected $1.2 billion a year, or an average of $520 per filer claiming \nthe deduction. The Texas Comptroller also estimates continuing the \ndeduction is associated with 15,700 to 25,700 Texas jobs and $1.1 \nbillion to $1.4 billion in gross State product.\n  Recognizing the inequity in the tax code, Congress reinstated the \nsales tax deduction in 2004 and authorized it for 2 years. In 2006 \nCongress extended the sales tax deduction for an additional 2 years. \nLast year, Congress extended the deduction for 2 more years. \nUnfortunately, the deduction is only in effect through 2009, and we \nmust act to prevent the inequity from returning.\n  The legislation I am offering today will fix this problem for good by \nmaking the State and local sales tax deduction permanent. This will \npermanently end the discrimination suffered by my fellow Texans and \ncitizens of other States who do not have the option of an income tax \ndeduction.\n  This legislation is about reestablishing equity to the tax code and \ndefending the important principle of eliminating taxes on taxes. I hope \nmy fellow Senators will support this effort and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 35\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF DEDUCTION OF STATE AND \n                   LOCAL GENERAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (I) of section 164(b)(5) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by section 201 \n     of the Tax Extenders and Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, is \n     amended by striking ``, and before January 1, 2010''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 36. A bill to repeat the perimeter rule for Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nEnsign in introducing the Abolishing Aviation Barriers Act of 2009. \nThis bill would remove the arbitrary restrictions that prevent \nAmericans from having an array of options for non-stop air travel \nbetween airports in Western states and LaGuardia International Airport \nand Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n  LaGuardia restricts the departure or arrival of non-stop flights to \nor from airports that are farther then 1,500 miles from LaGuardia. \nWashington National has a similar restriction for non-stop flights to \nor from airports 1,250 miles from Washington National. These \nrestrictions are commonly referred to as the ``perimeter rule.'' This \nbill would abolish these archaic limitations that reduce consumers' \noptions for convenient flights and competitive fares.\n  The original purpose of the perimeter rule was to promote LaGuardia \nand Washington National as airports for business travelers flying to \nand from East Coast and Midwest cities and to promote traffic to other \nairports by diverting long haul flights to Newark and Kennedy airports \nin the New York area and the Dulles airport in the Washington area. \nHowever, over the years, Congress has granted numerous exceptions to \nthe perimeter rule because the air traveling public is eager for \noptions. Today, exceptions are made for nonstop flights between \nLaGuardia and Denver and between Washington National and Denver, Las \nVegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Seattle. Rather then \ncontinuing to take a piecemeal approach to promoting consumer choice, I \nurge Congress to take this opportunity once and for all to do away with \nthis outdated rule.\n  I continue to believe that Americans should have access to air travel \nat the lowest possible cost and with the most convenience for their \nschedule. Therefore, I have always advocated for the removal of any \nartificial barrier that prevents free market competition. In 2004, I \nco-sponsored legislation to repeal the Wright Amendment which \nprohibited flights from Dallas' Love Field airport to 43 states. This \nyear, I am proud to once again join with my colleagues to eliminate \nanother unnecessary restraint through the Abolishing Aviation Barriers \nAct of 2009.\n  A 1999 study by the Transportation Research Board, the most recent \navailable, stated that perimeter rules ``no longer serve their original \npurpose and have produced too many adverse side effects, including \nbarriers to competition . . . The rules arbitrarily prevent some \nairlines from extending their networks to these airports; they \ndiscourage competition among the airports in the region and among the \nairlines that use these airports; and they are subject to chronic \nattempts by special interest groups to obtain exemptions.'' That same \nyear, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, stated that the\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\n``practical effect'' of the perimeter rule ``has been to limit entry'' \nof other carriers and found that airfares at LaGuardia and Washington \nNational are approximately 50 percent higher on average than fares at \nsimilar airports unconstrained by the perimeter rule. Such an \nanticompetitive rule should not remain in effect, particularly where \nits anticompetitive impact has long been recognized.\n  For this reason, I will continue the struggle to try to remove the \nperimeter rule and other anti-competitive restrictions that increase \nconsumer costs and decrease convenience for no apparent benefit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 37. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Economic Growth \nThrough Innovation Act of 2009. This bill would make permanent the \ncurrent research and development tax credit. Otherwise, this tax credit \nwill expire on December 31, 2009.\n  A permanent credit would provide an incentive to innovate, and remove \nuncertainty now hanging over businesses as they make research and \ndevelopment investment decisions for 2010 and beyond. The research and \ndevelopment tax credit was first established in 1981 and has been \nextended and revised repeatedly since then. Failure to make the tax \ncredit permanent has led to reduced investment in research, which has \nled to fewer jobs being created in the United States. Tax policies have \na powerful influence on business investment and hiring decisions, and \nthat is why I have chosen to introduce this bill on the first day of \nthe 111th Congress. Additionally, both President-elect Obama and I were \nin full agreement during the campaign that making permanent the \nresearch and development tax credit is critical to spurring investment \nin developing technologies.\n  In the 1980s, the U.S. was a leader among nations for providing the \nmost generous tax treatment of research and development. By 2004, the \nmost recent study, the United States had fallen to 17th, which explains \nwhy the U.S. is no longer considered by many to be the world leader in \ninnovation and technology. A permanent, meaningful research and \ndevelopment tax credit will ensure that businesses keep funding \nresearch and development, which may lead to numerous new discoveries in \nthe U.S. such as fuel-efficient vehicles, cancer treatment or the \ndevelopment of clean energy.\n  Studies have shown that on average, companies invest $94 in research \nand development for every $6 the Federal Government invests in the tax \ncredit. While I understand that some economists have estimated this tax \ncredit may cost many billions of dollars in tax revenue to the Federal \ngovernment, I believe it is essential to spurring an economic recovery.\n  Companies of all sizes, in a wide range of industries, have taken \nadvantage of the research and development tax credit during its \nexistence. According to a recent study by Ernst & Young, 17,700 \nbusinesses claimed $6.6 billion research and development tax credits on \ntheir tax returns in 2005, the most recent year available. Almost a \nquarter of these businesses were small businesses with $1 million of \nassets or less, and almost half were businesses with assets of $1-$5 \nmillion, which is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. Firms in the \nmanufacturing, information and services sectors claimed the majority of \nthe credit, and the states with the highest number of companies \nreporting research and development activity include those States that \nhave been hit the hardest by the depressed economy such as Michigan, \nPennsylvania and California.\n  Congress has endorsed the credit by extending it 13 times since \nenactment, and several times the credit has been reinstated \nretroactively. Yet, it has never been made permanent, creating a less \ncertain investment atmosphere. With so many Republicans and Democrats \nin agreement that this tax credit must be made permanent, including \nPresident-elect Obama, I hope this bill will be given swift \nconsideration and signed into law during the first few months of 2009 \nto increase our nation's ability to innovate, create jobs and improve \nour sagging economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 38. A bill to establish a United States Boxing Commission to \nadminister the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nDorgan in introducing the Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2009. \nThis legislation is virtually identical to a measure reported by the \nCommerce Committee during the first executive session of the 110th \nCongress, after being approved unanimously by the Senate in 2005. \nSimply put, this bill would better protect professional boxing from the \nfraud, corruption, and ineffective regulation that have plagued the \nsport for far too many years, and that have devastated physically and \nfinancially many of our Nation's professional boxers. I remain \ncommitted to moving the Professional Boxing Amendments Act through the \nSenate and I trust that my colleagues will once again vote favorably on \nthis important legislation.\n  Since 1996, Congress has made efforts to improve the sport of \nprofessional boxing--and for very good reason. With rare exception, \nprofessional boxers come from the lowest rung on our economic ladder. \nOften they are the least educated and most exploited athletes in our \nnation. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 and the Muhammad Ali \nBoxing Reform Act of 2000 established uniform health and safety \nstandards for professional boxers, as well as basic protections for \nboxers against the sometimes coercive, exploitative, and unethical \nbusiness practices of promoters, managers, and sanctioning \norganizations. But further action is needed.\n  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing \nFederal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards \nfor professional boxers, establishing a centralized medical registry to \nbe used by local commissions to protect boxers, reducing the arbitrary \npractices of sanctioning organizations, and enhancing the uniformity \nand basic standards for professional boxing contracts. Most \nimportantly, this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory \nentity to oversee professional boxing and set basic uniform standards \nfor certain aspects of the sport.\n  Current law has improved to some extent the state of professional \nboxing. However, I remain concerned, as do many others, that the sport \nremains at risk. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office spent \nmore than six months studying ten of the country's busiest state and \ntribal boxing commissions. Government auditors found that many State \nand tribal boxing commissions still do not comply with Federal boxing \nlaw, and that there is a troubling lack of enforcement by both Federal \nand State officials.\n  Ineffective and inconsistent oversight of professional boxing has \ncontributed to the continuing scandals, controversies, unethical \npractices, and unnecessary deaths in the sport. These problems have led \nmany in professional boxing to conclude that the only solution is an \neffective and accountable Federal boxing commission. The Professional \nBoxing Amendments Act would create such an entity.\n  Professional boxing remains the only major sport in the United States \nthat does not have a strong, centralized association, league, or other \nregulatory body to establish and enforce uniform rules and practices. \nBecause a powerful few benefit greatly from the current system of \npatchwork compliance and enforcement of Federal boxing law, a national \nself-regulating organization--though preferable to Federal government \noversight is not a realistic option.\n  This bill would establish the United States Boxing Commission \n``USBC'' or Commission. The Commission would be responsible for \nprotecting the health, safety, and general interests of professional \nboxers. The USBC would also be responsible for ensuring uniformity, \nfairness, and integrity in professional boxing. More specifically, the \nCommission would administer Federal boxing law and coordinate with \nother Federal regulatory agencies to ensure that this law is enforced; \noversee all professional boxing matches in the United States; and work \nwith the boxing industry and local commissions to improve the safety, \nintegrity, and professionalism of\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nprofessional boxing in the United States.\n  The USBC would also license boxers, promoters, managers, and \nsanctioning organizations. The Commission would have the authority to \nrevoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing law, to stop \nunethical or illegal conduct, to protect the health and safety of a \nboxer, or if the revocation is otherwise in the public interest.\n  It is important to state clearly and plainly for the record that the \npurpose of the USBC is not to interfere with the daily operations of \nState and tribal boxing commissions. Instead, the Commission would work \nin consultation with local commissions, and it would only exercise its \nauthority when reasonable grounds exist for such intervention. In point \nof fact, the Professional Boxing Amendments Act states explicitly that \nit would not prohibit any boxing commission from exercising any of its \npowers, duties, or functions with respect to the regulation or \nsupervision of professional boxing to the extent not inconsistent with \nthe provisions of Federal boxing law.\n  Let there be no doubt, however, of the very basic and pressing need \nin professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission. The \nestablishment of the USBC would address that need. The problems that \nplague the sport of professional boxing undermine the credibility of \nthe sport in the eyes of the public and--more importantly--compromise \nthe safety of boxers. The Professional Boxing Amendments Act provides \nan effective approach to curbing these problems.\n  As this measure continues through the legislative process, I fully \nexpect Congress will ensure that funding offsets are provided to it and \nevery other spending measure as we work to restore fiscal discipline to \nWashington in a bipartisan manner. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 39. A bill to repeal section 10(f) of Public Law 93-531, commonly \nknown as the ``Bennett Freeze''; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwould repeal section 10(f) of Public Law 93-531, commonly known as the \n``Bennett Freeze.'' Passage of this legislation would officially mark \nthe end of roughly 40 years of litigation and land-lock between the \nNavajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe.\n  For decades the Navajo and the Hopi have been engrossed in a bitter \ndispute over land rights in the Black Mesa area just south of Kayenta, \nArizona. The conflict extends as far back as 1882 when the boundaries \nof the Hopi and Navajo reservations were initially defined resulting in \na tragic saga of litigation and damaging federal Indian policy. By \n1966, relations between the tribes became so strained over development \nand access to sacred religious sites in the disputed area that the \nfederal government imposed a construction freeze on the disputed \nreservation land. The freeze prohibited any additional housing \ndevelopment in the Black Mesa area and restricted repairs on existing \ndwellings. This injunction became known as the ``Bennett Freeze,'' \nnamed after former BIA Commissioner Robert Bennett who imposed the ban.\n  The Bennett Freeze was intended to be a temporary measure to prevent \none tribe taking advantage of another until the land dispute could be \nsettled. Unfortunately, the conflict was nowhere near resolution, and \nthe construction freeze ultimately devastated economic development in \nnorthern Arizona for years to come. By some accounts, nearly 8,000 \npeople currently living in the Bennett Freeze area reside in conditions \nthat haven't changed in half a century. While the population of the \narea has increased 65 percent, generations of families have been forced \nto live together in homes that have been declared unfit for human \nhabitation by the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. \nOnly 3 percent of the families affected by the Bennett Freeze have \nelectricity. Only 10 percent have running water. Almost none have \nnatural gas.\n  In September 2005, the Navajo and Hopi peoples' desire to live \ntogether in mutual respect prevailed when both tribes approved an \nintergovernmental agreement that resolved all outstanding litigation in \nthe Bennett Freeze area. This landmark agreement also clarifies the \nboundaries of the Navajo and Hopi reservations in Arizona, and ensures \nthat access to religious sites of both tribes in protected. As such, \nthe Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, and the Department of Interior all \nsupport congressional legislation to lift the freeze.\n  The bill I am introducing today would repeal the Bennett Freeze. The \nintergovernmental compact approved last year by both tribes, the \nDepartment of Interior, and signed by the U.S. District Court for \nArizona, marks a new era in Navajo-Hopi relations. Lifting the Bennett \nFreeze gives us an opportunity to put decades of conflict between the \nNavajo and Hopi behind us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 40. A bill to designate Fossil Creek, a tributary of the Verde \nRiver in the State of Arizona, as a component of the National Wild and \nScenic Rivers System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, in reintroducing a bill to designate Fossil Creek as a \nWild and Scenic River.\n  Fossil Creek is a thing of beauty. With its picturesque scenery, lush \nriparian ecosystem, unique geological features, and deep iridescent \nblue pools and waterfalls, this tributary to the Wild and Scenic Verde \nRiver and Lower Colorado River Watershed stretches 14 miles through \neast central Arizona. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, some of \nwhich are threatened or endangered species. Over 100 bird species \ninhabit the Fossil Creek area and use it to migrate between the range \nlowlands and the Mogollon-Colorado Plateau highlands. Fossil Creek also \nsupports a variety of aquatic species and is one of the few perennial \nstreams in Arizona with multiple native fish.\n  Fossil Creek was named in the 1800s when early explorers described \nthe fossil-like appearance of creek-side rocks and vegetation coated \nwith calcium carbonate deposits from the creek's water. In the early \n1900s, pioneers recognized the potential for hydroelectric power \ngeneration in the creek's constant and abundant spring fed base-flow. \nThey claimed the channel's water rights and built a dam system and \ngenerating facilities known as the Childs-Irving hydro-project. Over \ntime, the project was acquired by Arizona Public Service, APS, one of \nthe state's largest electric utility providers serving more than a \nmillion Arizonans. Because Childs-Irving produced less then half of 1 \npercent of the total power generated by APS, the decision was made \nultimately to decommission the aging dam and restore Fossil Creek to \nits pre-settlement conditions.\n  APS has partnered with various environmental groups, federal land \nmanagers, and state, tribal and local governments to safely remove the \nChilds-Irving power generating facilities and restore the riparian \necosystem. In 2005, APS removed the dam system and returned full flows \nto Fossil Creek. Researchers predict Fossil Creek will soon become a \nfully regenerated Southwest native fishery providing a most-valuable \nopportunity to reintroduce at least six threatened and endangered \nnative fish species as well as rebuild the native populations presently \nliving in the creek.\n  There is a growing need to provide additional protection and adequate \nstaffing and management at Fossil Creek. Recreational visitation to the \nriverbed is expected to increase dramatically, and by the Forest \nService's own admission, they aren't able to manage current levels of \nvisitation or the pressures of increased use. While responsible \nrecreation and other activities at Fossil Creek are to be encouraged, \nwe must also ensure the long-term success of the ongoing restoration \nefforts. Designation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would help to \nensure the appropriate level of protection and resources are devoted to \nFossil Creek. Already, Fossil Creek has been found eligible for Wild \nand Scenic designation by the Forest Service and the proposal has \nwidespread support from surrounding communities. All of the lands \npotentially affected by a designation are owned and managed by the \nForest Service and will not affect private\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nproperty owners. I fully expect that as this measure continues through \nthe legislative process, Congress will ensure that funding offsets are \nprovided to it and every other spending measure as we work to restore \nfiscal discipline to Washington in a bipartisan manner.\n  Fossil Creek is a unique Arizona treasure, and would benefit greatly \nfrom the protection and recognition offered through Wild and Scenic \ndesignation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 49. A bill to help Federal prosecutors and investigators combat \npublic corruption by strengthening and clarifying the law; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, I am pleased to join with Senator Cornyn \nonce again to introduce the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements \nAct of 2009, a bill that will strengthen and clarify key aspects of \nFederal criminal law and provide new tools to help investigators and \nprosecutors attack public corruption nationwide.\n  The start of a new Congress presents a unique opportunity to restore \nthe faith of the American people in their government. That is why I \nsought to offer an early version of this bill as my first amendment two \nyears ago when that new Congress began. Regrettably, a Republican \nobjection to it prevented its adoption at that time.\n  As we have seen in recent months, public corruption can erode the \ntrust the American people have in those who are given the privilege of \npublic service. Too often, though, loopholes in existing laws have \nmeant that corrupt conduct can go unchecked.\n  Make no mistake: The stain of corruption has spread to all levels of \ngovernment. This is a problem that victimizes every American by \nchipping away at the foundations of our democracy. Rooting out the \nkinds of public corruption that have resulted in convictions of members \nof both the Senate and the House, and many others, requires us to give \nprosecutors the tools and resources they need to investigate and \nprosecute criminal public corruption offenses. This bill will do \nexactly that.\n  The bill Senator Cornyn and I introduce today will provide \ninvestigators and prosecutors more time and, even more crucially, more \nresources to pursue public corruption cases. It also amends several key \nstatutes to broaden their application in corruption contexts and to \nprevent corrupt public officials and their accomplices from evading or \ndefeating prosecution based on existing legal ambiguities.\n  The bill provides significant and much-needed additional funding for \npublic corruption enforcement. Since September 11, 2001, Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, FBI, resources have been shifted away from the \npursuit of white collar crime to counterterrorism. Director Mueller has \nsaid that public corruption is among the FBI's top investigative \npriorities, but a September 2005 report by the Department of Justice \nInspector General found that, from 2000 to 2004, there was an overall \nreduction in public corruption matters handled by the FBI. More \nrecently, a study by the research group Transactional Records Access \nClearinghouse found that the prosecution of all kinds of white collar \ncrimes is down 27 percent since 2000, and official corruption cases \nhave dropped in the same period by 14 percent. The Wall Street Journal \nreported in 2007 that the investigation of an elected Federal official \nstalled for six months because the investigating U.S. Attorney's Office \ncould not afford to replace the prosecutor who had previously handled \nthe case. We must reverse this trend and make sure that law enforcement \nhas the tools and the resources it needs to confront these serious and \ncorrosive crimes.\n  Efforts to combat terrorism and public corruption are not mutually \nexclusive. A bribed customs official who allows a terrorist to smuggle \ncontraband into our country, or a corrupt consular officer who \nillegally supplies U.S. entry visas to would-be terrorists can cause \ngrave harm to our national security.\n  The bill also extends the statute of limitations from 5 to 6 years \nfor the most serious public corruption offenses. Public corruption \ncases are among the most difficult and time-consuming cases to \ninvestigate. Bank fraud, arson and passport fraud, among other \noffenses, all have 10-year statutes of limitations. Public corruption \noffenses cut to the heart of our democracy. This modest increase to the \nstatute of limitations is a reasonable step to help our corruption \ninvestigators and prosecutors do their jobs.\n  This bill goes further by amending several key statutes to broaden \ntheir application in corruption and fraud contexts and to eliminate \nlegal ambiguities that can hinder prosecution of serious corruption. \nThe bill includes a fix to the gratuities statute that makes clear that \npublic officials may not accept anything of value, other than what is \npermitted by existing rules and regulations, given to them because of \ntheir official position. This important provision contains appropriate \nsafeguards to ensure that only corrupt conduct is prosecuted, but it \nputs teeth behind the ethical reforms the Senate adopted under the \nleadership of Senator Obama.\n  The bill also appropriately clarifies the definition of what it means \nfor a public official to perform an ``official act'' for the purposes \nof the bribery statute and closes several other gaps in current law. \nThe bill adds two corruption-related crimes as predicates for the \nFederal wiretap and racketeering statutes, lowers the transactional \namount required for Federal prosecution of bribery involving federally-\nfunded State programs, and expands the venue for perjury and \nobstruction of justice prosecutions.\n  Finally, the bill raises the statutory maximum penalties for several \nlaws dealing with official misconduct, including theft of Government \nproperty and bribery. These increases reflect the serious and corrosive \nnature of these crimes, and would harmonize the punishment for these \ncrimes with other similar statutes.\n  If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct \nthat we have witnessed over the past several years in high-profile \npublic corruption cases, Congress should enact meaningful legislation \nto give investigators and prosecutors the tools and resources they need \nto enforce our laws. Passing ethics and lobbying reform in the last \nCongress was a step in the right direction. Now we should finish the \njob by strengthening the criminal law to enable federal investigators \nand prosecutors to bring those who undermine the public trust to \njustice. I am disappointed that Republican objections prevented the \nfull Senate from passing this critical bill early in the last Congress. \nI hope that this year all Senators will support this bipartisan bill \nand take firm action to stamp out intolerable corruption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 49\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \nauthorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to \ndetermine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Clinical Social \nWorkers' Recognition Act to correct a continuing problem in the Federal \nEmployees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social \nworkers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of \nquality mental health care services.\n  Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance \nplans across the nation. However, Title V of the United States Code, \ndoes not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by \nclinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' \ncompensation claims brought by Federal employees. The bill I am \nintroducing corrects this problem.\n  It is a sad irony that Federal employees may select a clinical social \nworker through their health plans to provide mental health services, \nbut may not go to this same professional for workers' compensation \nevaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations \nprovided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits Federal \nemployees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation \nmental health evaluations. Lack of this recognition may well impose an \nundue burden on federal employees where clinical social workers are the \nonly available providers of mental health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Social Workers' \n     Recognition Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXAMINATIONS BY CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS FOR FEDERAL \n                   WORKER COMPENSATION CLAIMS.\n\n       Section 8101 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and osteopathic \n     practitioners'' and inserting ``osteopathic practitioners, \n     and clinical social workers''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``osteopathic \n     practitioners'' and inserting ``osteopathic practitioners, \n     clinical social workers,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 51. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to recognize the \nUnited States Military Cancer Institute as an establishment within the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, to require the \nInstitute to promote the health of members of the Armed Forces and \ntheir dependents by enhancing cancer research and treatment, to provide \nfor a study of the epidemiological causes of cancer among various \nethnic groups for cancer prevention and early detection efforts, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I am, again, introducing the United \nStates Military Cancer Institute Research Collaborative Act. This \nlegislation, twice passed by the Senate yet unsuccessful in the House, \nwould formally establish the United States Military Cancer Institute, \nUSMCI, and support the collaborative augmentation of research efforts \nin cancer epidemiology, prevention and control. Although the USMCI \nalready exists as an informal collaborative effort, this bill will \nformally establish the institution with a mission of providing for the \nmaintenance of health in the military by enhancing cancer research and \ntreatment, and studying the epidemiological causes of cancer among \nvarious ethnic groups. By formally establishing the USMCI, it will be \nin a better position to unite military research efforts with other \ncancer research centers.\n  Cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment are significant \nissues for the military population, thus the USMCI was organized to \ncoordinate the existing military cancer assets. The USMCI has a \ncomprehensive database of its beneficiary population of 9 million \npeople. The military's nationwide tumor registry, the Automated Central \nTumor Registry, has acquired more than 180,000 cases in the last 14 \nyears, and a serum repository of 30 million specimens from military \npersonnel collected sequentially since 1987.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Native \nHawaiian Medicaid Coverage Act. This legislation would authorize a \nFederal Medicaid Assistance Percent, FMAP, of 100 percent for the \npayment of health care costs of Native Hawaiians who receive health \ncare from Federally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian \nHealth Care System.\n  This bill is modeled on the Native Alaskan Health Care Act, which \nprovides for a Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent of 100 percent for \npayment of health care costs for Native Alaskans by the Indian Health \nService, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization.\n  Community health centers serve as the ``safety net'' for uninsured \nand medically underserved Native Hawaiians and other United States \ncitizens, providing comprehensive primary and preventive health \nservices to the entire community. Outpatient services offered to the \nentire family include comprehensive primary care, preventive health \nmaintenance, and education outreach in the local community. Community \nhealth centers, with their multidisciplinary approach, offer cost \neffective integration of health promotion and wellness with chronic \ndisease management and primary care focused on serving vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 52\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics \nunder State Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am, again, introducing the Nursing \nSchool Clinics Act. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to \nprovide access to quality health care for all Americans by offering \ngrants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary care \nclinics in underserved areas where additional medical services are most \nneeded. In addition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing \nschools to enhance the scope of student training and education by \nproviding firsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities.\n  Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university \nof nonprofit primary care centers developed mainly in collaboration \nwith university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. \nThese centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse \npractitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient \ncare while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing \nfaculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic \ninstitutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. To \ndate, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have \nyielded excellent results, including significantly fewer emergency room \nvisits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as \ncompared to conventional primary health care.\n  The bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery \nin underserved areas with the education of advanced practice nurses. To \naccomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would \nbe amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing \nschool clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of \ngrants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the \nfinancial incentives for clinic operators to establish the clinics.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective \nand quality health care to all Americans, we must consider a wide range \nof proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach \nthe issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring \nthat all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an \nintegral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act \nrecognizes the central role nurses can perform as care givers to the \nmedically underserved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 53\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by establishing minimum nurse staffing \nratios at certain Medicare providers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am, again, reintroducing the \nRegistered Nurse Safe Staffing Act. For over four decades I have been a \ncommitted supporter of nurses and the delivery of safe patient care. \nWhile enforceable regulations will help to ensure patient safety, the \ncomplexity and variability of today's hospitals require that staffing \npatters be determined at the hospital and unit level, with the \nprofessional input of registered nurses. More than a decade of research \ndemonstrates that nurse staff levels and the skill mix of nursing staff \ndirectly affect the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. Studies \nshow that when there are more registered nurses, there are lower \nmortality rates, shorter lengths of stay, reduced costs, and fewer \ncomplications.\n  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nfound that the risks of patient mortality rose by 7 percent for every \nadditional patient added to the average nurse's workload. In the midst \nof a nursing shortage and increasing financial pressures, hospitals \noften find it difficult to maintain adequate staffing.\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nWhile nursing research indicates that adequate registered nurse \nstaffing is vital to the health and safety of patients, there is no \nstandardized public reporting mechanism, nor enforcement of adequate \nstaffing plans. The only regulations addressing nursing staff exists \nvaguely in Medicare Conditions of Participation which states: ``The \nnursing service must have an adequate number of licensed registered \nnurses, licensed practice, vocational, nurses, and other personnel to \nprovide nursing care to all patients as needed''.\n  This bill will require Medicare Participating Hospitals to develop \nand maintain reliable and valid systems to determine sufficient \nregistered nurse staffing. Given the demands that the healthcare \nindustry faces today, it is our responsibility to ensure that patients \nhave access to adequate nursing care. However, we must ensure that the \ndecisions by which care is provided are made by the clinical experts, \nthe registered nurses caring for these patients. Support of this bill \nsupports our Nation's nurses during a critical shortage, but more \nimportantly, works to ensure the safety of their patients.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 54\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Registered Nurse Safe \n     Staffing Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are hospitals throughout the United States that \n     have inadequate staffing of registered nurses to protect the \n     well-being and health of the patients.\n       (2) Studies show that the health of patients in hospitals \n     is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses \n     working in the hospital.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of registered nurses in \n     the United States.\n       (4) The effect of that shortage is revealed in unsafe \n     staffing levels in hospitals.\n       (5) Patient safety is adversely affected by these unsafe \n     staffing levels, creating a public health crisis.\n       (6) Registered nurses are being required to perform \n     professional services under conditions that do not support \n     quality health care or a healthful work environment for \n     registered nurses.\n       (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services for individuals entitled to benefits under the \n     Medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act, the Federal Government has a compelling \n     interest in promoting the safety of such individuals by \n     requiring any hospital participating in such program to \n     establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide improved reimbursement for clinical social worker services \nunder the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am, again, introducing legislation \nto amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct \ndiscrepancies in the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered \nthrough Medicare, Part B. These three proposed changes contained in \nthis legislation clarify the current payment process for clinical \nsocial workers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the \nprofession that is similar to other health care professionals \nreimbursed through the Medicare program.\n  First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker \nservices according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. \nSecond, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a \nclinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these \nservices are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. \nThird, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for \nservices provided to a client who is hospitalized.\n  Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care \nprovider network. They are legally regulated in every state of the \nnation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare throughout the health care system. It is time to correct the \ndisparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 55\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I again introduce legislation to \nauthorize the autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and \nclinical social workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical \nsupervision of the services provided by certain health professionals \nand does not\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nallow them to function to the full extent of their State practice \nlicenses. Those who need the services of outpatient rehabilitation \nfacilities should have access to a wide range of social and behavioral \nscience expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical social workers \nare recognized as independent providers of mental health care services \nunder the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the TRICARE \nMilitary Health Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare (Part \nB) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This legislation will \nensure that these qualified professionals achieve the same recognition \nunder the Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 56\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nestablish a psychology post-doctoral fellowship program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation to \namend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a \npsychology post-doctoral program. Psychologists have made a unique \ncontribution in reaching out to the Nation's medically underserved \npopulations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing \ngrave concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, adolescent \nand child behavioral disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of \na psychology post-doctoral program could be an effective way to find \nsolutions to these issues.\n  Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in \ntraditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining \nparticipants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health \nprofessionals who have participated in these specialized federally \nfunded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment \nobligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with \nthe underserved.\n  While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and \nmastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral \nfellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment \nskills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For \nexample, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child \nrecently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a \ncultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic \nlearning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to \ninitiate effective treatment.\n  Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is \nnot just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against \nwomen results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child \nand spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are the rates \nof alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral \nfellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be \nof special benefit in addressing these problems.\n  Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized \ntraining programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation \nin post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the Nation's \nunderserved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 57\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the tonnage tax on vessels operating in the dual \nUnited States domestic and foreign trades, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. Presdient, foreign registered ships now carry 97 \npercent of the imports and exports moving in United States \ninternational trade. These foreign vessels are held to lower standards \nthan United States registered ships, and are virtually untaxed. Their \ncosts of operation are, therefore, lower than United States ship \noperating costs, which explains their 97 percent market share.\n  Three years ago, in order to help level the playing field for United \nStates-flag ships that compete in international trade, Congress \nenacted, under the American Jobs Creation Act\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nof 2004, Public Law 108-357, Subchapter R, a ``tonnage tax'' that is \nbased on the tonnage of a vessel, rather than taxing international \nincome at a 35 percent corporate income tax rate. However, during the \nHouse and Senate conference, language was included, which states that a \nUnited States vessel cannot use the tonnage tax on international income \nif that vessel also operates in United States domestic commerce for \nmore than 30 days per year.\n  This 30-day limitation dramatically limits the availability of the \ntonnage tax for those United States ships that operate in both domestic \nand international trade and, accordingly, severely hinders their \ncompetitiveness in foreign commerce. It is important to recognize that \nships operating in United States domestic trade already have \nsignificant cost disadvantages. Specifically, (1) they are built in \nhigher priced United States shipyards; (2) do not receive Maritime \nSecurity Payments, even when operated in international trade; and (3) \nare owned by United States-based American corporations. The inability \nof these domestic operators to use the tonnage tax for their \ninternational service is a further, unnecessary burden on their \ncompetitive position in foreign commerce.\n  When windows of opportunity present themselves in international \ntrade, American tax policy and maritime policy should facilitate the \nparticipation of these American-built ships. Instead, the 30-day limit \nmakes them ineligible to use the tonnage tax, and further handicaps \nAmerican vessels when competing for international cargo. Denying the \ntonnage tax to coastwise qualified ships further stymies the operation \nof American built ships in international commerce, and further \nexacerbates America's 97 percent reliance on foreign ships to carry its \ninternational cargo.\n  These concerns were of sufficient importance that in December 2006 \nCongress repealed the 30-day limit on domestic trading but only for \napproximately 50 ships operating in the Great Lakes. These ships \nprimarily operate in domestic trade on the Great Lakes, but also carry \ncargo between the United States and Canada in international trade \n(Section 415 of P.L. 109-432, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006.)\n  The identifiable universe of remaining ships other than the Great \nLakes ships that operate in domestic trade, but that may also operate \ntemporarily in international trade, totals 13 United States flag \nvessels. These 13 ships normally operate in domestic trades that \ninvolve Washington, Oregon, California, Hawaii, Alaska, Florida, \nMississippi, and Louisiana. In the interest of providing equity to the \nUnited States corporations that own and operate these 13 vessels, my \nbill would repeal the tonnage tax 30-day limit on domestic operations \nand enable these vessels to utilize the tonnage tax on their \ninternational income--so they receive the same treatment as other \nUnited States flag international operators. I stress that, under my \nbill, these ships will continue to pay the normal 35 percent United \nStates corporate tax rate on their domestic income.\n  Repeal of the tonnage tax's 30-day limit on domestic operations is a \nnecessary step toward providing tax equity between United States flag \nand foreign flag vessels. I strongly urge the tax committees of the \nCongress to give this legislation their expedited consideration and \napproval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 58\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nmake certain graduate programs in professional psychology eligible to \nparticipate in various health professions loan programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n   Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise again today to reintroduce \nlegislation to modify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act \nin order to provide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs \nwith the opportunity to participate in various health professions loan \nprograms.\n  Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with \neligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan \nguarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusion of \nbehavioral science expertise into our community of public health \nproviders. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution \nbeing made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most \ndistressing problems.\n  The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical \ndisciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title \nVII programs plays a significant role in providing financial support \nfor the recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from \neconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an \nadvantage in the provision of critical services to minority populations \nbecause often they can communicate with clients in their own language \nand cultural framework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in \ncommunity settings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued \nsupport be provided for the training of individuals who provide health \ncare services to underserved communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 59\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the sale and counterfeiting of Presidential \ninaugural tickets; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Schumer, \nSnowe, and Boxer in introducing legislation to prohibit the selling and \ncounterfeiting of tickets to the Presidential inaugural ceremony.\n  The inauguration of the President of the United States is one of the \nmost important rituals of our democracy, and the chance to witness this \nsolemn event should not be bought and sold similar to tickets to a \nsporting event.\n  This is a dignified and critical moment of transition in Government, \na moment of which Americans have always been justifiably proud. It is, \nin fact, the major symbol of the real strength of our democracy--the \npeaceful transition from one elected President to the next.\n  Tickets to the official Presidential inaugural ceremony are supposed \nto be free for the people: for the volunteers who gave up their \nweekends, walking miles door to door to encourage voters to turn out at \nthe polls on election day, for members of the African-American \ncommunity to see one of their own take the oath of office for the \nhighest office in the land, for schoolchildren to witness history, and \nfor the American public to watch this affirmation of our Constitution, \nthis peaceful transition from one administration to another.\n  This is going to be the major civic event of our time. Excitement is \nat an all time high, and every one of us has received more phone calls \nfor tickets than we could possibly ever meet. People are desperate to \nbecome part of it, to touch it, to be around, to feel it, to listen to \nit, and they are coming from all over the country. We could have more \nthan 1.5 million people descend on the Nation's Capital for this \ninauguration.\n  Before I introduced a similar bill at the end of the last Congress, \ntickets to the Presidential inaugural were being offered for sale on \nthe Internet for $5,000 apiece, with some going as high as $40,000 \neach. To their credit, some Internet websites voluntarily agreed to \nrefuse to sell these tickets online. I want to thank and commend \nCraigslist, eBay, and StubHub for leading the way on this issue.\n  However, it is clear that relying on voluntary industry compliance to \nprevent the sale of these tickets is simply not enough. Today, some \nInternet sites are still offering these tickets for sale at prices up \nto $750 per ticket.\n  Let me be clear--these are free tickets that have not yet been \ndistributed by congressional and Presidential transition offices. These \nunscrupulous websites who continue to offer these tickets for sale do \nnot have any tickets to offer for sale.\n  These tickets are supposed to be free for the people. Once more, \nthese tickets are not yet even available. They will not be distributed \nto congressional offices until the end of the week before the \ninauguration. Even then the offices will require in-person pickup, with \nsecure identification. But they will be free and they should stay that \nway.\n  We are asking people to pick up their tickets the day before the \ninauguration in my office. Everyone will submit their name, their \naddress, and their driver's license. They will have to verify they are \nthe actual person who has tickets waiting for them. I believe this kind \nof procedure deters unscrupulous people from selling these tickets on \nthe Internet. No websites or other ticket outlets have inaugural \nswearing-in tickets to sell, despite what some of them claim.\n  Congress has the responsibility of overseeing this historic event. \nThis bill will ensure that these tickets are not sold to the highest \nbidder, and that the inauguration has all the respect and dignity it \ndeserves.\n  This legislation is aimed at stopping those who seek to profit by \nselling these tickets. It would also target those who seek to dupe the \npublic with fraudulent or counterfeit tickets or those who merely \npromise but can't deliver on tickets that they do not actually have.\n  Those who violate the law under this legislation would face a class A \nmisdemeanor with a substantial fine, imprisonment of up to 1 year, or \nboth.\n  The bill also exempts official Presidential Inaugural Committees, and \nthere is good reason for this. Presidential Inaugural Committees are \nused to organize and fund the public inaugural ceremonies. Donations \nmade in return for inaugural tickets have long been used by both \npolitical parts to fund the Presidential inaugural festivities.\n  Unlike unscrupulous websites and ticket scalpers, there is no \n``profit'' made by Presidential Inaugural Committees in giving these \ntickets to people in return for inaugural donations. This exemption \nwill allow both parties to raise the needed funds to put on \nPresidential inaugurals in the future.\n  It is my hope that Congress will pass this legislation quickly, \nbefore President-elect Obama's inauguration on January 20th. I think it \nis very important to establish once and for all that tickets to the \ninauguration of the next President of the United States are not issues \nof commerce, but rather free tickets to be given to the people.\n  So I hope that this week this legislation can pass unanimously on a \nhotline by this body.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 60\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code with \nrespect to modification of certain mortgages on principal residences, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the 111th Congress begins, the most \nimportant item on our agenda is to help end the worst economic crisis \nAmerica has faced since the Great Depression.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to develop \nand approve an economic turnaround package as quickly as possible.\n  But even if Congress authorizes as much as $1 trillion in new \nGovernment spending over the next 2 years to stimulate the economy, if \nwe don't address the origins of this crisis, I fear the impact of any \nrecovery package will be dampened.\n  This economic crisis began with the bubble that burst in the housing \nmarket. So we have to address that, first and foremost. Families need \nto be able to stay in their homes, and communities need to be \nstabilized before the economy can start to grow again.\n  That's why, as my first bill in the new Congress, I am reintroducing \nthe Helping Families Save Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act.\n  When I first began working on this bill almost two years ago, the \nCenter for Responsible Lending, Credit Suisse, and others estimated \nthat 2 million homes were at risk of foreclosure.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association and the rest of the mortgage \nindustry scoffed at such a number.\n  Last month, Credit Suisse estimated that 8.1 million homes are likely \nto be lost to foreclosure by 2012. If the economy continues to worsen, \nthey believe foreclosures will exceed 10 million homes.\n  If over 8 million families--representing 16 percent of all \nmortgages--are losing their homes, our economy is not going to recover.\n  I first introduced this bill in September of 2007. I have chaired \nthree hearings on the subject and tried three times to pass this \nlegislation last year.\n  A large coalition supports this bill--including the AARP, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, the AFL-CIO, the Center for Responsible Lending, the National \nAssociation of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, and many others. But the \nMortgage Bankers Association and the rest of the mortgage industry have \nsuccessfully opposed it so far.\n  Three things have fundamentally changed, and I am back, pressing even \nharder that we make this bill law.\n  First, the banks that brought us the reckless lending, dense \nsecuritization, and risky investing practices that created the boom and \nbust in the housing market have now happily accepted a $700 billion \nhandout from the American taxpayers . . . even as most of them refuse \nto help the homeowners who are suffering most acutely from their \nirresponsible business practices. Frankly, I think that the credibility \nof the opposition to my bill has slipped just a bit.\n  Second, it is painfully clear that foreclosure mitigation efforts to \ndate have failed. Professor Alan White of the Valparaiso School of Law \nanalyzed a large sample of the mortgage modifications made voluntarily \nby the industry-led Hope Now Alliance. He found that almost half of \nthese so-called foreclosure prevention plans actually increased the \nmonthly payments of homeowners. How does that help families save their \nhomes?\n  Third, America soon will have a President who understands the \nenormity of this problem and supports this change to the bankruptcy \ncode.\n  So what does this bill do? This bill would allow mortgages on primary \nresidences to be modified in bankruptcy just like other debts--\nincluding vacation homes, family farms, and yachts.\n  Only families living in the home would qualify--no speculators are \nallowed.\n  The bill would allow judges to cut through all of the constraints \nthat have doomed foreclosure prevention plans from being successful for \neven the most proactive and well-intentioned mortgage servicers.\n  There are very real constraints on some of the current efforts to \nprevent foreclosure today because most mortgages are sliced and sold to \ndifferent investors, servicers sometimes have a hard time locating all \nof the owners of the mortgages to get their consent for modifications.\n  Servicers that modify mortgages without the consent of all the \ninvestors fear that they could be sued.\n  Some investors refuse to approve sensible restructurings, because \nthere is little incentive for the owner of a second mortgage to approve \na modification of a first mortgage that will see the second mortgage \nwiped out.\n  Mortgage modifications that ignore the other pile of debt a household \nis facing is a set-up for failure. That's a leading reason why we see \nso many redefaults on newly modified mortgages through the current \nprograms.\n  Finally, servicers who are on the front lines answering the phone \ncalls from homeowners and processing the paperwork often are \ncompensated more for foreclosures than modifications.\n  My proposal would allow judges to cut through these complicating \nfactors to rework the underlying loans.\n  The mortgages that are modified in bankruptcy will provide far more \nvalue to the lenders and the investors than foreclosure.\n  The bill would provide borrowers who are frustrated with their \nmortgage servicers some desperately needed leverage to get their \nbanker's full attention. It provides an incentive for banks to modify \nloans before the judges in bankruptcy do it for them.\n  Best of all, this program would cost the taxpayers nothing. Given the \nstaggering amounts that taxpayers have been asked to give to the \nmortgage industry lately, the taxpayers are ready for a plan that \ndoesn't cost them anything and that will actually work.\n  Since the Mortgage Bankers Association still opposes this plan, after \ntaking all of that taxpayer money and after failing to do anything \nmeaningful on their own to address this crisis, I want to address their \nprimary remaining objection to this plan as clearly as possible so that \neveryone listening fully understands why the industry is wrong, once \nand for all.\n  A few weeks ago, the Chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association \ntestified in the Senate Judiciary Committee that my bill would create a \ntax of $295, per month, for every homeowner in America, forever. I \nasked in the hearing, and my staff asked three times after the hearing, \nfor some shred of evidence to support such a ridiculous claim. The \nresponse finally came just before the holidays, and it is laughable.\n  The Mortgage Bankers Association claims that changing the bankruptcy \ncode will create new costs for lenders that must then be passed on to \nall borrowers. They have concocted a list of individual costs that add \nup to the full ``tax,'' as they call it. But they don't provide a \nsingle shred of evidence to support any of these cost estimates. Not \none. They just made them all up.\n  On the other hand, a study conducted by Adam Levitin of the \nGeorgetown Law School uses actual statistical data to show that there \nis virtually no impact on mortgage interest rates just because \nmortgages can be modified by judges in bankruptcy.\n  The main problem with the argument that my bill will increase future \nmortgage rates is this:\n  The choice for mortgage lenders and investors is not full payment of \nthe original mortgage versus a lower payment from a judicially modified \nmortgage.\n  The choice is between a lower payment from a judicially modified \nmortgage and mortgage failure.\n  Valparaiso's Professor White reports that in his large study sample, \nmortgage servicers and their investors lost an average of 55 percent of \nthe value of the mortgages that failed through foreclosure, or about \n$145,000 per loan.\n  If those loans would have been modified in bankruptcy, the servicers \nand investors would have been given ownership of a sustainable mortgage \nworth at least the fair market value of the home plus an interest rate \nthat included a premium for risk. These modified mortgages would on \naverage have created far better results than the foreclosures that \nactually occurred.\n  Therefore, when the Mortgage Bankers Association claims with no \nevidence whatsoever that my bill would raise mortgage interest rates, \nwe should all ask them this: Why would mortgage bankers charge future \nborrowers higher interest rates tomorrow because of a change in the law \nthat\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nhelps the bankers reduce their losses today?\n  I urge the Senate to move swiftly to enact the economic recovery \npackage that America desperately needs. And as part of that effort I \nurge my colleagues to support the remedy to the foreclosure crisis that \nwill provide the most help to the 8.1 million families across the \ncountry who are at risk of losing their homes.\n  If we don't address the core of the crisis, I fear that the stimulus \nmay not work as well as it should. I look forward to working with \nChairman Dodd, Senator Schumer, all of the other Senators who have \nsupported this provision, and President-elect Obama to see that it is \nsigned into law quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to advanced practice nurses and physicians assistants \nunder the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I, again, introduce the Medicaid \nAdvanced Practice Nurse and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2009. \nThis legislation would change the Federal law to expand fee-for-service \nMedicaid to include direct payment for services provided by all nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. It \nwould ensure all nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and \nphysician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers, and \nrequire Medicaid panels to include advanced practice nurses on their \nmanaged care panels.\n  Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained \nadditional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions. \nTypically, an advanced practice nurse holds a master's degree with \ndidactic and clinical preparation beyond that of the registered nurse. \nThey are employed in clinics, hospitals, and private practices. While \nthere are many titles given to these advanced practice\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\nnurses, such as pediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse \npractitioners, certified nurse midwives, certified registered nurse \nanesthetists, and clinical nurse specialists, our current Medicaid law \nhas not kept up with the multiple specialties and titles of these \nadvanced practitioners, nor has it recognized the critical role \nphysician assistants play in the delivery of primary care.\n  I have been a long-time advocate of advanced practice nurses and \ntheir ability to extend health care services to our most rural and \nunderserved communities. They have improved access to health care in \nHawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to \npractice in what some providers might see as undesirable locations--\nextremely rural, frontier, or urban areas. This legislation ensures \nthey are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health \ncare services patients need, and it gives those patients the choice of \nselecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their \nprimary care providers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 63\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide relief to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor settlement of certain claims against the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, almost 14 years ago, I stood before you to \nintroduce a bill ``to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United States \ndetermined by the United States Court of Federal Claims.''\n  That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Nine years ago, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims \nreported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate \nand credible legal claim. By settlement stipulation, the United States \nhas taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and equitable'' to \nsettle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada for the sum of \n$1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the parties after 7 \nyears of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. Independently, the Court \nof Federal Claims concluded that the settlement amount is ``not a \ngratuity'' and that the ``settlement was predicated on a credible legal \nclaim.'' Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, Cong. \nRef. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of \nHearing Officer).\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the payment of those funds \nthat the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to satisfy this legal claim from amounts appropriated under \nsection 1304 of title 31 of the United States Code. If enacted, this \nbill will finally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that \nhas for far too long been denied.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. \nFrom 1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional \nland of the Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of \ncession--many of these cessions were made under extreme duress and the \nthreat of military action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were \nrepeatedly made promises that the remainder of their lands would be \nsecure and, in addition, that the United States would pay certain \nannuities to the Pottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal policy of \nremoval--an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands--some 5 million acres in and \naround the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, the \nPottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their tribal \nterritory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers seeking \nmore land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with orders to \nextract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty Commissioners \nspent 2 weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--including threats \nof war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to agree to cede their \nterritory. Finally, those Pottawatomis who were present relented and on \nSeptember 26, 1933, they ceded their remaining tribal estate through \nwhat would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. Seventy-seven members of \nthe Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of Chicago. Members of the \n``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not assent to the cession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomis 5 million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nBut the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to 5 million acres in Iowa. The Treaty \nCommissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to the Iowa \nland. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to accept \nthe change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied ``justice \nwould be done.'' Treaty of Chicago, as amended, Article 4. \nNevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago was ratified as amended by the\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nSenate in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomis sent a delegation to \nevaluate the land in Iowa. The delegation reported back that the land \nwas ``not fit for snakes to live on.''\n  While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis--\nparticularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty--refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east--with \ndevastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian \ntribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of \nthe Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on \na per capita basis government contract. Over one-half of the Indians \nremoved by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were \nalmost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas \nagainst their will and without their consent.\n  Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most \nof those in the Wisconsin Band vigorously resisted forced removal. To \navoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Band \nultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes \nwithout their horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes \non their backs.\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864 (13 Stat. 172) the \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their \nannuities by not removing and directed that the share of the \nPottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be \nretained for their use in the United States Treasury. (H.R. Rep. No. \n470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, \n1949). Nevertheless, much of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin \nBand.\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--\npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties. (Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess.) By the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 380), the \nCongress directed the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims \nmade by the Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomis that still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the Wisconsin Bands proportionate \nshares of the annuities, trust funds, and other monies paid to or \nexpended for the tribe to which they belong in which the claimant \nIndians have not shared, and the amount of such monies retained in the \nTreasury of the United States to the credit of the claimant Indians as \ndirected the provision of the Act of June 25, 1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of the Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada was $1,517,226. The Congress thereafter enacted a \nseries of appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to \nsatisfy most of the monies owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nresiding in the United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nwho resided in Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \ncongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for \nredress of their claim.\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act, ICCA, \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides \nof the border--brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission \nfor recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 \n(Ind. Cl. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823 (1950). The claim \nof the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims Court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. Cl. 445 (1983). The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the congressional reference process. The court has \nnow reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing \nto admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that the United \nStates is willing to do what we can to see that justice--so long \ndelayed is not now denied.\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States, the \nAssembly of First Nations, which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada, and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal groups \nthat remain in the United States today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 65\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability \nrated as total to travel on military aircraft in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as retired members of the Armed Forces are entitled to \ntravel on such aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is \nof great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation \nis designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to \ntravel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights \nwithin the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights \noperated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the \nsame benefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ncertain disabled former prisoners of war to use Department of Defense \ncommissary and exchange stores; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned because it \nserves as a reminder that our Nation has not forgotten their \nsacrifices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a fact-finding Commission to extend the \nstudy of a prior Commission to investigate and determine facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and deportation \nto Axis countries of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December \n1941 through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \nUnited States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of \nJapanese Descent Act.\n  The story of U.S. citizens taken from their homes on the west coast \nand confined in camps is a story that was made known after a fact-\nfinding study by a Commission that Congress authorized in 1980. That \nstudy was followed by a formal apology by President Reagan and a bill \nfor reparations. Far less known, and indeed, I myself did not initially \nknow, is the story of Latin Americans of Japanese descent taken from \ntheir homes in Latin America, stripped of their passports, brought to \nthe U.S., and interned in American camps.\n  This is a story about the U.S. government's act of reaching its arm \nacross international borders, into a community that did not pose an \nimmediate threat to our Nation, in order to use them, devoid of \npassports or any other proof of citizenship, for exchange with \nAmericans with Japan. Between the years 1941 and 1945, our Government, \nwith the help of Latin American officials, arbitrarily arrested persons \nof Japanese descent from streets, homes, and workplaces. Approximately \n2,300 undocumented persons were brought to camp sites in the U.S., \nwhere they were held under armed watch, and then held in reserve for \nprisoner exchange. Those used in an exchange were sent to Japan, a \nforeign country that many had never set foot on since their ancestors' \nimmigration to Latin America.\n  Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American internees of \nJapanese descent were considered by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService as illegal entrants. By the end of the war, some Japanese Latin \nAmericans had been sent to Japan. Those who were not used in a prisoner \nexchange were cast out into a new and English-speaking country, and \nsubject to deportation proceedings. Some returned to Latin America. \nOthers remained in the U.S., because their country of origin in Latin \nAmerica refused their re-entry, because they were unable to present a \npassport.\n  When I first learned of the wartime experiences of Japanese Latin \nAmericans, it seemed unbelievable, but indeed, it happened. It is a \npart of our national history, and it is a part of the living histories \nof the many families whose lives are forever tied to internment camps \nin our country.\n  The outline of this story was sketched out in a book published by the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians formed in \n1980. This Commission had set out to learn about Japanese Americans. \nTowards the close of their investigations, the Commissioners stumbled \nupon this extraordinary effort by the U.S. government to relocate, \nintern, and deport Japanese persons formerly living in Latin America. \nBecause this finding surfaced late in its study, the Commission was \nunable to fully uncover the facts, but found them significant enough to \ninclude in its published study, urging a deeper investigation.\n  I rise today to introduce the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act, which would \nestablish a fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the 1980 \nCommission. This Commission's task would be to determine facts \nsurrounding the U.S. government's actions in regards to Japanese Latin \nAmericans subject to a program of relocation, internment, and \ndeportation. I believe that examining this extraordinary program would \ngive finality to, and complete the account of Federal actions to detain \nand intern civilians of Japanese ancestry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 69\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Wartime \n     Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese \n     Descent Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study published in \n     December 1982 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians, Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States--\n       (A) expanded its internment program and national security \n     investigations to conduct the program and investigations in \n     Latin America; and\n       (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n     internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the Latin \n     Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held \n     by Axis countries.\n       (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held \n     in the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n     operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n     1941 through 1948.\n       (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n       (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment \n     by local police, and sent to the United States for \n     internment; or\n       (B) in some cases involving women and children, voluntarily \n     entered internment camps to remain with their arrested \n     husbands, fathers, and other male relatives.\n       (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n     of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n     individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department \n     of State ordered United States consuls in Latin American \n     countries to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior \n     to departure.\n       (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n     internees of Japanese descent were considered to be and \n     treated as illegal entrants by the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service. Thus, the internees became illegal \n     aliens in United States custody who were subject to \n     deportation proceedings for immediate removal from the United \n     States. In some cases, Latin American internees of Japanese \n     descent were deported to Axis countries to enable the United \n     States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n     America, detained in internment camps in the United States, \n     and in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the \n     United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n     Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary \n     of War to prescribe military areas). Although the United \n     States program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese \n     descent was not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, \n     an examination of that extraordinary program is necessary to \n     establish a complete account of Federal actions to detain and \n     intern civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, \n     particularly of Japanese descent. Although historical \n     documents relating to the program exist in distant archives, \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians did not research those documents.\n       (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n     group not covered by the\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.), \n     which formally apologized and provided compensation payments \n     to former Japanese Americans interned pursuant to Executive \n     Order 9066.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the Commission \n     on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to \n     investigate and determine facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the relocation, internment, and deportation to Axis countries \n     of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 \n     through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \n     United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if any, \n     based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and \n     new discoveries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to restore the traditional day of observance of \nMemorial Day, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in our effort to accommodate many \nAmericans by making Memorial Day the last Monday in May, we have lost \nsight of the significance of this day to our Nation. My bill would \nrestore Memorial Day to May 30 and authorize our flag to fly at half \nmast on that day. In addition, this legislation would authorize the \nPresident to issue a proclamation\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\ndesignating Memorial Day and Veterans Day as days for prayer and \nceremonies. This legislation would help restore the recognition our \nveterans deserve for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 70\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the programs of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development for housing assistance for Native \nHawaiians; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reauthorize \nTitle VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act. Senator Akaka joins me in sponsoring this measure. \nTitle VIII provides authority for the appropriation of funds for the \nconstruction of low-income housing for native Hawaiians and further \nprovides authority for access to loan guarantees associated with the \nconstruction of housing to serve native Hawaiians.\n  Three studies have documented the acute housing needs of native \nHawaiians--which include the highest rates of overcrowding and \nhomelessness in the State of Hawaii. Those same studies indicate that \ninadequate housing rates for Native Hawaiians are amongst the highest \nin the Nation.\n  The reauthorization of Title VIII will support the continuation of \nefforts to assure that the native people of Hawaii may one day have \naccess to housing opportunities that are comparable to those now \nenjoyed by other Americans.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 72\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a systematic mortgage modification program \nat the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will limit foreclosures and stabilize home values through Federal \nloan guarantees and standardized procedures for mortgage workout \nagreements.\n  The Systematic Foreclosure Prevention and Mortgage Modification Act \nwould implement the foreclosure prevention plan developed by Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, Chairman Sheila Bair.\n  There are three key components of this legislation.\n  Servicers would be incentivized to modify mortgages, receiving $1,000 \nto help cover the costs of each loan modification; the Federal \nGovernment would share up to 50 percent of any loss should the \nhomeowner default after receiving a modification; and participating \nservicers would be required to systematically review and modify all \nsuitable loans in their portfolios, applying a standard calculation to \nhelp expedite loan modifications as cost-effectively as possible.\n  The FDIC estimates that roughly 2.2 million home loans, worth $444 \nbillion, could be modified under this plan, with 1.5 million \nforeclosures avoided.\n  This legislation is projected to cost at least $25 billion; however, \nno additional spending is necessary.\n  This effort would be funded solely through the Troubled Assets Relief \nProgram, TARP, to ensure that one of the core objectives of the bill, \nassistance to homeowners, is achieved.\n  The foreclosure crisis and declining housing market remain at the \nepicenter of the economic challenges we face. And, although the Federal \nGovernment has taken unprecedented steps to address this problem, they \nhave not been sufficient.\n  Foreclosures are in the best interest of no one.\n  Neighborhoods are decimated when homes are repossessed or left \nvacant, property values decline, local economies suffer, and crime \noften increases in blighted areas. Lenders must sustain the costs of \nforeclosure and are left with the burden of reselling properties in a \ndistressed market.\n  Homeowners are forced to give up on the American dream, and in some \ncases, tenants are forced out of homes they have been renting.\n  To date, no TARP funds have been allocated by Treasury to directly \naddress the foreclosure crisis.\n  This must change, and it must change now.\n  According to the FDIC, the pace of loan modifications continues to be \nvery slow, with only 4 percent of troubled mortgages being modified to \nprevent foreclosures each month.\n  A systematic approach is needed to expedite this process. The FDIC \nhas\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nimplemented such a program successfully at Indy Mac Federal Bank, to \nreduce mortgage payments as low as 31 percent of monthly income.\n  Loan modifications are based on interest rate reductions, extended \nloan terms, and principal forbearance.\n  Unfortunately, banks that have received TARP funds have not been \ncompelled to implement foreclosure reduction measures, and adequate \nincentive structures are not in place.\n  This legislation provides prudent and cost-effective steps to improve \nassistance for struggling homeowners while also stabilizing the housing \nmarket.\n  Foreclosures have had a devastating impact on our national economy, \nand the damage in my state has been particularly severe.\n  California accounts for 1/3 of all foreclosure activity in the United \nStates.\n  Roughly 800,000 foreclosures will be filed in my state in 2008--a 70 \npercent increase over 2007, when 481,392 foreclosures were filed in \nCalifornia.\n  The foreclosure rate in California is the fourth highest in the \nNation, with one foreclosure filing for every 218 households.\n  In fact, 6 of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest foreclosure \nrate in the Nation are in California.\n  This includes: Merced--one out of every 76 homes in foreclosure; \nModesto--one out of every 93 homes in foreclosure; Stockton--one out of \nevery 94 homes in foreclosure; Riverside and San Bernardino--one out of \nevery 107 homes in foreclosure; Bakersfield--one out of every 129 homes \nin foreclosure; and Vallejo and Fairfield--one out of every 133 homes \nin foreclosure.\n  And, the situation is only getting worse.\n  Property values have plummeted across California, making it difficult \nfor many residents with adjustable rate mortgages to refinance into \nmore stable, fixed rate products.\n  One California community is in a special category of need: the city \nof Stockton, which has been referred to as ``America's foreclosure \ncapital.''\n  The foreclosure crisis has devastated this city of more than 260,000 \nresidents.\n  Home foreclosures impact neighbors and reduce property values.\n  But, the spillover effect in Stockton has been overwhelming.\n  Jobs: The downturn in the construction industry has contributed to an \nunemployment rate of 11.9 percent in San Joaquin County, well above the \nnational average.\n  Schools: Foreclosures have displaced many students who were forced to \nchange schools or leave the area when their families lost their homes.\n  The student population of Stockton Unified School District, the \nbiggest in San Joaquin County, was down about 200 students last year.\n  Student displacement has a direct impact on school budgets, which are \nlinked to student attendance.\n  Most unfortunately, the emotional impact on children being forced to \nswitch schools in the middle of the year can be tremendous.\n  Public Services: High foreclosure rates have taken a toll on the city \nof Stockton's budget.\n  Stockton now faces a nearly $25 million budget deficit.\n  City officials have been forced to consider voluntary buyouts for \nmunicipal employees and mandatory 10-day furloughs to help close the \ngap.\n  Because property values have fallen--due to foreclosures and \nincreased inventory--Stockton also is facing lower tax revenues, which \nare depended upon to fill the city's $186 million general fund.\n  This could have a dramatic effect on the city's emergency services; \nabout 75 percent of Stockton's general fund pays for police and fire \nservices.\n  It is essential that we not forget communities such as Stockton. We \ncannot sit idly by and watch them fall through the cracks.\n  This legislation is a much-needed step forward to provide relief to \nMain Street.\n  Millions of Americans have lost their homes to foreclosure, and \nmillions more are at risk of losing their homes in the coming months.\n  Part of this problem was driven by abusive and predatory lending \npractices.\n  Part of the problem can be attributed to lax underwriting standards \nand regulators who were asleep at the wheel.\n  Part of this problem was due to individuals who made bad choices.\n  But, this is a problem that now impacts--either directly or \nindirectly--all hard-working American families.\n  These are significant challenges we face, and innovative solutions \nare required.\n  This bill will serve as a companion to legislation introduced in the \nHouse by my colleague from California, Representative Maxine Waters.\n  I look forward to working with her, and my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle, to pass this important legislation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 73\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Systematic Foreclosure \n     Prevention and Mortgage Modification Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SYSTEMATIC FORECLOSURE PREVENTION AND MORTGAGE \n                   MODIFICATION PLAN ESTABLISHED.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairperson of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation shall establish a systematic \n     foreclosure prevention and mortgage modification program by--\n       (1) paying servicers $1,000 to cover expenses for each loan \n     modified according to the required standards; and\n       (2) sharing up to 50 percent of any losses incurred if a \n     modified loan should subsequently re-default.\n       (b) Program Components.--The program established under \n     subsection (a) shall include the following components:\n       (1) Eligible borrowers.--The program shall be limited to \n     loans secured by owner-occupied properties.\n       (2) Exclusion for early payment default.--To promote \n     sustainable mortgages, government loss sharing shall be \n     available only after the borrower has made a minimum of 6 \n     payments on the modified mortgage.\n       (3) Standard net present value test.--In order to promote \n     consistency and simplicity in implementation and audit, a \n     standard test comparing the expected net present value of \n     modifying past due loans compared to the net present value of \n     foreclosing on them will be applied. Under this test, \n     standard assumptions shall be used to ensure that a \n     consistent standard for affordability is provided based on a \n     31 percent borrower mortgage debt-to-income ratio.\n       (4) Systematic loan review by participating servicers.--\n     Participating servicers shall be required to undertake a \n     systematic review of all of the loans under their management, \n     to subject each loan to a standard net present value test to \n     determine whether it is a suitable candidate for \n     modification, and to modify all loans that pass this test. \n     The penalty for failing to undertake such a systematic review \n     and to carry out modifications where they are justified would \n     be disqualification from further participation in the program \n     until such a systematic program was introduced.\n       (5) Modifications.--Modifications may include any of the \n     following:\n       (A) Reduction in interest rates and fees.\n       (B) Forbearance of principal.\n       (C) Extension of the term to maturity.\n       (D) Other similar modifications.\n       (6) Reduced loss share percentage for ``underwater \n     loans''.--For loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent, the \n     government loss share shall be progressively reduced from 50 \n     percent to 20 percent as the current loan-to-value ratio \n     rises, except that loss sharing shall not be available if the \n     loan-to-value ratio of the first lien exceeds 150 percent.\n       (7) Simplified loss share calculation.--In order to ensure \n     the administrative efficiency of this program, the \n     calculation of loss share basis would be as simple as \n     possible. In general terms, the calculation shall be based on \n     the difference between the net present value, as defined by \n     the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     of the modified loan and the amount of recoveries obtained in \n     a disposition by refinancing, short sale, or real estate \n     owned sale, net of disposal costs as estimated according to \n     industry standards. Interim modifications shall be allowed.\n       (8) De minimis test.--To lower administrative costs, a de \n     minimis test shall be used to exclude from loss sharing any \n     modification that does not lower the monthly payment at least \n     10 percent.\n       (9) 8-year limit on loss sharing payment.--The loss sharing \n     guarantee shall terminate at the end of the 8-year period \n     beginning on the date the modification was consummated.\n       (c) Regulations.--The Corporation shall prescribe such \n     regulations as may be necessary to implement this Act and \n     prevent evasions thereof.\n       (d) Troubled Assets.--The costs incurred by the Federal \n     Government in carrying out the loan modification program \n     established under this section shall be covered out of the \n     funds made available to the Secretary of the\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\n     Treasury under section 118 of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008.\n       (e) Modifications to Program.--The Chairperson of the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may make any \n     modification to the program established under subsection (a) \n     that the Chairperson determines are appropriate for the \n     purpose of maximizing the number of foreclosures prevented.\n       (f) Report.--Before the end of the 6-month period beginning \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chairperson of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall submit a \n     progress report to the Congress containing such findings and \n     such recommendations for legislative or administrative action \n     as the Chairperson may determine to be appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \n        Cornyn, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 74. A bill to provide permanent tax relief from the marriage \npenalty.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from the marriage penalty--the most \negregious, anti-family provision in the tax code. One of my highest \npriorities in the United States Senate has been to relieve American \ntaxpayers of this punitive burden.\n  We have made important strides to eliminate this unfair tax and \nprovide marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and \nenlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice \nthat of single filers. Before these provisions were changed, 42 percent \nof married couples paid an average penalty of $1,400.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money they now \nsave to put food on the table and clothes on their children, a tax \nincrease looms in the future. Since the 2001 tax relief bill was \nrestricted, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect \nthrough 2010. In 2011, marriage will again be a taxable event and a \nsignificant number of married couples will again pay more in taxes \nunless we act decisively. Given the challenges many families face in \nmaking ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this \nimportant reform.\n  The benefits of marriage are well established, yet, without marriage \npenalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for \npeople to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to \nsuffer from child abuse. Research indicates these children are also \nless likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges \nsuch as adolescent drug use are less common in married families, and \nmarried mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  We should celebrate marriage, not penalize it. The bill I am offering \nwould make marriage penalty relief permanent, because marriage should \nnot be a taxable event. I call on the Senate to finish the job we \nstarted and make marriage penalty relief permanent today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 74\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Permanent Marriage Penalty \n     Relief Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF SUNSET ON MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF.\n\n       Title IX of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 (relating to sunset of provisions \n     of such Act) shall not apply to--\n       (1) sections 301, 302, and 303 of such Act (relating to \n     marriage penalty relief), and\n       (2) sections 101(b) and 101(c) of the Working Families Tax \n     Relief Act of 2004 (relating to marriage penalty relief in \n     the standard deduction and 15-percent income tax bracket, \n     respectively).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 75. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the use of generic drugs under the Medicare part D prescription \ndrug program when available unless the brand name drug is determined to \nbe medically necessary; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Generics First \nAct. This legislation requires the Federal Government's Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program to use generic drugs whenever available, \nunless a brand-name drug is determined to be medically necessary by a \nphysician. Modeled after similar provisions in many state-administered \nMedicaid programs, this measure would reduce the high costs of the new \nprescription drug program and keep seniors from reaching the current \ncoverage gap, or ``donut hole,'' by guiding beneficiaries toward cost-\nsaving generic drug alternatives.\n  We know that the cost of prescription drugs is prohibitive, placing a \nfinancial strain on seniors, families, and businesses that are \nstruggling to pay their health care bills. According to the National \nBureau of Economic Research, spending on prescription drugs totaled \n$227.5 billion in 2007. People need help now and we must respond by \nexpanding access to generic drugs. Generics, which on average cost 60 \npercent less than their brand-name counterparts, are a big part of the \nsolution to health care costs that are spiraling out of control.\n  Generic drugs that are approved by the FDA must meet the same \nrigorous standards for safety and effectiveness as brand-name drugs. In \naddition to being safe and effective, the generic must have the same \nactive ingredient or ingredients, be the same strength, and have the \nsame labeling for the approved uses as the brand-name drug. In other \nwords, generics perform the same medicinal purposes as their respective \nbrand-name product.\n  We know generic drugs have the potential to save seniors thousands of \ndollars and curb health spending for the Federal Government, employers, \nand families. Every year, more blockbuster drugs are coming off patent, \nsetting up the potential for billions of dollars in savings. This \nlegislation is just one part of a larger agenda I'm pushing to remove \nthe obstacles that prevent generics from getting to market, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 75\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement \nAct to revise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today, again, to introduce a bill \nto reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Senator \nAkaka joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law \nin 1988, and has been reauthorized several times throughout the years.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n  The Act provides authority for a range of programs and services \ndesigned to improve the health care status of the native people of \nHawaii.\n  With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act \nand the establishment of native Hawaiian health care systems on most of \nthe islands that make up the State of Hawaii, we have witnessed \nsignificant improvements in the health status of native Hawaiians, but \nas the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this \nbill make clear, we still have a long way to go.\n  For instance, native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \nrates in the State of Hawaii--rates that are 22 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State female population. Nationally, native \nHawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast \ncancer.\n  With respect to diabetes, in 2004 native Hawaiians had the highest \nmortality rate associated with diabetes in the State--a rate which is \n119 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups.\n  When it comes to heart disease, the mortality rate of native \nHawaiians associated with heart disease is 86 percent higher than the \nrate for the entire State and the mortality rate for hypertension is 46 \npercent higher than that for the entire State.\n  These statistics on the health status of native Hawaiians are but a \nsmall part of the long list of date that makes clear that our objective \nof assuring that the native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good \nhealth comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet \nbeen achieved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 76\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for equal coverage of mental health services under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my great hope that Congress will move \nthis year to see that the successful, bipartisan State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, SCHIP, is allowed the opportunity to fulfill \nits promise to the low-income children of this country. For over 11 \nyears it has provided, along with Medicaid, the type of meaningful and \naffordable health insurance coverage that each and every American child \ndeserves. Yet there is much work to be done to improve this program, \nand the reauthorization of SCHIP gives us the opportunity to expand \nthese successful programs to many of the nine million uninsured \nchildren in the country today, starting with the 6 million that are \nalready eligible for public programs but not yet enrolled.\n  While expanding coverage to the uninsured is our top priority, it is \nequally important to ensure that the types of benefits offered to our \nNation's children are quality services that are available when needed. \nUnfortunately, when it comes to mental health coverage, that is too \noften not the case today. Therefore, I am introducing today, along with \nSenator Snowe, the Children's Mental Health Parity Act which provides \nfor equal coverage of mental health care for all children enrolled in \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Plan, SCHIP. This was passed as \npart of the SCHIP reauthorization last year, but unfortunately the bill \nwas vetoed by President Bush.\n  I am encouraged by the passage of the Paul Wellstone and Pete \nDomenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in October 2008. \nIt is now time to extend the same parity in mental health coverage to \nour children that we give to adults. Mental illness is a critical \nproblem for the young people in this country today. The numbers are \nstartling. Mental disorders affect about one in five American children \nand up to 9 percent of kids experience serious emotional disturbances \nthat severely impact their functioning. Low-income children, those the \nSCHIP program is designed to cover, have the highest rates of mental \nhealth problems.\n  Yet the sad reality is that an estimated \\2/3\\ of all young people \nstruggling with mental health disorders do not receive the care they \nneed. We are failing our children when we do not provide appropriate \ntreatment of mental health disorders. The consequences of this failure \ncould not be more severe. Without early and effective intervention, \naffected children are less likely to do well in school and more likely \nto have compromised employment and earnings opportunities. Moreover, \nuntreated mental illness may increase a child's risk of coming into \ncontact with the juvenile justice system. Finally, children with mental \ndisorders are at a much higher risk for suicide.\n  Unfortunately, many states' SCHIP programs are not providing the type \nof mental health care coverage that our most vulnerable children \ndeserve. Many States impose discriminatory limits on mental health care \ncoverage that do not apply to medical and surgical care. These can \ninclude caps on coverage of inpatient days and outpatient visits, as \nwell as cost and testing restrictions that impair the ability of our \nphysicians to make the best judgments for our kids.\n  The Children's Mental Health Parity Act would prohibit discriminatory \nlimits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by directing that any \nfinancial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to mental \nhealth or substance abuse services must be no more restrictive than the \nfinancial requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical \nservices. This bill would also eliminate a harmful provision in current \nlaw that authorizes states to lower the amount of mental health \ncoverage they provide to children to just 75 percent of the coverage \nprovided in other health care plans used by states.\n  Many of the leading advocacy groups have endorsed the Children's \nMental Health Parity Act, including Mental Health America, the American \nAcademy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, the Bazelon Center for Mental \nHealth Law, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, The National Association for \nChildren's Behavioral Health, the National Association of Psychiatric \nHealth Systems, and the National Council for Community Behavioral \nHealth care.\n  America's kids who are covered through SCHIP should be guaranteed \nthat the mental health benefits they receive are just as comprehensive \nas those for medical and surgical care. It is no less important to care \nfor our kids' mental health, and this unfair and unwise disparity \nshould no longer be acceptable. As we debate many important features of \nthe SCHIP program during reauthorization, I look forward to working \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that this important, \nbipartisan measure receives the support that it deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S.78. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \nfull exclusion for gain from certain small business stocks; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our economy is in the midst of the worst \neconomic downturn since since the Great Depression. We all realize that \nsmall businesses are the backbone of our economy. During these \ndifficult times, many small businesses are having trouble accessing \ncredit which leads to a decline in job creation and innovation.\n  Many of our most successful corporations started as small businesses, \nincluding AOL, Apple Computer, Compac Computer, Datastream, Evergreen \nSolar, Intel Corporations, and Sun Microsystems. As you can see from \nthis partial list, many of these companies played an integral role in \nmaking the Internet a reality.\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2009 to encourage private investment in small \nbusinesses by making changes to the existing partial exclusion for gain \nfrom certain small business stock.\n  Investing in small businesses is essential to turning around the \neconomy. Not only will investment in small business spur job creation. \nit will lead to new technological breakthroughs. We are at an integral \njuncture in developing technology to address global climate change. I \nbelieve that small business will repeat the role it played at the \nvanguard of the computer revolution--by leading the Nation in \ndeveloping the technologies to substantially reduce carbon emissions. \nSmall businesses already are at the forefront of these industries, and \nwe need to do everything we can to encourage investment in small \nbusinesses.\n  Back in 1993, I worked with Senator Bumpers to enact legislation to \nprovide a 50 percent exclusion for gain for individuals from the sale \nof certain small business stock that is held for 5 years. This \nprovision would provide a 50 percent exclusion for gain for individuals \nfrom the sale of certain small business stock that is held for 5 years. \nSince the enactment of this provision, the capital gains rate has been \nlowered twice without any changes to the exclusion. Due to the lower \ncapital rates, this provision no longer provides a strong incentive for \ninvestment in small businesses.\n  The Invest in Small Business Act of 2009 makes several changes to the \nexisting provision. This legislation increases the exclusion amount \nfrom 50 percent to 100 percent and decreases the holding period from 5 \nto 4 years. This bill would allow corporations to benefit from the \nprovision as long as they own less than 25 percent of the small \nbusiness corporation stock.\n  Currently, the exclusion is treated as a preference item for \ncalculating the alternative minimum tax, AMT. The Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2009 would repeal the exclusion as an AMT preference \nitem.\n  The Invest in Small Business Act of 2009 will provide an effective \ntax rate of 0 percent for the gain from the sale of certain small \nbusinesses. This lower capital gains rate will encourage investment in \nsmall businesses. In addition, the changes made by the Invest in Small \nBusiness Act of 2009 will make more taxpayers eligible for this \nprovision.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Invest in Small Business Act of \n2009 which strengthens an existing tax incentive to provide an \nappropriate incentive to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 79. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish a Federal \nReinsurance Program for Catastrophic Health Care Costs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my home State of Massachusetts is setting \nan example for the rest of the country by taking bold steps to provide \nquality health coverage for everyone. Now it is time for Washington to \ndo the same by bringing meaningful, affordable healthcare to the \nuninsured, in Massachusetts and across America.\n  In Massachusetts the cost of health care is a major obstacle to the \noverall goal of universal coverage. The problem of the uninsured can't \nbe solved unless the issue of skyrocketing health costs to families and \nbusinesses is also tackled. And fully reforming the healthcare system \nrequires that the Federal Government begin shouldering some of the \nburden to help alleviate costs.\n  Healthcare costs are highly concentrated in this country. The very \nfew who suffer from catastrophic illness or injury drive costs up for \neveryone. One percent of patients account for 25 percent of healthcare \ncosts, and 20 percent of patients account for 80 percent of costs. To \nmake healthcare more affordable, we must find a better way to share the \nimmense burden of insuring the chronically ill and seriously injured.\n  Part of the reason that businesses and health plans today fail to \ncover their workers is an aversion to risk. Patients who are \ncatastrophically ill or injured often face the tragic combination of \nfailing health and financial peril. But there's a way to combat these \ncosts.\n  Congress should make employers and healthcare plans an offer they \ncan't refuse. It's called ``reinsurance.'' Reinsurance provides a \nbackstop for the high costs of healthcare. The Federal Government will \nreimburse a percentage of the highest cost cases if employers agree to \noffer comprehensive health insurance benefits to all full time \nemployees, including preventative care and health promotion benefits \nthat are proven to make care affordable. This will result in lower \ncosts and lower premiums for both employers and employees. If the \nFederal Government can help small and large businesses bear the burden \nof cost in the most expensive cases, we'll dramatically improve the \naccess to health care for everyone.\n  That is why I am introducing the Healthy Businesses, Healthy Workers \nReinsurance Act, to make the federal government a partner in helping \nbusinesses with the heavy financial burden of those catastrophic cases. \nSpecifically, this legislation is designed to assist those catastrophic \ncases that cost more than $50,000 in a single year. Healthy Businesses, \nHealthy Workers will protect business owners from skyrocketing \npremiums, and provide more working families affordable, quality \nhealthcare. With reinsurance, health insurance premiums for all of us \nwill go down, by up to approximately 10 percent under this plan. This \nplan does have a cost associated with it, but the benefits will \noutweigh the costs. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year \non inefficient and wasteful health expenditures. We need to make sure \nthat these funds are being spent wisely to ensure that we can lower \nhealth care costs and improve coverage.\n  I believe that we must act now to address the health care crisis in \nAmerica, taking steps that create real change and address both access \nto care and the cost of care. There is a growing bipartisan consensus \nthat the Federal Government has a responsibility to help the \ncatastrophically ill. As we take the next steps toward alleviating our \nnation's health care crisis, a commonsense partnership between \nemployers, families, and the government to share the costs of the \nsickest among us will lay the groundwork for achieving our ultimate \ngoal: meaningful health care coverage for every single American. I ask \nall my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 111. A bill for the relief of Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra \nand his wife, Sharon Kamel, Egyptian nationals currently living with \ntheir children in Camarillo, California.\n  Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel entered the United States legally on \nNovember 1, 1998, on tourist visas. They immediately filed for \npolitical asylum based on religious persecution.\n  The couple fled Egypt because they had been targeted for their active \ninvolvement in the Coptic Christian Church in Egypt. Mr. Gabra was \nemployed from 1990-1998 by the Coptic Catholic Diocese Church in El-\nFayoum as an accountant and ``project coordinator'' in the Office of \nHuman and Social Elevation. He was responsible for building community \nfacilities such as religious schools, among other things.\n  His wife, Sharon Kamel, was employed as the Director for Training in \nthe Human Resources Department of the Coptic Church.\n  Both Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel had paid full-time positions with the \nCoptic Church.\n  Unfortunately, they and their families suffered abuse because of \ntheir commitment to their church. Mr. Gabra was repeatedly jailed by \nEgyptian authorities because of his work for the church. In addition, \nMs. Kamel's cousin was murdered and her brother's business was fire-\nbombed.\n  When Ms. Kamel became pregnant with their first child, the family was \nwarned by a member of the Muslim brotherhood that if they did not raise \ntheir child as a Muslim, the child would be kidnapped and taken from \nthem.\n  Frightened by these threats, the young family sought refuge in the \nUnited States. Unfortunately, when\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\nthey sought asylum here, Mr. Gabra, who has a speech impediment, had \ndifficulty communicating his fear of persecution to the immigration \njudge.\n  The judge denied their petition, telling the family that he did not \nsee why they could not just move to another city in Egypt to avoid the \nabuse they were suffering. Since the time that they were denied asylum, \nMs. Kamel's brother, who lived in the same town and suffered similar \nabuse, was granted asylum.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure immense and unfair hardship.\n  First, in the ten years that Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have lived here, \nthey have worked to adjust their status through the appropriate legal \nchannels. They left behind employment in Egypt and came to the United \nStates on a lawful visa. Once here, they immediately notified \nauthorities of their intent to seek asylum here. They have played by \nthe rules and followed our laws.\n  In addition, during those ten years, the couple has had four U.S. \ncitizen children who do not speak Arabic and are unfamiliar with \nEgyptian culture. If the family is deported, the children would have to \nacclimate to a different culture, language and way of life.\n  Jessica, age 10, is the Gabras' oldest child, and in the Gifted and \nTalented Education program in Ventura County. Rebecca, age 9, and \nRafael, age 8, are old enough to understand that they would be leaving \ntheir schools, their teachers, their friends and their home. Veronica, \nthe Gabra's youngest child, is just 3 years old.\n  More troubling is the very real possibility that if sent to Egypt, \nthese four American children would suffer discrimination and \npersecution because of their religion, just as the rest of their family \nreports.\n  Mr. Gabra and Ms. Kamel have made a positive life for themselves and \ntheir family in the United States. Both have earned college degrees in \nEgypt and once in the United States, Mr. Gabra passed the Certified \nPublic Accountant Examination on August 4, 2003. Since arriving here, \nMr. Gabra has consistently worked to support his family.\n  The positive impact they have made on their community is highlighted \nby the fact that I received a letter of support on their behalf signed \nby 160 members of their church and community. From everything I have \nlearned about the family, we can expect that they will continue to \ncontribute to their community in productive ways.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Joseph Gabra and Sharon \nKamel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Joseph Gabra and Sharon Kamel shall \n     each be deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and \n     remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence under section 245 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an \n     application for such adjustment of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Joseph Gabra and Sharon \n     Kamel, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of Joseph \n     Gabra and Sharon Kamel under section 203(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if \n     applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are made \n     available to natives to the country of birth of Joseph Gabra \n     and Sharon Kamel under section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1152(e)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 112. A bill to treat certain hospital support organizations as \nqualified organizations for purposes of determining acquisition \nindebtedness; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the legislation I have reintroduced will \nextend to qualified teaching hospital support organizations the \nexisting debt-financed safe harbor rule. Congress enacted that rule to \nsupport the public service activities of tax-exempt schools, \nuniversities, pension funds, and consortia of such institutions. Our \nteaching hospitals require similar support.\n  As a result, for-profit hospitals are moving from older areas to \naffluent locations where residents can afford to pay for treatment. \nThese private hospitals typically have no mandate for community \nservice. In contrast, nonprofit hospitals must fulfill a community \nservice requirement. They must stretch their resources to provide \nincreased charitable care, update their facilities, and maintain \nskilled staffing resulting in closures of nonprofit hospitals due to \nthis financial strain.\n  The problem is particularly severe for teaching hospitals. Non-profit \nhospitals provide nearly all the postgraduate medical education in the \nUnited States. Post-graduate medical instruction is by nature not \nprofitable. Instruction in the treatment of mental disorders and trauma \nis especially costly.\n  Despite their financial problem the Nation's nonprofit hospitals \nstrive to deliver a very high level of service. A study in the December \n2006 issue of Archives of International Medicine had surveyed \nhospitals' quality of care in four areas of treatment. It found that \nnonprofit hospitals consistently outperformed for-profit hospitals. It \nalso found that teaching hospitals had a higher level of performance in \ntreatment and diagnosis. It said that investment in technology and \nstaffing leads to better care. And it recommended that alternative \npayments and sources of payments be considered to finance these \nimprovements.\n  The success and financial constraints of nonprofit teaching hospitals \nis evident in work of the Queen's Health Systems in my State. This 147-\nyear-old organization maintains the largest, private, nonprofit \nhospital in Hawaii. It serves as the primary clinical teaching facility \nfor the University of Hawaii's medical residency programs in medicine, \ngeneral surgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, pathology, \nand psychiatry. It conducts educational and training programs for \nnurses and allied health personnel. It operates the only trauma unit as \nwell as the chief behavioral health program in the State. It maintains \nclinics throughout Hawaii, health programs for native Hawaiians, and a \nsmall hospital on a rural, economically depressed island. Its medical \nreference library is the largest in the State. Not the least, it \nannually provides millions of dollars in uncompensated health services. \nTo help pay for these community benefits, the Queen's Health Systems, \nas other nonprofit teaching hospitals, relies significantly on income \nfrom its endowment.\n  In the past, the Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, colleges, \nuniversities, and pension funds to invest their endowment in real \nestate so as to better meet their financial needs. Under the tax code \nthese organizations can incur debt for real estate investments without \ntriggering the tax on unrelated business activities.\n  If the Queen's Health Systems were part of a university, it could \nborrow without incurring an unrelated business income tax. Not being \npart of a university, however, a teaching hospital and its support \norganization run into the tax code's debt financing prohibition. \nNonprofit teaching hospitals have the same if not more pressing needs \nas universities, schools, and pension trusts. The same safe harbor rule \nshould be extended to teaching hospitals.\n  My bill would allow the support organizations for qualified teaching \nhospitals to engage in limited borrowing to enhance their endowment \nincome. The proposal for teaching hospitals is actually more restricted \nthan current law for schools, universities and pension trusts. Under \nsafeguards developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, a \nsupport organization for a teaching hospital can not buy and develop \nland on a commercial basis. The proposal is tied directly to the \norganization endowment. The staff's revenue\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nestimates show that the provision with its general application will \nhelp a number of teaching hospitals.\n  The U.S. Senate several times has acted favorably on this proposal. \nThe Senate adopted a similar provision in H.R. 1836, the Economic \nGrowth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. The House conferees on that bill, \nhowever, objected that the provision was unrelated to the bill's focus \non individual tax relief and the conference deleted the provision from \nthe final legislation. Subsequently, the Finance Committee included the \nprovision in H.R. 7, the CARE Act of 2002, and in S. 476, the CARE Act \nof 2003 which the Senate passed. In a previous Congress' S. 6, the \nMarriage, Opportunity, Relief, and Empowerment Act of 2005, which the \nSenate leadership introduced, also included the proposal.\n  As the Senate Finance Committee's recent hearings show, substantial \nhealth needs would go unmet if not for our charitable hospitals. It is \ntime for the Congress to assist the Nation's teaching hospitals in \ntheir charitable, educational service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill by \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nhealth care practitioners in rural areas with training in preventive \nhealth care, including both physical and mental care, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today, again, to introduce the \nRural Preventive Health Care Training Act, a bill that responds to the \ndire need of our rural communities for quality health care and disease \nprevention programs. Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas \nand frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. \nAs many as 21 million of the 3 million people living in underserved \nrural areas are without access to a primary care provider. Even in \nareas where providers do exist, there are numerous limits to access, \nsuch as geography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of \nknowledge about available resources. Due to the diversity of rural \npopulations, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the \naccess to medical care.\n  Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the \nresult is that many Americans living in rural communities go without \nvital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive \nimmunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries \noccur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early \nsymptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and \noften develop into full-blown disorders.\n  An Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for \nMental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research,'' \nhighlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. The \ntraining of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to \nmeet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural health \ncare providers lack preventive care training opportunities.\n  Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers \nmust be encouraged. Through such training, rural health care providers \ncan build a strong educational foundation from the behavioral, \nbiological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team \nprevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both \nhealth and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation \nbetween groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their \nservices as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall \nhealth of rural communities.\n  The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act would implement the \nrisk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on \nthe identification of risk factors and targets specific interventions \nfor those risk factors. The human suffering caused by poor health is \nimmeasurable, and places a huge financial burden on communities, \nfamilies, and individuals. By implementing preventive measures to \nreduce this suffering, the potential psychological and financial \nsavings are enormous.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 113\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a National Center for Social Work Research; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise, again, today to reintroduce \nlegislation to amend the Public Health Service Act for the \nestablishment of a National Center for Social Work Research. Social \nworkers provide a multitude of health care delivery services throughout \nAmerica to our children, families, the elderly, and persons suffering \nfrom various forms of abuse and neglect. The purpose of this center is \nto support and disseminate information about the basic and clinical \nsocial work research and training, with emphasis on service to \nunderserved and rural populations.\n  While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work \nresearch activities through the National Institutes of Health and other \nFederal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of \nthese critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and \nopportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of \na Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral \nand mental health care outcomes for our Nation's children, families, \nthe elderly, and others.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-\neffective, research-based quality health care to all Americans, we must \nrecognize the important contributions of social work researchers to \nhealth care delivery and central role that the Center for Social Work \ncan provide in facilitating their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Center for Social \n     Work Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) social workers focus on the improvement of individual \n     and family functioning and the creation of effective health \n     and mental health prevention and treatment interventions in \n     order for individuals to become more productive members of \n     society;\n       (2) social workers provide front line prevention and \n     treatment services in the areas of school violence, aging, \n     teen pregnancy, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile \n     crime, and substance abuse, particularly in rural and \n     underserved communities; and\n       (3) social workers are in a unique position to provide \n     valuable research information on these complex social \n     concerns, taking into account a wide range of social, \n     medical, economic and community influences from an \n     interdisciplinary, family-centered and community-based \n     approach.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate \n$10,000,000,000 of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds to local \ngovernments that have suffered significant losses due to highly-rated \ninvestments in failed financial institutions; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. MR. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will provide relief to local governments that have suffered losses \ndue to highly-rated investments with failed financial institutions, \nsuch as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual.\n  The TARP Assistance for Local Governments Act would require the \nTreasury Secretary to provide $10 billion in TARP funds to local \ngovernments that suffered losses due to investments in failed financial \ninstitutions; and limit relief to local governments with investments in \nfailed financial institutions that were highly rated, as determined by \nthe Treasury Secretary.\n  This legislation is necessary because local governments are in \njeopardy of losing up to $10 billion as a result of these investments.\n  In California 28 cities and counties could lose nearly $300 million.\n  These investments include basic operational funds which cities and \ncounties rely upon to function.\n  For many cities and counties that are already struggling with budget \nshortfalls, the consequences of these losses are severe.\n  Public safety, education, public health, infrastructure, and transit \nwill be compromised.\n  Communities large and small are significantly impacted.\n  These are examples from my State that demonstrate the gravity of this \nsituation.\n  This list was included in a December 22 letter to Secretary Paulson, \nand to date, I have not received a response. San Mateo County sustained \na loss of $30 million, which will require the county to abandon plans \nfor a new and urgently needed county jail. The current jail will \ncontinue to operate in overcrowded conditions, far beyond the rating of \nthe facility. The result will be unsafe working conditions for the \ncorrections personnel and the likelihood that convicted criminals will \nbe released into the community early and in large numbers.\n  The City of Shafter, a small community of 15,000 in the San Joaquin \nValley, sustained a loss of $300,000, or nearly 4 percent of its annual \nbudget. The City will be forced to make across-the-board cuts in all \nservices, including police and fire.\n  Monterey County is facing a $30 million loss. Amid numerous other \ncuts, hardest hit will be programs targeting gang activities, including \na special task force and the construction of new adult and juvenile \ncorrections facilities to manage these criminals.\n  The San Mateo County Transportation Authority sustained a loss of \nmore than $25 million, which will mean delays and higher costs for \nmajor projects that will reduce emissions and traffic, specifically the \nelectrification of the Caltrain Peninsula Commuter Rail Service. \nSimilarly, cuts in highway and roads projects will put more people on \nthe local roads for longer times at a major cost in compromised air \nquality.\n  The City of Culver City has lost $1 million. This will result in a \nsubstantial reduction in planned street repairs and higher liability \nexposure from accidents, greater environmental degradation from storm \nwater drain off, and worsened traffic congestion in a region of the \nU.S. ranked as one of the worst for traffic.\n  The Hillsborough City School District lost over $924,000. Projects to \ncreate more classrooms for increased enrollment will not take place, \nincreasing class sizes. Combined with other budget cuts from the State, \nall the District's programs are threatened.\n  The Vallejo Sanitation and Flood Control District, which provides \nsanitary sewer and storm water services to the City of Vallejo, \npopulation 119,600, and nearby areas of Solano County, sustained losses \nof $4.5 million in Lehman Brothers investments and $1.46 million in \nWashington Mutual investments. The result is that aging infrastructure \nessential to the health of this community will not be replaced. The \nCity of Vallejo recently declared Chapter 9 Municipal bankruptcy.\n  Sacramento County sustained an increase in costs of $8 million \nrelated to an interest rate swap agreement with Lehman. This increase \nmeans fewer funds for sheriff's patrol and investigations and probation \nsupervision, resulting in an increased risk to the safety of the \ncommunity and reductions in social safety net services, at a time of \nincreased community need.\n  The City of Folsom lost $700,000, which has caused the City to \nindefinitely postpone staffing and equipping a new fire station.\n  The San Mateo County Community College District sustained a loss of \n$25 million in voter-approved bond funds. As a result, the District \nwill be forced to abandon a program to build more classrooms, and, \ntherefore, turn away thousands of potential students, many of them \nunemployed adults seeking job training.\n  The economic rescue legislation included a provision to require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to consider the impact of these losses on \nlocal governments when disbursing TARP funds.\n  But, to date, the Secretary has not exercised his authority to assist \nlocal governments with such funds.\n  The TARP Assistance for Local Governments Act of 2009 will change \nthis, and ensure that communities remain solvent and taxpayers are \nprotected.\n  Given the urgency of this situation, we can no longer afford to wait.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Boxer, \n        and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 117. A bill to protect the property and security of homeowners who \nare subject to foreclosure proceedings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am introducing the Foreclosure Rescue \nFraud Act of 2009 with my colleagues Senators Collins and Lincoln. This \nlegislation, which we introduced last Congress, will make it more \ndifficult for financial predators to take advantage of homeowners in \nforeclosure.\n  Foreclosure rescue scams are another consequence of the housing \ncrisis that is plaguing the country. Foreclosure filings have been \nclimbing across the country for the past two years and in Wisconsin, \nfilings have risen 22 percent over the past year. Additionally, the \nFederal Reserve estimates that 2.5 million Americans will be facing \nforeclosure in 2009. As default rates and foreclosure filings have \nsteadily increased, so have financial scams which prey on homeowners. \nThe Better Business Bureau listed foreclosure rescue scams as one of \nthe top ten financial scams in 2008.\n  For most people, their home is their greatest asset. When a homeowner \nfalls behind in their payments, it can cause a great deal of emotional \nstress on the family. Scam artists prey on owner's desperation and give \nthem a false sense of security, claiming they can help ``save their \nhome.'' The types of scams vary, but the end result is that the \nhomeowner is left in a more desperate situation than before.\n  The Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act aims to prevent these cruel abuses \nby increasing disclosure and creating strict requirements for a person \nor entity offering foreclosure-rescue services. The legislation \nprohibits a ``foreclosure consultant'' from collecting any fee or \ncompensation before completing contracted services, and from obtaining \npower of attorney from a homeowner. It also requires full disclosure of \nthird-party consideration in the property and creates a 3-day right to \ncancel the foreclosure-rescue contract. Finally, the legislation \ncreates a federal ``floor'' of protection and allows states without \nrescue-fraud laws to use these provisions as a way to help scam \nvictims. The Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act will make it easier for \nstates and the Federal Government to combat these schemes and protect \npeople who are already financially distressed from being made worse \noff.\n  The past year has exposed the irregularities and inadequacies of our \nbanking regulations. As Congress continues to work on proposals to \nrestore confidence in our financial industry, it is imperative that we \nput in place new rules and regulations that better protect consumers in \norder to avoid further economic strain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Nelson of Florida, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 118. A bill to amend section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, to \nimprove the program under such section for supportive housing for the \nelderly, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am introducing the Section 202 Supportive \nHousing for the Elderly Act of 2008 with my colleague Senator Charles \nSchumer for the purpose of expanding and improving the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the \nElderly Program. Section 202 provides capital grants to nonprofit \ncommunity organizations for the development of supportive housing and \nprovision of rental assistance exclusively for low-income seniors. This \nprogram supplies housing that includes access to supportive services to \nallow seniors to remain safely in their homes and age in place. Access \nto supportive services reduces the occurrence of costly nursing home \nstays and helps save both seniors and the Federal Government money.\n  There are over 300,000 seniors living in 6,000 Section 202 \ndevelopments across the country. Unfortunately, the program is far from \nmeeting the growing demand. Approximately 730,000 additional senior \nhousing units will be needed by 2020 in order to address the future \nhousing needs of low-income seniors. There are currently 10 seniors \nvying for each unit that becomes available, with many seniors waiting \nyears before finding a home. To make matters worse, we are losing older \nSection 202 properties to developers of high-priced condominiums and \napartments. As a result, many seniors currently participating in the \nprogram could end up homeless.\n  Congress needs to act now to address the demand for safe, affordable \nsenior housing. Our legislation would promote the construction of new \nsenior housing facilities as well as preserve and improve upon existing \nfacilities. The legislation would also support the conversion of \nexisting facilities into assisted living facilities that provide a wide \nvariety of additional supportive health and social services. Under \ncurrent law, these processes are time-consuming and bureaucratic, often \nrequiring waivers and special permission from HUD. Finally, our \nlegislation provides priority consideration for our homeless seniors \nseeking a place to call their own. With this bill, we hope to reduce \ncurrent impediments and increase the availability of affordable and \nsupportive housing for our Nations most vulnerable seniors.\n  I want to thank the American Association of Homes and Services for \nthe Aging as well as the Wisconsin Association of Homes and Services \nfor the Aging for being champions of this legislation and for working \nwith us to develop a comprehensive bill that will help meet the growing \nneed for senior housing in this Nation.\n  Senior citizens deserve to have housing that will help them maintain \ntheir independence. I urge that my colleagues will join Senator Schumer \nand me in our efforts to ensure that older Americans have a place to \ncall home during their golden years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Guy Privat Tape and his wife Lou Nazie \nRaymonde Toto. Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto are citizens of the Ivory Coast, \nbut have been living in the San Francisco area of California for \napproximately 15 years.\n  The story of Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were previously political activists who were \nsubjected to numerous atrocities in the early 1990s in the Ivory Coast.\n  After a demonstration in which both were promoting peace, they were \njailed and tortured by their own government. Ms. Toto was brutally \nraped by her captors and in 1997 learned that she had contracted HIV.\n  Despite the hardships that they suffered, Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto were \nable to make a better life for themselves in the United States. Mr. \nTape arrived in the U.S. in 1993 on a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa. Ms. \nToto entered without inspection in 1995 from Spain. Despite being \ndiagnosed with HIV, Ms. Toto was able to give birth to two healthy \nchildren, Melody, age 10, and Emmanuel, age 6.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement and a strong work ethic. They pay \ntaxes and own their own home in Hercules, CA. They are active members \nof Easter Hill United Methodist Church.\n  Mr. Tape works full-time as a security guard with Universal \nProtective Services. He also manages a small business, Melody's Carpet \nCleaning & Upholstery. He employs four other individuals, all U.S. \ncitizens. Unfortunately, in 2002, Mr. Tape was diagnosed with urologic \ncancer. While his doctor states that the cancer is currently in \nremission, he will continue to require life-long surveillance to \nmonitor for reoccurrence of the disease.\n  In addition to raising her two children, Ms. Toto became a certified \nNursing Assistant in 2001 and currently works at Creekside Health Care \nin San Pablo, CA. She hopes to finish her schooling so that she can \nbecome a Registered Nurse. Ms. Toto continues to receive medical \ntreatment for HIV. According to her doctor, without access to adequate \nhealth care and laboratory monitoring, she is at risk of developing \nlife threatening illnesses.\n  Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto applied for asylum when they arrived in the \nU.S., but after many years of litigation, the claim was ultimately \ndenied by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Although the regime which subjected Mr. Tape and Ms. Toto to \nimprisonment and torture is no longer in power, Mr. Tape has been \nafraid to return to the Ivory Coast due to his prior association with \nPresident Gbagbo. Mr. Tape strongly believes that his family will be \ntargeted if they return to the Ivory Coast.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to \nremain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have \non their two children. For Melody and Emmanuel, the United States is \nthe only country they have ever known. Mr. Tape believes that if the \nfamily returns to the Ivory Coast, these two young children will be \nforced to enter the army.\n  We are the only hope for this family who seeks to remain in the \nUnited States. To send them back to the Ivory Coast, where they will \nlikely face persecution and will not be able to obtain adequate medical \ntreatment for their illnesses would be devastating to them. They are \ncontributing members of their community and have embraced the American \ndream with their strong work ethic and family values. I have received \napproximately 50 letters from the church community in support of this \nfamily. Representative George Miller has also requested that we assist \nthis family.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR GUY PRIVAT TAPE AND \n                   LOU NAZIE RAYMONDE TOTO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto shall each \n     be eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for \n     adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted \n     for permanent residence upon filing an application for \n     issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Guy Privat Tape or Lou Nazie \n     Raymonde Toto enters the United States before the filing \n     deadline specified in subsection (c), Guy Privat Tape or Lou \n     Nazie Raymonde Toto, as appropriate, shall be considered to \n     have entered\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n     and remained lawfully in the United States and shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status \n     is filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an \n     immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Privat Tape and \n     Lou Nazie Raymonde Toto, the Secretary of State shall \n     instruct the proper officer to reduce by 2, during the \n     current or subsequent fiscal year, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde \n     Toto under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the total number of \n     immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Guy Privat Tape and Lou Nazie Raymonde \n     Toto under section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 120. A bill for the relief of Denes Fulop and Gyorgyi Fulop; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today a private immigration \nrelief bill to provide lawful permanent residence status to Denes and \nGyorgyi Fulop, Hungarian nationals who have lived in California for \nmore than 20 years. The Fulops are the parents of six U.S. citizen \nchildren.\n  I first introduced this bill in June, 2000. Today, the Fulops \ncontinue to face deportation having exhausted all administrative \nremedies under our immigration system.\n  The Fulops' story is a compelling one and one which I believe merits \nCongress' consideration for humanitarian relief.\n  The most poignant tragedy to affect this family occurred in May of \n2000, when the Fulops' eldest child, Robert ``Bobby'' Fulop, an \naccomplished 15-year-old teenager, died suddenly of a heart aneurism. \nBobby was considered the shining star of his family.\n  That same year their 6-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was diagnosed \nwith moderate pulmonary stenosis, a potentially life-threatening heart \ncondition and a frightening situation similar to Bobby's. Not long ago, \nshe successfully underwent heart surgery, but requires medical \nsupervision to ensure her good health.\n  The Fulops' youngest child, Matthew, was born seven weeks premature. \nHe subsequently underwent several kidney surgeries and is still being \nclosely monitored by physicians.\n  Compounding these tragedies is the fact that today the Fulops face \ndeportation. They face deportation, in part, because in 1995 the family \ntraveled to Hungary and remained there for more than 90 days.\n  Under the pre-1996 immigration law, prior to the Illegal Immigration \nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, their stay in Hungary \nwould not have been a factor in their immigration case and they would \nhave been eligible for adjustment of status to lawful permanent \nresidents.\n  Indeed, in 1996, Mr. and Mrs. Fulop applied to the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, for permanent resident status. Due to \nlarge backlogs, the INS did not interview them until 1998. By the time \ntheir applications were considered, the new 1996 immigration law had \ntaken effect.\n  Given their one-time 90 day trip outside the United States, they were \nstatutorily ineligible for relief pursuant to the cancellation of \nremoval provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  One cannot help but conclude that had the INS acted on the Fulops' \napplication for relief from deportation in a timelier manner, they \nwould have qualified for suspension of deportation under the pre-1996 \nlaw, given that they were long-term residents of the United States with \nU.S. citizen children and many positive factors in their favor.\n  The irony of this situation is that the Fulops were gone from the \nUnited States for nearly five months in 1995 because they traveled to \nHungary to help Mr. Fulop's brother build his home. Mr. Fulop's brother \nis handicapped and they went to help remodel his home.\n  The Fulops are good and decent people. Mr. Fulop is a masonry \ncontractor and the Owner and President of his own construction \ncompany--Sumeg International. He has owned this business for almost 14 \nyears.\n  The couple is active in their church and community. As Pastor Peter \nPetrovic of the Apostolic Christian Church of San Diego says in his \nletter of support, ``[t]he family is an exceptional asset to their \ncommunity.'' Mrs. Fulop has served as a Sunday school teacher and \nvolunteers regularly at Heritage K-8 Charter School in Escondido. Mrs. \nMorris, a Heritage K-8 Charter School faculty member says in her letter \nof support that Mrs. Fulop is ``. . . a valuable asset to our school \nand community.''\n  Mr. President, this is a tragic situation. Essentially, as happened \nto many families under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, the rules of the game were changed in the \nmiddle. When the Fulops applied for relief from deportation they were \neligible for suspension of deportation. By the time the INS got around \nto their application, nearly three years later, they were no longer \neligible and in fact suspension of deportation as a form of relief \nceased to exist.\n  The Fulops today have been in the United States since the early \n1980s. Most harmful is the effect that their deportation will have on \nthe children, all of whom were born here and who range from five years \nold to 21 years of age. Their two eldest children are attending \ncollege, one studying structural engineering and the other studying to \nbecome a dental hygienist.\n  It is my hope that Congress sees fit to provide an opportunity for \nthis family to remain together in the United States given their many \nyears here, the profound sadness they have already experienced and the \nharm that would come from their deportation to their six U.S. citizen \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Denes Fulop and \n     Gyorgyi Fulop shall be deemed to have been lawfully admitted \n     to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255).\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed \n     with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas to Denes Fulop and Gyorgyi Fulop, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent fiscal year, \n     the total number of immigrant visas that are made available \n     to natives of the country of birth of Denes Fulop and Gyorgyi \n     Fulop under section or 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are of birth of Denes \n     Fulop and Gyorgyi Fulop under section 202(e) of that Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 121. A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria \nElna Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana Arreola, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private immigration \nrelief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to \nEsidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Bibiana \nArreola and Cindy Jael Arreola, Mexican nationals living in the Fresno \narea of California.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Arreola have lived in the United States for over 20 \nyears. Two of their five children, Nayely, age 23, and Cindy, age 19, \nalso stand to benefit from this legislation. Their other three \nchildren, Roberto, age 16, Daniel, age 13, and Saray, age 11, are \nUnited States citizens. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Arreola and their two \neldest children face deportation.\n  The story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they \nmerit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\n  The Arreolas are in this uncertain situation in part because of \ngrievous errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been \ndisbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it \ncompelled an immigration judge to write the Executive Office of \nImmigration Review seeking his disbarment for the disservice he caused \nhis immigration clients.\n  Mr. Arreola has lived in the United States since 1986. He was an \nagricultural migrant worker in the fields of California for several \nyears, and as such would have been eligible for permanent residence \nthrough the Seasonal Agricultural Workers, SAW, program, had he known \nabout it.\n  Mrs. Arreola was living in the United States at the time she became \npregnant with her daughter Cindy, but returned to Mexico to give birth \nso as to avoid any problems with the Immigration and Naturalization \nService.\n  Given the length of time that the Arreolas had, and have been, in the \nUnited States it is quite likely that they would have qualified for \nrelief from deportation pursuant to the cancellation of removal \nprovisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, but for the conduct \nof their previous attorney.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the devastating impact their \ndeportation would have on their children--three of whom are U.S. \ncitizens--and the other two who have lived in the United States since \nthey were toddlers. For these children, this country is the only \ncountry they really know.\n  Nayely, the oldest, recently graduated from Fresno Pacific University \nwith a degree in Business Administration and was recently hired as a \nsubstitute teacher in Tulare County. She was the first in her family to \ngraduate from high school and the first to graduate college. She \nattended Fresno Pacific University, a regionally ranked university, on \na full tuition scholarship package and worked part-time in the \nadmissions office.\n  At her young age, Nayely has demonstrated a strong commitment to the \nideals of citizenship in her adopted country. She has worked hard to \nachieve her full potential both in her academic endeavors and through \nthe service she provides her community. As the Associate Dean of \nEnrollment Services, Cary Templeton, at Fresno Pacific University \nstates in a letter of support, ``[t]he leaders of Fresno Pacific \nUniversity saw in Nayely, a young person who will become exemplary of \nall that is good in the American dream.''\n  In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual \nDetermination, AVID, a college preparatory program in which students \ncommit to determining their own futures through achieving a college \ndegree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service \norganization. She helped mentor freshmen and participates in several \nother student organizations in her school. Perhaps the greatest \nhardship to this family, if forced to return to Mexico, will be her \nlost opportunity to realize her dreams and further contribute to her \ncommunity and to this country.\n  It is clear to me that Nayely feels a strong sense of responsibility \nfor her community and country. By all indication, this is the case as \nwell for all of the members of her family.\n  The Arreolas also have other family who are lawful permanent \nresidents of this country or United States citizens. Mrs. Arreola has \nthree brothers who are U.S. citizens and Mr. Arreola has a sister who \nis a U.S. citizen. It is also my understanding that they have no \nimmediate family in Mexico.\n  According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any \nproblems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their \ntaxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked \nhard to support themselves. As I previously mentioned, Mr. Arreola was \npreviously employed as a farm worker, but now has his own business \nrepairing electronics. His business has been successful enough to \nenable him to purchase a home for his family.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear.

A bill for the relief of Robert Liang and Alice Liang; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Robert Kuan \nLiang and his wife, Chun-Mei, Alice, Hsu-Liang, foreign nationals who \nlive in San Bruno, California.\n  I have decided to reintroduce private relief immigration bills on \ntheir behalf because I believe that, without them, this hardworking \ncouple and their three United States citizen children would endure an \nimmense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this \nfamily may not remain a family for much longer.\n  The Liangs are foreign nationals facing deportation on account of \ntheir overstay of visitors visas and the failure of their previous \nattorney to timely file a suspension of deportation application before \nthe immigration laws changed in 1996.\n  Mr. Liang is a foreign national and refugee from Laos. His wife is a \ncitizen of Taiwan. They entered the United States over 25 years ago as \ntourists and established residency in San Bruno, California. Because \nthey overstayed the terms of their temporary visas, they now face \ndeportation from the United States.\n  After living here for so many years, removal from the United States \nwould not come easily or perhaps without tearing this family apart. The \nLiangs have three children born in this country: Wesley, 17 years old, \nBruce, 13 years old, and Eva, 11 years old. Young Wesley suffers from \nasthma and has a history of social and emotional anxiety.\n  The immigration judge who presided over the Liangs' case in 1997 \nconcluded that there was no question that the Liang children would be \nadversely impacted if they were required to leave their relatives and \nfriends behind in California to follow their parents to Taiwan, a \ncountry whose language and culture is unfamiliar to them.\n  I can only imagine how much more they would be adversely impacted now \ngiven the passage of 9 more years.\n  The Liangs have filed annual income tax returns; established a \nsuccessful business, Fong Yong Restaurant, in the United States; are \nhome owners, and\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\nare financially successful. Since they arrived in the United States, \nthey have pursued and, to a degree, achieved the American Dream.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Liang's quest to legalize their immigration status began \nin 1993 when they filed for relief from deportation before an \nimmigration judge.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service, however, did not act on \ntheir application until nearly 5 years later, in 1997, after which time \nthe immigration laws had significantly changed.\n  According to the immigration judge, had the INS acted on their \napplication for relief from deportation in a timely manner, they would \nhave qualified for suspension of deportation, given that they were \nlong-term residents of this country with U.S. citizen children and \nother positive factors. By the time INS processed their application, \nhowever, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, which changed the requirements for relief \nfrom removal to the Liangs' disadvantage.\n  I supported the changes of the 1996 law, but I believe sometimes \nthere are exceptions which merit special consideration. The Liangs are \nsuch a couple and family. Perhaps what distinguishes this family from \nmany others is that through hard work and perseverance, Mr. Liang has \nachieved a significant degree of success in the United States while \nbattling a severe form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n  According to his psychologist, this disorder stems from the \npersecution he, his family and community experienced in his native \ncountry of Laos during the Vietnam War.\n  Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Mr. Liang was exposed to \nnumerous traumatic experiences, including the murder of his mother by \nthe North Vietnamese and frequent episodes of wartime violence. He also \nroutinely witnessed the brutal persecution and deaths of others in his \nvillage. In 1975, he was granted refugee status in Taiwan.\n  The emotional impact of Mr. Liang's experiences in his war-torn \nnative country has been profound and continues to haunt him. His \npsychologist has also indicated that he suffers from severe clinical \ndepression, which has been exacerbated by the prospect of being \ndeported to Taiwan, where on account of his nationality, he believes he \nand his family would be treated as second-class citizens.\n  Moreover, Mr. Liang believes that the pursuit of further mental \nhealth treatment in Taiwan would only exacerbate the stigma of being an \noutsider in a country whose language he does not speak. Given those \nprospects, he also fears the impact such a stigma would have on the \nwell-being and future of his children.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of the Liangs. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law \n     or any order, for the purposes of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Robert Liang and \n     Alice Liang shall be deemed to have been lawfully admitted \n     to, and remained in, the United States, and shall be eligible \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status \n     under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1255).\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the applications for issuance of immigrant \n     visas or the applications for adjustment of status are filed \n     with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of immigrant visas to Robert Liang and Alice Liang, the \n     Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to \n     reduce by 2, during the current or subsequent fiscal year, \n     the total number of immigrant visas that are made available \n     to natives of the country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice \n     Liang under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)), or, if applicable, the total number \n     of immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the \n     country of birth of Robert Liang and Alice Liang under \n     section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 123. A bill for the relief of Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda \nDe Buendia, and Ana Laura Buendia Aranda; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nto provide lawful permanent residence status to Jose Buendia Balderas, \nhis wife, Alicia Aranda De Buendia, and their daughter, Ana Laura \nBuendia Aranda, Mexican nationals who have been living and working in \nthe Fresno area of California for over 20 years.\n  Jose Buendia is a remarkable individual who epitomizes the American \ndream. His father worked as an agricultural laborer in the Bracero \nprogram over 25 years ago. In 1981, Jose followed his father to the \nUnited States--where he worked in the shadows to help provide for his \nfamily in Mexico.\n  Since then, Jose has moved from working as a landscaper to \nconstruction, where he is now a valued employee of Bone Construction in \nReedley, California. He has been employed by this cement company for \nthe past 8 years. Although he knew nothing about construction when he \nbegan working in the field, he was disciplined and persistent in his \ntraining and is now a lead foreman.\n  His employer, Timothy Bone, says Mr. Buendia is a ``reliable, \nhardworking and conscientious'' employee. In fact, it was Mr. Bone who \ncontacted my office to seek relief for Mr. Buendia.\n  Alicia Buendia, Jose Buendia's wife, has been working as a seasonal \nfruit packer for several years. The family has consistently paid all of \ntheir taxes. Recently, they paid off their mortgage and today, they are \ndebt free. They have health insurance, savings and retirement accounts, \nparticipate in the company profit-sharing company, and support their \nfamily here and in Mexico. In short, they are living the American \ndream.\n  Their daughter, Ana Laura, is an outstanding student. She earned a \n4.0 GPA at Reedley High School and was awarded an academic scholarship \nto the University of California-Berkeley. Unfortunately, because of her \nimmigration status, she was unable to accept the scholarship and her \nparents now pay full out-of-state tuition for her to attend the \nUniversity of California-Irvine. She is now completing her second year \nthere.\n  Their son, Jose, is a U.S. citizen, and graduated high school with a \n3.85 grade point average and honors, and is currently an engineering \nstudent at Reedley Junior College. For both Jose and Ana Laura, the \nUnited States is the only country they know.\n  What makes the story of the Buendias so tragic is that they would \nhave been eligible to correct their illegal status but for the \nunscrupulous practices of their former immigration attorney.\n  Because Mr. Buendia has been in this country for so long, he \nqualified for legalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform \nControl Act of 1986. Unfortunately, his legalization application was \nnever acted upon because his attorney, Jose Velez, was convicted of \nfraudulently submitting legalization and Special Agricultural Worker \napplications.\n  This criminal conduct tainted all of Mr. Velez's clients. Although \nMr. Buendia's application was found not to contain any fraudulent \ndocumentation, it was submitted while his lawyer was under \ninvestigation. The result was that Mr. Buendia was unable to be \ninterviewed and obtain legal status.\n  To complicate matters, it took the Immigration and Naturalization \nService nearly 7 years to determine that Mr. Buendia's application \ncontained no fraudulent information. In the meantime, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service reinterpreted the law and determined that he \nwas no longer eligible for relief because he had left the United States \nbriefly when he married his wife.\n  Despite these setbacks, the Buendia family has continued to seek \nlegal status. They believed they were successful when an immigration \njudge granted the family relief based on the hardship their U.S. \ncitizen son would face if his family was deported to Mexico. \nUnfortunately, the government appealed the judge's decision and had it \noverturned by the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  Despite the problems with adjusting their legal status, this family \nhas forged ahead and continued to play a meaningful role in their \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nThey have worked hard. They have invested in their neighborhood. They \nare active in the PTA and their local church.\n  I believe the Buendia family should be allowed to continue to live in \nthis country that has become their own. If this legislation is \napproved, the Buendias will be able to continue to contribute \nsignificantly to the United States. It is my hope that Congress passes \nthis private legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Shigeru Yamada; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Shigeru \nYamada, a 24-year-old Japanese national who lives in Chula Vista, \nCalifornia. The House passed a private relief bill on behalf of Mr. \nYamada last year, but unfortunately we were unable to move the bill in \nthe Senate before the end of the 110th Congress.\n  I have decided to re-introduce a private bill on his behalf because I \nbelieve that Mr. Yamada represents a model American citizen, for whom \nremoval from this country would represent an unfair hardship. Without \nthis legislation, Mr. Yamada will be forced to return to a country in \nwhich he lacks any linguistic, cultural or family ties.\n  Mr. Yamada legally entered the United States with his mother and two \nsisters in 1992 at the young age of 10. The family was fleeing from Mr. \nYamada's alcoholic father, who had been physically abusive to his \nmother, the children and even his own parents. Since then, he has had \nno contact with his father and is unsure if he is even alive. \nTragically, Mr. Yamada experienced further hardship when his mother was \nkilled in a car crash in 1995. Orphaned at the age of 13, Mr. Yamada \nspent time living with his aunt before moving to Chula Vista to live \nwith a close friend of his late mother.\n  The death of his mother marked more than a personal tragedy for Mr. \nYamada; it also served to impede the process for him to legalize his \nstatus. At the time of her death, Mr. Yamada's family was living \nlegally in the United States. His mother had acquired a student visa \nfor herself and her children qualified as her dependants. Her death \nrevoked his legal status in the United States.\n  In addition, Mr. Yamada's mother was engaged to an American citizen \nat the time of her death. Had she survived, her son would likely have \nbecome an American citizen through this marriage.\n  Mr. Yamada has exhausted all administrative options under our current \nimmigration system. Throughout high school, he contacted attorneys in \nthe hopes of legalizing his status, but his attempts were unsuccessful. \nUnfortunately, time has run out and, for Mr. Yamada, the only option \navailable to him today is private relief legislation.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for Mr. Yamada to be deported \nfrom the United States and forced to return to Japan.\n  First, since arriving in the United States, Mr. Yamada has lived as a \nmodel American. He graduated with honors from Eastlake High School in \n2000, where he excelled in both academics and athletics. Academically, \nhe earned a number of awards including being named an ``Outstanding \nEnglish Student'' his freshman year, an All-American Scholar, and \nearning the United States National Minority Leadership Award.\n  His teacher and coach, Mr. John describes him as being ``responsible, \nhard working, organized, honest, caring and very dependable.'' His role \nas the vice president of the Associated Student Body his senior year is \nan indication of Mr. Yamada's high level of leadership, as well as, his \npopularity and trustworthiness among his peers.\n  As an athlete, Mr. Yamada was named the ``Most Inspirational Player \nof the Year'' in junior varsity baseball and football, as well as, \nvarsity football. His football coach, Mr. Jose Mendoza, expressed his \nadmiration by saying that he has ``seen in Shigeru Yamada the \nresponsibility, dedication and loyalty that the average American holds \nto be virtuous.''\n\n  Second, Mr. Yamada has distinguished himself as a local volunteer. As \na member of the Eastlake High School Link Crew, he helped freshman find \ntheir way around campus, offered tutoring and mentoring services, and \nset an example of how to be a successful member of the student body. \nAfter graduating from high school, he volunteered his time for 4 years \nas the coach of the Eastlake High School Girl's softball team. The \nformer head coach, who has since retired, Dr. Charles Sorge, describes \nhim as an individual full of ``integrity'' who understands that as a \ncoach it is important to work as a ``team player.''\n  His level of commitment to the team was further illustrated to Dr. \nSorge when he discovered, halfway through the season, that Mr. Yamada's \ncommute to and from practice was 2 hours long each way. It takes an \nindividual with character to volunteer his time to coach and never \nbring up the issue of how long his commute takes him each day. Dr. \nSorge hopes that, once Mr. Yamada legalizes his immigration status, he \nwill be formally hired to continue coaching the team.\n  Third, sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan would be an immense hardship \nfor him and his family here. Mr. Yamada does not speak Japanese. He is \nunaware of the nation's current cultural trends.\n  And, he has no immediate family members that he knows of in Japan. \nAll of his family lives in California. Sending Mr. Yamada back to Japan \nwould serve to split his family apart and separate him from everyone \nand everything that he knows.\n  His sister contends that her younger brother would be ``lost'' if he \nhad to return to live in Japan on his own. It is unlikely that he would \nbe able to find any gainful employment in Japan due to his inability to \nspeak or read the language.\n  As a member of the Chula Vista community, Mr. Yamada has \ndistinguished himself as an honorable individual. His teacher, Mr. \nRobert Hughes, describes him as being an ``upstanding `All-American' \nyoung man''. Until being picked up during a routine check of riders' \nimmigration status on a city bus, he had never been arrested or \nconvicted of any crime. Mr. Yamada is not, and has never been, a burden \non\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nthe State. He has never received any Federal or State assistance.\n  With his hard work and giving attitude, Shigeru Yamada represents the \nideal American citizen. Although born in Japan, he is truly American in \nevery other sense.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Mr. Yamada. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIGERU YAMADA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Shigeru Yamada shall be eligible for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shigeru Yamada enters the \n     United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Shigeru Yamada shall be considered to have \n     entered and remained lawfully and shall be eligible for \n     adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shigeru \n     Yamada, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper \n     officer to reduce by 1, during the current or subsequent \n     fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas that are \n     made available to natives of the country of birth of Shigeru \n     Yamada under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of birth of Shigeru Yamada under \n     section 202(e) of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 125. A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria \nDel Refugio Plascencia; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez \nand his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals who live \nin the San Bruno area of California.\n  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe \nthat, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States \ncitizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, \nwithout this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much \nlonger.\n  The Plascencia's have worked for years to adjust their status through \nthe appropriate legal channels, only to have their efforts thwarted by \ninattentive legal counsel. Repeatedly, the Plascencia's lawyer refused \nto return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in anyway. He \nalso failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even notify \nthe Plascencias that he had them. Because of the poor representation \nthey received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware that they had \nbeen ordered to leave the country 15 days prior to their deportation.\n  Although the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, \nthey acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and to file the \nappropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any \nother legal action could be taken.\n  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed \nfrom the United States.\n  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. \nPlascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded \ncouple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to \nfamily, and devotion to community.\n  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's \nShellfish for the over 14 years, where his dedication and willingness \nto learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial \nposition. He now overseas the market's entire packing operation and \nseveral employees.\n  The president of the market, in one of the several dozen letters I \nhave received in support of Mr. Plascencia, referred to him as ``a \nvaluable and respected employee'' who ``handles himself in a very \nprofessional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other \nemployees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. Plascencia's job \nperformance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' \n``honest,'' and ``reliable.''\n  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as \na medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. \nNot satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia \nwent to school, earned her high school equivalency degree and improved \nher skills to become a medical assistant.\n  Those who have written to me in support of Mrs. Plascencia, of which \nthere are several, have described her work as ``responsible,'' \n``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.''\n  In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse \nRose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the \ncommunity and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, \ndevoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her \ncommunity. She and her family are a solid example of the type of \nimmigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.''\n  Mrs. Carino went on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent \nemployee and role model for her colleagues. She works in a very \ndemanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by the \nphysicians she works with.''\n  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional \nsuccesses to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. \nThey saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health \ncare benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want \nto send their children to college and give them an even better life.\n  This legislation is important because it would preserve these \nachievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to \nmake substantive contributions to the community in the future.\n  It is important, also, because of the positive impact it will have on \nthe couple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and each \nof whom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay \nArea community.\n  Christina, 17, is the Plascencia's oldest child, and an honor \nstudent. Erika, 14, and Alfredo, Jr., 12, have worked hard at their \nstudies and received praise and good grades from their teachers. In \nfact, the principal of Erika's school has recognized her as the ``Most \nArtistic'' student in her class. Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked \non a report card, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''\n  The Plascencia's also have two young children: 6-year-old Daisy and \n2-year-old Juan-Pablo.\n  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be \ntragic for their children. Children who were born in the United States \nand who through no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation \nthat has the potential to dramatically alter their lives.\n  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencia's older children--\nChristina, Erika, and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They \nare old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their \nteachers, their friends, and their home. They would leave everything \nthat is familiar to them.\n  Their parents would find themselves in Mexico without a job and \nwithout a house. The children would have to acclimate to a different \nculture, language, and way of life.\n  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave \ntheir children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which \nno parents should have to make.\n  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are \nnot my own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with \nthe Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the \nAmerican spirit.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n  I have sponsored this legislation, and asked my colleagues to support \nit, because I believe that this is a spirit that we must nurture \nwherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to leave the United \nStates would extinguish that spirit. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis private bill on behalf of the Plascencia family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Claudia Marquez Rico; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Claudia \nMarquez Rico, a Mexican national living in Redwood City, CA.\n  Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Claudia was brought to the United States by \nher parents 16 years ago.\n  Claudia was just 6 years old at the time. She has two younger \nbrothers, Jose and Omar, who came to America with her, and a sister, \nMaribel, who was born in California and is a U.S. Citizen. America is \nthe only home they know.\n  Eight years ago that home was visited by tragedy. As Mr. and Mrs. \nMarquez were driving to work early on the morning of October 4, 2000, \nthey were both killed in a horrible traffic accident when their car \ncollided with a truck on an isolated rural road.\n  The children went to live with their aunt and uncle, Hortencia and \nPatricio Alcala. The Alcalas are a generous and loving couple. They are \nU.S. citizens with two children of their own and took the Marquez \nchildren in and did all they could to comfort them in their grief. They \nsupervised their schooling, and made sure they received the counseling \nthey needed, too. The family is active in their parish at Buen Pastor \nCatholic Church, and Patricio Alcala serves as a youth soccer coach. In \n2001, the Alcalas were appointed the legal guardians of the Marquez \nchildren.\n  Sadly, the Marquez family received poor legal representation. At the \ntime of their parents' death, Claudia and Jose were minors, and \nqualified for special immigrant juvenile status. This category was \nenacted by Congress to protect children like them from the hardship \nthat would result from deportation under such extraordinary \ncircumstances, when a State court deems them to be dependents due to \nabuse, abandonment or neglect.\n  Today, their younger brother Omar is a U.S. Citizen, due to his \nadjustment as a special immigrant juvenile. Unfortunately, the family's \nprevious lawyer failed to secure this relief for Claudia, and she has \nnow reached the age of majority without having resolved her immigration \nstatus.\n  I should note that their former lawyer, Walter Pineda, is currently \nanswering charges on 29 counts of professional incompetence and 5 \ncounts of moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases and appears \non his way to being disbarred.\n  I am offering legislation on Claudia's behalf because I believe that, \nwithout it, this family would endure an immense and unfair hardship. \nIndeed, without this legislation, this family will not remain a family \nfor much longer.\n  Despite the adversity they encountered, Claudia finished school. She \nsupports herself, her 17-year-old sister, Maribel, and her younger \nbrother Omar. Again, both Maribel and Omar are now U.S. Citizens.\n  Claudia has no close relatives in Mexico. She has never visited \nMexico, and she was so young when she was brought to America that she \nhas no memories of it. How can we expect her to start a new life there \nnow?\n  It would be a grave injustice to add to this family's misfortune by \ntearing these siblings apart. This is a close family, and they have \ncome to rely on each other heavily in the absence of their deceased \nparents. This bill will prevent the added tragedy of another wrenching \nseparation.\n  Given these extraordinary and unique facts, I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this private relief bill on behalf of Claudia Rico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR CLAUDIA MARQUEZ \n                   RICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Claudia Marquez Rico shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Claudia Marquez Rico enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully and, if otherwise eligible, shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an \n     immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Claudia \n     Marquez Rico, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by 1, during the current or \n     subsequent fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of birth of \n     Claudia Marquez Rico under section 203(a) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of birth of Claudia Marquez Rico under \n     section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for \n     Certain Relatives.--The natural parents, brothers, and \n     sisters of Claudia Marquez Rico shall not, by virtue of such \n     relationship, be accorded any right, privilege, or status \n     under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 127. A bill for the relief of Jacqueline W. Coats; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jacqueline \nCoats, a 28-year-old widow currently living in San Francisco.\n  Mrs. Coats came to the U.S. in 2001 from Kenya on a student visa to \nstudy Mass Communications at San Jose State University. Her visa status \nlapsed in 2003, and the Department of\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nHomeland Security began deportation proceedings against her.\n  Mrs. Coats married Marlin Coats on April 17, 2006, after dating for \nseveral years. The couple was happily married and planning to start a \nfamily when, on May 13, Mr. Coats tragically died in a heroic attempt \nto save two young boys from drowning.\n  The couple had been on a Mother's Day outing at Ocean Beach with some \nof Mr. Coats' nephews when they heard cries for help. Having worked as \na lifeguard in the past, Mr. Coats instinctively dove into the water. \nThe two children were saved with the help of a rescue crew, but Mr. \nCoats, caught in a riptide, died. Mrs. Coats received a medal honoring \nher husband.\n  Four days before Mr. Coats' death, the couple prepared and signed an \napplication for a green card at their attorney's office. Unfortunately \nthe petition was not filed until after his death, rendering it invalid. \nMrs. Coats currently has a hearing before an immigration judge in San \nFrancisco on August 24, but her attorney has informed my staff that she \nhas no relief available to her and will be ordered deported.\n  Mrs. Coats, devastated by the loss of her husband, is now caught in a \nbattle for her right to stay in America. At a recent news conference \nwith her lawyer, Thip Ark, she explained of her situation, ``I feel \nlike I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to go home to . . . \nI've been here four years . . . It would be like starting a new life.''\n  Ms. Ark explains that Mrs. Coats is extremely close with her late \nhusband's family, with whom she lives in San Leandro, California. Mrs. \nCoats has said that her husband's large family has become her own. \nRamona Burton of San Francisco, one of Marlin Coats' seven brothers and \nsisters explains, ``She spent her first American Christmas with us, her \nfirst American Thanksgiving . . . I can't imagine looking around and \nnot seeing her there. She needs to be there.''\n  The San Francisco and Bay Area community has rallied strong support \nfor Mrs. Coats. The San Francisco chapters of the NAACP, the San \nFrancisco Board of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Police \nDepartment, have all passed resolutions in support of Mrs. Coats' right \nto remain in the country.\n  Unfortunately, if this private relief bill is not approved, this \nyoung woman, and the Coats family, will face yet another disorienting \nand heartbreaking tragedy. Mrs. Coats will be deported to Kenya, a \ncountry she has not lived in since she was 21. In her time of grieving, \nshe will be forced to leave her home, her job with AC Transit, her new \nfamily, and everything she has known for the past 5 years.\n  I cannot think of a compelling reason why the United States should \nnot allow this young widow to continue the green card process. Had her \nhusband lived, Mrs. Coats would have filed the papers without \ndifficulty. It was because of her husband's selfless and heroic act \nthat Mrs. Coats must now struggle to remain in the country. As one \nconcerned California constituent wrote to me, ``If ever there was a \ncase where common fairness, morality and decency should reign over \nlegal technicalities, this is it. We, as a country, need to reward \nheroism and good.''\n  I believe that we can reward the late Mr. Coats for his noble actions \nby granting his wife citizenship. It is what he intended for her. It \ncan even be argued that a green card for his wife was one of his dying \nwishes, as the papers were signed just 4 days prior to his death.\n  For these reasons, I reintroduce this private relief immigration bill \nand ask my colleagues to support it on behalf of Mrs. Coats.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JACQUELINE W. COATS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Jacqueline W.

Coats enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), Jacqueline W.

A bill for the relief of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \nMicaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private \nimmigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence \nstatus to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno and Micaela Lopez Martinez and \ntheir daughter, Adilene Martinez--Mexican nationals now living in San \nFrancisco, California.\n  This family embodies the true American success story and I believe \nthey merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary \nform of relief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Martinez came to the United States eighteen years ago from \nMexico. He started working as a bus boy in restaurants in San \nFrancisco. In 1990, he began working as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an \naward winning Italian restaurant in San Francisco.\n  According to the people who worked with him, he ``never made \nmistakes, never lost his temper, and never seemed to sweat.''\n  Over the years, Jose Martinez has worked his way through the ranks. \nToday, he is the sous chef at Palio, where he is respected by everyone \nin the restaurant, from dishwashers to cooks, busboys to waiters, \nbartenders to managers.\n  Mr. Martinez has unique skills: he is an excellent chef; he is \nbilingual; he is a leader in the workplace. He is described as ``an \nexemplary employee'' who is not only ``good at his job, but is also a \ngreat boss to his subordinates.''\n  He and his wife, Micaela, have made a home in San Francisco. Micaela \nhas been working as a housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of \nwhom are United States citizens. Their oldest child Adilene, 20, is \nundocumented. Adilene recently graduated from the Immaculate Conception \nAcademy and is attending San Francisco City College.\n  One of the most compelling reasons for allowing the family to remain \nin the United States is that they are eligible for a green card. \nUnfortunately, there is such a back log for green cards right now that \neven though he has a work permit, owns a home in San Francisco, works \ntwo jobs, and has been in the United States for twenty years with a \nclean record, he and his family will be deported.\n  Mr. Martinez and his family have applied unsuccessfully for legal \nstatus several ways:\n  In May 2002, Mr. and Mrs. Martinez filed for political asylum. Their \ncase was denied and a subsequent application for a Cancellation of \nRemoval was also denied because the immigration court judge could not \nfind ``requisite hardship'' required for this relief.\n  Ironically, the immigration judge who reviewed their case found that \nMr. Martinez's culinary ability was a negative factor--as it indicated \nthat he could find a job in Mexico.\n  In 2001, his sister, who has legal status, petitioned for Mr. \nMartinez to get a green card. Unfortunately, because of the current \ngreen card backlog, Mr. Martinez has several years to wait before he is \neligible for a green card.\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\n  Finally, Daniel Scherotter, the executive chef and owner of Palio \nD'Asti, has petitioned for legal status for Mr. Martinez based on Mr. \nMartinez's unique skills as a chef. Although Mr. Martinez's work \npetition was approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nthere is a backlog on these visas, and Mr. Martinez is on a waiting \nlist for a green card through this channel, as well.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Martinez have no other administrative options available \nto them at this point and if deported, they will face a 5 to 10 year \nban from returning to the United States. In addition, this bill remains \nthe only means for Adilene to gain legal status.\n  The Martinez family has become an important and valued part of their \ncommunity. They are active members of their church, their children's \nschool, and Comite de Padres Unido, a grassroots immigrant organization \nin California.\n  They volunteer extensively--advocating for safe new parks in the \ncommunity for the children, volunteering at their children's school, \nand working on a voter registration campaign, even though they are \nunable to vote themselves.\n  In fact, I have received 46 letters of support from teachers, church \nmembers, and members of their community who attest to their honesty, \nresponsibility, and long-standing commitment to their community. Their \nsupporters include San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom; former Mayor \nWillie Brown; President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, \nAaron Peskin; and the Director of Immigration Policy at the Immigrant \nLegal Resource Center, Mark Silverman.\n  This family has truly embraced the American dream. I believe their \ncontinued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the \nvalues we hold dear. Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced \ntoday will enable the Martinez family to continue to make significant \ncontributions to their community as well as the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for the purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez shall each be \n     deemed to have been lawfully admitted to, and remained in, \n     the United States, and shall be eligible for adjustment of \n     status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence under section 245 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) upon filing an application \n     for such adjustment of status.\n       (b) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsection (a) shall \n     apply only if the application for adjustment of status is \n     filed with appropriate fees not later than 2 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting \n     of permanent resident status to Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez, the Secretary \n     of State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by 3, \n     during the current or subsequent fiscal year, the total \n     number of immigrant visas that are made available to natives \n     of the country of the birth of Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, \n     Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez under section \n     202(e) or 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1152(e) and 1153(a)), as applicable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 129. A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian, Asmik Karapetian, and \nArthur Mkoyan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Ruben Mkoian, his wife, Asmik Karapetian and \ntheir son, Arthur Mkoyan. The Mkoian family are Armenian nationals who \nhave been living and working in Fresno, California, for over a decade.\n  The story of the Mkoian family is compelling and I believe they merit \nCongress's special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Let me first start with how the Mkoian family arrived in the United \nStates. While in Armenia, Mr. Mkoian worked as a police sergeant in a \ndivision dealing with vehicle licensing. As a result of his position, \nhe was offered a bribe to register 20 stolen vehicles.\n  He refused the bribe and reported the incident to the police chief. \nHe later learned that his co-worker had registered the vehicles at the \nrequest of the chief.\n  After he reported the offense, Mr. Mkoian's supervisor informed him \nthat the department was to undergo an inspection. Mr. Mkoian was \ninstructed to take a vacation during this time period. Mr. Mkoian \nbelieved that the inspection was a result of the complaint that he had \nfiled with the higher authorities.\n  During the inspection, however, Mr. Mkoian worked at a store that he \nowned rather than taking a vacation. During that time, individuals kept \nentering his store and attempted to damage it and break merchandise. \nWhen he threatened to call the police, he received threatening phone \ncalls telling him to ``shut up'' or else he would ``regret it.'' Mr. \nMkoian believed that these threats were related to the illegal vehicle \nregistrations occurring in his department because he had nothing else \nto be silent about.\n  Later that same month, three men grabbed his wife and attempted to \nkidnap his child, Arthur, on the street. Mrs. Mkoian was told that her \nhusband should ``shut up.'' No one suffered any injuries from the \nincident. In October 1991, a bottle of gasoline was thrown into the \nMkoian's residence and their house was burned down. The final incident \noccurred on April 1, 1992, when four or five men assaulted Mr. Mkoian \nin his store. He was beaten and hospitalized for 22 days.\n  Following that experience, Mr. Mkoian left Armenia for Russia, and \nthen came to the United States on a visitor's visa in search of a \nbetter life. Two years later he brought his wife Asmik and his then 3-\nyear-old son Arthur to the United States, also on visitor's visas. The \nfamily applied for political asylum, but the 9th Circuit Court of \nAppeals denied their request in January 2008. Thus, the family has no \nfurther legal recourse by which to remain in the country other than \nthis bill.\n  Since arriving in the United States, the family has thrived. Arthur \nis now 18 years old and the family has expanded to include Arsen, who \nis a U.S. citizen.\n  Both Arthur and Arsen are very special children. In high school, \nArthur maintained a 4.0 grade point average and was a valedictorian for \nthe class of 2008. I first introduced this bill on his graduation day. \nToday, Arthur is a freshman at the University of California, Davis.\n  Arsen is following in his older brother's footsteps. At age 12, he \nstands out among his peers and is on the honor roll at Tenaya Middle \nSchool in Fresno.\n  In addition to raising two outstanding children, Mr. and Mrs. Mkoian \nhave maintained steady jobs and have devoted time and energy into the \ncommunity and their church. Mr. Mkoian is working at HB Medical \nTransportation, as a driver in Fresno.\n  His wife, Asmik, has two jobs as a medical receptionist with Dr. \nKumar in Fresno and as a sales clerk at Gottschalks Department Store. \nIn addition, she has taken classes at Fresno Community College and has \ncompleted their Medical Assistant Program.\n  The family are active members of the St. Paul Armenian Church, and \nMr. Mkoian is a member of the PTA of the St. Paul Armenian Saturday \nSchool.\n  There has been an outpouring of support for this family from their \nchurch, the schools their children attend, and the community at large.\n  To date, we have received over 200 letters of support for the family \nin addition to numerous telephone calls. I also note that I have \nletters from both Congressman George Radanovich and Jim Costa, \nrequesting that I offer this bill for the Mkoian family.\n  I truly believe that this case warrants our compassion and our \nextraordinary consideration.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. Mr. President, I \nask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\n                                 S. 129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and Jorge Rojas Gonzalez; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a private \nrelief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva \nGonzalez Gonzalez, and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas \nfamily members are Mexican nationals living in the San Jose area of \nCalifornia.\n  The story of the Rojas family is compelling, and I believe they merit \nCongress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of \nrelief as a private bill.\n  Mr. Rojas and his wife Ms. Gonzalez originally came to the United \nStates in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In \n1995, they left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered on \nvisitors' visas.\n  The family has since expanded to include a son, Alexis Rojas, now age \n16, and a daughter Tania Rojas, now age 14.\n  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated \nthemselves to community involvement, a strong work ethic and \nvolunteerism. They have been paying taxes since their arrival in 1990. \nThe family has been described by their friends and colleagues as a \n``model American family.'' I would like to tell you some more about \neach member of the Rojas family.\n  Mr. Rojas is a hard-working individual who has been employed by \nValley Crest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the \npast 14 years. Currently, Mr. Rojas works on commercial landscaping \nprojects. He is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.\n  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time \nand talents to provide modern green landscaping and a recreational \njungle gym to Sherman Oaks Community Charter School, where his two \nyoungest children attend school.\n  Ms. Gonzalez, in addition to raising her three children, has been \nvery active in the local community. She has worked to help other \nimmigrants assimilate to American life by working as a translator and a \ntutor for immigrant children at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School \nand the Y.M.C.A. Kids after-school program.\n  She has also coached soccer teams, and has recently directed a \nThanksgiving food drive. Ms. Gonzalez also devotes many hours of her \ntime to the organization People Acting in Community Together, PACT, \nwhere she works to prevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose \nneighborhoods and schools.\n  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family \nto remain in the United States is the impact their deportation would \nhave on their three children. Two of the children, Alexis and Tania, \nare U.S. citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has lived in the United States \nsince he was a toddler. For these children, this country is the only \ncountry they really know.\n  Jorge Rojas, Jr., who entered the United States as an infant with his \nparents, is now 20 and is currently working at Jamba Juice. He \ngraduated from Del Mar High School in 2007 and is currently taking \nclasses at San Jose City College.\n  Alexis and Tania are students at Sherman Oaks Community Charter \nSchool. They are described by their teachers as ``fantastic, wonderful, \nand gifted'' students. In fact, the principal at Sherman Oaks has \ndescribed all three of the children as ``honest, hard-working academic \nhonor students'' and have commended all of them for their on-campus \nleadership.\n  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American \ndream, and their continued presence in our country would do so much to \nenhance the values we hold dear. I have received 30 letters from the \ncommunity in support of this family. Enactment of the legislation I \nhave reintroduced today will enable the Rojas family to continue to \nmake significant contributions to their community as well as the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 130\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide for \nenhanced disclosure under an open end credit plan; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Credit Card \nMinimum Payment Notification Act.\n  This bill would help American consumers by requiring banks to notify \ncredit card holders of the true cost if\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nthey choose to make the minimum payment each month.\n  Americans today own more credit cards than ever before. The average \nAmerican has approximately four credit cards. In 2007, 1 in 7 Americans \nheld more than 10 cards.\n  Unsurprisingly, this increase in credit card ownership has resulted \nin a dramatic increase in credit card debt.\n  Over the past 2 decades, Americans' combined credit card debt has \nnearly tripled--from $238 billion in 1989 to a staggering $971 billion \nin 2008.\n  Today, the average American household has approximately $10,678 in \ncredit card debt, up 29 percent from 2000.\n  Among credit card users, 55 percent carry a balance on their credit \ncard, a 2 percent increase from last year.\n  Approximately 1 in 6 families with credit cards pays only the minimum \ndue every month.\n  Young Americans are using credit cards to finance everything from \ndaily expenses to college tuition. Forty-one percent of college \nstudents have a credit card, and, of those, only 65 percent pay their \nbills in full every month.\n  Over the past year, as economic conditions have worsened, it has \nbecome even harder for families to pay off their debt. Whether it is a \nmortgage, or tuition, or medical expenses, people are finding it harder \nthan ever to meet all of their expenses.\n  In July of this year, 28 percent of people surveyed reported that \ntheir ability to pay off their credit card balances has become more \nstrained.\n  This increasing debt is contributing to more and more Americans \nfiling for bankruptcy.\n  Ever since the Bankruptcy Reform Act was enacted in 2005, non-\nbusiness bankruptcies have been increasing at a rapid pace. The numbers \nthis year already show a staggering hike. Between September 2007 and \nSeptember 2008, Americans filed over one million non-business \nbankruptcies, up 30 percent from the previous year.\n  Many of these personal bankruptcies are people who are turning to \ncredit cards to finance their expenses. Today's filers have even more \ncredit card debt than usual--sometimes because they have been \nstruggling to pay a mortgage and have started using credit cards for \ndaily expenses.\n  One family, the Forsyths, found themselves in financial trouble after \nmoving to a new State for a better job opportunity. Unable to sell \ntheir old house, they rented. But when the renter stopped making \npayments, the family became overwhelmed with two mortgage payments. \nCredit cards helped at first--providing payment for food, utilities, \nand clothes--but the family quickly accumulated $20,000 in debt and was \nleft with no alternative other than bankruptcy.\n  The benefits offered by credit cards are attractive, but these cards \nalso pose enormous financial risk. Dianne McLeod discovered this in a \npainful way after back-to-back medical emergencies depleted her \nfinances. Although credit cards initially enabled her to maintain her \nlifestyle, before long these cards and two mortgages meant that she \nlater found that she was spending more than 40 percent of her monthly \nincome on interest payments, in addition to thousands of dollars \nannually in fees.\n  Today, credit cardholders receive no information on the impact of \ncarrying a balance with compounding interest. As a result, too often \nindividuals make only the minimum payment. After a few years, they find \nthat the interest on the debt is almost twice the amount of their \noriginal purchases--and they do not know what to do about it.\n  I first introduced the Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act \nduring the debate on the 2005 bankruptcy bill. As I said then, I \nbelieve the bill failed to balance responsibility and fairness. \nConsumers should not be so harshly penalized when they do not have the \nbasic tools and information they need to make informed choices.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act would help prevent \nthis problem by requiring credit card companies to add two items to \neach consumer's monthly credit card statement:\n  A general notice that would read ``Making only the minimum payment \nwill increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your \nbalance.''\n  An individualized notice to credit card holders that specifies \nclearly on their bill how much time it will take to repay their debt \nand the total amount they will pay if they only make the minimum \npayments.\n  For consumers with variable rate cards, the bill would also require \ncompanies to provide a toll-free number where cardholders can access \ncredit-counseling services.\n  The disclosure requirements in the bill would only apply if the \nconsumer has a minimum payment that is less than 10 percent of the debt \non the credit card. Otherwise, none of these disclosures would be \nrequired on their statement.\n  Last year, a Gallup--Experian poll found that about 11 percent of \ncredit cardholders consistently make only the minimum payment on their \ncards each month.\n  Consider what this could mean for the average household.\n  For example, the U.S. average credit card debt is $10,678. The \naverage fixed credit card interest rate is approximately 12 percent. If \nthe 2 percent minimum payment is all that is paid on its debt each \nmonth, it would take more than 31 years to pay off the bill and the \ntotal cost would be $21,052.66--and that's just the minimum assuming \nthat the family didn't ever charge another dime on that bill.\n  In other words, the family would need to pay $10,374.66 in interest \njust to repay $10,678 in original debt.\n  For individuals or families with more than average debt, the pitfalls \nare even greater. $20,000 of credit card debt at the average 12 percent \ninterest rate will take over 36 years and more than $28,261 to pay off \nif only the minimum payments are made.\n  Twelve percent is relatively low, average interest rate. Interest \nrates around 20 percent are not uncommon on credit cards, and penalty \ninterest rates can reach as high as 32 percent.\n  A family that has the average debt with a 20 percent interest rate \nand makes the minimum payments will need a lifetime--over 85 years--and \n$62,158 to pay off the initial $10,678 bill. That's $51,480 just in \ninterest--an amount that approaches 5 times the original debt.\n  Credit cards are an important part of everyday life, and they help \nthe economy operate more smoothly by giving consumers and merchants a \nreliable, convenient way to exchange funds. But the bottom line is that \nfor many consumers, the two percent minimum payment is a financial \ntrap.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act is designed to \nensure that people are not caught in this trap through lack of \ninformation.\n  Last month, the Federal Reserve Board approved new rules that will \nimprove disclosures, but the rules do not go far enough. Under the \nrules, starting July 1, 2010, credit card companies will have to warn \nconsumers about the effect of making minimum payments on the length of \ntime it will take to pay off their balances. But the warnings may be \nonly examples and will not show the effect on the amount that consumers \npay over time.\n  Before approving the final rules, the Federal Reserve Board \ninterviewed consumers who typically carried credit card balances. Those \nconsumers found disclosures most helpful when they provided specific \ninformation and included warnings about the amount that would have to \nbe paid over time.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act would provide the \nstraightforward disclosure that consumers find most helpful and most \neffective.\n  This disclosure will ensure that consumers know exactly what it means \nfor them to carry a balance and make minimum payments, so they can make \ninformed decisions on credit card use and repayment.\n  In addition, the burden on banks will be minimal. Calculations like \nthese are purely formulaic. Credit card companies already complete \nsimilar calculations to determine credit risk and when they tell \nconsumers what their required minimum payment is each month.\n  The harsh effects of the 2005 bankruptcy bill are becoming apparent. \nDuring the debate over that bill, I had hoped that Congress would \nsucceed in balancing the need to incentivize consumers to act \nresponsibly with the promise of a fresh start for those who fell \nimpossibly behind. I do not believe that that balance was reached.\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n  I continue to believe that consumers need a meaningful disclosure \ninforming them of the effects of making minimum payments.\n  Today, as Americans face increasing struggles with debt and expenses, \nthe bill is needed more than ever. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase and enhance law enforcement resources \ncommitted to investigation and prosecution of violent gangs, to deter \nand punish violent gang crime, to protect law-abiding citizens and \ncommunities from violent criminals, to revise and enhance criminal \npenalties for violent crimes, to expand and improve gang prevention \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Hatch, \nBayh, Kerry, Murray, Kyl, and Specter in introducing comprehensive \nanti-gang legislation--the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2009.\n  This bill has changed significantly since Senator Hatch and I began \nintroducing gang legislation over 10 years ago. The current version of \nthe bill reflects changes that have been made to comprehensively \naddress the gang problem, including provisions emphasizing prevention \nand intervention programs, as well as enforcement funding.\n  This bill recognizes that the root causes of gang violence need to be \naddressed--identifying successful community programs and then investing \nsignificant resources in schools and religious and community \norganizations to prevent young people from joining gangs in the first \nplace.\n  The bill constitutes a balanced approach to fighting the gang \nproblem, with authorization for hundreds of millions of dollars to be \nused for proven gang prevention and intervention programs, as well as \nstrong enforcement provisions.\n  The rise of criminal street gangs and the effect these gangs are \nhaving on our Nation are two of the fundamental issues facing us today. \nThis country is in the midst of an epidemic of gang violence that cuts \nacross every age and every race and plagues our cities, suburbs and \nrural areas. This violence often involves teens and children as both \nvictims and perpetrators.\n  Almost every day, gang violence is in the news across the country, \nwith gang-related killings of children and innocent bystanders almost \ntoo numerous to count. A person only needs to pick up a newspaper or \nwatch the evening news to see how gang violence is affecting our \ncommunities.\n  A snapshot of gang violence that occurred over a 4-day period in Los \nAngeles in March 2008 illustrates how insidious gangs have become.\n  On March 2, 2008, Jamiel Shaw, a 17-year-old high school football \nstar, was shot to death just three doors from his home in Mid-City Los \nAngeles as he rushed home to make curfew. Two gang members pulled up in \na car, asked if Jamiel was a gang member, and then shot him when he \ndidn't answer. Jamiel was not in a gang and was a model student and \nathlete who was being recruited by Stanford and Rutgers to play \ncollegiate football. His mother, a sergeant in the U.S. Army who was \nserving her second tour of duty in Iraq, had to return home to Los \nAngeles to bury her son.\n  On March 4, 2008, 6-year-old Lavarea Elvy was shot in the head in the \nHarbor Gateway area of South Los Angeles as she sat in the family car. \nA gang member and a gang associate of a Hispanic street gang have been \ncharged in this attempted murder.\n  On March 6, 2008, 13-year-old Anthony Escobar was killed while \npicking lemons in a neighbor's yard in the Echo Park area of Los \nAngeles. Anthony was not a gang member, and police believe he was \ntargeted by gang members who came to his neighborhood for no other \nreason than to kill someone.\n  Stories like these are not limited to California. They are becoming \ncommonplace across the country. Consider the following incidents of \ngang violence from across the country:\n  In February 2008, Julia Steele, an 80-year-old woman from St. Louis, \nMissouri, was killed when she was caught in the crossfire of gunfire \nbetween rival gang members. Julia's 80-year-old friend was also injured \nwhen their car slammed into other vehicles after the shooting.\n  Beginning in May 2008, police in Billings, Montana had to increase \nneighborhood patrols due to repeated drive-by shootings conducted by \ngang members.\n  In July 2008, a 7-year-old boy was wounded while playing kickball \nnear his suburban Roxbury, Massachusetts home. He was shot by an adult \ngang member from Boston, who police believe had traveled to the suburbs \nfor no other reason than to shoot someone.\n  In October 2008, Christopher Walker, a 16-year-old high school junior \nand member of the varsity basketball team, was shot and killed by a \ngang member near Henry Ford High School, his high school in Detroit, \nMichigan. According to media reports, Chris' death has sparked much \nanger in the community over growing gang violence in the area.\n  Across the country, in rural areas, suburbs, and cities, gang \nviolence is literally holding neighborhoods hostage and Congress needs \nto do something about it. Our national gang problem is immense and \ngrowing, and it is not going away.\n  On January 18, 2007, FBI Director Mueller acknowledged that gang \ncrime has become ``part of a clear national trend.'' FBI statistics \nshow that there are over 30,000 criminal street gangs operating in the \nUnited States, with more than one million gang members.\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\n  According to the FBI, gangs have an impact on at least 2,500 \ncommunities across the Nation. These criminal street gangs engage in \ndrug trafficking, robbery, extortion, gun trafficking, and murder. They \nrecruit children and teens, destroy neighborhoods, cripple families, \nand kill innocent people.\n  In California, the State Attorney General has estimated that there \nare 171,000 juveniles and adults committed to criminal street gangs and \ntheir way of life. That's greater than the population of 28 California \ncounties.\n  From 1992 to 2003, there were more than 7,500 gang-related homicides \nreported in California. In 2007, 469 of the 2,258 homicides in \nCalifornia were gang-related.\n  Los Angeles Police Department Chief Bill Bratton put it bluntly: \n``There is nothing more insidious than these gangs. They are worse than \nthe Mafia. Show me a year in New York where the Mafia indiscriminately \nkilled 300 people. You can't.''\n  It's not just a California problem or an issue limited to big cities. \nIn Chicago, the FBI estimates that there are over 60,000 gang members. \nA 2008 DOJ Report notes the rapid spread of gangs and violence to \nsuburban areas. FBI Director Mueller recently recognized the national \nscope of the gang problem when he said: ``Gangs are no longer limited \nto Los Angeles. Like a cancer, gangs are spreading to communities \nacross America.''\n  Our cities and States need our help--a long-term commitment to combat \ngang violence and a Federal helping hand to get our youth out of gangs \nand keep them from joining gangs in the first place.\n  Senator Hatch and I have now been introducing comprehensive Federal \ngang legislation for over a decade. Our gang bills have been modified \nand refined over the years, most recently in the bill that passed in \nthe Senate in the 110th Congress by unanimous consent.\n  The bill that we introduce today is a balanced and measured approach \nto dealing with the gang problem. It has no death penalty provisions, \nno mandatory minimums, and we have eliminated juvenile justice changes \nthat previously proved to be an impediment to the larger bill's \npassage.\n  The bill that we offer today provides a Federal helping hand to fight \nthe gang problem. It provides a comprehensive solution to gang \nviolence, combining enforcement, prevention, and intervention efforts \nin a collaborative approach that has proven effective in models like \nOperation Ceasefire.\n  The bill recognizes that the Federal Government can do more to fight \ngangs and that more tools must be made available to Federal law \nenforcement agents and prosecutors to stop the epidemic of gang \nviolence. To this end, the bill establishes new, common sense Federal \ngang crimes and tougher Federal penalties.\n  Existing Federal street gang laws are frankly weak, and are almost \nnever used. Currently, a person committing a gang crime might have \nextra time tacked on to the end of their Federal sentence. That is \nbecause Federal law currently focuses on gang violence only as a \nsentencing enhancement, rather than as a crime unto itself.\n  The bill that I offer today would make it a separate Federal crime \nfor any criminal street gang member to commit, conspire or attempt to \ncommit violent crimes--including murder, kidnapping, arson, extortion--\nin furtherance of the gang.\n  The penalties for gang members committing such crimes would increase \nconsiderably.\n  For gang-related murder, kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse or \nmaiming, the penalties would range up to life imprisonment.\n  For any other serious violent felony, the penalty would range up to \n30 years.\n  For other crimes of violence--defined as the actual or intended use \nof physical force against the person of another--the penalty could \nbring up to 20 years in prison.\n  The bill also creates a new crime for recruiting juveniles and adults \ninto a criminal street gang, with a penalty of up to 10 years, or if \nthe recruiting involved a juvenile or recruiting from prison, up to 20 \nyears.\n  It also creates new Federal crimes for committing violent crimes in \nconnection with drug trafficking, and increases existing penalties for \nviolent crimes in aid of racketeering.\n  Finally, the bill also makes a host of other violent crime reforms, \nincluding closing a loophole that allows carjackers to avoid \nconvictions, increasing the penalties for those who use guns in violent \ncrimes or transfer guns knowing they will be used in crimes, and \nlimiting bail for violent felons who possess firearms.\n  But the bill also recognizes that we cannot simply arrest our way out \nof the gang problem. It also focuses on prevention and intervention \nstrategies to prevent our youth from joining street gangs and to give \nexisting gang members a way out of that lifestyle.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize over $1 billion in new funds \nover the next 5 years to address the gang problem, including: $411.5 \nmillion to fund gang prevention and intervention programs, like \nOperation Ceasefire, a proven gang prevention and intervention program \nsuccessfully used in communities across the country; $187.5 million to \nestablish High Intensity Interstate Gang Activity Areas--Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement task forces to combat gangs and \nimplement prevention programs; $100 million to fund the DOJ's Project \nSafe Neighborhood Program, the Federal Government's primary anti-gang \ninitiative; $50 million for the Project Safe Streets Program, the FBI's \nprimary gang investigation tool; $100 million for more prosecutors, \ntechnology, and equipment for gang investigations; $270 million for \nState witness protection programs in gang cases.\n  This balanced approach--of prevention and intervention plus common \nsense enforcement--will send a clear message to gang members: a new day \nhas arrived and the Federal Government will no longer sit on the \nsidelines while gang violence engulfs the country.\n  This bill will provide gang members with new opportunities, with \nschools and social services agencies empowered to make alternatives to \ngangs a realistic option. But if gang members continue to engage in \nviolence, they will face new and serious Federal consequences.\n  For more than 10 years now, Senator Hatch and I have been trying to \npass Federal anti-gang legislation. There have been times when we have \ngotten close, including last session when the Senate passed this same \nbill. Unfortunately, while Congress as a whole has failed to act, \nviolent street gangs have only expanded nationwide and become more \nempowered and entrenched in other States and communities.\n  I believe this bill can again pass in the Senate and be enacted into \nlaw. The time has arrived for us to finally address this problem, and I \nbelieve this bill is well-suited to help solve it.\n  I urge my colleagues to favorably consider this legislation in the \n111th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) violent crime and drug trafficking are pervasive \n     problems at the national, State, and local level;\n       (2) according to recent Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     Uniform Crime Reports, violent crime in the United States is \n     on the rise, with a 2.3 percent increase in violent crime in \n     2005 (the largest increase in the United States in 15 years) \n     and an even larger 3.7 percent jump during the first 6 months \n     of 2006, and the Police Executive Research Forum reports \n     that, among jurisdictions providing information, homicides \n     are up 10.21 percent, robberies are up 12.27 percent, and \n     aggravated assaults with firearms are up 9.98 percent since \n     2004;\n       (3) these disturbing rises in violent crime are \n     attributable in part to the spread of criminal street gangs \n     and the willingness of gang members to commit acts of \n     violence and drug trafficking offenses;\n       (4) according to a recent National Drug Threat Assessment, \n     criminal street gangs are responsible for much of the retail \n     distribution of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and \n     other illegal drugs being distributed in rural and urban \n     communities throughout the United States;\n       (5) gangs commit acts of violence or drug offenses for \n     numerous motives, such as membership in or loyalty to the \n     gang, for protecting gang territory, and for profit;\n       (6) gang presence and intimidation, and the organized and \n     repetitive nature of the crimes that gangs and gang members \n     commit, has a pernicious effect on the free flow of \n     interstate commercial activities and directly affects the \n     freedom and security of communities plagued by gang activity, \n     diminishing the value of property, inhibiting the desire of \n     national and multinational corporations to transact business \n     in those communities, and in a variety of ways directly and \n     substantially affecting interstate and foreign commerce;\n       (7) gangs often recruit and utilize minors to engage in \n     acts of violence and other serious offenses out of a belief \n     that the criminal justice systems are more lenient on \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (8) gangs often intimidate and threaten witnesses to \n     prevent successful prosecutions;\n       (9) gangs prey upon and incorporate minors into their \n     ranks, exploiting the fact that adolescents have immature \n     decision-making capacity, therefore, gang activity and \n     recruitment can be reduced and deterred through increased \n     vigilance, appropriate criminal penalties, partnerships \n     between Federal and State and local law enforcement, and \n     proactive prevention and intervention efforts, particularly \n     targeted at juveniles and young adults, prior to and even \n     during gang involvement;\n       (10) State and local prosecutors and law enforcement \n     officers, in hearings before the Committee on the Judiciary \n     of the Senate and elsewhere, have enlisted the help of \n     Congress in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of \n     gang crimes and in the protection of witnesses and victims of \n     gang crimes; and\n       (11) because State and local prosecutors and law \n     enforcement have the expertise, experience, and connection to \n     the community that is needed to assist in combating gang \n     violence, consultation and coordination between Federal, \n     State, and local law enforcement and collaboration with other \n     community agencies is critical to the successful prosecutions \n     of criminal street gangs and reduction of gang problems.\n\n TITLE I--NEW FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAWS NEEDED TO FIGHT VIOLENT NATIONAL, \n  INTERNATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND LOCAL GANGS THAT AFFECT INTERSTATE AND \n                            FOREIGN COMMERCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to prohibit any recipient of emergency Federal \neconomic assistance from using such funds for lobbying expenditures or \npolitical contributions, to improve transparency, enhance \naccountability, encourage responsible corporate governance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nSnowe to introduce legislation that will increase transparency, \nstrengthen oversight, and require firms receiving financial lifelines \nfrom the Federal Government to practice responsible corporate \ngovernance.\n  Our bill--the Troubled Asset Relief Program Transparency Reporting \nAct--will achieve four essential objectives, prohibit firms receiving \nloans from the Federal Reserve or participating in the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, TARP, from using this money for lobbying expenditures \nor political contributions; require that firms receiving government \nassistance provide detailed, publicly available quarterly reports to \nTreasury outlining how taxpayer dollars have been used; establish \ncorporate governance standards to ensure that firms receiving Federal \nassistance do not waste money on unnecessary expenditures; and create \npenalties of at least $100,000 per violation for firms that fail to \nmeet the corporate governance standards established in the bill.\n  The need for such legislation has become very apparent in the 3 \nmonths since Congress approved the economic rescue plan.\n  The economic rescue legislation passed in October includes several \noversight boards and accountability provisions to ensure that public \nfunds are effectively distributed. But, it does not include any \nreporting requirements for firms that receive Federal dollars.\n  This is a significant omission, especially given the amount of \nFederal money that some firms are receiving.\n  The Treasury Department has committed to purchasing $250 billion of \npreferred stock in financial institutions. More than 200 financial \ninstitutions have received roughly $188 billion. Of these funds, $125 \nbillion was allocated to nine large national banks.\n  In addition to injecting capital into banks, American Insurance \nGroup, AIG, has received an additional $40 billion and CitiGroup has \nreceived $20 billion of TARP funds.\n  Last month, GM received more than $10 billion in financing through \nthe recently implemented Automotive Industry Financing Program.\n  This effectively means that the entirety of the first $350 billion of \nrescue funds has been spent.\n  When you add up all of the taxpayer dollars put on the line--from $30 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nprovided to Bear Stearns in March, $200 billion available to Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, $150 billion to AIG, $700 billion for TARP, plus the \ndirect lending programs at the Federal Reserve--we are talking about \nwell over 1 trillion Federal dollars.\n  I certainly don't think it is unreasonable for the public to know how \ntheir money is being spent, and I am not the only Member of Congress or \nelected official who feels this way.\n  In response to questions posed by the Congressional Oversight Panel \nfor Economic Stabilization, the Treasury Department noted that it was \ncommitted to rigorous oversight of executive compensation packages. \nThis may be the case, but executive compensation is only the beginning.\n  While I am pleased that CEOs at some financial institutions that \naccepted Federal assistance did not accept their annual bonuses last \nyear, we still do not have an official accounting of how Federal funds \nwere used.\n  Certainly Americans deserve assurances that struggling firms will not \nuse public funds to pay exorbitant salaries or bonuses.\n  The same can be said for these funds going towards dividend payments, \nor mergers and acquisitions.\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, has reported that the \nTreasury Department had no strong accountability or oversight function \nto ensure that banks were using rescue assistance with the best \ninterests of the public in mind.\n  It noted that Treasury had little ability to ensure that \nparticipating firms complied with laws already limiting executive \ncompensation and conflicts of interest.\n  An investigation last month by the Associated Press found that many \nbanks that have accepted Federal assistance are not able to say with \ncertainty exactly how they have used the money. Some of these banks \nwould not even discuss the issue.\n  We cannot be sure that the rescue funds are being used to stabilize \nthe economy if banks are not keeping proper accounting of their use, \nand those that do will not disclose it.\n  Shining light on how firms use public dollars not only makes good \nsense, but it will also act as a deterrent to irresponsible behavior.\n  On October 16, 2008, the Wall Street Journal reported that AIG, which \nreceived billions of dollars in Federal rescue funds, was continuing to \nlobby State regulators to delay implementation of strengthened \nlicensing standards for mortgage brokers and lenders.\n  AIG was lobbying against sensible standards created by the SAFE \nMortgage Licensing Act. This bill, introduced by Senator Martinez and \nmyself, established basic minimum regulations for the mortgage industry \nto ensure consumers were adequately protected.\n  Before this bill, in some States virtually anyone--even those with \ncriminal records--could go out and get a mortgage broker's license.\n  Left unchecked, and with no regulations to stop them, unscrupulous \nmortgage brokers and lenders flooded the markets with subprime loans \nthat they knew would never be paid back.\n  Of course, this has served as one of the catalysts for our current \neconomic predicament.\n  And now AIG, propped up by billions in Government money after having \nsuccumbed to bad investments, was lobbying against the strong \nenforcement of State laws that might have helped prevent this \ncatastrophe in the first place.\n  Senator Martinez and I wrote a letter to AIG and, to the company's \ncredit, CEO Edward Liddy immediately suspended the company's lobbying \noperations.\n  I find it completely unacceptable that taxpayer dollars intended to \nstabilize the economy could find their way into the bank accounts of \nlobbying firms. The legislation which I am reintroducing today will \nmake sure that does not happen.\n  I do not mean to pick on AIG, but they have also been the poster \nchild for wasteful spending by rescued firms.\n  In September 2008, just days after receiving an $85 billion Federal \nlifeline, the management of AIG treated itself to a $444,000 spa \nweekend at the St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach, California. This \nincluded $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for fine dining and $23,000 in \nspa charges.\n  AIG executives spent the last 2 days of September 2008 on a golf \nouting at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas at a cost of up to $500,000. They \nwere planning to follow this with a few days at the Ritz Carlton in \nHalf Moon Bay, but cancelled after it hit the news and drew fire from \ncongressional leaders.\n  As news of these wasteful expenditures was making headlines, AIG \nreceived another $37.8 billion in emergency loans from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Shortly thereafter, the Associated Press reported that--even as AIG \nwas asking Congress for these loans--AIG executives were spending \n$86,000 on a pheasant hunting expedition in England. During the trip, \nthey stayed at a 17th century manor.\n  One AIG executive named Sebastian Preil was quoted as saying that: \n``The recession will go on until about 2011, but the shooting was great \ntoday and we are relaxing fine.''\n  Once these lapses in judgment came to light, AIG chief executive \nEdward Liddy informed Congress that he was putting an end to all \nnonessential expenditures. Yet weeks later, an undercover news crew \ncaught AIG executives at the Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix, \nhosting a seminar for financial planners complete with cocktails and \nlimousines.\n  One would think that a brush with collapse and total failure might \nhave a sobering effect on some of these firms.\n  But this penchant for wasteful junkets in the face of complete \nfailure was not unique to AIG.\n  Following enactment of TARP, news reports have uncovered multiple \ninstances in which rescued firms have been caught making unnecessary \nand outrageous expenditures, leading many taxpayers to question why \nthese firms are receiving Federal assistance in the first place.\n  In November, Treasury Secretary Paulson announced that the $700 \nbillion approved by Congress to stabilize financial markets would not \nbe used to purchase illiquid assets but rather to make direct capital \ninjections into financial institutions.\n  Given this new mission, the need for additional transparency and \ndisclosure is striking.\n  We have learned that we cannot necessarily count on these firms and \ntheir executives to act sensibly and do what is right.\n  The public needs to know that their tax dollars are being put to good \nuse.\n  A simple ``trust me'' from the bank executives is not enough.\n  Americans are struggling, and the pain in my State of California, \nwhere unemployment is 8.4 percent, and foreclosure filings exceeded \n750,000 last year, is especially acute.\n  This bill puts in place commonsense solutions to fix some of the \ndeficiencies in the economic stabilization bill.\n  This legislation is significant and sorely needed.\n  We must act soon to help restore confidence in this effort and shed \nlight on how public funds are used. We promised the American people \ntransparency and oversight, and this legislation will make good on that \npromise.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me to ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nspent efficiently and responsibly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 138. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nalternative minimum tax limitations on private activity bond interest, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I are introduce \nlegislation to exempt private activity bond interest from the \nalternative minimum tax, AMT. My colleague from Massachusetts, \nRepresentative Richard Neal has introduced similar legislation. Under \ncurrent law, interest paid on private activity bonds is subject to the \nalternative minimum tax. This results in the bonds not being very \nmarketable in these difficult economic times.\n  Making private activity bonds no longer subject to the AMT would help \nwith the issuance of bonds. This legislation would assist in needed \nrelief to State and local governments across the Nation. It would \nprovide more buyers to the market, resulting in interest savings for \nissuers, and ultimately taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\n  Subjecting private activity bond interest to the AMT could cost an \nissuer 25 to 30 more basis points when issuing an AMT bond compared to \na non-AMT bond. However, the recent freezing of the municipal credit \nmarket has led the difference to rise as much as 100 basis points. This \nresults in increased costs for various infrastructure projects \nincluding airports, docks and other transportation-related facilities; \nwater, sewer and other utility facilities; and solid and hazardous \nwaste disposal facilities.\n  Last Congress, I worked on a provision to exempt the interest from \nprivate activity housing bonds from the AMT and this provision was \nincluded in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The \nlegislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing builds on this \nprovision by exempting interest from all private activity bonds from \nthe AMT.\n  I believe this legislation will help spur the economy and create \njobs. This legislation will provide better funding options for \nessential infrastructure projects and create jobs across the country. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 139. A bill to require Federal agencies, and persons engaged in \ninterstate commerce, in possession of data containing sensitive \npersonally identifiable information, to disclose any breach of such \ninformation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Data Breach \nNotification Act.\n  This is a commonsense bill that is aimed at protecting personal \ninformation and preventing identity theft. The bill would require \nbusinesses and government agencies to notify individuals when their \nsensitive personal information has been exposed in a data breach.\n  As many of you know, I have been urging the Senate to adopt this \nlegislation since 2003, when California first imposed a State \nnotification requirement.\n  That legislation has helped consumers in my State. Federal data \nbreach law would provide uniformity and protect consumers throughout \nthe country.\n  With every year that passes, the evidence in support of this \nlegislation has only continued to mount.\n  The cost of identity theft is enormous--estimated at more than $50 \nbillion per year. Some of the costs fall on businesses and banks, which \nsuffer losses from fraudulent transactions. Some of the costs are also \nborne by consumers, whose finances and credit ratings are disrupted.\n  Since the beginning of 2005, over 240 million data records containing \nindividuals' sensitive personal data have been exposed in data \nbreaches.\n  It seems that not a week goes by without news of another security \nbreach that exposes names, addresses, birth dates, social security \nnumbers, or other personal data.\n  These breaches have spawned a vast online market in stolen \nidentities. Today, each person whose identity is sold on the internet \nfaces a high risk of becoming a victim of identity theft. Each of them \nfaces the expensive and time-consuming nightmare of trying to restore \ntheir finances and credit ratings.\n  According to a report by the Identity Theft Resource Center, the news \nmedia reported more than 620 breaches involving personal information \nduring 2008. That works out to about one data security breach every 14 \nhours--and those are just the ones that are big enough to be covered in \nthe media.\n  Recent reports of security breaches involving sensitive personal data \npoint out the extent of the problem.\n  In December 2008, during a website development project at the Florida \nAgency for Workforce Innovation, the Social Security numbers of more \nthan a quarter of a million people were accidentally posted online.\n  In August of last year, an employee working weekends at Countrywide \ncopied customer records from an office computer and then sold the \npersonal information of an estimated 2,000,000 mortgage applicants.\n  In May of 2007, a breach at the Transportation Security \nAdministration made the names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, \npayroll information, and bank account information of more than 100,000 \nformer employees vulnerable to theft or sale.\n  In January of that same year, hackers accessed information held by \nTJX stores, including more than 45 million credit card numbers and more \nthan 455,000 merchandise records containing customers' drivers license \nnumbers.\n  In May of 2006, there was a breach at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs that involved the names, birth dates, and Social Security \nnumbers of every veteran discharged from the military since 1975--more \nthan 28 million veterans--every veteran discharged from the military \nsince 1975.\n  Another disturbing example took place last year at the State \nDepartment when the passport files of Senator Clinton, Senator McCain, \nand Senator Obama--the three leading presidential contenders at the \ntime--were accessed by contractors working for the Department. Though \nthe Department knew about the breaches right away, several months \npassed before our colleagues were told about the problem.\n  Unfortunately, this delay is not surprising--because there is \ncurrently nothing to require a Federal agency to tell us when a \nsecurity breach affects our personal data.\n  That needs to change. That's what my bill does.\n  Specifically, this legislation requires the Federal Government and \nprivate businesses to notify individuals when there has been a security \nbreach involving their sensitive personal data; ensures that the notice \nis provided without unreasonable delay; creates very limited exceptions \nto notification for national security and law enforcement purposes, and \nwhen law enforcement certifies that there is there is no significant \nrisk of harm to the individual; establishes penalties against those who \ndo not provide the required notice. The provisions of the bill would be \nenforced by the Federal and State attorneys general; and pre-empts \nState laws so that there is a single, nationwide notification \nrequirement.\n  Data security breaches have real consequences. For one thing, they \nare bad for business because they lead to a loss of confidence--\nespecially in online commerce. A 2005 survey for Consumer Reports \nshowed that 25 percent of Internet users stopped shopping online \nbecause of fears about identity theft. Of people who still shopped \nonline, 29 percent said that they had cut back on how often they buy \nproducts on the Internet.\n  Data breaches also pose serious harms for consumers. A November 2007 \nreport from the Federal Trade Commission revealed that identity theft \nvictims spent as much as $5,000 of their own money--and as many as \n1,200 hours of their time--recovering from the harm to their finances \ncaused by identity theft.\n  While not all data breaches lead to identity theft, the cost of \nstolen identities is so enormous that we should be doing everything we \ncan to solve this problem.\n  The situation requires action. While Congress has been slow to act, \nthe States have not. In the almost 6 years since the California law \ntook effect, 43 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the \nVirgin Islands have passed similar laws.\n  A report issued by the Federal Trade Commission in December 2008 \nnoted that these State data breach notification laws have had several \nindirect benefits; many businesses across the country have strengthened \ntheir safeguard practices in order to avoid data breaches.\n  By forcing companies to consider the potential cost and liability \nthat may ensue if information is compromised in a data breach, these \nlaws have the indirect benefit of motivating companies to reassess \ntheir need to collect personally identifiable information in the first \nplace.\n  The same benefits would flow from Federal legislation. Additionally, \nthe Data Breach Notification Act would improve the law by creating a \nsingle, uniform national standard.\n  A September 2008 report issued by the President's Identity Theft Task \nForce again emphasized the need for a unified Federal standard to \nreplace the patchwork of varied state laws currently in place. The \nDecember 2008 FTC report made the same point.\n  A Federal bill will simplify the process of compliance and \nnotification for\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\nbusinesses, while ensuring that all consumers get the information they \nneed as soon as possible when breaches happen.\n  We have already waited too long. The Judiciary Committee endorsed \nthis bill unanimously during the last Congress. The epidemic of data \nbreaches in our nation continues unabated. This is a common-sense bill \nthat we should take action on now.\n  I urge the Senate to pass the Data Breach Notification Act to give \nAmericans the information they need to protect themselves from identity \ntheft.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the requirements applicable to locatable \nminerals on public domain lands, consistent with the principles of \nself-initiation of mining claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help address the threats to public health and safety caused \nby abandoned hardrock mines.\n  There are as many as 500,000 abandoned mines strewn across the \nwestern states--47,000 alone are found on California's public lands.\n  The scope of this problem is huge.\n  In the past two years, eight accidents at abandoned mine sites were \nreported in California. Throughout the United States, at least 37 \ndeaths occurred between 1999 and 2007 and the potential for more is \nominous.\n  Basic remediation efforts, such as warning signs and fencing, can \nprovide protection.\n  However, some abandoned mines pose a more serious threat. \nEnvironmental impact studies have shown that important watersheds are \nbeing polluted by high levels of harmful minerals, such as mercury, \nlead, arsenic and asbestos. In California alone, seventeen watersheds \nhave been affected.\n  Yet not enough is being done to clean up these dangerous Gold Rush-\nera mines.\n  The bill that I am introducing today is not intended to be a \ncomprehensive hardrock mining bill, but it is an important piece of the \nreform needed.\n  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2009 will reform the 1872 \nMining Law by establishing fees to support abandoned mine clean up; \nestablishing a royalty payment system; and creating an Abandoned Mine \nClean up Fund.\n  Unlike the coal industry, the metal mining industry does not pay to \nclean up its legacy of abandoned mines, making lack of funding the \nprimary obstacle to abandoned hardrock mine clean up.\n  This legislation would help fund the clean up of abandoned mines by \nplacing an Abandoned Mine Reclamation fee on all hardrock minerals, \nusing the underground coal industry fee program as a model. \nSpecifically, it would create a 0.3 percent reclamation fee on the \ngross value of all hardrock mineral mining, including mining on \nFederal, State, tribal, local and private lands.\n  The condition of abandoned coal mines has greatly improved since the \nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established a fee to \nfinance restoration of land abandoned or inadequately restored by coal \nmining companies.\n  This fund has been able to raise billions of dollars for coal mine \nreclamation--and I believe that a similar program could be part of the \nsolution to hardrock abandoned mine clean up.\n  This legislation establishes a royalty fee on Hardrock Mining Claims.\n  Companies that mine for gold and silver on Federal lands are not \ncurrently required to pay any royalties to the Federal Government--even \nthough we are experiencing near record high gold prices.\n  These companies should be required to pay their fair share.\n  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act establishes an 8 percent royalty \non new mining operations located on Federal lands, and a 4 percent \nroyalty for existing operations.\n  The legislation I am introducing today also creates an Abandoned Mine \nFund.\n  In these times of budget deficits, it's clear that we will not be \nable to simply appropriate the funds necessary to clean up the hundreds \nof thousands of abandoned hard rock mines.\n  So, this legislation will create an abandoned mine clean up fund to \nensure that we have a lasting source of funding for this critical clean \nup effort.\n  Specifically, the fund will direct the royalties, as well as other \npayments collected from mining operations, and dedicate them to the \nclean up of abandoned hardrock mines.\n  I recognize the important role that mining has played in California's \nhistory. The discovery of gold at Sutter Mill near Placerville, \nCalifornia in 1848 was a defining moment for my State and the U.S.\n  It is fair to say that without mining and the Gold Rush, California \nand the entire country would be a far different place than it is today.\n  The history of mining in California, however, is tarnished by the \nlegacy of tens of thousands of abandoned mines. In particular, \nabandoned mine sites on Federal lands.\n  A recent report from the Department of the Interior's Inspector \nGeneral underscores the scope and the urgency of\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nthe abandoned mine problem on public lands--in particular, those \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.\n  The report concluded that public health and safety have been \ncompromised by mismanagement, funding shortfalls and systematic \nneglect.\n  The report found the potential for more deaths and injuries is \nominous. A number of abandoned mine sites on public lands present an \nimmediate danger due to open shafts, collapsing mine walls, and rotting \nstructures. Some have deadly gases that accumulate in underground \npassages. And others leach hazardous chemicals like arsenic, lead and \nmercury into groundwater.\n   The Bureau of Land Management's abandoned mines program has been \nneglected and understaffed. In some cases, staff were told by their \nsupervisors to ignore these problems; and those who did come forward to \nidentify contaminated sites were criticized or outright threatened.\n  The scope of the problem is less severe at the National Parks \nService. But perennial funding shortfalls impede the clean up of known \nabandoned mines.\n  At the heart of the problem is a century-old law signed by President \nUlysses S. Grant to promote the settlement of publicly-owned lands in \nthe western states.\n  The 1872 Mining Law created national standards for hardrock mining \noperations on Federal public lands; however, it has not been \nsubstantially updated for 137 years. Under this outdated framework, the \nhardrock mining industry does not pay royalties for minerals taken from \nFederal land and is not obligated to share in the cost of clean up for \nabandoned mines. Since the enactment of this law, hundreds of thousands \nof mines have been abandoned.\n  Congress needs to move swiftly to address this issue before more \ndamage and accidents occur.\n  Though this legislation is a significant step forward for the funding \nof abandoned mines, I know that there is much more mining reform to be \ndone.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to modernize our \nNation's mining laws and accelerate the clean up of dangerous abandoned \nmines.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 140\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of Social Security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nto protect one of Americans' most valuable but vulnerable assets: \nSocial Security numbers.\n  The bill I am introducing today aims to protect individual privacy \nand prevent identity theft by eliminating the unnecessary use and \ndisplay of Social Security numbers.\n  I have been working since the 106th Congress to safeguard Social \nSecurity numbers. I believe that the widespread display and use of \nthese numbers poses a significant, and entirely preventable threat to \npersonal privacy.\n  In 1935, Congress authorized the Social Security Administration to \nissue Social Security numbers as part of the Social Security program. \nSince that time, Social Security numbers have become the best-known and \neasiest way to identify individuals in the United States.\n  Use of these numbers has expanded well beyond their original purpose. \nSocial Security numbers are now used for everything from credit checks \nto rental agreements to employment verifications, among other purposes. \nThey can be found in privately held databases and on public records--\nincluding marriage licenses, professional certifications, and countless \nother public documents--many of which are available on the Internet.\n  Once accessed, the numbers act like keys--allowing thieves to open \ncredit card and bank accounts and even begin applying for government \nbenefits.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, as many as 10 million \nAmericans have their identities stolen by\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\nsuch thieves each year--at a combined cost of billions of dollars.\n  What's worse, victims often do not realize that a theft has occurred \nuntil much later, when they learn that their credit has been destroyed \nby unpaid debt on fraudulently opened accounts.\n  One thief stole a retired Army captain's military identification card \nand used his Social Security number, listed on the card, to go on a 6-\nmonth, $260,000 shopping spree. By the time the Army captain realized \nwhat had happened, the thief had opened more than 60 fraudulent \naccounts.\n  A single mother of two went to file her taxes and learned that a \nfraudulent return had already been filed in her name by someone else--a \nthief who wanted her refund check.\n  A former pro-football player received a phone call notifying him that \na $1 million home mortgage loan had been approved in his name even \nthough he had never applied for such a loan.\n  Identity theft is serious. Once an individual's identity is stolen, \npeople are often subjected to countless hours and costs attempting to \nregain their good name and credit. In 2004, victims spent an average of \n300 hours recovering from the crime. The crime disrupts lives and can \ndestroy finances.\n  It also hurts business. A 2006 online survey by the Business Software \nAlliance and Harris Interactive found that nearly 30 percent of adults \ndecided to shop online less or not at all during the holiday season \nbecause of fears about identity theft.\n  When people's identities are stolen, they often do not know how the \nthieves obtained their personal information. Social security numbers \nand other key identifying data are displayed and used in such a \nwidespread manner that individuals could not successfully restrict \naccess themselves.\n  Comprehensive limitations on the display of Social Security numbers \nare critically needed.\n  The U.S. Government Accountability Office conducted studies of this \nproblem in 2002 and 2007. Both times--in studies entitled ``Social \nSecurity numbers Are Widely Used by Government and Could Be Better \nProtected'' and ``Social Security numbers: Use Is Widespread and Could \nBe Improved''--the GAO concluded that current protections are \ninsufficient and that serious vulnerabilities remain.\n  The Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act would \nrequire government agencies and businesses to do more to protect \nAmericans' Social Security numbers. The bill would stop the sale or \ndisplay of a person's Social Security number without his or her express \nconsent; prevent Federal, State and local governments from displaying \nSocial Security numbers on public records posted on the Internet; \nprohibit the printing of Social Security numbers on government checks; \nprohibit the employing of inmates for tasks that give them access to \nthe Social Security numbers of other individuals; limit the \ncircumstances in which businesses could ask a customer for his or her \nSocial Security number; commission a study by the Attorney General \nregarding the current uses of Social Security numbers and the impact on \nprivacy and data security; and institute criminal and civil penalties \nfor misuse of Social Security numbers.\n  This legislation is simple. It is also critical to stopping the \ngrowing epidemic of identity theft that has been plaguing America and \nits citizens.\n  As the President's Identity Theft Task Force reported last year, \n``[i]dentity theft depends on access to . . . data. Reducing the \nopportunities for thieves to get the data is critical to fighting the \ncrime.''\n  Every agency to study this problem has agreed that the problem will \ncontinue to grow over time and that action is needed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting the Privacy of Social \nSecurity Numbers Act. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of Social \n     Security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used Social Security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that Social \n     Security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     Social Security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of Social Security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of Social Security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a Social Security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto ensure that every uninsured child in America has health insurance \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  MR. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Kids Come First \nAct, legislation to ensure every child in America has access to health \ncare coverage. The Kids Come First Act is the first bill I am \nintroducing in the 111th Congress because I believe that insuring all \nchildren must be at the top of the agenda this Congress.\n  Long-term health care reform is vital, but we must also do all that \nwe can now to make sure our children have access to health care. That \nis why I have incorporated the Small Business Children's Health \nEducation Act as part of Kids First this Congress.\n  The 111th Congress faces many challenges, from the economic situation \nat home to the continuing conflicts in the Middle East. But perhaps no \nissue bears more directly on the lives of more Americans than health \ncare reform. Today, nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, \nincluding 11 million children. Health care has become a slow-motion \ndisaster that is ruining lives and bankrupting families all over the \ncountry. We cannot stand by as the ranks of the uninsured rise and \nAmerican families find themselves in peril.\n  Children from low income households are three times as likely to be \nuninsured and more than 60 percent of uninsured children have at least \none parent working full time. As we continue to face uncertain economic \ntimes we must do more for the children of this country who lack health \ncoverage. Too many families are struggling with how to make ends meet. \nThis is the time to take one worry off their plate and make health \ninsurance available for all children.\n  The Kids Come First Act calls for a Federal-State partnership to \nmandate health coverage to every child in America. The proposal makes \nstates an offer they can't refuse. The Federal Government will pay for \nthe most expensive part: enrolling all low-income children in Medicaid, \nautomatically. In return, the States will pay to expand coverage to \nhigher income children. Under this legislation, States will save more \nthan $6 billion a year, and every child will have access to healthcare.\n  I think it is unacceptable that in the greatest country in the world, \nmillions of children are denied access to the health care they need. \nThe Kids Come First Act expands health care coverage for children up to \nthe age of 21. Through expanding the programs that work, such as \nMedicaid and SCHIP, we can cover every uninsured child.\n  Insuring children improves their health and helps families cover the \nspiraling costs of medical care. Covering all kids will help reduce \navoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent and replace expensive critical \ncare with inexpensive preventative care. Also, when children get the \nmedical attention they need, they do better in school.\n  To pay for the expansion of health insurance for children, the Kids \nCome First Act includes a provision that provides the Secretary of \nTreasury with the authority to raise the highest income tax rate of 35 \npercent to a rate not higher than 39.6 percent in order to offset the \ncosts. Prior to the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, the top marginal rate was 39.6 percent. \nLess than one percent of taxpayers pay the top rate and for 2009, this \nrate only affects individuals with income above $372,950.\n  In addition to expanding access to health insurance, we need to \nimprove enrollment of eligible children. In February 2007, the Urban \nInstitute reported that among those eligible for the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, children whose families are self-employed or \nwho work for small business concerns are far less likely to be \nenrolled. Specifically, one out of every four eligible children with \nparents working for a small business or are self-employed are not \ncurrently enrolled. This compares with just 1 out of every 10 eligible \nchildren whose parents work for a large firm.\n  We need to do a better job of informing and educating America's small \nbusiness owners and employees of the options that may be available for \ncovering uninsured children. To that effect, the Kids Come First Act \nincludes a provision that creates an intergovernmental task force, \nconsisting of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor and \nthe Secretary of Treasury, to conduct a campaign to enroll kids of \nsmall business employees who are eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid but \nare not currently enrolled. To educate America's small businesses on \nthe availability of SCHIP and Medicaid, the task force will make use of \nthe Small Business Administration's business partners, including the \nService Corps of Retired Executives, the Small Business Development \nCenters, Certified Development Companies, and Women's Business Centers, \nand with chambers of commerce across the country.\n  Additionally, the Small Business Administration is directed to post \nSCHIP and Medicaid eligibility criteria and enrollment information on \nits website, and to report back to the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business regarding the status and successes of the task force's \nefforts to enroll eligible kids.\n  Health care for our children is a top priority that we must address. \nI believe it can be done in a fiscally responsible manner. We must \ninvest our resources in our future by improving health care for \nchildren.\n  Since I first introduced the Kids Come First Act in the 109th \nCongress, more than 500,000 people have shown their support for the \nbill by becoming Citizen Cosponsors and another 20,000 Americans called \ninto our ``Give Voices to Our Values'' hotline to share their personal \nstories.\n  It is clear that providing health care coverage for our uninsured \nchildren is a priority for our nation's workers, businesses, and health \ncare community. They know, as I do, that further delay only results in \ngraver health problems for America's children. Their future, and ours, \ndepends on us doing better. I urge my colleagues to support and help \nenact the Kids Come First Act during this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 143. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a college opportunity tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the College \nOpportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009. This legislation creates a new tax \ncredit that\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\nwill put the cost of higher education in reach for American families.\n  According to a recent College Board report tuition is rising at both \npublic and private institutions. On average, the tuition at a private \ncollege this year is $25,143, up 5.9 percent from last year, and the \ntuition at a public college $6,585, up 6.4 percent from last year.\n  Unfortunately, neither student aid funds nor family incomes are \nkeeping pace with increasing tuition and fees. In my travels around \nMassachusetts, I frequently hear from parents concerned they will not \nbe able to pay for their children's college. These parents know that \nearning a college education will result in greater earnings for their \nchildren and they desperately want to ensure their kids have the \ngreatest opportunities possible.\n  In 1997, the Congress implemented two new tax credits to make college \naffordable--the HOPE and the Lifetime Learning credits. These tax \ncredits have put college in reach for families, but I believe we can do \nmore.\n  The HOPE and Lifetime Learning credits are not refundable, and \ntherefore a family of four must have an income over $30,000 in order to \nreceive the maximum credit. Almost half of families with college \nstudents fail to receive the full credit because their income is too \nlow. In order to receive the full benefit of the Lifetime Learning \ncredit, a student has to spend $10,000 a year on tuition and fees. This \nis more than $3,000 the average annual public 4-year college tuition \nmore than three times the average annual tuition of a 2-year community \ncollege. About 56 percent of college students attend schools with \ntuition and fees under $9,000.\n  In 2004, I proposed a refundable tax credit to help pay for the cost \nof 4 years of college. Currently the HOPE credit applies only to the \nfirst 2 years of college. The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of \n2009 helps students and parents afford all four years of college. It \nalso builds on the proposal I made in 2004 by incorporating some of the \nsuggestions made by experts at a Finance Committee hearing held during \nthe 109th Congress. My legislation creates a new credit, the College \nOpportunity Tax Credit, COTC, that replaces the existing HOPE credit \nand Lifetime Learning credit and ultimately makes these benefits more \ngenerous.\n  The COTC has two components. The first provides a refundable tax \ncredit for a student enrolled in a degree program at least on a half-\ntime basis. It would provide a 100 percent tax credit for the first \n$2,000 of eligible expenses and a 50 percent tax credit for the next \n$4,000 of expenses. The maximum credit would be $4,000 each year per \nstudent. The second provides a nonrefundable tax credit for part-time \nstudents, graduate students, and other students that do not qualify for \nthe refundable tax credit. It provides a 40 percent credit for the \nfirst $1,000 of eligible expenses and a 20 percent credit for the next \n$3,000 of expenses.\n  Both of these credits can be used for expenses associated with \ntuition and fees. The same income limits that apply to the HOPE credit \nand the Lifetime Learning credit apply to the COTC. These amounts are \nindexed for inflation, as are the eligible amounts of expenses. This \nlegislation is only for taxable years beginning in 2009 and 2010 in \norder to make colleges affordable during these difficult financial \ntimes. It will also give the Congress additional time to work on a \npermanent solution to help with the rising cost of a college education.\n  The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2009 simplifies the \nexisting credits that make higher education more affordable and will \nenable more students to be eligible for tax relief. I understand that \nmany of my colleagues are interested in making college more affordable. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to make a refundable tax \ncredit for college education a reality this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 144. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to remove \ncell phones from listed property under section 280F; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I are \nreintroducing the MOBILE Cell Phone Act of 2009, Modernize Our \nBookkeeping in the Law for Employee's Cell Phone Act of 2009. Last \nCongress, 60 Senators cosponsored this legislation which would update \nthe tax treatment of cell phones and mobile communication devices.\n  During the past 20 years, the use of cell phone and mobile \ncommunication devices has skyrocketed. Cell phones are no longer viewed \nas an executive perk or a luxury item. They no longer resemble \nsuitcases or are hardwired to the floor of an automobile. Cell phone \nand mobile communication devices are now part of daily business \npractices at all levels.\n  In 1989, Congress passed a law which added cell phones to the \ndefinition of listed property under section 280F(d)(4) of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986. Treating cell phones as listed property requires \nsubstantial documentation in order for cell phones to benefit from \naccelerated depreciation and not be treated as taxable income to the \nemployee. This documentation is required to substantiate that the cell \nphone is used for business purposes more than 50 percent of the time. \nGenerally, listed property is property that inherently lends itself to \npersonal use, such as automobiles.\n  Back in 1989, cell phone technology was an expensive technology \nworthy of detailed log sheets. At that time, it was difficult to \nenvision cell phones that could be placed in a pocket or handbag. \nCongress was skeptical about the daily business use of cell phones.\n  Technological advances have revolutionized the cell phone and mobile \ncommunication device industries. Twenty years ago, no one could have \nimagined the role BlackBerries play in our day-to-day communications. \nCell phones and mobile communication devices are now widespread \nthroughout all types of businesses. Employers provide their employees \nwith these devices to enable them to remain connected 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week. The cost of the devices has been reduced and most \nproviders offer unlimited airtime for one monthly rate.\n  Recently, the Internal Revenue Service reminded field examiners of \nthe substantiation rules for cell phones as listed property. The \ncurrent rule requires employers to maintain expensive and detailed \nlogs, and employers caught without cell phone logs could face tax \npenalties.\n  The MOBILE Cell Phone Act of 2009 updates the tax treatment of cell \nphones and mobile communication devices by repealing the requirement \nthat employers maintain detailed logs. The tax code should keep pace \nwith technological advances. There is no longer a reason that cell \nphones and mobile communication devices should be treated differently \nthan office phones or computers. Last, Congress 60 Senators cosponsored \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nchange.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Feingold, \n        Mr. Schumer, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 146. A bill to amend the Federal antitrust laws to provide \nexpanded coverage and to eliminate exemptions from such laws that are \ncontrary to the public interest with respect to railroads; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nessential to restoring competition to the nation's crucial freight \nrailroad sector. Freight railroads are essential to shipping a myriad \nof vital goods, everything from coal used to generate electricity to \ngrain used for basic foodstuffs. But for decades the freight railroads \nhave been insulated from the normal rules of competition followed by \nalmost all other parts of our economy by an outmoded and unwarranted \nantitrust exemption. So today I am introducing along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Vitter, Leahy, Feingold, Schumer, Rockefeller, \nDorgan and Klobuchar, the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2009. \nThis legislation will eliminate the obsolete antitrust exemptions that \nprotect freight railroads from competition. This legislation is \nidentical to the legislation that was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the last Congress without dissent.\n  Our legislation will eliminate obsolete antitrust exemptions that \nprotect\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\nfreight railroads from competition and result in higher prices to \nmillions of consumers every day. Consolidation in the railroad industry \nin recent years has resulted in only four Class I railroads providing \nover 90 percent of the nation's freight rail transportation. The lack \nof competition was documented in an October 2006 Government \nAccountability Office report. That report found that shippers in many \ngeographic areas ``may be paying excessive rates due to a lack of \ncompetition in these markets.'' These unjustified cost increases cause \nconsumers to suffer higher electricity bills because a utility must pay \nfor the high cost of transporting coal, result in higher prices for \ngoods produced by manufacturers who rely on railroads to transport raw \nmaterials, and reduce earnings for American farmers who ship their \nproducts by rail and raise food prices paid by consumers.\n  The ill-effects of this consolidation are exemplified in the case of \n``captive shippers''--industries served by only one railroad. Over the \npast several years, these captive shippers have faced spiking rail \nrates. They are the victims of the monopolistic practices and price \ngouging by the single railroad that serves them, price increases which \nthey are forced to pass along into the price of their products, and \nultimately, to consumers. And in many cases, the ordinary protections \nof antitrust law are unavailable to these captive shippers--instead, \nthe railroads are protected by a series of outmoded exemptions from the \nnormal rules of antitrust law to which all other industries must abide. \nIn August 2006, the Attorneys General of 17 states and the District of \nColumbia sent a letter to Congress citing problems due to a lack of \ncompetition and asked that the antitrust exemptions be removed.\n  These unwarranted antitrust exemptions have put the American consumer \nat risk, and in Wisconsin, victims of a lack of railroad competition \nabound. A coalition has formed, consisting of about 40 affected \norganizations--Badger CURE. From Dairyland Power Cooperative in La \nCrosse to Wolf River Lumber in New London, companies in my state are \nfeeling the crunch of years of railroad consolidation. To help offset a \n93 percent increase in shipping rates in 2006, Dairyland Power \nCooperative had to raise electricity rates by 20 percent. The \nreliability, efficiency, and affordability of freight rail have all \ndeclined, and Wisconsin consumers feel the pinch.\n  Similar stories exist across the country. We held a hearing at the \nAntitrust Subcommittee in September 2007 which detailed numerous \ninstances of anti-competitive conduct by the dominant freight railroads \nand at which railroad shippers testified as to the need to repeal the \noutmoded and unwarranted antitrust exemptions which left them without \nremedies. Dozens of organizations, unions and trade groups--including \nthe American Public Power Association, the American Chemistry Council, \nAmerican Corn Growers Associations and many more affected by \nmonopolistic railroad conduct endorsed the Railroad Antitrust \nEnforcement Act in the last Congress.\n  The current antitrust exemptions protect a wide range of railroad \nindustry conduct from scrutiny by governmental antitrust enforcers. \nRailroad mergers and acquisitions are exempt from antitrust law and are \nreviewed solely by the Surface Transportation Board. Railroads that \nengage in collective ratemaking are also exempt from antitrust law. \nRailroads subject to the regulation of the Surface Transportation Board \nare also exempt from private antitrust lawsuits seeking the termination \nof anticompetitive practices via injunctive relief. Our bill will \neliminate these exemptions.\n  No good reason exists for them. While railroad legislation in recent \ndecades--including most notably the Staggers Rail Act of 1980--\nderegulated much railroad rate setting from the oversight of the \nSurface Transportation Board, these obsolete antitrust exemptions \nremained in place, insulating a consolidating industry from obeying the \nrules of fair competition. And there is no reason to treat railroads \nany differently from dozens of other regulated industries in our \neconomy that are fully subject to antitrust law--whether the \ntelecommunications sector regulated by the FCC, or the aviation \nindustry regulation by the Department of Transportation, to name just \ntwo examples.\n  Our bill will bring railroad mergers and acquisitions under the \npurview of the Clayton Act, allowing the Federal government, state \nattorneys general and private parties to file suit to enjoin \nanticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. It will restore the review of \nthese mergers to the agencies where they belong--the Justice \nDepartment's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission. It \nwill eliminate the exemption that prevents FTC's scrutiny of railroad \ncommon carriers. It will eliminate the antitrust exemption for railroad \ncollective ratemaking. It will allow state attorneys general and other \nprivate parties to sue railroads for treble damages and injunctive \nrelief for violations of the antitrust laws, including collusion that \nleads to excessive and unreasonable rates. This legislation will force \nrailroads to play by the rules of free competition like all other \nbusinesses.\n  In sum, by clearing out this thicket of outmoded antitrust \nexemptions, railroads will be subject to the same laws as the rest of \nthe economy. Government antitrust enforcers will finally have the tools \nto prevent anti-competitive transactions and practices by railroads. \nLikewise, private parties will be able to utilize the antitrust laws to \ndeter anti-competitive conduct and to seek redress for their injuries.\n  It is time to put an end to the abusive practices of the Nation's \nfreight railroads. On the Antitrust Subcommittee, we have seen that in \nindustry after industry, vigorous application of our Nation's antitrust \nlaws is the best way to eliminate barriers to competition, to end \nmonopolistic behavior, to keep prices low and quality of service high. \nThe railroad industry is no different. All those who rely on railroads \nto ship their products--whether it is an electric utility for its coal, \na farmer to ship grain, or a factory to acquire its raw materials or \nship out its finished product--deserve the full application of the \nantitrust laws to end the anti-competitive abuses all too prevalent in \nthis industry today. I urge my colleagues support the Railroad \nAntitrust Enforcement Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to thank the senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin for his hard work to address antitrust issues in the \nrail industry along with other industries as Chairman of the Antitrust, \nCompetition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I have been pleased to support his efforts to bring \nantitrust scrutiny to the large freight railroads since he first \nintroduced a version of this legislation in 2006. As Senator Kohl well \nknows, this is a vitally important issue for rail customers and \nultimately consumers both in Wisconsin and across the country.\n  Over the past several years, I have heard more and more comments and \nconcerns from freight rail customers at my town hall meetings in \nWisconsin and my meetings in Washington. The concerns have come from \nconstituents who rely on freight railroads to transport their goods or \nreceive raw materials. The comments I have heard have been diverse by \nindustry, ranging from forestry, energy, farming, and petrochemical \ncompanies to various manufacturers, and by size, from family owned \nenterprises to large corporations. The problems they have described do \nnot seem to be isolated incidents, but instead suggest a systematic \ncontinuing problem.\n  There are several general concerns that seem to apply no matter which \nclass of railroad is discussed. While outright refusals of transport \nmay be rare, several of my constituents have found it difficult to get \ntimely estimates of costs for carriage for their cargo. This seems to \nespecially be a problem for short distances or small loads, or if the \ncargo is only on the originating railroads' tracks for a short \ndistance. Many have said that they feel like second-class citizens, \ndenied the better service and dedicated trains that the long-haul \nreceive.\n  I have also heard about problems with changes to transportation \nschedules, and problems with rail car delivery and ancillary services \nsuch as scales. Many rail customers seem to feel that as railroads \ncontinued to merge over the past two decades, service, especially for \nsmall customers, has declined dramatically. Again, this seems to \nespecially affect small railroad customers who are dependant on rail \ntransport, but face difficulty in receiving cars to fill, moving filled \ncars in a timely manner or weighing their loads.\n  Of course cost is also an issue, but it is not just the cost of \ntransportation. Some rail customers feel that the Surface \nTransportation Board, STB, complaint process is too costly, slow and \ntilted in favor of the railroads over the customers. They contend that \nthese hurdles to exposing anticompetitive practices have the effect of \nperpetuating the unfair treatment and excessive rates they experience.\n  Senator Kohl's proposal would remove the current railroad antitrust \nexemptions so that railroads would be covered like other segments of \nindustry. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission \nwould then have the authority to review mergers and block anti-\ncompetitive mergers. The legislation would also expand the ability of \nState Attorneys General and private parties to halt anti-competitive \nbehavior and seek up to treble damages for any such violations.\n  I believe this is a very reasonable and measured proposal as \nevidenced by the bill being passed out of the Judiciary Committee in \nthe previous Congress by voice vote. I look forward to supporting \nSenator Kohl's efforts to move the legislation through committee again \nand push for its passage into law during the current Congress.\n  While I hope that providing the Department of Justice the authority \nto review possible antitrust violations as proposed in the current bill \nwill improve the situation for many shippers, it may have to go hand-\nin-hand with reforms at the STB as were contemplated in the previous \nCongress by Senator Rockefeller's Railroad Competition and Service \nImprovements Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Wyden, and \n        Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 147.

Today, I am introducing the Lawful Interrogation and \nDetention Act of 2009--legislation intended to reverse the harmful, \ndangerous, un-American, and illegal detention and interrogation \npractices of the past seven years.\n  As I will describe in detail below, the four provisions in this bill \nwould: Close the Guantanamo Bay detention centers, outlaw CIA's \ncoercive interrogation program, prevent the use of contractor \ninterrogations, and end secret detention at CIA black sites.\n  These practices have brought shame to our nation, have harmed our \nability to fight the war on terror, and, I believe, violate U.S. law \nand international treaty obligations.\n  As was made crystal clear on last November 4, we need change and we \nneed a new direction. When it comes to the war on terrorism, we need to \ndisavow ``the Dark Side'' so embraced by the Bush administration. \nInstead, we need to follow our approach honed through the Cold War: \nstanding by the strength of our values and ideals, building strong \npartnerships with allies, and mixing soft power with the force of our \nmilitary might.\n  This legislation would put us back on the right track and I believe \nit to be fully consistent with the policies and intentions of \nPresident-elect Obama.\n  It is time to end the failed experiment at Guantanamo Bay. It is time \nto repudiate torture and secret disappearances. It is time to end the \noutsourcing of coercive interrogations to outside mercenaries. It is \ntime to return to the norms and values that have driven the United \nStates to greatness since the days of George Washington, but have been \ntarnished in the past 7 years.\n  First, this legislation requires the President to close the detention \nfacilities at Guantanamo Bay within 12 months.\n  The need to close Guantanamo is clear. Along with the abuses at Abu \nGhraib, Guantanamo has been decried as American hypocrisy and cruelty \nthroughout the world. They have given aid in recruiting to our enemies, \nand have been named by Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora as the leading \ncauses of death to U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  Numerous reports, most recently one completed and approved \nunanimously by the Senate Armed Services Committee, have documented the \nabusive methods used at Guantanamo.\n  Beyond the physical, psychological, and emotional abuse witnessed at \nGuantanamo, it has been the source of great legal embarrassment. The \nSupreme Court has struck down the Bush administration's legal reasoning \nfour separate times: in the Rasul, Hamdi, Hamdan, and Boumediene \ndecisions.\n  It was explicitly created to be a separate and lesser system of \njustice, to hold people captured on or near the battlefield in \nAfghanistan indefinitely. It has produced exactly three convictions, \nincluding Australian David Hicks who agreed to a plea bargain to get \noff the island, and Osama bin Ladin's driver, Salim Hamdan, who has \nalready served almost all of his sentence through time already spent at \nGuantanamo.\n  The hard part about closing Guantanamo is not deciding to do it--it \nis figuring out what to do with the remaining detainees.\n  Under the Lawful Interrogation and Detention Act, the approximately \n250 individuals now being held there would be handled in one of five \nways:\n  They could be charged with a crime and tried in the United States in \nthe Federal civilian or military justice systems. These systems have \nhandled terrorists and other dangerous individuals before, and are \ncapable of dealing with classified evidence and other unusual factors.\n  Individuals could be transferred to an international tribunal to hold \nhearings, if such a tribunal is created; detainees could be returned to \ntheir native countries, or if that is not possible, they could be \ntransferred to a third country.\n  To date, more than 500 men have been sent from Guantanamo to the \ncustody other countries. Recently, Portugal and other nations have \nsuggested they would be open to taking some of the remaining detainees \nas a way to help close Guantanamo.\n  If there are detainees who can't be charged with crimes or \ntransferred to the custody of another country, there is a fourth \noption. If the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \nIntelligence agree that an individual poses no security threat to the \nUnited States, the U.S. Government may release him.\n  This may work, for example, for the Chinese Uighurs remaining at \nGuantanamo. In fact, a Federal court has already ordered that this \ngroup be released into the country, though that ruling has been stayed \nupon appeal.\n  Finally, for detainees who cannot be addressed in any of the first \nfour options, the Executive Branch could hold them under the existing \nauthorities provided by the law of armed conflict.\n  I believe that these options provide sufficient flexibility to handle \nthe 250 or so people now being held at Guantanamo. If the incoming \nObama Administration decides that other alternatives are needed, it \nshould come to Congress, explain the specifics of the problem, and we \nwill work toward a joint legislative solution.\n  The other three provisions in this legislation end parts of the CIA's \nsecret detention and interrogation program.\n  Some of the details of the program are already publicly known, like \nthe use of waterboarding on three individuals. Other aspects remain \nsecret, such as the other authorized interrogation techniques and how \nthey were used.\n  There have been public allegations of multiple deaths of detainees in \nCIA custody. There was one conviction of a CIA contractor in the death \nof a detainee in Afghanistan, but other details remain classified.\n  But it is well known that on August 1, 2002, the Justice Department \napproved coercive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, \nfor the CIA's use. This despite the fact that the Justice Department \nhas prosecuted the use of waterboarding and the State Department has \ndecried it overseas.\n  The Administration used warped logic and faulty reasoning to say \nwaterboarding technique was not torture. It is.\n  Other interrogation techniques used by the CIA have not been \nacknowledged but are still authorized for use. This has to end.\n  But we will never turn this sad page in our nation's history until \nall coercive techniques are banned, and are replaced with a single, \nclear, uniform standard across the United States Government.\n  That standard established by this legislation is the interrogation \nprotocols set out in the Army Field Manual. The 19 specified techniques \nwork for the military and operate under the same framework as the time-\nhonored approach of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. If the CIA \nwould abide by its terms, it would work for the CIA as well.\n  These techniques were at the heart of former FBI Special Agent Jack \nCloonan's successful interrogation of those responsible for the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing. They were also the tools used by Special \nAgent George Piro to get Saddam Hussein to provide the evidence that \nresulted in his death sentence.\n  We have powerful expert testimony that the Army Field Manual \ntechniques work against terrorist suspects. The Manual's use across the \ngovernment is supported by scores of retired generals and admirals, by \nGeneral David Petraeus, and by former secretaries of state and national \nsecurity advisors in both parties.\n  Majorities in both houses of Congress passed this provision last year \nas part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill, \nsending a clear message that we do not support coercive interrogations.\n  Regrettably, the President's veto stopped it from becoming law.\n  The new President agrees that we need to end coercive interrogations \nand to comply strictly to the terms of the Convention Against Torture \nand the Geneva Conventions. I look forward to working with him to end \nthis sad story in the Nation's history.\n  The third part of this legislation is a ban on contractor \ninterrogators at the CIA. As General Hayden has testified, the CIA \nhires and keeps on contract people who are not intelligence \nprofessionals and whose sole job is to ``break'' detainees and get them \nto talk.\n\n[[Page S133]]\n\n  I firmly believe that outsourcing interrogations, whether coercive or \nmore appropriate ones, to private companies is a way to diminish \naccountability and to avoid getting the Agency's hands dirty. I also \nbelieve that the use of contractors leads to more brutal interrogations \nthan if they were done by government employees.\n  There are surely areas where paying contractors makes practical and \nfinancial sense. Interrogations--a form of collecting intelligence--is \nnot one of them. This has become a major diplomatic issue, a key \nobstacle in prosecuting people like Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Shaykh \nMohammed, and a national black eye. It is not the sort of thing to be \ndone at arm's length.\n  The fourth and final provision in this legislation requires that the \nCIA and other intelligence agencies provide notification to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross--the ICRC--of their detainees. \nFollowing notification, the CIA will be required to provide ICRC \nofficials with access to their detainees in the same way that the \nmilitary does.\n  Access by the ICRC is a hallmark of international law and is required \nby the Geneva Conventions. Access to a third party, and the ICRC in \nparticular, was seen by the U.S. in 1947 as a guarantee that American \nmen and women would be protected if they were ever captured overseas.\n  But ICRC access has been denied at CIA black sites, just like it had \nbeen in some military-run facilities in the war on terror. This has, in \npart, opened the door to the abuses in detainee treatment. Independent \naccess prevents abuses like we witnessed at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo \nBay. It is time that the same protection is in place for the CIA as has \nbeen demanded of the Department of Defense.\n  We remain a nation at war, and credible, actionable intelligence \nremains a cornerstone of our war effort. But this is a war that will be \nwon by fighting smarter, not by sinking to the depths of our enemies.\n  Our Nation has paid an enormous price because of these \ninterrogations.\n  They cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our system of justice.\n  Our enemies have used our practices to recruit more extremists.\n  Our key global partnerships, crucial to winning the war on terror, \nhave been strained.\n  It will take time to resume our place as the world's beacon of \nliberty and justice. This bill will put us on that path and start the \nprocess. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore the rule that agreements between \nmanufacturers and retailers, distributors, or wholesalers to set the \nminimum price below which the manufacturer's product or service cannot \nbe sold violates the Sherman Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nessential to consumers receiving the best prices on every product from \nelectronics to clothing to groceries. My bill, the Discount Pricing \nConsumer Protection Act, will restore the nearly century old rule that \nit is illegal under antitrust law for a manufacturer to set a minimum \nprice below which a retailer cannot sell the manufacturer's product, a \npractice known as ``resale price maintenance'' or ``vertical price \nfixing''. In June 2007, overturning a 96-year-old precedent, a narrow \n5-4 Supreme Court majority in the Leegin case incorrectly interpreted \nthe Sherman Act to overturn this basic rule of the marketplace which \nhas served consumers well for nearly a century. My bill--identical to \nlegislation I introduced in 2007 (S. 2261 in the 110th Congress)--will \ncorrect this misinterpretation of antitrust law and restore the per se \nban on vertical price fixing. Our bill has been endorsed by 34 state \nattorneys general as well as numerous antitrust experts, including \nformer FTC Chairman Pitofsky and current FTC Commissioner Harbour.\n  The reasons for this legislation are compelling. Allowing \nmanufacturers to set minimum retail prices will threaten the very \nexistence of discounting and discount stores, and lead to higher prices \nfor consumers. For nearly a century the rule against vertical price \nfixing permitted discounters to sell goods\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nat the most competitive price. Many credit this rule with the rise of \ntoday's low price, discount retail giants--stores like Target, Best \nBuy, Walmart, and the Internet sites Amazon and EBay, which offer \nconsumers a wide array of highly desired products at discount prices.\n  From my own personal experience in business I know of the dangers of \npermitting vertical price fixing. My family started the Kohl's \ndepartment stores in 1962, and I worked there for many years before we \nsold the stores in the 1980s. On several occasions, we lost lines of \nmerchandise because we tried to sell at prices lower than what the \nmanufacturer and our rival retailers wanted. For example, when we \nstarted Kohl's and were just a small competitor to the established \nretail giants, we had serious difficulties obtaining the leading brand \nname jeans. The traditional department stores demanded that the \nmanufacturer not sell to us unless we would agree to maintain a certain \nminimum price. Because they didn't want to lose the business of their \nbiggest customers, that jeans manufacturer acquiesced in the demands of \nthe department stores--at least until our lawyers told them that they \nwere violating the rule against vertical price fixing.\n  So I know firsthand the dangers to competition and discounting of \npermitting the practice of vertical price fixing. But we don't need to \nrely on my own experience. For nearly 40 years until 1975 when Congress \npassed the Consumer Goods Pricing Act, Federal law permitted States to \nenact so-called ``fair trade'' laws legalizing vertical price fixing. \nStudies Department of Justice conducted in the late 1960s indicated \nthat prices were between 18-27 percent higher in the States that \nallowed vertical price fixing than the States that had not passed such \n``fair trade'' laws, costing consumers at least $ 2.1 billion per year \nat that time.\n  Given the tremendous economic growth in the intervening decades, the \nlikely harm to consumers if vertical price fixing were permitted is \neven grater today. In his dissenting opinion in the Leegin case, \nJustice Breyer estimated that if only 10 percent of manufacturers \nengaged in vertical price fixing, the volume of commerce affected today \nwould be $ 300 billion, translating into retail bills that would \naverage $ 750 to $ 1,000 higher for the average family of four every \nyear.\n  And the experience of the last year and a half since the Leegin \ndecision is beginning to confirm our fears regarding the dangers from \npermitting vertical price fixing. In December 2008, for example, Sony \nannounced that it would implement a no-discount rule to retailer's \nselling some of its most in-demand products, including some models of \nhigh-end flat screen TVs and digital cameras. On December 4, 2008, the \nWall Street Journal reported that a new business has materialized for \ncompanies that scour the Internet in search of retailers selling \nproducts at a bargain. When such bargain sellers are detected, the \nmanufacturer is alerted so that they can demand the seller end the \ndiscounting of its product. The chilling effect on discounting of such \ntactics is clear--in one example, the Wall Street Journal reported that \nCircuit City was forced to raise its retail price for an LG flat screen \nTV by $ 170 to nearly $ 1,600 after its discount price was discovered \non the Internet.\n  Defenders of the Leegin decision argue that today's giant retailers \nsuch as Walmart, Best Buy or Target can ``take care of themselves'' and \nhave sufficient market power to fight manufacturer efforts to impose \nretail prices. Whatever the merits of that argument, I am particularly \nworried about the effect of this new rule permitting minimum vertical \nprice fixing on the next generation of discount retailers. If new \ndiscount retailers can be prevented from selling products at a discount \nat the behest of an established retailer worried about the competition, \nwe will imperil an essential element of retail competition so \nbeneficial to consumers.\n  In overturning the per se ban on vertical price fixing, the Supreme \nCourt in Leegin announced this practice should instead be evaluated \nunder what is known as the ``rule of reason.'' Under the rule of \nreason, a business practice is illegal only if it imposes an \n``unreasonable'' restraint on competition. The burden is on the party \nchallenging the practice to prove in court that the anti-competitive \neffects of the practice outweigh its justifications. In the words of \nthe Supreme Court, the party challenging the practice must establish \nthe restraint's ``history, nature and effect.'' Whether the businesses \ninvolved possess market power ``is a further, significant \nconsideration'' under the rule of reason.\n  In short, establishing that any specific example of vertical price \nfixing violates the rule of reason is an onerous and difficult burden \nfor a plaintiff in an antitrust case. Parties complaining about \nvertical price fixing are likely to be small discount stores with \nlimited resources to engage in lengthy and complicated antitrust \nlitigation. These plaintiffs are unlikely to possess the facts \nnecessary to make the extensive showing necessary to prove a case under \nthe ``rule of reason.'' In the words of FTC Commissioner Pamela Jones \nHarbour, applying the rule of reason to vertical price fixing ``is a \nvirtual euphemism for per se legality.''\n  In July 2007, our Antitrust Subcommittee conducted an extensive \nhearing into the Leegin decision and the likely effects of abolishing \nthe ban on vertical price fixing. Both former FTC Chairman Robert \nPitofsky and current FTC Commissioner Harbour strongly endorsed \nrestoring the ban on vertical price fixing. Marcy Syms, CEO of the Syms \ndiscount clothing stores, did so as well, citing the likely dangers to \nthe ability of discounters such as Syms to survive after abolition of \nthe rule against vertical price fixing. Ms. Syms also stated that ``it \nwould be very unlikely for her to bring an antitrust suit'' challenging \nvertical price fixing under the rule of reason because her company \n``would not have the resources, knowledge or a strong enough position \nin the marketplace to make such action prudent.'' Our examination of \nthis issue has produced compelling evidence for the continued necessity \nof a ban on vertical price fixing to protect discounting and low prices \nfor consumers.\n  The Discount Pricing Consumer Protection Act will accomplish this \ngoal. My legislation is quite simple and direct. It would simply add \none sentence to Section 1 of the Sherman Act--the basic provision \naddressing combinations in restraint of trade--a statement that any \nagreement with a retailer, wholesaler or distributor setting a price \nbelow which a product or service cannot be sold violates the law. No \nbalancing or protracted legal proceedings will be necessary. Should a \nmanufacturer enter into such an agreement it will unquestionably \nviolate antitrust law. The uncertainty and legal impediments to \nantitrust enforcement of vertical price fixing will be replaced by \nsimple and clear legal rule--a legal rule that will promote low prices \nand discount competition to the benefit of consumers every day.\n  In the last few decades, millions of consumers have benefited from an \nexplosion of retail competition from new large discounters in virtually \nevery product, from clothing to electronics to groceries, in both ``big \nbox'' stores and on the Internet. Our legislation will correct the \nSupreme Court's abrupt change to antitrust law, and will ensure that \ntoday's vibrant competitive retail marketplace and the savings gained \nby American consumers from discounting will not be jeopardized by the \nabolition of the ban on vertical price fixing. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Discount Pricing Consumer \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1911 in the Dr. Miles decision until June 2007 in \n     the Leegin decision, the Supreme Court had ruled that the \n     Sherman Act forbid in all circumstances the practice of a \n     manufacturer setting a minimum price below which any \n     retailer, wholesaler or distributor could not sell the \n     manufacturer's product (the practice of ``resale price \n     maintenance'' or ``vertical price fixing'').\n\n[[Page S135]]\n\n       (2) The rule of per se illegality forbidding resale price \n     maintenance promoted price competition and the practice of \n     discounting all to the substantial benefit of consumers and \n     the health of the economy.\n       (3) Many economic studies showed that the rule against \n     resale price maintenance led to lower prices and promoted \n     consumer welfare.\n       (4) Abandoning the rule against resale price maintenance \n     will likely lead to higher prices paid by consumers and \n     substantially harms the ability of discount retail stores to \n     compete. For 40 years prior to 1975, Federal law permitted \n     states to enact so-called ``fair trade'' laws allowing \n     vertical price fixing. Studies conducted by the Department of \n     Justice in the late 1960s indicated that retail prices were \n     between 18 and 27 percent higher in states that allowed \n     vertical price fixing than those that did not. Likewise, a \n     1983 study by the Bureau of Economics of the Federal Trade \n     Commission found that, in most cases, resale price \n     maintenance increased the prices of products sold.\n       (5) The 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court majority in \n     Leegin incorrectly interpreted the Sherman Act and improperly \n     disregarded 96 years of antitrust law precedent in \n     overturning the per se rule against resale price maintenance.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to correct the Supreme Court's mistaken interpretation \n     of the Sherman Act in the Leegin decision; and\n       (2) to restore the rule that agreements between \n     manufacturers and retailers, distributors or wholesalers to \n     set the minimum price below which the manufacturer's product \n     or service cannot be sold violates the Sherman Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON VERTICAL PRICE FIXING.\n\n       (a) Amendment to the Sherman Act.--Section 1 of the Sherman \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1) is amended by adding after the first \n     sentence the following: ``Any contract, combination, \n     conspiracy or agreement setting a minimum price below which a \n     product or service cannot be sold by a retailer, wholesaler, \n     or distributor shall violate this Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 149. A bill to change the date for regularly scheduled Federal \nelections and establish polling place hours; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Weekend Voting \nAct. This legislation will change the day for Congressional and \nPresidential elections from the first Tuesday in November to the first \nweekend in November. This legislation is nearly identical to \nlegislation that I first proposed in 1997.\n  We have recently completed the most serious business of our \ndemocracy--a Presidential election in which millions and millions of \ncitizens demonstrated an enormous amount of enthusiasm. We all want \nevery eligible voter to participate and cast a vote. But recent \nexperience has shown us that unneeded obstacles are placed preventing \ncitizens from exercising their franchise. The debacle of defective \nballots and voting methods in Florida in the 2000 election galvanized \nCongress into passing major election reform legislation. The Help \nAmerica Vote Act, which was enacted into law in 2002, was an important \nstep forward in establishing minimum standards for States in the \nadministration of Federal elections and in providing funds to replace \noutdated voting systems and improve election administration. However, \nthere is much that still needs to be done.\n  With more and more voters seeking to cast their ballots on Election \nDay, we need to build on the movement which already exists to make it \neasier for Americans to cast their ballots by providing alternatives to \nvoting on just one election day. Twenty-eight States, including my own \nState of Wisconsin, now permit any registered voter to vote by absentee \nballot. These states constitute nearly half of the voting age citizens \nof the United States. Thirty-one States permit in-person early voting \nat election offices or at other satellite locations. The State of \nOregon now conducts statewide elections completely by mail. These \ninnovations are critical if we are to conduct fair elections for it has \nbecome unreasonable to expect that a Nation of 300 million people can \nline up at the same time and cast their ballots at the same time. If we \ncontinue to try to do so, we will encounter even more reports of broken \nmachines and long lines in the rain and registration errors that create \nbarriers to voting.\n  That is why I have been a long-time advocate of moving our Federal \nelection day from the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November \nto the first weekend in November. Holding our Federal elections on a \nweekend will create more opportunities for voters to cast their ballots \nand will help end the gridlock at the polling places which threaten to \nundermine our elections.\n  Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time from 10 a.m. Saturday eastern time to 6 p.m. Sunday eastern \ntime. Polls in all time zones would in the 48 contiguous states also \nopen and close at this time. Election officials would be permitted to \nclose polls during the overnight hours if they determine it would be \ninefficient to keep them open. Because the polls would be open on both \nSaturday and Sunday, they also would not interfere with religious \nobservances.\n  Keeping polls open the same hours across the continental United \nStates, also addresses the challenge of keeping results on one side of \nthe country, or even a state, from influencing voting in places where \npolls are still open. Moving elections to the weekend will expand the \npool of buildings available for polling stations and people available \nto work at the polls, addressing the critical shortage of poll workers.\n  Most important, weekend voting has the potential to increase voter \nturnout by giving all voters ample opportunity to get to the polls \nwithout creating a national holiday. There is already evidence that \nholding elections on a non-working day can increase voter turnout. In \none survey of 44 democracies, 29 held elections on holidays or weekends \nand in all these cases voter turnout surpassed our country's voter \nparticipation rates.\n  In 2001, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform \nrecommended that we move our Federal election day to a national \nholiday, in particular Veterans Day. As expected, the proposal was not \nwell received among veterans and I do not endorse such a move, but I \nshare the Commission's goal of moving election day to a non-working \nday.\n  Since the mid 19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land \nowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. We have outgrown our Tuesday \nvoting day tradition, a tradition better left behind to a bygone horse \nand buggy era. In today's America, 60 percent of all households have \ntwo working adults. Since most polls in the United States are open only \n12 hours on a Tuesday, generally from 7 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m., voters \noften have only one or two hours to vote. As we've seen in recent \nelections, long lines in many polling places have kept some voters \nwaiting much longer than one or two hours. If voters have children, and \nare dropping them off at day care, or if they have a long work commute, \nthere is just not enough time in a workday to vote.\n  With long lines and chaotic polling places becoming the unacceptable \nnorm in many communities, we have an obligation to reform how our \nNation votes. If we are to grant all Americans an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the electoral process, and to elect our representatives \nin this great democracy, then we must be willing to reexamine all \naspects of voting in America. Changing our election day to a weekend \nmay seem like a change of great magnitude. Given the stakes--the \nintegrity of future elections and full participation by as many \nAmericans as possible--I hope my colleagues will recognize it as a \ncommonsense proposal whose time has come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide Federal assistance to States for rural law \nenforcement and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Rural \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Act of 2009, a bill designed to help rural \ncommunities deal with growing crime problems that threaten to become \nsignificantly worse as a result of the devastating economic crisis we \nface.\n  Congress and the new administration are beginning this session \nfocused on passing a stimulus bill that will provide hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to restart our economy, create jobs, and reverse \nthe economic downturn inherited from the Bush administration. The Bush \nadministration has already provided hundreds of billions of dollars to \nrescue the financial industry, and President Bush released billions \nmore for assistance to the auto industry. Despite our legislative \nefforts to protect jobs and the economy as a whole, little has been \ndone to help the millions of people in rural America, who have been hit \nas hard as anyone by the devastating effects of this recession.\n  We must help rural communities stay safe during this economic \ndownturn. Rural areas, which lack the crime prevention and law \nenforcement resources often available in larger communities, have a \nparticular need for assistance to combat the worsening drug and crime \nproblems that threaten the well-being of our small cities and towns \nand, most particularly, our young people. The Rural Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act of 2009 will provide just this kind of help.\n  This bill will reauthorize a rural law enforcement assistance program \nfirst passed by Congress in the early 1990s. Like so many valuable \nprograms that help local law enforcement and crime prevention, funding \nfor this program was allowed to lapse under the Bush administration, \ndespite its effectiveness in contributing to the record drop in crime \nin the late 1990s.\n  The program would authorize $75 million a year over the next 5 years \nin new Byrne grant funds for State and local law enforcement, \nspecifically for rural States and rural areas within larger States. \nThis support would be used to hire police officers, purchase necessary \npolice equipment, and to promote the use of task forces and \ncollaborative efforts with Federal law enforcement. Just as important, \nthese funds would also be used for prevention and treatment programs in \nrural communities; programs that are necessary to combat crime and are \ntoo often the first programs cut in an economic downturn. This bill \nalso authorizes $2 million a year over 5 years for specialized training \nfor rural law enforcement officers, since training is another area \noften cut in hard times. This bill will immediately help cash-strapped \nrural communities with the law enforcement assistance they desperately \nneed.\n  In December, the Senate Judiciary Committee traveled to St. Albans, \nVermont, to hear from the people of that resilient community about the \ngrowing problem of drug-related crime in rural America, and about the \ninnovative steps they are taking to combat that scourge. The \nintroduction of this bill is a step forward to apply the lessons \nlearned in that hearing and in previous crime hearings in Vermont and \nelsewhere.\n  Crime is not just a big city issue. As we heard in St. Albans last \nmonth, and at a hearing in Rutland, Vermont, earlier last year, the \ndrugs and violence so long seen largely in urban areas now plague even \nour most rural and remote communities, as well. As the world grows \nsmaller with better transportation and faster communication, so do our \nshared problems. Rural communities also face the added burden of \nfighting these crime problems without the sophisticated task forces and \nspecialized squads so common in big cities and metropolitan areas. In \nfact, too many rural communities, whether in Vermont or other rural \nStates, don't have the money for a local police force at all, and rely \nalmost exclusively on the state police or other state-wide agencies for \neven basic police services. In this environment, we must do more to \nprovide assistance to those rural communities most at risk and hardest \nhit by the economic crisis.\n  Unfortunately, for the last 8 years, throughout the country, State \nand local law enforcement agencies have been stretched thin as they \nshoulder both traditional crime-fighting duties and new homeland \nsecurity demands. They have faced continuous cuts in Federal funding \nduring the Bush years, and time and time again, our State and local law \nenforcement officers have been unable to fill vacancies and get the \nequipment they need.\n  This trend is unacceptable, and that is why we must restore funding \nfor rural law enforcement that proved so successful in 1990s, when \ncrime fell to record lows in rural and urban areas alike.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have always advocated vigorous enforcement \nand punishment of those who commit serious crimes. But I also know that \npunishment alone will not solve the problems of drugs and violence in \nour rural communities. Police chiefs from Vermont and across the \ncountry have told me that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem.\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\n  Combating drug use and crime requires all the tools at our disposal, \nincluding enforcement, prevention, and treatment. The best way to \nprevent crime is often to provide young people with opportunities and \nconstructive things to do, so they stay away from drugs and crime \naltogether. If young people do get involved with drugs, treatment in \nmany cases can work to help them to turn their lives around. Good \nprevention and treatment programs have been shown again and again to \nreduce crime, but regrettably, the Bush administration has consistently \nsought to reduce funding for these important programs. It is time to \nmove in a new direction.\n  I will work with the new administration to advance legislation that \nwill give State and local law enforcement the support it needs, that \nwill help our cities and towns to implement the kinds of innovative and \nproven community-based solutions needed to reduce crime. The \nlegislation I introduce today is a beginning, addressing the urgent and \nunmet need to support our rural law enforcement as they struggle to \ncombat drugs and crime.\n  It is a first step for us to help our small cities and towns weather \nthe worsening conditions of these difficult times and begin to move in \na better direction. I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect Indian arts and crafts through the \nimprovement of applicable criminal proceedings, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues \nSenator Thomas, Senator Kyl, and Senator Domenici in introducing a bill \nto amend the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. This legislation would improve \nFederal laws that protect the integrity and originality of Native \nAmerican arts and crafts.\n  The Indian Arts and Crafts Act prohibits the misrepresentation in \nmarketing of Indian arts and crafts products, and makes it illegal to \ndisplay or sell works in a manner that falsely suggests it's the \nproduct of an individual Indian or Indian Tribe. Unfortunately, the law \nis written so that only the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, \nacting on behalf of the Attorney General, can investigate and make \narrests in cases of suspected Indian art counterfeiters. The bill we \nare introducing would amend the law to expand existing Federal \ninvestigative authority by authorizing other Federal investigative \nbodies, such as the BIA Office of Law Enforcement, in addition to the \nFBI, to investigate cases of misrepresentation of Indian arts and \ncrafts. This bill is similar to provisions included in S. 1255, which \npassed the Senate last Congress but wasn't acted on by the House, and \nthe Native American Omnibus Technical Corrections Act of 2007, S. 2087.\n  A major source of tribal and individual Indian income is derived from \nthe sale of handmade Indian arts and crafts. Yet, millions of dollars \nare diverted each year from these original artists and Indian tribes by \nthose who reproduce and sell counterfeit Indian goods. Few, if any, \ncriminal prosecutions have been brought in Federal court for such \nviolations. It is understandable that enforcing the criminal law under \nthe Indian Arts and Crafts Act is often stalled by the other \nresponsibilities of the FBI including investigating terrorism activity \nand violent crimes in Indian country. Therefore, expanding the \ninvestigative authority to include other Federal agencies is intended \nto promote the active investigation of alleged misconduct. It is my \nhope that this much needed change will deter those who choose to \nviolate the law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 152. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to jointly conduct a study of certain land \nadjacent to the Walnut Canyon National Monument in the State of \nArizona; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl \nin reintroducing legislation to authorize a special resources and land \nmanagement study for lands adjacent to the Walnut Canyon National \nMonument in Arizona. The study is intended to evaluate a range of \nmanagement options for public lands adjacent to the monument to ensure \nadequate protection of the canyon's cultural and natural resources. A \nsimilar bill was introduced last Congress and received a hearing in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on \nNational Parks. The bill being introduced today reflects suggested \nchanges of that Subcommittee and includes language that met their \napproval. I am grateful for the input of the members of the \nSubcommittee and their staff.\n  For several years, local communities adjacent to the Walnut Canyon \nNational Monument have debated whether the land surrounding the \nmonument would be best protected from future development under \nmanagement of the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. The \nCoconino County Board and the Flagstaff City Council have passed \nresolutions concluding that the preferred method to determine what is \nbest for the land surrounding Walnut Canyon National Monument is by \nhaving a Federal study conducted. The recommendations from such a study \nwould help to resolve the question of future management and whether \nexpanding the monument's boundaries could compliment current public and \nmultiple-use needs.\n  The legislation also would direct the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide recommendations for management \noptions for maintenance of the public uses and protection of resources \nof the study area. I fully expect that as this measure continues \nthrough the legislative process, Congress will ensure that funding \noffsets are provided to it and every other spending measure as we work \nto restore fiscal discipline to Washington in a bi-partisan manner.\n  This legislation would provide a mechanism for determining the \nmanagement options for one of Arizona's high uses scenic areas and \nprotect the natural and cultural resources of this incredibly beautiful \nmonument. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n\n[[Page S138]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 153. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Arizona National Scenic Trail; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nKyl in introducing the Arizona Trail Feasibility National Scenic Trail \nAct. This bill would designate the Arizona Trail as a National Scenic \nTrail.\n  The Arizona Trail is a beautifully diverse stretch of public lands, \nmountains, canyons, deserts, forests, historic sites, and communities. \nThe Trail is approximately 807 miles long and begins at the Coronado \nNational Memorial on the U.S.-Mexico border and ends in the Bureau of \nLand Management's Arizona Strip District on the Utah border near the \nGrand Canyon. In between these two points, the Trail winds through some \nof the most rugged, spectacular scenery in the Western United States. \nThe corridor for the Arizona Trail encompasses the wide range of \necological diversity in the state, and incorporates a host of existing \ntrails into one continuous trail. In fact, the Trail route is so \ntopographically diverse that a person can hike from the Sonoran Desert \nto Alpine forests in one day.\n  For over a decade, more than 16 Federal, State, and local agencies, \nas well as community and business organizations, have partnered to \ncreate, develop, and manage the Arizona Trail. Through their combined \nefforts, these agencies and the members of the Arizona Trail \nAssociation have completed over 90 percent of the longest contiguous \nland-based trail in the State of Arizona. Designating the Arizona Trail \nas a National Scenic Trail would help streamline the management of the \nhigh-use trail to ensure that this pristine stretch of diverse land is \npreserved for future generations to enjoy.\n  Since 1968, when the National Trails System Act was established, \nCongress has designated over 20 national trails. Before a trail \nreceives a national designation, a federal study is typically required \nto assess the feasibility of establishing a trail route. The Arizona \nTrail doesn't require a feasibility study because it's virtually \ncomplete with less than 60 miles left to build and sign. All but 1-\npercent of the trail resides on public land, and the unfinished \nsegments don't involve private property. The trail meets the criteria \nto be labeled a National Scenic Trail and already appears on all \nArizona state maps. Therefore, the Congress has reason to forego an \nunnecessary and costly feasibility study and proceed straight to \nNational Scenic Trail designation.\n  The Arizona Trail is known throughout the State as boon to outdoor \nenthusiasts. The Arizona State Parks recently released data showing \nthat two-thirds of Arizonans consider themselves trail users. Millions \nof visitors also use Arizona's trails each year. In one of the fastest-\ngrowing states in the United States, the designation of the Arizona \nTrail as a National Scenic Trail would ensure the preservation of a \ncorridor of open space for hikers, mountain bicyclists, cross country \nskiers, snowshoers, eco-tourists, equestrians, and joggers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Bunning):\n  S. 155. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend \nthe taxation of unemployment compensation for 2 years; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill I \noffered last December that will provide much-needed relief to \nstruggling families across America. The Unemployment Benefit Tax \nSuspension Act of 2009 is a critical piece of legislation, which should \nbe considered as part of any stimulus package, that would suspend the \ncollection of Federal income tax on unemployment benefits for 2008 and \n2009. This bill would ensure that as individuals sit down in the next \ncouple months to complete their 2008 tax bills, they will not have to \nworry about paying taxes on the unemployment benefits they received \nlast year or can get refunds of taxes withheld. It also means that the \nunemployed would not be concerned with taxes on benefits paid this \nyear. I thank Senators Lincoln and Bunning for joining me to introduce \nthis legislation.\n  In light of the calamitous labor market, Congress must act to ensure \nthat workers who lose their jobs do not also lose their livelihoods. In \nDecember, the Labor Department released sobering statistics that \ndemonstrated the gravity of the situation we face. In November, the \neconomy shed 533,000 jobs, the largest monthly job loss since December \n1974. Our unemployment rate now stands at a perilous 6.7 percent, a 15-\nyear high. We have lost 1.9 million jobs since the beginning of our \npresent recession in December 2007--including two-thirds of those jobs \nin the last 3 months alone--and the number of unemployed stands at a \nwhopping 10.3 million.\n  Suspending the Federal income tax on unemployment benefits is a \nsimple way to assist our Nation's unemployed workers and families. In \nfact, the CBO has estimated that in 2005, of the 8.1 million recipients \nof unemployment compensation benefits, 7.5 million had incomes of under \n$100,000. As such, most of the benefits of suspending this tax are \nlikely to go to lower- and middle-income families, those struggling \nharder than ever just to make ends meet.\n  During these challenging times, taxes on unemployment compensation \nrepresents a burden that unemployed members of our society simply \ncannot afford. Working families are already suffering, with the high \ncost of groceries, an unstable energy market, and the outrageous \npricetag for health care. My bill offers a means to help stimulate the \neconomy by making unemployed workers' benefits stretch farther. While \nit is certainly not a solution to the problem, it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  President-elect Obama has voiced his support for this general idea, \ncalling it ``a way of giving more relief to families,'' and I believe \nthat is the ultimate goal we must pursue in these trying times. I look \nforward to seeing this bill is passed in a timely manner, so that the \nimpact can be immediate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unemployment Benefit Tax \n     Suspension Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUSPENSION OF TAX ON UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 85 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to unemployment compensation) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Temporary Suspension.--Subsection (a) shall not apply \n     to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2007, and \n     before January 1, 2010.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 156. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nenhanced small business expensing and to provide for a 5-year net \noperating loss carryback for losses incurred in 2008 or 2009; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms, SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide critical tax incentives to our Nation's small businesses, which \nwill help them to make vital investments in new plant and equipment and \nweather the recession that is crippling our Nation's economy. The Small \nBusiness Stimulus Act of 2009 is just three pages, but by extending \nenhanced small business expensing and establishing a 5-year carryback \nfor net operating losses, it would pack a powerful punch and assist \nAmerica's 26 million small firms that represent over 99.7 of all \nemployers. I am pleased that press reports indicate that President-\nelect Obama will include these proposals in his stimulus initiative, \nand I hope that Congress will feature them in any legislation we pass \nin the coming weeks. I thank Senator Kerry for joining me to introduce \nthis legislation.\n  I have long championed so-called enhanced Section 179 expensing, and \nI was gratified that Congress, as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of \n2008, allowed small businesses in Maine and across the nation to \nexpense up to $250,000 of their investments, including\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nthe purchase of essential new equipment. Unfortunately, the incentive \nin that bill was written to last just one year, and so, in 2009, absent \nadditional action, small firms will be able to expense just $133,000 of \nnew investment. Instead of being able to write off more of their \nequipment purchases immediately, films will have to recover their costs \nover 5, 7, or more years.\n  At a time in which we find ourselves in a recession and our nation's \nsmall businesses are having trouble finding capital to make job-\ncreating new investments, we simply cannot allow that to occur. \nAccordingly, my bill would allow small businesses to continue expensing \nup to $250,000 of new investment in both 2009 and 2010. The purchase of \nnew equipment will undoubtedly contribute to continued productivity \ngrowth in the business community, which economic experts have \nrepeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term vitality of our \neconomy.\n  Second, my bill recognizes that many businesses that were once \nprofitable are experiencing significant losses as a result of current \neconomic conditions. As a result, many are curtailing operations, and \nover 2 million Americans lost their jobs in 2008. It is for this reason \nthat I am introducing a proposal to extend the net operating loss \ncarryback period from 2 to 5 years. In this way, businesses reporting \nlosses in 2008 and 2009 may offset those losses against profits from as \nmany as 5 years in the past and claim an immediate tax refund. They can \nuse that money to help sustain operations and retain employees while \nthe economy recovers. This proposal should be particularly beneficial \nto small businesses, which are responsible for creating 75 percent of \nnet new jobs. Finally, I would note that although I proposed this very \nchange in January 2008 and it cleared the Finance Committee as part of \nlast year's stimulus legislation, it was subsequently dropped in \nnegotiations with the House of Representatives. I hope that this worthy \nproposal does not suffer the same fate this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe temporary waiver of required minimum distribution rules for certain \nretirement plans and accounts; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \noffer expanded relief to retirees who are forced to take so-called \nrequired minimum distributions from their retirement accounts. After a \nyear in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a staggering 34 \npercent, Congress rightly suspended required minimum distribution rules \nfor 2009 as part of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of \n2008. Unfortunately, Congress did not act to suspend the rules for 2008 \nor 2010 as I had previously proposed. Consequently, we now find \nourselves in a situation in which 1 year of relief is insufficient to \nenable retirees to recoup their losses, and I am, therefore, \nintroducing the Retirement Account Distribution Improvement Act of 2009 \nto allow amounts required to have been distributed in 2008 to be re-\ncontributed and to waive the rules for 2010. I would like to thank \nSenator Lincoln for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Under current law, individuals who have reached age 70.5 generally \nmust begin to withdraw funds from their IRAs or defined contribution \nretirement plans, including 401(k), 403(b), 457, and TSP plans. The \nwithdrawals must begin by April 1 of the year after which an individual \nattains age 70.5. Failure to take a required minimum distribution may \nresult in a 50 percent excise tax on the difference between what must \nbe withdrawn and the amount actually distributed.\n  In times that equities markets are rising and retirement account \nbalances are growing, required minimum distribution rules are sensible. \nIndeed, they ensure the Government gains revenue after years of tax-\ndeferred growth. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing unprecedented \nlosses in equities markets that have caused many individuals to suffer \nsteep losses in their retirement account balances. Notably, \nthe American Association of Retired Persons has said that retirement \naccounts have lost as much as $2.3 trillion between September 30, 2007, \nand October 16, 2008. Forcing individuals to prematurely liquidate \naccounts and pay income taxes on the proceeds, as is required under \ncurrent law, instead of allowing them to wait until the market recovers \nand continue to defer tax, simply adds insult to injury. Moreover, \nmandating withdrawals may cause stock prices to fall, hurting other \ninvestors.\n\n  It is for these reasons that I am today introducing legislation to \nallow individuals who were forced to withdraw funds in 2008 to re-\ncontribute that money into their accounts by July 1, 2009. Any amounts \nerroneously distributed in early 2009 could also be re-contributed by \nJuly 1, 2009. Finally, my bill would also waive minimum required \ndistributions for 2010.\n  Although Congress took a solid first step by suspending minimum \nrequired distributions for 2009, we must do more. With many predicting \na multi-year recession, Congress must adopt a longer-term approach to \nhelping individuals protect their retirement assets and weather the \ncurrent economic storm. Individuals may require several years to recoup \nlosses they have sustained, and by enabling them to keep assets in \ntheir retirement accounts until 2011, this bill offers them that \nopportunity. At that point, Congress can reevaluate whether the waiver \nof current-law rules should be further extended.\n  I urge all Senators to consider the benefits this legislation will \nprovide to millions of retirees all across the United States, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to enact it in a timely \nmanner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brown, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln:\n  S. 158. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of industrial development bonds to facilities \nmanufacturing intangible property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat would provide State and local development finance authorities with \ngreater flexibility in promoting economic growth that meets the \nchanging realities of an ever more global economy. Specifically, my \nbill would expand the definition of ``manufacturing'' as it pertains to \nthe small-issue Industrial Development Bond, IDB, program to include \nthe creation of ``intangible'' property. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kerry, Brown, and Lincoln in reintroducing this critical \nlegislation to promote economic development, and I strongly believe it \nwould be a critical additional to any stimulus legislation.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \nremains the envy of the world, even during these difficult economic \ntimes. Knowledge-based businesses have been at the forefront of this \ninnovation that has bolstered the economy over the long-term. For \nexample, science parks have helped lead the technological revolution \nand have created more than 300,000 high-paying science and technology \njobs, along with another 450,000 indirect jobs for a total of 750,000 \njobs in North America.\n  It is clear that the promotion of knowledge-based industries can be a \nkey economic tool for States and localities. This is especially true \nfor States that have seen a loss in traditional manufacturing. In my \nhome State of Maine, we lost 28 percent of our total manufacturing \nemployment over the last decade. I believe that it is critical that we \nprovide States and localities with a wider range of options in \npromoting economic development, particularly as our economy lost over 2 \nmillion jobs in 2008. My legislation will do just that by expanding the \navailability of small-issue IDBs to new economy industries, such as \nsoftware and biotechnology, that have proven their ability to provide \nhigh-paying jobs.\n  These IDBs allow State and local development finance authorities, \nlike the Finance Authority of Maine, to issue tax-exempt bonds for the \npurpose of raising capital to provide low-cost financing of \nmanufacturing facilities. These bonds, therefore, provide local \nauthorities with an invaluable tool to attract new employers and assist \nexisting ones to grow. The result is a win-win situation for local \ncommunities providing them with much needed jobs. Consequently, it only \nmakes sense to ensure that these finance authorities have maximum \nflexibility in options to grow jobs.\n  In addition, my bill provides some technical clarity to distinguish \nbetween the phrases ``functionally related and subordinate facilities'' \nand ``directly related and ancillary facilities.'' Until 1988, there \nwas little confusion based on Treasury regulations going back to 1972 \nthat made it clear that ``functionally related and subordinate \nfacilities'' were clearly eligible for\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nfinancing through private activity tax-exempt bonds. But, Congress \nenacted the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Bond Act of 1988 that \nimposed a limitation that not more than 25 percent of tax-exempt bond \nfinancing could be used on ``directly related and ancillary \nfacilities.'' While these two phrases appear to be very similar, they \nare indeed distinguishable from each other. Unfortunately, the Internal \nRevenue Service has blurred this distinction between the phrases which \nhas had an adverse impact on the way facilities are able to utilize \ntax-exempt bond financing. My legislation would make it clear that \n``functionally related and subordinate facilities'' are not susceptible \nto the 25 percent limitation.\n  We must continue to encourage all avenues of economic development if \nAmerica is to compete in a changing and increasingly global economy, \nand my legislation is one small step in furtherance of that goal. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and to include it \nin stimulus legislation we will be considering in the coming weeks.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide the District of Columbia a voting seat and \nthe State of Utah an additional seat in the House of Representatives; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity \ntoday, obviously early on this first day of this new session of \nCongress, together with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to \nintroduce bipartisan legislation which will finally grant citizens of \nour Nation's Capital, the District of Columbia, voting representation, \nthe proper representation to which they are entitled as citizens.\n  That representative voting would be in the House of Representatives. \nThis bill is entitled ``The District of Columbia House Voting Rights \nAct of 2009.'' It is identical to a bill which Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced in the 110th Congress.\n  It would, for the first time, give citizens of the District of \nColumbia full voting representation in the House while adding a fourth \ncongressional seat for the State of Utah based on population statistics \nfrom the 2000 census in which they came very close. I think the people \nof Utah would in fact say they deserve an additional seat.\n  This is the fifth session in which I have introduced legislation to \ntry to correct what I believe is a fundamental wrong--which is to deny \nthe citizens of our Nation's Capital voting representation in Congress. \nI hope and believe and pray this is the session in which we are going \nto get this done.\n  Last year, this bill passed overwhelmingly in the House by a vote of \n271 to 177, but it fell three votes short of gaining cloture in the \nSenate, though the vote in favor was 57 to 42. With a new Congress and \na new President who was in fact a cosponsor of this bill himself in the \nlast session of Congress, I am hopeful we can pass this legislation, \nvital to the rights of nearly 600,000 Americans living in the District \nof Columbia. Keep in mind the population of the District, though small \ncompared to many States, is roughly equal to the State populations of \nAlaska, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming, all of which have, of \ncourse, not only representation--that is, voting in the House--but two \nSenators here. This deals only and exclusively with voting \nrepresentation in the House.\n  I want to particularly thank my dear friend and colleague, Senator \nOrin Hatch, for his continued, principled, steadfast support of this \nbill. He set aside partisanship to join me and others in trying to \nright this historic wrong. I greatly admire his commitment to this \ncause.\n  I am also proud to say Senators Leahy, Kennedy, Clinton, Dodd, \nSanders, Kerry, Durbin, and Feingold are today joining as original \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  Of course, I pay special honor and thanks to the DC Delegate, Eleanor \nHolmes Norton, who has been a tireless champion of full representation \nfor the citizens of the District; of course, a tireless champion for \nthe citizens of the District generally. Delegate Norton is introducing \na similar bill in the House today.\n  I do this with a certain special personal pride because Delegate \nNorton and I were at law school at Yale at the same time just a few \nyears ago. It probably would seem, to the casual observer, hard to \nbelieve that we deny the residents of our Nation's Capital of the right \nto have a voting representative in the House of Representatives. In \nfact, public opinion polls have been taken over the years that ask \npeople: Do you think the residents of the District of Columbia have \nvoting representation in the House? Overwhelming, the American public \nsays: Of course they do, because they cannot believe there would be a \nreason to deny them the representation.\n  In recent years, those who have opposed this legislation which would \ncorrect a historic injustice have argued that congressional \nrepresentation is granted only to the States under the Constitution, \nand therefore our legislation is unconstitutional.\n  With all respect, I believe that simply is not true. The Constitution \nprovides Congress with the authority to bestow voting rights on the \nDistrict. Multiple constitutional experts, spanning the full \nideological spectrum of left to right, including Ken Starr, former \njudge on the U.S. Court of Appeals and former Solicitor General, and \nViet Dinh, former Assistant Attorney General, and many others have told \nCongress and the public that this authority, which is, the authority to \ngrant representation in Congress, lies within the District Clause of \nthe Constitution, which is article I, section 8, where it states:\n\n       Congress has the power to exercise exclusive legislation in \n     all cases whatsoever over such District.\n\n  Congress has repeatedly used this authority to treat the District of \nColumbia as a State for various public purposes. For example, as long \nago as 1940, the Judiciary Act of 1789 was revised to broaden diversity \njurisdiction to include citizens of the District, even though the \nConstitution specifically provides that national courts may hear cases \n``between citizens of different States.''\n  In other words, in that act, Congress said no, for purposes of \ndiversity of jurisdiction access to the courts, even though the \nConstitution says that courts may hear cases between citizens of \ndifferent States. It would be incomprehensible that citizens of the \nDistrict of Columbia, because they happen to live in the Nation's \nCapital, could not gain access to the Federal courts.\n  When challenged, this revision to the Judiciary Act was upheld as \nconstitutional by the Federal courts themselves. Furthermore, the \ncourts have found that Congress has the authority to impose national \ntaxes on the District, to provide a jury trial to residents of the \nDistrict, and to include\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\nthe District in interstate commerce regulations.\n  These are rights and responsibilities that our Constitution grants to \nStates. Yet the District Clause has allowed Congress to apply those \nrights and responsibilities to the District of Columbia because not to \ndo so would make residents of the District, or the District itself, \nsecond class in their citizenship.\n  Treating the District as a State for purposes of voting \nrepresentation in Congress should be no different. The elections of \n2008 saw a historic number of citizens carrying out their civic duty by \nvoting for their representatives in Congress. Unfortunately, for over \n200 years, DC residents have been denied that most basic right.\n  According to a 2005 KRC Research poll, 82 percent of Americans, when \ntold that residents of the District do not have a voting representative \nin Congress, say it is time to give that voting representation to the \ncitizens of our Nation's Capital.\n  This has very practical and just consequences. People of the District \nhave been the target directly of terrorist attacks, but they have no \nvote on how the Federal Government provides for their homeland \nsecurity. Men and women citizens of the District have fought bravely in \nour wars, in defense of our security and our freedom over the years, \nmany giving their lives in defense of our country. Yet citizens of the \nDistrict have no voting representation in Congress on the serious \nquestions of war and peace, veterans' benefits, and the like. Of \ncourse, the citizens of the District of Columbia, per capita, pay \nFederal income taxes at the second highest rate in the Nation. Yet they \nhave absolutely no voice, no voting representation, in setting tax \nrates or in determining how the revenues raised by those taxes will be \nspent.\n  This is plain wrong. The Supreme Court has said ``that no right is \nmore precious in a free country than that of having a vote in the \nelection of those who make the laws, under which, as good citizens, we \nmust live.''\n  We can no longer deny our fellow American citizens who happen to live \nin the District of Columbia this precious right. With the United States \nengaged now in two wars, a global war also against terrorists who \nattacked us on 9/11/2001, with our country facing the most significant \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression, it is past time to grant \nthe vote to those citizens living in our Nation's Capital so their vote \ncan be rightfully heard as we debate these great and complex issues of \nour time.\n  This matter has fallen, according to our rules, under the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, which I am privileged to chair. I hope we will be \nable to take it up quickly. It is my intention to consider this \nlegislation at the first markup of our committee in the session, and \nthen to bring it to the floor as quickly as possible with a high sense \nof optimism that on this occasion, if there is another filibuster that \nwe will have, with the help of the new Members of the Senate, more than \n60 votes necessary to close it off, and at least have a vote on this \nquestion of fundamental rights for 600,000 of our fellow Americans.\n  I want to submit not only an original copy of the bill to the clerk, \nbut also for the Record a statement from Senator Hatch, which I ask \nunanimous consent to appear as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as I did in the last Congress, I am \ncosponsoring the legislation introduced today by the Senator from \nConnecticut to provide a House seat for the District of Columbia and an \nadditional House seat for Utah.\n  Representation and suffrage are so central to the American system of \nself-government that America's founders warned that limiting suffrage \nwould risk another revolution and could prevent ratification of the \nConstitution. The Supreme Court has said that no right is more precious \nin a free country than having a voice in the election of those who \ngovern us. I continue to believe what I stated more than 30 years ago \nhere on the Senate floor, that Americans living in the District should \nenjoy all the privileges of citizenship, including voting rights.\n  The bill introduced today would treat the District of Columbia as a \ncongressional district to provide for full representation in the House. \nThe bill states, however, that the District shall not be treated as a \nState for representation in this body.\n  No matter how worthwhile or even compelling an objective might be, \nhowever, we cannot legislatively pursue it without authority grounded \nin the Constitution. I would note that the Constitution explicitly \ngives Congress legislative authority over the District ``in all cases \nwhatsoever.'' This authority is unparalleled in scope and has been \ncalled sweeping, plenary, and extraordinary by the courts. It surpasses \nboth the authority a State legislature has over its own State and the \nauthority Congress has over legislation affecting the States.\n  Some have argued that despite the centrality of representation and \nsuffrage, and notwithstanding our unparalleled and plenary authority \nover the District, that Congress cannot provide a House seat for the \nDistrict by legislation. They base their argument on a single word. \nArticle I, Section 5, of the Constitution provides that the House of \nRepresentatives shall be composed of members chosen by the people of \nthe several States. Because the District is not a State, the argument \ngoes, it cannot have a House seat without a constitutional amendment,\n  I studied this issue extensively and published my analysis and \nconclusions in the Harvard Journal on Legislation for everyone to \nconsider. I ask unanimous consent that this article be made part of the \nRecord following my remarks. Let me here just mention a few \nconsiderations that I found persuasive.\n  First, as I have already mentioned, the default position of our \nsystem of government is representation and suffrage. That principle is \nso fundamental that, in this case, I believe there must be actual \nevidence that America's founders intended to deny it to District \nresidents, No such evidence exists.\n  Second, establishing and maintaining the District as a separate \npolitical jurisdiction does not require disenfranchising its residents. \nThe\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\nfounders wanted the capital to be free from State control and I support \nkeeping it that way. Giving the District a House seat changes neither \nthat status nor Congress' legislative authority over the District.\n  Third, America's founders not only did not intend to disenfranchise \nDistrict residents, they demonstrated the opposite intention by their \nown legislative actions. In 1790, Congress provided by legislation for \nAmericans living in the land ceded for the District to vote in \ncongressional elections. No one even suggested that this legislation \nwas unconstitutional because that land was not part of a State. If \nCongress could do it then, Congress can do it today.\n  Fourth, courts have held for more than two centuries that \nconstitutional provisions framed in terms of States can be applied to \nthe District or that Congress can legislatively accomplish for the \nDistrict what the Constitution accomplishes for States. Congress, for \nexample, has authority to regulate commerce among the several States. \nThe Supreme Court held in 1889 that this applies to the District. Do \nopponents of giving the District a House seat believe Congress cannot \nregulate commerce involving the District?\n  The original Constitution provided that direct taxes shall be \napportioned among the several States. The Supreme Court held in 1820 \nthat Congress' legislative authority over the District allows taxation \nof the District. Do opponents of giving the District a House seat \nbelieve that the District is suitable for taxation but not for \nrepresentation?\n  The Constitution provides that federal courts may review lawsuits \nbetween citizens of different States. The Supreme Court held in 1805 \nthat Congress can legislatively extend this to the District even though \nthe Constitution does not.\n  The list goes on involving provisions of the Constitution, statues, \nand even treaties. Over and over, courts have ruled either that \nprovisions framed in terms of States can be directly applied to the \nDistrict or that Congress can legislatively do so. Perhaps opponents of \ngiving the District a House seat believe that all of these decisions \nover more than two centuries were wrong, that the word States begins \nand ends the discussion in every case. They cannot say so in the \npresent case without confronting those precedents.\n  These and other considerations which I discussed in the article I \nmentioned have led me to conclude that the Constitution allows Congress \nlegislatively to provide a House seat for the District. I do want to \nrepeat my continuing opposition to District representation in the \nSenate. The District's status as a non-State jurisdiction is not \nrelevant to representation in the House, which was designed to \nrepresent people, but it is relevant to representation in the Senate, \nwhich was designed to represent states. I would once again emphasize \nthat the bill introduced today explicitly disclaims Senate \nrepresentation for the District.\n  In December 2006, I signed a letter to the majority and minority \nleaders expressing the same position I had taken three decades earlier. \nIt stated that while there are many differences between Utah and the \nDistrict, to be sure, they share the right to be represented in our \ncountry's legislature. I take the same position today, believing that \nCongress may and should pass the bill introduced today to provide for \nthat representation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the District of \nColumbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009 to end the unfair treatment of \nDistrict of Columbia residents and give them voting representation in \nthe House of Representatives. For over 200 hundred years, the residents \nof the District of Columbia have been denied a voting Member \nrepresenting their views in Congress. That is wrong, and I hope the \nSenate will consider this important issue early this year to remedy the \ndisenfranchisement that residents of our Nation's capital have endured.\n  When the Senate considered this legislation last Congress the \nRepublican minority chose to filibuster the bill. While a majority \nfavored it, we fell short of the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster \nand pass it. Earlier that year, however, the House of Representatives \nworked in a bipartisan manner to pass a version of a voting rights bill \nfor the District of Columbia led by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes \nNorton. As a young lawyer, she worked for civil rights and voting \nrights around the country. It is a cruel irony that upon her return to \nthe District of Columbia, and her election to the House of \nRepresentatives, she does not yet have the right to vote on behalf of \nthe people of the District of Columbia who elected her. She is a strong \nvoice in Congress, but the citizens living in the Nation's capital \ndeserve a vote, as well.\n  The bill introduced today would give the District of Columbia \ndelegate a vote in the House. It would give Utah a fourth seat in the \nHouse as well. Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held hearings on \na similar measure and we heard compelling testimony from constitutional \nexperts. They testified that this legislation is constitutional, and \nhighlighted the fact that Congress's greater power to confer statehood \non the District certainly contains the lesser one, the power to grant \nDistrict residents voting rights in the House of Representatives. \nCongress has repeatedly treated the District of Columbia as a ``State'' \nfor various purposes. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton testified \nthat although ``the District is not a State,'' the ``Congress has not \nhad the slightest difficulty in treating the District as a State, with \nits laws, its treaties, and for constitutional purposes.'' Examples of \nthese actions include a revision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that \nbroadened Article III diversity jurisdiction to include citizens of the \nDistrict even though the Constitution only provides that Federal courts \nmay hear cases ``between citizens of different States.'' Congress has \nalso treated the District as a ``State'' for purposes of congressional \npower to regulate commerce ``among the several States.'' The Sixteenth \nAmendment grants Congress the power to directly tax incomes ``without \napportionment among the several States,'' but has been interpreted also \nto apply to residents of the District. In fact, the District of \nColumbia pays the second highest Federal taxes per capita without any \nsay in how those dollars are spent.\n  I believe that this legislation is within Congress's powers as \nprovided in the Constitution. I agree with Congressman John Lewis, \nCongresswoman Norton and numerous other civil rights leaders and \nconstitutional scholars that we should extend the basic right of voting \nrepresentation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans residing in \nthe District of Columbia. These Americans pay Federal taxes, defend our \ncountry in the military and serve on Federal juries.\n  This is an historic measure that holds great significance within the \ncivil rights community and for the residents of the District of \nColumbia. I urge Senators to do what is right and to support this bill \nwhen it comes to the floor for full Senate consideration.\n  Over 50 years ago, the Senate overrode filibusters to pass the Civil \nRights Acts of 1957 and 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \nCongressman Lewis, a courageous leader during those transformational \nstruggles decades ago, gave moving testimony before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last Congress in which he reminded us that ``we in \nCongress must do all we can to inspire a new generation to fulfill the \nmission of equal justice.'' The Senate should continue to fight for the \nfundamental rights of all Americans and stand united in serving this \nnoble purpose. No person's right to vote should be abridged, suppressed \nor denied in the United States of America. Let us move forward together \nand provide full voting rights for the citizens in our Nation's \ncapital.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. \n        Graham, and Mr. Coburn.)\n  S. 162. A bill to provide greater accountability of taxpayers' \ndollars by curtailing congressional earmarking, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, the junior Senator from Missouri, \nMrs. McCaskill, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, in introducing the \nFiscal Discipline, Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act of 2009. \nSenator McCain has been one of the preeminent champions\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\nof earmark reform, and I have been pleased to work with him in fighting \nthis abuse over the last two decades. Senators McCaskill and Coburn, \nthough newer to the Senate, have been two of the most effective \nadvocates of earmark reform since taking office. And Senator Graham has \nbeen a courageous champion of reform as well, and during consideration \nof the Lobbying and Ethics Reform measure in the 110th Congress was a \ncritical vote in helping to strengthen the earmark provisions of that \nlegislation.\n  That measure was the most significant earmark reform Congress has \never enacted, and it reflected a growing recognition by Members that \nthe business-as-usual days of using earmarks to avoid the scrutiny of \nthe authorizing process or of competitive grants are coming to an end. \nIt is no accident that the presidential nominees of the two major \nparties were major players on that reform package.\n  Mr. President, it would be a mistake not to acknowledge just how far \nwe have come. The Lobbying and Ethics Reform bill was an enormous step \nforward, and I commend our Majority Leader, Senator Reid, as well as \nour former colleague from Illinois, President-elect Obama, for their \nwork in ensuring the passage of that landmark bill.\n  But it would also be a mistake not to admit that we still have a way \nto go. The Fiscal Discipline, Earmark Reform, and Accountability Act of \n2009 will build on the significant achievement of the 110th Congress by \nmoving from what has largely been a system designed to dissuade the use \nof earmarks through disclosure to one that actually makes it much more \ndifficult to enact them.\n  The principal provision of this measure is the establishment of a \npoint of order against unauthorized earmarks on appropriations bills. \nTo overcome that point of order, supporters of the unauthorized earmark \nwill need to obtain a super-majority of the Senate. As a further \ndeterrent, the bill provides that any earmarked funding which is \nsuccessfully stricken from the appropriations bill will be unavailable \nfor other spending in that bill.\n  The measure also closes a loophole in last year's Lobbying and Ethics \nReform bill by requiring all appropriations conference reports and all \nauthorizing conference reports to be electronically searchable 48 hours \nbefore the Senate considers the conference report. And it requires all \nrecipients of federal funds to disclose any money spent on registered \nlobbyists.\n  I am delighted that President-elect Obama has announced that the \nexpected economic recovery package which may be proposed in the next \nfew days should be kept free of earmarks. I couldn't agree more, and I \nexpect to join with Senators McCain, McCaskill, Graham, and Coburn to \nsee that the recovery package is free of unauthorized earmarks.\n  In the past, this urgently needed measure was just the kind of \nlegislation that typically attracted unauthorized earmarks. We are much \nmore likely to be successful in keeping that package and other \nappropriations bills free of earmarks if we are able to use the tools \nproposed in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fiscal Discipline, Earmark \n     Reform, and Accountability Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am proud to again be joining forces with \nmy good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to \nintroduce a comprehensive earmark reform measure. We are also pleased \nto be joined by Senators McCaskill, Graham, and Coburn as cosponsors in \nthis effort. The measure we are introducing today is designed to \neliminate unauthorized earmarks and wasteful spending in appropriations \nbills and conference reports and help restore fiscal discipline to \nWashington. Specifically, this bill would allow any member to raise a \npoint of order in an effort to extract objectionable unauthorized \nprovisions. Additionally, it contains a requirement that all \nappropriations and authorization conference reports be electronically \nsearchable at least 48 hours before full Senate consideration, and a \nrequirement that the recipients of Federal dollars disclose any amounts \nthat they spend on registered lobbyists. These are reasonable, \nresponsible reform measures that deserve consideration by the full \nSenate.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now, more than ever, we prioritize our Federal \nspending. But our appropriations bills do not always put our national \npriorities first. The process is broken and it needs to be fixed. As we \nenter the second year of a recession, the economy is in shambles. \nRecord numbers of homeowners face foreclosure, our financial markets \nhave nearly collapsed, and the U.S. automobile manufacturers are near \nruin. The national unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent--the highest \nin 15 years--with over 1.9 million people having lost their jobs last \nyear.\n  In the last year alone, due to the mortgage crisis, the Government \nhas seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress passed a \nmassive $700 billion rescue of the financial markets, and we've debated \ngiving the big-three auto manufacturers tens of billions in taxpayer \ndollars--just as a ``short-term'' infusion of cash--knowing that they'd \nbe back for more. Additionally, we're getting ready to consider an \neconomic stimulus package which is estimated to cost as much as $850 \nbillion to a trillion dollars. With all of this spending, we can no \nlonger afford to waste even a single dime of taxpayer money.\n  It is abundantly clear that the time has come for us to eliminate the \ncorrupt, wasteful practice of earmarking. We have made some progress on \nthe issue in the past couple of years, but we have not gone far enough. \nLegislation we passed in 2007 provided for greater disclosure of \nearmarks. While that was a good step forward, the bottom line is that \nwe don't simply need more disclosure of earmarks--we need to eliminate \nthem.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, for years I have been coming to the \nSenate floor to read list after list of the ridiculous items we've \nspent money on--hoping enough embarrassment might spur some change. And \nyear after year I would offer amendment after amendment to strip pork \nbarrel projects from spending bills--usually only getting a handful of \nvotes each time.\n  Finally, I was encouraged in January 2007 when this body passed, by a \nvote of 96-2, an ethics and lobbying reform package which contained \nreal, meaningful earmark reform. I thought that, at last, we would \nfinally enact some effective reforms. Unfortunately, that victory was \nshort lived. In August 2007, we were presented with a bill containing \nvery watered down earmark provisions. Not only did that bill, S. 1, do \nfar too little to rein in wasteful spending--it completely gutted the \nearmark reform provisions we passed overwhelmingly the previous \nJanuary.\n  Earmarks, Mr. President, are like a cancer. Left unchecked, they have \ngrown out of control--increasing by nearly 400 percent since 1994. And \njust as cancer destroys tissue and vital organs, the corruption \nassociated with the process of earmarking is destroying what is vital \nto our strength as a nation--that is the faith and trust of the \nAmerican people in their elected representatives and in the \ninstitutions of their government.\n  Not long ago, in the House of Representatives, when another member \nquestioned the necessity of one of his earmarked projects, a \nCongressman raged at the idea of someone challenging what he described \nas ``my\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\nmoney, my money.'' Therein lies the problem, Mr. President. Too many \nMembers of Congress view taxpayers, funds as their own. They feel free \nto spend it as they see fit, with no oversight and, often, no shame. \nLook at some of the things we've funded over the years: $225,000 for an \nHistoric Wagon Museum in Utah, $1 million for a DNA study of bears in \nMontana, $200,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Ohio, $220,000 \nfor blueberry research at the University of Maine, $3 million for an \nanimal waste management research facility in Kentucky, $170,000 for \nblackbird management in Kansas, $196,000 for geese control in New York, \n$50,000 for feral hog control in Missouri, $90,000 for the National \nCowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, $200,000 for an \nAmerican White Pelican survey, $6 million for sugarcane growers in \nHawaii, $13 million for a ewe lamb retention program, $500,000 to study \nflight attendant fatigue, $200,000 for a deer avoidance system in \nPennsylvania and New York, $3 million for the production of a \ndocumentary about Alaska, $1 million for a waterless urinal initiative, \n$500,000 for a Teapot museum in North Carolina, $1.1 million to \nresearch the use of Alaskan salmon in baby food, $25 million for a fish \nhatchery in Montana, $37 million over four years to the Alaska \nFisheries Marketing Board to ``promote and develop fishery products and \nresearch pertaining to American fisheries.'' So how exactly does this \nBoard spend the money Congress so generously earmarks every year? Well, \nthey spent $500,000 of it to paint a giant salmon on the side of an \nAlaska Airlines 747--and nicknamed it the ``Salmon Forty Salmon.''\n  Unfortunately, I could go on and on with examples of wasteful \nearmarks that have been approved by Congress. And we wonder why our \napproval rating stands at 20 percent.\n  The corruption which stems from the practice of earmarking has \nresulted in current and former Members of both the House and Senate \neither under investigation, under indictment, or in prison. Let's be \nclear--it wasn't inadequate lobbyist disclosure requirements which led \nDuke Cunningham to violate his oath of office and take $2.5 million in \nbribes in exchange for doling out $70-$80 million of the taxpayer's \nfunds to a defense contractor. It was his ability to freely earmark \ntaxpayer funds without question.\n  We cannot allow this to continue. Now is the time to put a stop to \nthis corrupt practice. The bill we are introducing today seeks to \nreform the current system by empowering all Members with a tool to rid \nappropriations bills of unauthorized funds, pork barrel projects, and \nlegislative policy riders and to provide greater public disclosure of \nthe legislative process.\n  We, as Members, owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in \na way that reinforces, rather than diminishes, the public's faith and \nconfidence in Congress. An informed citizenry is essential to a \nthriving democracy. A democratic government operates best in the \ndisinfecting light of the public eye. By seriously addressing the \ncorrupting influence of earmarks, we will allow Members to legislate \nwith the imperative that our Government must be free from corrupting \ninfluences, both real and perceived. We must act now to ensure that the \nerosion we see today in the public's confidence in Congress does not \nbecome a collapse of confidence. We can, and we must, end the practice \nof earmarking.\n  Again, I thank my friend and colleague from Wisconsin for his strong \nleadership on this issue, and I encourage the Senate act quickly to \napprove this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S.J.

Res. 4\n\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 sexual assault victims is under 12 years \n     of age;\n       Whereas raping a child is a particularly depraved, \n     perverted, and heinous act;\n       Whereas child rape is among the most morally reprehensible \n     crimes;\n       Whereas child rape is a gross defilement of innocence that \n     should be severely punished;\n       Whereas a raped child suffers immeasurable physical, \n     psychological, and emotional harm from which the child may \n     never recover;\n       Whereas the Federal Government and State governments have a \n     right and a duty to combat, prevent, and punish child rape;\n       Whereas the popularly elected representatives of Louisiana \n     modified the rape laws of the State in 1995, making the \n     aggravated rape of a child 11 years of age or younger \n     punishable by death, life imprisonment without parole, \n     probation, or suspension of sentence, as determined by a \n     jury;\n       Whereas on March 2, 1998, Patrick Kennedy, a resident of \n     Louisiana, brutally raped his 8-year-old stepdaughter;\n       Whereas the injuries inflicted on the child victim by her \n     stepfather were described by an expert in pediatric forensic \n     medicine as ``the most severe he had seen from a sexual \n     assault'';\n       Whereas the cataclysmic injuries to her 8-year-old body \n     required emergency surgery;\n       Whereas a jury of 12 Louisiana citizens convicted Patrick \n     Kennedy of this depraved crime, and unanimously sentenced him \n     to death;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld this \n     sentence, holding that the death penalty was not an excessive \n     punishment for Kennedy's crime;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of Louisiana relied on precedent \n     interpreting the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas on June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States held in Kennedy v. Louisiana, No. 07-343 (2008), that \n     executing Patrick Kennedy for the rape of his stepdaughter \n     would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'';\n       Whereas the Supreme Court, in the 5-4 decision, overturned \n     the judgment of Louisiana's elected officials, the citizens \n     who sat on the jury, and the Louisiana Supreme Court;\n       Whereas this decision marked the first time that the \n     Supreme Court held that the death penalty for child rape was \n     unconstitutional;\n       Whereas, as Justice Alito observed in his dissent, the \n     opinion of the majority was so broad that it precludes the \n     Federal Government and State governments from authorizing the \n     death penalty for child rape ``no matter how young the child, \n     no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how \n     many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic \n     the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological \n     trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous the \n     perpetrator's prior criminal record may be'';\n       Whereas, in the United States, the people, not the \n     Government, are sovereign;\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States is supreme \n     and deserving of the people's allegiance;\n       Whereas the framers of the eighth amendment did not intend \n     to prohibit the death penalty for child rape;\n       Whereas the imposition of the death penalty for child rape \n     has never been within the plain and ordinary meaning of \n     ``cruel and unusual punishment'', neither now nor at the \n     adoption of the eighth amendment;\n       Whereas instead of construing the eighth amendment's \n     prohibition of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' according to \n     its original meaning or its plain and ordinary meaning, the \n     Court followed a two-step approach of first attempting to \n     discern a national consensus regarding the appropriateness of \n     the death penalty for child rape and then applying the \n     Justices' own independent judgment in light of their \n     interpretation of a national consensus and evolving standards \n     of decency;\n       Whereas, to the extent that a national consensus is \n     relevant to the meaning of the eighth amendment, there is \n     national consensus in favor of the death penalty for child \n     rape, as evidenced by the adoption of that penalty by the \n     elected branches of the Federal Government only 2 years ago, \n     and by the swift denunciations of the Kennedy v. Louisiana \n     decision by the presumptive nominees for President of both \n     major political parties;\n       Whereas the evolving standards of decency is an arbitrary \n     construct without foundation in the Constitution of the \n     United States and should have no bearing on Justices who are \n     bound to interpret the laws of the United States;\n       Whereas the standards of decency in the United States have \n     evolved toward approval of the death penalty for child rape, \n     as evidenced by 6 States and the Federal Government adopting \n     that penalty in the past 13 years;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court rendered its opinion without \n     knowledge of a Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists;\n       Whereas the Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists was passed by Congress and signed by the \n     President 2 years before the Supreme Court released the \n     decision; and\n       Whereas the Court presumably would have deferred to the \n     elected branches of government in determining a national \n     consensus regarding evolving standards of decency had it been \n     aware of the Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists at the time that it made the decision: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the depraved conduct of the worst child rapists merits \n     the death penalty;\n       (2) standards of decency allow, and sometimes compel, the \n     death penalty for child rape;\n       (3) the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States allows the death penalty for the rape of a child where \n     the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in \n     death of the victim;\n       (4) the Louisiana statute making child rape punishable by \n     death is constitutional;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States should grant any \n     petition for rehearing of Kennedy v. Louisiana, No. 07-343 \n     (2008), because the case was decided under a mistaken view of \n     Federal law;\n       (6) the portions of the Kennedy v. Louisiana decision \n     regarding the national consensus or evolving standards of \n     decency with respect to the imposition of the death penalty \n     for child rape should not be viewed by Federal or State \n     courts as binding precedent, because the Supreme Court was \n     operating under a mistaken view of Federal law; and\n       (7) the Supreme Court should reverse its decision in \n     Kennedy v. Louisiana, on rehearing or in a future case, \n     because the decision was supported by neither commonly held \n     beliefs about ``cruel and unusual punishment'', nor by the \n     text, structure, or history of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S148-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S148]]\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 4--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ERRONEOUSLY DECIDED KENNEDY V. \n  LOUISIANA, NO. 07-343 (2008), AND THAT THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE \n CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ALLOWS THE IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH \n                    PENALTY FOR THE RAPE OF A CHILD\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Louisiana decision \n     regarding the national consensus or evolving standards of \n     decency with respect to the imposition of the death penalty \n     for child rape should not be viewed by Federal or State \n     courts as binding precedent, because the Supreme Court was \n     operating under a mistaken view of Federal law; and\n       (7) the Supreme Court should reverse its decision in \n     Kennedy v. Louisiana, on rehearing or in a future case, \n     because the decision was supported by neither commonly held \n     beliefs about ``cruel and unusual punishment'', nor by the \n     text, structure, or history of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S148-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 5--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT FOR PRAYER AT SCHOOL BOARD \n                                MEETINGS\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                               S.

Res. 7\n\n       Whereas military families, through their sacrifices and \n     their dedication to the United States and its values, \n     represent the bedrock upon which the United States was \n     founded and upon which the country continues to rely in these \n     perilous and challenging times: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the month of \n     November should be designated as ``National Military Family \n     Month''; and\n       (2) the Senate encourages the people of the United States \n     to observe National Military Family Month with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by introducing a resolution to designate November as National \nMilitary Family Month. As we all know, memories fade, and the hardships \nexperienced by our military families are easily forgotten unless they \ntouch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent ``short week'' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservances on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to \nstimulate media support.\n  A concurrent Resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S149-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 8--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CLAIBORNE \n  DE BORDA PELL, FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF RHODE \n                                 ISLAND\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reed, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Begich, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, \nMr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. \nEnzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nGregg, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nKerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nMartinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. \nMikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \nSalazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \nShelby, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, \nMr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 8, submitted \nearlier today by Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 8) relative to the death of the \n     Honorable Claiborne de Borda Pell, former United States \n     Senator for the State of Rhode Island.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, the people of \nRhode Island, and people across the Nation in mourning the passing of \nSenator Claiborne Pell. It was my honor to serve with him here in the \nSenate. My first term in the Senate coincided with his last years of \ndistinguished service in this body. In particular, I enjoyed the \nopportunity to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee during his time \nas chairman. He was known on the committee, and throughout the Senate \non both sides of the aisle, for his unfailingly kind manner and his \noutstanding commitment to public service, and rightly so.\n  Senator Pell had many accomplishments during his life in public \nservice, including his authorship of legislation that created the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for \nHumanities, but his work to create what came to be known as Pell grants \nwas perhaps his greatest achievement. Pell grants have helped millions \nof Americans attend college who otherwise may not have been able to \nattend due to cost. Higher education is one of the most important \ninvestments our Federal Government can make, and Senator Pell, who was \ndeeply concerned about the emergence of a widening educational gap \nbetween low-income and more affluent Americans, worked to try to ensure \nthat individuals from low-income families are not denied postsecondary \neducation because they cannot afford it. As this new Congress begins, \nit is my hope that we can carry forward Senator Pell's legacy and boost \nFederal need-based grant programs to help ensure the doors of higher \neducation are open to all Americans regardless of their financial \ncircumstances.\n  Senator Pell's success in creating these grants, and giving so many \nAmericans access to higher education, and to a better life, is a \nremarkable legacy. I am proud that I had the chance to serve with \nSenator Pell, and I join Americans across the country in honoring his \nmemory.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 8) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 8\n\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell represented the people of Rhode \n     Island with distinction for 36 years in the United States \n     Senate, from 1961 to 1997, and was the longest-serving \n     Senator in Rhode Island's history;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell served in the United States Coast \n     Guard and the Coast Guard Reserve, beginning in 1941 and \n     retiring in 1978 with the rank of Captain;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell participated in the 1945 United \n     Nations Conference on International Organization that \n     established the United Nations, and was a champion of the \n     United Nations throughout his life;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell served as a Foreign Service Officer \n     from 1945 to 1952;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell sponsored the legislation that, in \n     1965, created the National Endowment for the Arts and the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities and, in 1966, created \n     the National Sea Grant College and Program;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell's vision led to the creation of an \n     improved passenger rail system in the Northeast and across \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell believed that economic means should \n     not be a barrier to a higher education and sponsored \n     legislation creating the Basic Educational Opportunity Grants \n     in 1972, which were renamed ``Pell Grants'' in 1980;\n       Whereas Pell Grants have helped 54,000,000 people in the \n     United States secure a higher education;\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell sought to expand educational \n     opportunities throughout his tenure as a member and as \n     Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts and \n     Humanities;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell served as Chairman of the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations in the 100th through 103rd \n     Congresses;\n       Whereas Claiborne Pell was a champion of human rights who \n     devoted himself to promoting a peaceful resolution to \n     international conflict and the elimination of the threat of \n     nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas the hallmarks of Claiborne Pell's public service \n     were unsurpassed respect, decency, and civility: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret the announcement of the death of the Honorable \n     Claiborne Pell, former member of the United States Senate;\n       (2) the Secretary of the Senate communicate these \n     resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an \n     enrolled copy thereof to the family of the deceased; and\n       (3) that when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned \n     as a further mark of respect to the memory of the Honorable \n     Claiborne Pell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/06/senate-section/article/S152-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 7, 2009\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
