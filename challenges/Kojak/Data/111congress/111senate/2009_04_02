Really, he is representative \nof what that flag is all about--someone who not only comes from a \nlineage of people who have served our country, but this good man has \nserved our country in so many different ways.\n  We came to Washington together in 1982. We came to the Senate \ntogether in 1986. I can remember while I was still in the House of \nRepresentatives I attended a prayer breakfast, and Senator McCain was \nthe presenter. I cannot do justice and I will not even try to describe \nthe presentation he made about a Christmas celebration they had when he \nwas a prisoner of war. He spent so much time in solitary confinement. \nHe could have left the prison much earlier. He would not do that \nbecause his comrades were still there.\n  We take a lot of things for granted. Even though John McCain and I \nhave disagreed on occasion on things political, one thing that will \nalways be in my mind and my heart is people such as John McCain who \nrepresent what our country is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4231-8", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, anyone who turned on C-SPAN2 over the \npast 2 weeks could be excused for wondering what has been going on here \nin the Capitol. Most people outside Washington do not know much about \nreconciliation instructions or points of order. But behind the \nlegislative lingo, an extremely important debate has been taking place \non the Senate floor. It is a debate about the future of our country. \nAnd in the course of that debate, two very different philosophies have \nemerged. On one side are those who think American lives will improve in \ndirect proportion to the size of the Federal Government; that the \nanswer to all the challenges we face as a nation is to just simply \nfollow Europe, where people look to the government for almost \neverything from the cradle to the grave. On the other side are those \nwho think Government has an important role to play in keeping people \nsafe and creating the conditions in which Americans can succeed and \nthat Government can also play a role in helping people weather \ntemporary or permanent troubles and even to provide temporary help to \nprivate institutions if the failure of those institutions imperils the \nwell-being of the whole.\n  But in all these areas, the role of Government is limited. Liberty \nand freedom are primary. The first group defends the administration's \nbudget proposal which we first saw a couple of months ago and which \noutlines the administration's vision for America over the next several \nyears. The second group has warned about the consequences of the \nbudget, which calls for a dramatic and potentially irreversible shift \nof our Nation to the left in the areas of health care, education, and \nprivate enterprise, and which in order to get there imposes the biggest \ntax hike in history, massive spending, and a titanic amount of debt our \nchildren and grandchildren will have to pay back.\n\n  This is a debate that has been worth tuning in to because its outcome \naffects absolutely everyone. So I would like to highlight just a couple \nof things we have seen over the course of this debate that everyone \nshould know.\n  The first thing people should know is the one thing that many already \ndo know: The administration's budget simply taxes too much, spends too \nmuch, and borrows too much at a moment, interestingly enough, when we \ncan least afford it. There is good reason to believe the American \npeople agree. Several of the amendments Republicans have proposed \nadding to the budget as a way of protecting American businesses and \nfamilies have been approved by wide, bipartisan margins.\n  The American people cannot afford new taxes, and that is why Senators \napproved the Johanns amendment yesterday, an amendment which forces an \nopen debate on the budget's proposal for a massive new national energy \ntax that would hit every American family by up to $3,100 a year. As the \nsenior Senator from Missouri put it on Tuesday, ``Families are \nstruggling to make ends meet, unable to pay their mortgage, bills or \ndebts . . . We should oppose an energy tax.''\n  The junior Senator from Nevada also knows Americans cannot afford \nhaving their taxes raised, especially in a recession. That is why he \noffered an amendment yesterday that would make it harder to raise taxes \non middle-class couples. As he put it, ``Americans are struggling to \npay for life's essentials . . . What we should be discussing is \nextending tax relief,'' not raising taxes. This is common sense. His \namendment passed.\n  The junior Senator from Texas knows that business owners cannot \nafford a tax hike. That is why he offered an amendment that would make \nit harder for Democrats to raise taxes on small businesses. This is \nalso common sense. His amendment also was adopted overwhelmingly.\n  Americans know the trouble they get into when they spend money they \ndo not have, and they do not want Government to spend money it does not \nhave. That is why the junior Senator from Alabama came to the floor \nMonday and lamented the lack of fiscal responsibility in this budget.\n  The American people are worried about the size of the national debt, \nand they are worried about a budget that doubles that debt in 5 years \nand triples it in 10--a budget that adds more debt in 5 years than the \nentire debt accumulated under every President from George Washington \nthrough George W. Bush. The senior Senator from Tennessee is worried \nabout the size of the debt too, and that is why he offered an amendment \nto keep the growth of that debt relative to the GDP in check. As he put \nit on the Senate floor on Tuesday:\n\n       This is not a matter of not letting the horse get out of \n     the barn. This recognizes that the horse is already out of \n     the barn and we're trying to put a fence around him before he \n     gets into the next country.\n\n  Democrats rejected that amendment too.\n  Throughout this debate, Americans have started to focus a lot on the \nnational debt, and they have heard some troubling things.\n  If they were listening Tuesday, they would have heard a very \nilluminating discussion on the topic between the senior Senator from \nTennessee and the senior Senator from New Hampshire. The senior Senator \nfrom New Hampshire said that at the end of this budget, every American \nhousehold will have an obligation relative to the Federal debt of \n$133,000--$133,000 per household. The senior Senator from Tennessee \nasked who holds that debt. The answer, of course, is that China is the \nprimary holder of that debt, along with Russia and oil-producing \nnations in the Middle East.\n  Americans are worried about more Government spending, higher taxes, \nand higher debt that we may never be able to repay, and a lot of groups \nthat represent these Americans are amassing against these things. \nGroups opposed to this budget include the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Tax Relief Coalition, the American Conservative \nUnion, Americans for Prosperity, Citizens Against Government Waste, the \nClub for Growth, the Council on National Policy, Associated Builders \nand Contractors, Independent Electric Contractors, International \nFoodservice Distributors Administration, and the National Association \nof Wholesaler-Distributors. These groups represent millions of small \nbusiness owners, independent contractors, and millions of ordinary \nAmericans who do not want to see their dreams fade away because of \nsomeone else's vision of what Government should do for them.\n  Americans want the freedom to do for themselves, and they worry \nfreedom may slip away if this budget passes in its current form. They \ncannot afford a new national energy tax that could cost every American \nhousehold up to $3,100 a year. They do not want to have to pay for \n250,000 bureaucrats who will be needed just to spend the money this \nbudget wants to spend. And they do not want their children literally \nburied in debt. What Americans want is for Republicans and Democrats to \nwork together to craft a budget that let's them keep their hard-earned \nwages, spends their tax dollars wisely, and does not saddle their \nchildren and grandchildren with debt. That is what they have not seen \nthis week.\n  What they also will not see are the backdoor negotiations where the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator from North Dakota, \nhas said he will strip out many of these good amendments we have \nadopted this week and where some budget writers intend to fast track a \nmassive new energy tax even though we passed an amendment to keep that \nfrom happening. Americans oppose this energy tax. And if the senior \nSenator from North Dakota has as much influence over the outcome of the \nbudget as I hope he does, then he will make sure that the will of the \nSenate and the American people is reflected in the final product. I \nhope he will make sure that a new national energy tax costing American \nhouseholds up to $3,100 a year is not rushed through Congress on a \nparty-line vote.\n  So the drama that has unfolded in the Senate put two very different \nphilosophies on display. It showed Republicans fighting to keep our \nNation from an irreversible drift to the left, and it showed some \nDemocrats agreeing to\n\n[[Page S4233]]\n\nsome of our proposals. But the proof of their commitment is in the \nfinal product--what finally comes out of conference.\n\n  This debate isn't over with the passage of this budget today, and \nRepublicans are not finished fighting on behalf of the priorities of \nthe American people--not even close.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4233-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 13, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2010, revising the appropriate budgetary levels \n     for fiscal year 2009, and setting forth the appropriate \n     budgetary levels for fiscal years 2011 through 2011.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Ensign amendment No. 805, to require certain higher income \n     beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit to pay higher premiums, as is currently required for \n     physicians' services and outpatient services, and as proposed \n     in the budget of the U.S. Government most recently submitted \n     by the President.\n       McCain amendment No. 882, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \n90 minutes of debate remaining on the resolution, of which 40 minutes \nis for the debate of amendment No. 882, offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to respond briefly to the \nRepublican leader and then we will go to the McCain amendment.\n  First of all, I have just listened to remarks that are an attempt to \nrewrite history. Trying to put this deficit and this debt at the door \nof our new President is simply misplaced. He inherited a debt that was \ndoubled over the last 8 years, and most of my friends on the other side \nwere silent sentinels as that debt grew and grew and grew. Most of them \nsaid nothing; worse, they supported the policies that created that \ndoubling of the debt. Beyond that, they tripled foreign holdings of \nU.S. debt and left the country in the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. This President inherited a crisis in the financial markets, \na crisis in housing, a fiscal crisis, and two wars.\n  The budget that is before us is not as described by the Republican \nleader. The budget before us reduces the deficit by two-thirds over the \n5 years of its term. In fact, as a share of GDP--which most economists \nsay ought to be the measuring point because it excludes inflation--we \nreduce the deficit by three-quarters, all while maintaining the \nPresident's key priorities of reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy. That is not just a Presidential priority, that is an American \npriority. If we are going to be strong in the future, we have to \ndramatically reduce our dependence on foreign energy.\n  On education, there is a focus on excellence in education. If we are \nnot the best educated, we are not going to be the strongest country in \nthe world very long.\n  The prospect of major health care reform, which is provided for in \nthis budget, is the 800-pound gorilla. We are now spending $1 of every \n$6 in this country on health care. If we stay on the current trend, we \nwill spend more than $1 of every $3 in this country on health care. \nThat is utterly unsustainable.\n  They describe the budget of the President as having all these tax \nincreases. I would remind my colleagues that when the Congressional \nBudget Office scores the President's budget, they say there is $2.2 \ntrillion in tax cuts. If they look at the budget I have offered, which \nis a 5-year budget instead of a 10-year budget, it has $825 billion in \ntax cuts on a net basis. As I say, all while cutting the deficit in \nhalf, which was the President's goal. In the President's budget and the \nbudget I have offered, we cut it by two-thirds.\n  Now, on spending. Well, on spending, the hard fact is, the budget I \nhave offered reduces deficits and debt by $608 billion compared to the \nPresident's budget, on a 5-year comparison to a 5-year comparison. We \nreduce it by $608 billion in the budget that is before us. And on \nspending, we increase domestic spending, on average, by 2\\1/2\\ percent \na year. Believe me, I have heard lots of criticism from the left with \nrespect to the fact that is not enough. But when you lose $2.3 trillion \nin revenue because of the new CBO forecast, we felt it was necessary to \nmake adjustments in the President's budget while maintaining his \npriorities.\n  Now, in terms of middle-class tax relief, which is contained in this \nbudget, let me be clear that all the provisions from 2001 and 2003 are \nincluded in this budget. The 10-percent bracket, the child tax credit, \nthe marriage penalty relief, the education incentives--all of it--is in \nthis budget and an extension for the full 5 years.\n  In addition, the President's Make Work Pay provision was previously \nprovided for in the stimulus package for 2 years, and we provide the \nability to extend that, if there are offsets. In addition, we have \nprovided for alternative minimum tax reform, fully funded for 3 years. \nNo other budgets in the last 5 years have done it for that long. It has \nalways been a year-by-year fix.\n  On estate tax reform, we take the provisions from 2009 and extend \nthem for 2010--a $3.5 million exemption per person, $7 million per \nfamily. Instead of going back to $1 million in 2011, we continue that \n$3.5 million exclusion per person, $7 million per couple, adjusted for \ninflation.\n  We also provide for the business tax provisions and the extenders \nfully paid for. That is a total of almost a trillion dollars of tax \nrelief, offset by certain loophole closers to go after these abusive \ntax shelters--these offshore tax havens. We have the spectacle now of \ncompanies buying European sewer systems, not because they are in the \nsewer business but in order to depreciate them on their books for U.S. \ntax purposes. That is outrageous--United States companies buying \nEuropean sewer systems so they can write them off on their books here, \nand then they lease them back to the European cities that built them in \nthe first place.\n  The guys who came up with these scams didn't limit themselves to \nsewer systems. They are doing the same thing with public buildings and \ncity halls. We have companies that have bought city halls in Europe in \norder to depreciate them on their books in the United States and then \nlease the city halls back to the European countries that built them in \nthe first place. Is that acceptable? I don't think so. The President in \nhis budget and we in our budget say: Enough of that. Let's shut down \nthese abusive tax shelters. Let's shut down these offshore tax havens, \nwhich our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations tells us is costing \nus $100 billion a year.\n  If anybody wonders about it, read the Stanford saga. Mr. Stanford was \nrunning these offshore tax havens; running billions of dollars through \nthese offshore tax havens. Why? Why are they sending their money down \nto the Cayman Islands? Is it because they think the banks down there \nare more secure? Oh, no. They are sending their money down there to \ndodge the tax liability in the United States. That is the basis upon \nwhich Mr. Stanford sold his services.\n  On a net basis, our budget has $825 billion in tax cuts. Again, on \nspending, domestic spending increased at an average rate of 2\\1/2\\ \npercent a year. That is pretty tough.\n  In our proposal, in the budget before the body, there is no energy \ntax. There is none contained here. This reference to a national sales \ntax on energy, it is not in this budget proposal. It is not there. We \nhave a reserve fund that permits the committees of jurisdiction to come \nup with a way of reducing our dependence on foreign energy. We have the \nability for the committees of jurisdiction to write climate change \nlegislation. But there is no endorsement of any specific plan in this \nbudget around climate change that has been posited by others.\n  I wish to make clear that this budget is responsible, it controls \nspending, it\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nreduces the deficit by two-thirds, it extends the middle-class tax \ncuts, and it adopts the President's priorities of reducing our \ndependence on foreign energy, putting a focus on excellence in \neducation and providing the possibility of major health care reform. \nThose are the priorities of the American people, and they are contained \nin our budget.\n  Our budget has made significant adjustments from the President's. \nAgain, over 5 years, we have reduced the deficit and debt in the \nPresident's proposal by $608 billion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 882, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain \nsubstitute amendment be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman \nin allowing me to do this modification. I am aware it could have been \nobjected to, and I would like to say that the sense-of-the-Senate \nprovision is removed because I believe that sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions are not done this year in the budget resolution. There was \na formula glitch that affected some of the funding levels. We have \ncorrected the problem in the modification. We have corrected budget \nauthority and spending levels.\n  I thank my friend for allowing me to make this modification.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican time be allocated as follows, between now and the time of \nthe vote: that Senator Hutchison be allowed 5 minutes on the substitute \namendment, Senator Graham 5 minutes, Senator Coburn 5 minutes, myself 5 \nminutes, Senator Gregg 10 minutes, Senator Inhofe 3 minutes, Senator \nSessions 5 minutes, Senator Chambliss 2 minutes, and Senator Wicker 2 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S4241]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, first, wish to thank Senator McCain \nfor leading this effort to present an alternative because we all know, \nafter looking at the Democratic budget and the Obama administration \nbudget which produced the Democratic budget, that the debt is \nunsustainable. This is a budget that would double our debt in 5 years, \nand if it goes out to 10, it would triple our debt. As a matter of \nfact, it spends too much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too much.\n  We have to start putting some common sense in this budget process or \nwe are going to go into an abyss. We must take the reins of this budget \nand hold it back. Today, our debt-to-gross domestic product is 57 \npercent. That is pretty high. The average over the last 50 years has \nbeen about 40 percent. This underlying budget today would take our \ndebt-to-gross domestic product ratio to 80 percent. That is simply \nunsustainable on a long-term basis. During the Great Depression, during \nWorld War II, we saw numbers such as that, but you cannot sustain it \nover a long period of time. It was brought back down after World War II \nso that it was in the 30-percent range. Forty percent is optimum. We \nare at 57. We would go to 80 if we don't do something.\n  That is why Senator McCain and those of us who are cosponsoring his \nsubstitute are trying to do the right thing. We are trying to produce \nan alternative that is responsible and takes care of the needs of our \ncountry at the same time.\n\n  The key points of this substitute are that we would cap discretionary \nspending at baseline levels plus inflation, except for defense and \nveterans. That means every program we have can grow with inflation. You \nare not cutting anything from today, but you are allowing it to just \ngrow by inflation, which will cap it--except for defense, which does \nincrease, and our veterans, which does increase. We have increased our \nveterans, we have increased defense, we continue to do so because we \nknow our duty to those who are serving our country and protecting our \nfreedom.\n  This substitute also extends the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. That means \nmarriage penalty relief will be extended. It means we will not put a \nshock into the stock market by increasing the capital gains and \ndividends rates at a time when we want to shore up our stock market. \nThe worst thing we can do is send a signal that those taxes are going \nto go up in 2 years when our economy is already flailing. It will lower \neveryone's tax burden--everyone's. It will keep that 10-percent rate \ninstead of moving it up. It will keep everyone's tax burden lower.\n  Marriage penalty relief is something I am going to offer an amendment \non if this substitute does not pass because we need to make it \npermanent. The marriage penalty in this country, if we go back to the \nway it used to be, is over $1,000 a couple. Is this a country that \nwants to dissuade people from getting married? That is the core of our \nfamily support in this country. Our substitute will extend the tax \ncuts, including marriage penalty, including every bracket, and \nincluding capital gains and dividends, to encourage savings and shore \nup our stock market.\n  It also takes the bigger picture view. This is a 10-year substitute, \nso it ensures that revenues collected from closing the tax gap would \nonly be used for debt reduction. This is planning for the future. This \nis saying we are going to bring down that debt burden that is in the \nunderlying bill before us. It will not be used to increase Federal \nspending because we are going to cap that at the baseline plus \ninflation. We are not going to hurt anyone. We are not going to also \nadd to our debt. In fact, we would cut $4 trillion from the budget that \nis before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I hope my colleagues will look at this responsible \nalternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the thing many of my colleagues don't \nknow is, before I was a physician I was an accountant, and the thing \nabout numbers is you can make them show anything you want. That, \nhistorically, is what Republicans and Democrats have done with budgets. \nThey play games. The only year that counts is the next year, this next \n2010 fiscal year. That is the only thing that counts in terms of what \nthey are going to do.\n  The important thing before us ought to be the following: At the end \nof the budget that is offered by both President Obama and the majority, \nthe deficit will be higher than it has ever been any time prior to this \nyear, and it will not go down. It will never go down, in light of that, \nin terms of a sustainable level.\n  The second point I want to make on this budget is this budget is a \nreal budget that says to every American except our fighting men and \nwomen and our seniors and our veterans: Everybody has to sacrifice for \nus to get out of the mess we are in. The sacrifice will not necessarily \nbe hard because of the tremendous amount of waste that is in the \nFederal Government right now. At a conservative minimum, 10 percent of \neverything we spend is pure waste or fraud. We will not do anything \nabout it. One of the things with the McCain budget, the Republican \nbudget, is that it will force us to do something about it.\n  We take some of that $380 billion a year that is now defrauded of the \nFederal Government, or pure waste, and we will recapture that to do \nsomething positive. But the underlying point is, as Americans, if we \nare going to get out of the problems we are in, we cannot spend our way \ninto prosperity, and we can't borrow our way out of debt. That is what \nthis budget does. It attempts to grow Federal Government.\n  The claim is that it only grows it 2 percent over 5 years. But when \nyou look at the numbers in this budget, it grows at 7 percent in the \nnext year, in terms of discretionary spending. Then all the pain is \nafter that. We all know the reality of the Senate. There will not be \nany pain. It will be 7 percent the year after that. You watch what \ncomes from the appropriators.\n  The House budget has a 12-percent increase in it. The President's had \nan 11-percent increase. We can hear all these statements on the floor, \nbut the No. 1 fact is, everybody in this country is going to have to \nsacrifice except those who have already sacrificed. If we do anything \nless than that, then what we are doing is sacrificing the future of our \nkids and our grandkids.\n  In this budget we have a proposal that will pick up the 11 million \nAmericans who are eligible for Medicaid who are not even getting health \ncare now and, at the same time, save the States $88 billion a year and \nsave the Federal Government $40 billion a year and improve the health \ncare of everybody on Medicaid today. That is $1.3 trillion of \nefficiency in health care that we will save. The States will love the \nplan.\n  Does it fit into the overall plan of what we have now? Is it the only \nway we can do it? No. But the fact is, 40 percent of the doctors and \ncaregivers in our country today will not even see a Medicaid patient. \nWe are up to almost 20 percent not seeing a Medicare patient. We have \nto do something about that. But we don't need more money in health \ncare; what we need is a more efficient market and common sense in the \nway we spend the money so we get great quality care at a fair price, \nwhich is not happening today.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the McCain budget because of the \nsignificant truth that underlies it, that everybody is going to have to \nsacrifice some. Everybody has to sacrifice if we are to get out of the \nmess we are in. You can be critical of it, but the fact is, there is no \nprogram, in terms of total dollars, that is going to see a marked \ndecrease in terms of spending without getting exactly the same or \nbetter results.\n  Our President said he wants a line-by-line review of every program, \nthat he wants competitive bidding, he wants metrics. That is what we \ndo. We actually do what the average American would do. We apply common \nsense to the way the Government spends money, and we look at it and say \nwe cannot continue on the path we are on without bankrupting our kids.\n  The very real possibility that out of the budget that is being \npresented today we will have a fiat currency or a currency that is \ninflated, which will devalue the assets of everybody in this country, \nis absolutely real and recognized.\n\n[[Page S4242]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for the time to speak on \nhis budget, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 35 minutes and the \nRepublicans also have 35 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask to be notified after 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator. The \nSenator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I appreciate the \ncomments that have been made. I agree first with Senator Coburn's \ncomments about our distinguished chairman's pride in spending less \nmoney than the Obama proposal called for for discretionary spending \nover 5 years. He said he saved $600 billion--and it should save some. \nHowever, President Obama's budget was an 11-percent increase.\n  Senator Conrad came in with a 7-percent increase, which is huge in \nlight of the money we are spending on top of that with the stimulus \npackage we just passed; and at 7 percent, Government spending would \ndouble in 10 years. But the House is at 12 percent. So when the bill \ngoes to conference, it is not going to be at 7, it is going to be at \n10, 11, maybe 12 percent.\n  No. 2, his savings are projected in years 2, 3, 4 and 5, and as \nSenator Coburn said, when we come back next year, this body, if the \nsame Members are here, is going to have another 7 percent or 10 \npercent. The only one that counts is this year. So I do not believe we \nhave a real change in this budget. I believe Mr. Orszag is correct--the \nPresident's budget manager--that this is 98 percent of what he asked \nfor and he asked for a budget over 10 years that doubles the debt in 5 \nyears and triples it in 10. It triples the debt in 10. It is admitted \nby the President's own budget. It is in the numbers he sent to us. We \nare not making this up. That is No. 1.\n  I have several amendments I will be calling to my colleagues' \nattention. One is the Comprehensive Outer Continental Shelf Study. We \nhave no idea today how much oil and gas may be off our coasts, our \nAtlantic coast and Pacific coast. Particularly, the Atlantic States are \neager to know what is out there and to consider whether they want to \nproduce out there. I think it has great potential for America.\n  Every barrel of oil and energy we can produce in the United States \noff our shores so we do not have to transfer our wealth to Saudi Arabia \nor Venezuela or places around the world but keep it here creating jobs \nand revenue is progress for America in a significant way. That is an \namendment on which I hope we will have bipartisan support.\n  Missile defense, I am working with Senator Lieberman on that. I am \nconcerned there might be some belief that we can ease off the \ncompletion of missile defense. Our missile defense system now has 26 \nlaunchers already built or contracted for; we want to do 44. After \nyears and years of science and technology and investment, we are about \nto be able to complete a missile defense system that will make us all \nproud and can protect us from such things as a North Korean launch. If \nwe don't get this system up like we need it, we will not be able to do \nthat.\n  I believe today our technology would knock down that missile if it \nreached the United States. We need to complete that program. If we slow \nit down, it will just drive up the cost even more. That is important.\n  I am concerned about the history of this Congress when it deals with \nborder security. We have voted repeatedly--the last big vote was 80 to \n19--to complete 700 miles of fencing and barriers on our border. The \nmoney often does not get appropriated, however. We vote and say we are \nfor it, but when the chips are down the money doesn't get funded. This \nwould call on us to complete the funding for that project. I think all \nof us would want to complete what we have started.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I want to say it is not impossible for \nus at least to move substantially toward a balanced budget. In the \nimmediate years ahead it is going to be hard to get to a balanced \nbudget. But the President's budget does not attempt to do so. In fact, \nin years 7 and 10 of his budget, his deficits are not going down. This \nis his own document he submitted to us--they are surging upward. In his \n10th year, the Congressional Budget Office says his deficit will be, in \n1 year, $1.2 trillion. That will be almost three times the highest \ndeficit this country has ever had in its history.\n  I thank Senator McCain and others who are working on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains under my control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time is under the control of \nSenator McCain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining on the McCain \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the debate on the McCain \namendment appear all as one piece in the Record. I think that will be \nbetter for those reading this at some point in the future, if someone \ndoes care to read it in the future. It will be better if we keep the \nMcCain debate all together as one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. First, I thank and congratulate the Senator from Arizona \nfor producing a budget and a budget alternative. That was not done on \ntheir side until he did it, and I commend him for it.\n  I also commend him for producing a budget that in its overall totals \nis very close to the budget resolution I have advanced through the \nBudget Committee.\n  In fact, if you compare Senator McCain's 5-year totals with my 5-year \ntotals, compare his revenue to my revenue, his spending to my spending, \nthey are 98 percent alike. In addition, the size of the deficit in 2014 \nis virtually the same. Mine is 2.9 percent of GDP, his is 2.8. And the \ndebt, mine is 98.7, his is 98.3, virtually identical in 2014.\n  So there is some commonality here, and that is something perhaps we \ncan build on. Of course, there are differences, and differences do \nmatter. Largely they appear in two places. The Senator from Arizona \nappears to reduce mandatory spending by $350 billion over 5 years.\n  But where does he do it? Does he show savings in Medicare? No. Does \nhe show savings in Medicaid and the health care accounts? No. Does he \nshow savings in Social Security? No. Does he show savings in \nagriculture? No. He does not do it in any of those places that are the \nmajor pots of money for mandatory spending. Instead, he takes all of \nthe $350 billion in savings in Function 920. That is the general \noverhead function for all of those categories.\n  So, in effect, what he has is an across-the-board cut in Medicare, \nMedicaid, Social Security, agriculture, and that is how this budget \nwould work. I do not know if that is the intention, but that is what \nwould happen.\n  In fact, excluding debt service, 85 percent of the claimed savings \nare from function 920, no specific savings at all. Where are the \nremaining 15 percent of the savings? Largely, they are in the \ninternational affairs budget. Relative to the budget resolution before \nus, and that is before we adopted the Kerry amendment yesterday, he \nreduces spending on international accounts by $44 billion over the 5 \nyears. The Senator from Arizona assumes an increase of 1.3 percent in \n2010 and less than 1 percent over the remaining 5 years. That runs \ncounter to what the Secretary of Defense has asked of us because he has \nasked that we plus-up the international accounts so that things that \nreally ought to be done in the international accounts, instead of the \nDefense Department accounts, be shown there.\n\n[[Page S4243]]\n\n  Disturbingly, next year, when we will still be recovering from the \nworst recession since the Great Depression, the budget advanced by the \nSenator from Arizona would cut nondefense discretionary spending, \ncompared to the resolution before us, by $23 billion. Those cuts would \naffect virtually every discretionary function, although not defense and \nnot veterans. I commend him for holding them harmless, but that means \neverything else has to be cut more. That means education, the health \ncare accounts--all of those would have to be cut.\n  In terms of looking at a budget in a fair and balanced way, while I \ncommend the Senator for producing a budget, it is a budget without \ndetail, a budget without specificity, a budget that is almost ``paint \nyour own picture.'' Because he has this $350 billion of savings in \nfunction 920, because he doesn't specify, that would have to be done \nacross the board. That means all of these other functions--Medicare, \nSocial Security, agriculture, all of the other mandatory accounts--\nwould have to take significant across-the-board cuts.\n  I commend the Senator from Arizona for offering an alternative, but I \nthink the difference between his plan and my plan in overall numbers is \nvery small, but the differences that do exist matter a great deal.\n  One other point I want to make: As with many of my GOP colleagues' \namendments, the McCain amendment would create 60-vote points of order \nagainst future budget resolutions, threatening the ability to maintain \nthe disciplines that come through the budget process. Caps on \ndiscretionary spending, allocations to committees, the supermajority \npoints of order against excessive spending--all of that would be put at \nrisk in the name of preventing the growth of deficits and debt. While I \nshare the basic idea and the basic value of trying to control deficits \nand debt, as an unintended consequence, the cure here is worse than the \ndisease. When the answer is to make it harder to do a budget \nresolution, you actually lose the disciplines we could employ in order \nto reduce the growth of deficits and debt.\n  It is a curious thing, if one thinks about it. The way to prevent the \ngrowth of debt is not to do a budget or make it harder to do a budget. \nUnfortunately, around here one of the few things we have to discipline \nspending is a budget. That is where all the points of order lie when we \ngo to the appropriations process. If it were successful, if you were \nable to prevent doing a budget resolution, you would then immediately \ngo to appropriations bills and you would have no points of order, no \n60-vote hurdles against excessive spending. We want to think carefully \nwhether that is the answer.\n  My own view is, we would be much better off doing some kind of \nspecial process where all of the major players are at the table, \neverything is on the table, and we have a special process to get \nwhatever plan they develop to the floor for an actual vote. My own \nbelief is, after 22 years of this, the only real hope for changing the \nunderlying policies, for disciplining entitlements, for fundamental tax \nreform, the only way to do that is some sort of special bipartisan \nprocess where everybody is at the table, everything is on the table, \nand the work of that group comes to the floor for a guaranteed vote. \nThat is the best hope we have.\n  With that, I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself a couple of minutes.\n  First, the fundamental difference between the proposal before us and \nmy proposal is that the budget as proposed has a growth in 2010 for \nnondefense spending of 8 percent, with about 1 percent growth in each \nof the following years from 2011 to 2014. That is an old gimmick. The \nbudget proposal before us caps discretionary funding in 2010, which \nfront-loads all the higher costs in the first year. Without caps in the \noutyears, we will find ourselves right back here next year listening to \nwhy the administration can't possibly live with an increase in 2011 of \nless than 1 percent as recommended in the budget.\n  Mandatory spending is more than Social Security and Medicare. It is \ngeneral sciences, space, energy, natural resources. Every estimate we \nhave is that we could cut 10 percent immediately in unnecessary and \nwasteful spending and fraud across the board, including Medicare, \nincluding all of these other programs. We are asking Americans who are \ntightening their belts, we are asking every State legislature in \nAmerica to make tough decisions, and we are not making those tough \ndecisions. We are just going on as if it were business as usual. An 8-\npercent increase in spending for 2010? Tell me one State legislature in \nAmerica or any family in America that can afford an 8-percent increase \nin their budget. Only we can because we print money.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona \nyield 2 minutes to me to speak on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is allotted 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, as everyone knows, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee happens to be a dear friend of mine, a guy with \nwhom I work on any number of issues on a regular basis. I empathize \nwith him for having to take what I think has been generally recognized \nas a freewheeling spending budget coming from the White House and try \nto evolve that into something that is meaningful and much more \nresponsible. Unfortunately, that is a difficult task. I don't think it \nhas been done. I thought for a minute, in listening to the chairman of \nthe committee speak about the McCain alternative, that perhaps he was \ngoing to support it. But I understand why he can't.\n  There is one other major difference the Budget Committee chairman \nfails to point out between the President's budget and the Democratic \nbudget we will be voting on, and it is a fundamental difference. The \nPresident's budget and the Democratic budget focus on where we are \ngoing to spend money, versus the McCain budget which seeks to reduce \nFederal spending for the short term and the long term. The reason that \nis a fundamental difference is that when you look at the President's \nbudget and you look at the Democratic budget, in the year 2019, for \nexample, the amount of money that will be owed as interest on the debt \nwill exceed the amount of money we are going to spend on discretionary \ndefense. That is outrageous.\n  I have four grandchildren. Two of them are brand new. They are the \nones who will be charged with repaying this debt. By passing the \nDemocratic budget and the President's budget, there is simply no way \nthe grandchildren of all of us are ever going to be able to pay the \nmoney back.\n  I urge support for the McCain alternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I didn't mention at the beginning of my response, but I wish to \nexpress my appreciation for the way the chairman, Senator Conrad, and \nSenator Gregg have handled this debate. People have had a good \nopportunity to express their views. The worst part, obviously, is \ncoming up in about 20 minutes. Both the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the committee have handled the debate in a fashion \nbetter than I have ever seen in the past. I congratulate both of them \nfor allowing virtually every Member of the Senate to express their \nviews on this important issue.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I inquire if the Senator from Arizona \nwishes to go on his amendment. Do we still have Senator Graham?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think he is on his way.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I say, I was told a number of years ago that one of \nour colleagues called in and said he was on his way, that he was at the \nairport, and then it turned out he was at the Philadelphia airport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the chairman.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues where we are. We have a national debt \nof $10.7\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\ntrillion. The budget that was proposed by the President was $3.6 \ntrillion. What we are looking at is a debt of $10.7 trillion. The Fed \njust pumped $1.2 trillion into the economy. The TARP, Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, was $700 billion. We passed an omnibus bill of $410 \nbillion. Prior to that, we passed a $1.1 trillion stimulus package. And \nto cap it all off, the Chinese own $2 trillion of our paper, of our \ndebt.\n  This is an unprecedented expenditure of the taxpayers' dollars, and \nwith no way of paying for it. So these are extraordinary times, and we \nneed to do extraordinary things. But let's try not to ignore what we \nare doing to future generations of Americans. Especially this time of \nyear, I see lots of our citizens around the halls of Congress wearing \nbadges and buttons and carrying signs and advocating for the causes and \nefforts they believe in. Generally speaking, those causes and efforts, \nin their view, require more of our tax dollars. I understand that. I \nappreciate it. And it is wonderful to see people exercising their right \nto petition Congress, which is guaranteed by the Constitution.\n  But I do not see anybody who is in the halls of Congress for my kids \nand my grandkids and your kids and your grandkids. We are laying an \nastronomical debt on them, which they will have to pay for sooner or \nlater. One of the ways to pay for it is to debase the currency and \nprint money. The result of that is hyperinflation, which is the \ngreatest enemy of the middle class, and we have seen that before in the \n1970s.\n  So, yes, this is a tough budget I am talking about. Yes, these are \ncaps on discretionary spending. Tell me of a family in America--\nhardly--that is not having to put a cap on their spending. Tell me of a \nState legislature in America that is not having to put a cap on their \nspending because of enormous debts. My home State of Arizona is looking \nat a billion-dollar deficit. That is small compared to what is \nhappening in California.\n  Madam President, I ask for 2 additional minutes from Senator Gregg's \ntime.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So my point here is--by the way, one of the areas I agree \nwith both Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad is, we have to have a \ncommission that meets and makes tough decisions on entitlements. We \nknow entitlements cannot be sustained at their present level. And, of \ncourse, the first area we ought to look at is the $60 billion the \ninspector general has said is wasted in Medicare and Medicaid every \nyear. But tough decisions have to be made.\n  This is a tough budget proposal here. This is tough. It caps \ndiscretionary spending, except for defense and veterans. It increases \ndefense spending. We are in two wars. We are in two wars, and I wish to \ngive a little straight talk. In Afghanistan it is going to get worse \nbefore it gets better, and it is going to cost more of American blood \nand treasure.\n  It reduces the deficit and debt more than the proposals offered by \nthe Senate Budget Committee or the President, and I would point out \nthat 10 years is what we have to plan for rather than 5. It addresses \nthe critical problem of Social Security and Medicare solvency by the \nestablishment--according to the proposal both by the chairman and \nranking member--of BRAC-like commissions that would provide \nrecommendations to reduce mandatory spending by at least 4 percent over \nthe next 5 years.\n  It addresses our critical energy goals, and it also extends the tax \ncuts. This is the wrong time to increase anyone's taxes. History shows \nus if we raise people's taxes in tough economic times, it exacerbates \nthe economic problems.\n  I do not pretend this is easy. I do not pretend this does not affect \nmany Americans and their lives. But if we lay these multitrillion-\ndollar debts on future generations of Americans, we have contradicted \nand betrayed the commitment this Nation has kept throughout our \nhistory; that is, that the next generation of Americans inherit a \nbetter Nation than the one we did.\n  Madam President, I urge a vote for this amendment and this alternate \nbudget proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, could the Chair inform us of the time \nremaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 9 minutes. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has 7\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator from \nOklahoma has 3 minutes. The Senator from South Carolina has 5 minutes. \nThe Senator from Mississippi has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I think I will take a bit of my time, \nthen, as we await these other Senators. Perhaps the cloakroom could \ncheck on the availability of Senators who have time so we can use the \ntime effectively and efficiently.\n  With respect to Senator McCain's amendment, his substitute, I want to \nagain indicate there is virtually no difference between the debt at the \nend of the 5 years under his amendment and the amendment that has come \nthrough the Senate Budget Committee. The debt as a share of GDP on the \nbudget that is on the floor is 98.7 percent of GDP in 2014. In the \nsubstitute amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, it is 98.3 \npercent. There is virtually no difference in the debt levels under the \nMcCain amendment and the budget I have offered our colleagues.\n  With respect to deficits, in 2014, the deficit as a share of GDP in \nthe budget that is before us is 2.9 percent. Under the McCain \namendment, it is 2.8 percent.\n  So I say to my colleagues, if you rack up, if you look at his revenue \ncompared to my revenue: 98 percent the same. His spending versus my \nspending: 98 percent the same. Where have we heard that figure before?\n  I think the point that needs to be made, though, is that there are \ndifferences, and the differences do matter. The big difference here is \nthe Senator from Arizona saves $350 billion out of the mandatory \naccounts, but he does not say where. He does not say where. He does not \nsay it is out of Medicare. He does not say it is out of Social \nSecurity. He does not say it is out of agriculture. He does not say it \nis out of the other mandatory accounts. He puts all $350 billion in \nsection 920, which is an across-the-board cut in all of them--$350 \nbillion.\n  Colleagues, if you want to be voting for cuts that could be $350 \nbillion in Medicare and Social Security, vote for the McCain \nalternative. If you do not think that is a real good idea, stick with \nthe budget that is before us. Because we have been specific about where \nthe revenues are, about where the spending is, and we have tried to be \ndisciplined about getting down to virtually the same levels on deficits \nand debt that are in the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, if it is all right with the bill \nmanagers, I would ask for 7 minutes to speak in support of the McCain \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes under the order.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Five minutes. OK, thank you, Madam President.\n  I stand today in support of an alternative budget that is being \nproposed by Senator McCain and others. This country is trying to write \na budget for the American people. That should not be unknown to the \nAmerican people. They are doing it every day. Every business is writing \na budget. Every family is trying to plan a budget. The one thing \nfamilies and businesses are doing is they are tightening their belts. \nWell, we are not. We are buying a bigger belt. We are buying a bigger \nsuit.\n  We are trying to mask the fact that we are grossly overburdened. The \nbudget before us is better than President Obama's budget. But Peter \nOrszag of OMB says it is 98 percent the same. So we are tying to find a \ndifferent path. You can evaluate the people running your country as to \nhow they want to spend your money and how much.\n  What we are proposing in this budget is to basically freeze domestic \nspending, except for defense and veterans--to\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\ndo what you are doing, basically; that is, control your spending, to \nget by on the same amount of money, with allowing some growth in some \nneeded areas, but to rein in what will be a dramatic increase over time \nof domestic spending. I think we can do that.\n  We are spending trillions of dollars. We have trillions of dollars \navailable to us. I know we could get by for another year or two on that \nsame amount of money, allowing growth in certain key areas if we wanted \nto. But we don't have to. It is a choice we make. You don't have that \nchoice. You can't go and print money. If you write a bad check, you go \nto jail; we call it good government. So you have choices. You have to \nmake choices. We seem not to be bound by any choices.\n\n  If you are going to build a budget from a Federal level, what is the \nmost important thing? At home and in your business, you build a budget \naround the essentials of what your family needs and what your business \nneeds. I think we should be building a budget around securing the \nNation. Under the budget of President Obama, defense spending goes from \n4.7 percent of GDP--we are in Iraq and Afghanistan; there are all kinds \nof threats from Iran, North Korea, you name it; the world is a very \ndangerous place--and over 10 years, his defense budget takes spending \ndown to 3 percent of GDP. I don't know what he is listening to in terms \nof intelligence reports, but I don't think this world is safe right \nnow, and now is not the time to cut defense. The budget I am \nsupporting, Senator McCain's alternative, does away with tax increases \non the job creators. If you make over $250,000 a year, your taxes are \ngoing to go up by about 25 percent. At a time when we are trying to get \npeople to expand their business--and I can tell my colleagues one \nthing, and John Kennedy understood this--if you raise taxes, people do \nless business. If you raise the capital gains rates from 15 to 20, \npeople do less capital gains transactions because there is a penalty to \nengage in business activity. So now is not the time to raise taxes on \nanyone.\n  We have to compete with China and India. When you pass on the cost of \ndoing business--and that is what will happen--the American consumer \nsuffers and the American business community is going to suffer because \nthey are competing with people in a global economy who do not have all \nthese tax burdens.\n  The biggest problem this country faces in terms of long-term debt is \nSocial Security and Medicare. These are entitlement programs. When you \nget retirement eligible under Social Security, you get a check based on \nyour contributions. Nobody wants to allow that system to go bankrupt, \nbut it is headed toward bankruptcy. Why? Because the amount of money \ncoming in and the amount of money obligated do not match.\n  When I was born in 1955, there were 15 workers for every retiree. \nToday there are three and in 20 years there will be two. People will \nnot be able--two workers will not be able to meet the obligations that \nare owed through the Social Security system unless we act now. This \nbudget puts aside a reserve program to deal with saving Social \nSecurity. Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid are a very large \npart of our budget, and they are on autopilot. I commend the President \nfor wanting to do something in health care, but in his budget, he adds \n$1.6 trillion as a downpayment on health care reform.\n  We already spend more money than any country in the world on health \ncare. Rather than adding another $1 trillion into the system, let's see \nif we can better manage the money we have today. This budget puts a new \nearmark system in place so Senators and Congressmen cannot, in the \nmiddle of the night----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is an alternative that makes sense. This is an \nalternative that has to make the same choices you are making in the \nprivate sector. I hope the Congress will adopt this proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 875\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 875.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 875.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require information from the Board of Governors of the \n Federal Reserve System about the use of emergency economic assistance)\n\n       On page 48, line 24, insert ``including the identity of \n     each entity to which the Board has provided such assistance, \n     the value or amount of that financial assistance, and what \n     that entity is doing with such financial assistance,'' after \n     ``2008,''.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, the American people are outraged by the \ngreed, the recklessness, and the illegal behavior they have seen from \nthe masters of the universe on Wall Street, who, through their \noutrageous behavior, these financial tycoons, many of whom have earned \nhundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars in their \ncareer, have plunged our country and much of the world into a deep \nrecession which has cost our people millions of jobs, which has cost \npeople their homes, which has cost people their savings, and which has \nled millions of Americans to wonder what kind of future their kids are \ngoing to have.\n  All of this is not the result of an act of nature, it is the result \nof very definitive actions by a small number of people on Wall Street \nwho have shown outrageous greed in their behavior. It goes without \nsaying that we need a major investigation to understand how we got into \nthis disaster, and what we are going to do to get out of it, and whom \nwe are going to hold accountable.\n  It goes without saying that we need to begin the process of \nreregulating Wall Street, bringing back Glass-Steagall, and making sure \nour taxpayers will never again be put in this position of having to \nbail out the greed on Wall Street. It goes without saying that we have \ngot to address the issue of too big to fail, in my view--and I have \nsaid this many times--if an institution is too big to fail, it is too \nbig to exist, and we begin should begin right now in starting the \nbreakup of these mammoth financial institutions whose failure would \ncause systemic damage to our entire economy.\n  It goes without saying that we have got to do more than worry about \nWall Street, we have got to start worrying about Main Street and the \nmiddle class of this country. We need to pass strong mortgage reform \nlegislation, as well as legislation to protect the American people, who \nare paying outrageously high interest rates on their credit cards.\n  In that regard, I have introduced legislation, and hope to get it to \nthe floor of the Senate before too long, which would put a cap of 15 \npercent on the interest rates any credit card holder in this country \nwould be charged.\n  But those issues dealing with Wall Street and many more will have to \nwait for another day. Today, I am offering, along with Senators \nFeingold and Webb, a very simple, what I believe is a noncontroversial \namendment, which I hope will have the support of every Member of this \nbody.\n  As you well know, the Congress voted to provide $700 billion in so-\ncalled TARP funds to help bail out some of the major financial \ninstitutions in our country. I happen to have voted against that \nbailout. But what is very clear is that every penny of that TARP \nbailout money is now public.\n  As part of that bailout legislation, what was mandated is that every \nfinancial institution that received 1 penny of the taxpayers' money \nwould be listed on the Treasury Department Web site. And if any \nAmerican wants to know where that $700 billion went, they can account \nfor every nickel of that. That is the way it should be.\n  On the other hand, what many people do not know is that the TARP \nfunds, that $700 billion, were only one part of the bailout. What many \npeople do not know is that the Federal Reserve has lent out over $2 \ntrillion to a number of financial institutions. But if you were to ask \nme or any Member of the Senate, any Member of Congress, any American, \nwho received that money, what they will tell you is: We do not\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nknow. Over $2 trillion of taxpayer money has been placed at risk, but \nthe American people do not know who received those funds, and what the \nexact contractual arrangements were.\n  Anybody who believes in the concept of good government, anybody who \nbelieves in transparency, understands that is wrong, that is \nunacceptable, and that has got to change.\n  Earlier this month, I had an opportunity to ask Ben Bernanke, who is \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve, about this issue when he testified \nbefore the Budget Committee, of which I am a member.\n  At that hearing, Chairman Bernanke told the Budget Committee that \nsince the start of the financial crisis, the Fed has provided loans to \n``hundreds and hundreds of banks.'' But Mr. Bernanke declined to name \nany of those banks, how much assistance they were provided, or what, in \nfact, those banks are doing with the money that taxpayers gave them.\n  What the Federal Reserve needs to understand is that this money does \nnot belong to them, it belongs to the American people, and the American \npeople have a right to know who the Fed is lending taxpayer money to, \nhow much they are getting, and what the Fed is asking in return for \nthis money. I cannot imagine anything that is more obvious, more common \nsense. How can you put $2.2 trillion of taxpayer money at risk and not \nknow who is receiving that money? I think back now to the financial \nforms that Members of Congress have to fill out. People want to know, \nare we in a conflict of interest. We fill out those forms, they are \nmade public. Our staff members fill out those forms. In many instances, \nwhen people are applying for Federal aid, they are forced to make \npublic what they are asking for and how much. Some years ago, small \nfarmers in the State of Vermont received some help from the Federal \nGovernment as part of the MILC program, if I recall correctly there. It \nwas right in the newspaper, every nickel the struggling farmers were \ngetting. Some of these farmers make $20,000, $25,000 a year. Some of \nthem are on food stamps. It was, $8,399 goes to this farmer and that \nfarmer. They were not happy about it. That is what the process was.\n  So it seems to me that if small farmers in Vermont are going to see \nwhat they get from the Federal Government and hope to keep small farms \nalive in this country, I think that multibillion dollar financial \ninstitutions should also be asked to have what they received made \npublic as well.\n  The amendment I am offering today is a pretty simple one. It amends \nan amendment I offered. It was submitted in the Budget Committee. \nSpecifically this amendment calls for increased transparency, including \nnames, which institutions received assistance from the Fed, how much \nmoney they received, and what they are doing with this assistance.\n  I sincerely believe that is not an issue of left versus right. In \nfact, some of the strongest supporters of this concept are very \nconservative people such as Ron Paul, a colleague of mine in the \nHouse--a former colleague--who supports this type of approach. A number \nof Republicans have spoken for increased transparency, as well as \nprogressives.\n  That is the issue. It is as simple and as clear as it can possibly \nbe, that if taxpayers are going to be placed at risk by providing \ntrillions of dollars in loans to large financial institutions, the \nAmerican people have a right to know who is receiving that money, and \nwhat the terms are.\n  This amendment, once again, is supported by Senator Feingold and \nSenator Webb. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana to discuss her amendment, not to call it up but to discuss \nher amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 931\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise to speak about amendment No. 931 which is at the \ndesk, as modified. I will ask the chairman at a later time for it to be \nvoted on and in order.\n  I wanted to speak about an issue in the budget as we discuss the \nimportance of laying out a framework for how we may allocate future \nrevenues that come into our general fund from offshore oil and gas \ndrilling.\n  A couple of years ago, in 2006, Senator Domenici and I led a \nbipartisan effort to establish what I believe is a breakthrough process \nas we seek to build a system or a method of energy security for our \nNation which would, as the debate is going on in the Congress, include \nmore domestic oil and gas drilling and an expansion of our nuclear \ncapability for the production of electricity. I am very hopeful about \nalternative energy--wind and solar. We also have some interesting \nexperiments underway with geothermal and energy created by our tides. \nThere are also exciting opportunities for new hydro projects. It is \ngoing to take all of the above to help our country maximize domestic \nenergy sources.\n  Representing the State of Louisiana, I am offering this amendment \nwith the Senator from Alaska as well, Mr. Begich, who also represents a \nState that has contributed a great deal to conventional oil and gas \nproduction. It is important that the revenue streams associated with \nthis production are shared equitably and fairly, not only with the \nFederal Treasury but with States that serve as platforms for this \nindustry and with counties and, in the case of Louisiana, parishes that \nserve as platforms for this great industry.\n  More than ever, people in businesses and residences, individuals and \nfamilies are focused on the cost of energy and electricity, both on the \nelectricity side and the transportation side. While we are not there \nyet, we are pushing forward with the President's new initiatives and \nagenda to find a way to make America more energy secure.\n  In large measure, this debate has actually been led by the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, who is doing an outstanding job on the budget, \nbut has also been flexing his muscle and lending his voice, and we are \nso grateful and appreciative, to pushing our country to energy \nsecurity.\n  I offer this amendment as a basis to establish a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund that will continue the precedent and practice that was set \nby the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, which will set aside 50 \npercent of future funds to be allocated in a budget-neutral fashion for \nrevenue sharing for States and local governments, along with \ncontributions out of that fund made to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund and to investments in energy innovation--those three allocations \nof funding, whether it is for revenue sharing to establish a \npartnership with State and local governments, as we consider where else \nin America we can drill.\n  This amendment does not say where we are going to drill. It does not \nauthorize drilling. It says when those decisions are made that the \nrevenues should be shared with State and local governments \nappropriately, to enter into strong, reliable partnerships and mutually \nbeneficial partnerships for increased drilling domestically. I think \nthis is a very smart way to proceed, and it has been voted for by over \n72 Members of this Senate, both Republicans and Democrats.\n  In addition, we understand that a part of this money could be \ndedicated to conservation, land and water. It could also go to energy \ninnovation, research, and development. So, again, it does not tie our \nhands to the specifics. It does not authorize any drilling that is not \nalready authorized under the law. But it does establish a deficit \nreserve fund for us to act in the future.\n  I understand my time has come to an end. I thank the chairman for his \nconsideration. We will call this amendment up, No. 931, at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana for her leadership on these issues and for the good working \nrelationship we have enjoyed. One thing I have learned about the \nSenator from Louisiana: She is persistent with a capital ``P.'' And I \nwill tell you, if I wanted somebody to represent me here in this \nCapitol to get a result, I would pick her because never have I seen \nsomeone more indefatigable in defense of their State than the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, and I mean that with the highest praise.\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time is still pending for the various parties?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes, the Senator from New Hampshire has a total of 10 minutes, the \nSenator from Oklahoma has 3 minutes, and the Senator from Mississippi \nhas 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I see the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up amendment No. 742.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Would the Senator restate \nthe number.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. 742.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I object. We have a queue here. We have \na unanimous consent agreement. It would be out of order to call up an \namendment at this point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me withdraw that unanimous consent \nrequest and let me comment about what this amendment is about. There \nwas a misunderstanding. I thought this was going to be voice voted at \nsome point, or accepted.\n  It has been accepted on both sides. My cosponsor is Senator Akaka, \nwho I think is down here now. I will briefly describe what it is and, \nhopefully, we will be able to get it in before the day is over.\n  There is a little bit of a problem we have in health care for our \nveterans, in that quite often--in fact, 19 out of the last 22 years--\nCongress has been unsuccessful in passing annual funding for veterans \nhealth care in time. Over the past 7 years, the VA has received its \nfinal budget at an average of 3 months after the beginning of the new \nyear.\n  There is a solution to this--this discontinuation of health care for \nour veterans--that doesn't cost anything, and that is what this bill is \nall about. It would allow us to have advanced appropriations for \nveterans health care. This is not unprecedented; it happens in other \nareas too.\n  In October 2008, during his campaign, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       The way our Nation provides funding for VA health care must \n     be reformed . . . My administration will recommend passage of \n     advance appropriations legislation for the fiscal year 2010 \n     appropriations cycle.\n\n  So this is a recommendation that actually came from the \nadministration. I am joined by several others, including Senator Akaka, \nwho is, of course, the head of the Veterans' Committee.\n  At the appropriate time, I wish to go ahead and get this through, and \nI will leave it up to the managers of the bill as to when that \nappropriate time will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I will yield myself a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we had represented to our colleagues that \nwe would begin voting at 11:30. We have an inordinate number of votes \nalready in the queue. I hope people will appreciate the fact that the \nnumber of amendments pending right now is going to take us well into \nthe evening tonight, headed toward midnight. I recognize everybody \nwants to get their amendment up, and that is their right, but I would \nsimply counsel that if we are going to complete this bill--which \nprobably I should not counsel for since I am not for it, but as a \npractical matter, if we are going to complete this bill, we need to be \na little bit judicious as we ask for votes on amendments; otherwise, we \nwill be here well into Friday, if not into Saturday at this rate.\n  At this point, in order to recognize the fact that we are already \nbehind schedule a little bit, I would suggest to the chairman that we \nyield back all time, even though I had a brilliant statement in \nopposition to the bill.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I wasn't able \nto speak on my amendment last night. I wonder if I could have the \nremaining time until 11:45 to speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I do have 10 minutes left, so I will yield the Senator 5 \nminutes.\n  I, first, wish to take a minute, however, to say I appreciate Senator \nMcCain's full substitute. I think it is a very positive substitute. It \ndoes what the American people need to have done. It controls spending \nin the outyears.\n  The essence of the problem with the budget that has been brought \nforward by the President and by the Senator from North Dakota is that \nin the outyears, the debt explodes and it explodes as a result of an \nexplosion in spending. Senator McCain has taken an aggressive effort to \ntry to change that course of action so our kids have an affordable \nGovernment. I congratulate him for it.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, if the Senator from Nevada will withhold \nfor 1 minute--and this time will not come out of his time--I think it \nis very important Senators understand that we have done a 5-year budget \nhere. That is what we have done 30 of the 34 times Congress has done a \nbudget under the Budget Act, including the last 5 years and including 2 \nwhen the ranking member was the chairman. Now, why have we done 5-year \nbudgets? It is because the projections beyond 5 years are notoriously \nunreliable. The ranking member himself has said that second 5 years is \na guess. My own belief is the fact that President Obama came forward \nwith a 10-year budget is a useful thing. We have that scored. We know \nwhat that does. We know what it does in the second 5 years. But \nCongress has almost always done 5-year budgets. Thirty of the thirty-\nfour times a budget has been written in Congress, it has been done on a \n5-year basis because the outyears are so notoriously unreliable.\n  One other point I wish to make to colleagues. We now have over 100 \namendments pending. If everyone insists on their amendment, we can do \nthree an hour, we will be here for 33 hours. It is in the hands of our \ncolleagues. If everybody is going to insist on their amendment and a \nvote on their amendment, you can do the math. We can do three votes an \nhour, and we will be here for 33 hours. I hope my colleagues think \ncarefully about that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, 33\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So 33\\1/2\\ hours. I stand corrected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 805\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, my amendment which I have offered in the \npast, is a means testing of Medicare Part D, the prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  This Congress, under the leadership of President George W. Bush, \noffered seniors a brand new benefit: Prescription drug coverage. The \nproblem with what this Congress did is that in this brand new benefit, \nwe didn't take into account wealthier seniors who were getting a \nbenefit from a system they never paid into. People pay taxes for \nMedicare Part A: Hospital coverage. That is what Part A is for. We \ncurrently means test and require seniors that have more means to pay \npart of the Part B premium, which covers doctors. Well, Part D is to \ncover prescription drugs. So what we are doing with this amendment is \nsaying to seniors, that instead of a schoolteacher, firefighter or \npolice officer, the middle-income folks out there having to pay higher \ntaxes in order to pay for your prescription drugs, if you have the \nmeans, then you should pay for them.\n  That is all this amendment does. The savings are contributed to \ndeficit reduction.\n  We are talking about the massive amount of debt this budget puts onto \nour children and our grandchildren. The Chinese, who are a big buyer of \nour debt, are questioning whether they want to continue to buy our \ndebt. If\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\nthat ever happens, if the Japanese, the Chinese, other sovereigns \naround the world, or if our own citizens quit buying our Treasury bills \nthis country is in trouble. We should be looking at ways to lower our \ndebt, to lower the amount of money we are borrowing from our children \nand grandchildren.\n  This amendment saves about $3 billion. I realize it is small change, \nbut that used to be a lot of money around here. In these tough economic \ntimes we should save money whenever we can. This means-testing of \nMedicare Part D is absolutely a place where we should start saving.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know the Senator mentioned this, but I wish to reinforce \nit. This was a proposal that came from President Obama's administration \nand it was in his budget; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The Senator is correct, that the President of the United \nStates did include means testing as a part of his budget, means testing \nfor Part D. He did put that toward health care. There are many of us \nwho believe we spend plenty of money on health care in this country; we \njust don't spend it in the right way. We have a sick care system that \npays people, doctors, and hospitals once people get sick, but we don't \ndo pay for better behavior in this country, such as not smoking.\n  Safeway was in here talking to us about the program they implemented, \nand they actually give financial incentives for healthier living. They \nhave actually been able to lower costs, compared to the rest of the \nUnited States, by 40 percent over the last 4 years. The United States \ndoes not need to spend more money on health care. We need to better \nallocate the money we are spending. That is why putting the savings \nfrom Medicare Part D toward deficit reduction is the responsible way to \ngo.\n\n  Let's take the $3 billion in savings, considered a pittance around \nhere, and put it toward deficit reduction so we do not continue to put \na huge burden on our children and our grandchildren.\n  Lastly, when the President says: Let's means test Part D, I think we \nshould do just that. When our children and our grandchildren are \nsaying: Let's not have any more debt, let's not be burdened with huge \ntaxes in the future, we should listen to them as well. We have a \nresponsibility to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment sounds good on the \nsurface, but, frankly, it will make health care reform more difficult. \nIt is difficult enough as it is. This amendment will make it much more \ndifficult.\n  Some suggest that wealthier Americans should be ``means tested;'' \nthat is, they should not get the same benefit under the Part D drug \nbenefit as others. That is a policy that needs to be debated. I \npersonally think that is something we should consider. After all, as \nthe Senator from Nevada said, it is in the President's budget to means \ntest Part D drug benefits.\n  But that is not the point here. The point here is, do we want to help \nmake health care reform easier or more difficult? The effect of the \namendment is to reduce the Finance Committee's allocation in health \ncare reform. That is going to make the Finance Committee's effort to \nget meaningful health care reform more difficult.\n  I suggest we take up that issue--whether to means test Medicare or \nnot--in the context of health care reform. Then the savings that would \nbe achieved by means testing--if we enacted it--would go toward health \ncare reform.\n  The effect of the Senator's amendment is twofold. One is to suggest \nmeans testing Medicare Part D, which is in the President's budget, but \nthe President doesn't want to use means testing to reduce spending on \nhealth care. He doesn't want that. So it would accomplish both \npurposes; that is, to be sure we meaningfully address means testing but \nin a way that doesn't hurt the efforts of health care reform.\n  It makes much more sense to not adopt this amendment but take up the \nquestion of means testing in the context of health care reform, where \nit is part of many other components of health care reform, where the \npieces will fit together in a way that makes more sense.\n  I respectfully say this is not the place to consider means testing. \nIt should be done in the context of health care reform. If we don't \napprove this amendment, then we can deal with this issue on health care \nreform.\n  There are a lot of arguments for and against this. I take no firm \nposition as chairman of the Finance Committee, but I believe the \nSenator's concept has merit. After all, it is in the President's \nbudget, but it should not be done here, which has the effect of taking \nit out of the Finance Committee's allocation, which makes it more \ndifficult for the Finance Committee to do its work on health care \nreform.\n  I respectfully urge Senators to not support this amendment so we can \nmake it easier to take up health care reform in a way that we can \nconsider this policy as one of the many we take up on health care \nreform.\n  Again, I urge that the amendment not be adopted so we can do our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, momentarily, we will go to a vote on the \nEnsign amendment.\n  Before we do that, I ask unanimous consent that upon the use of all \ntime remaining for debate on the budget resolution, the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the following amendments in the order \nlisted; that each amendment be reported by number prior to the time for \ndebate with respect to the amendment; that the previous order remaining \ndebate time and vote time remain in effect; provided further, that if a \nbudget point of order is raised against any amendment, then a motion to \nwaive the applicable point of order be considered made, with the vote \noccurring on the motion to waive.\n  The list of amendments is as follows: Ensign, No. 805; McCain, No. \n882, as modified; Dodd-Shelby, No. 913; Sanders, No. 875; Johanns, \nmotion to recommit; Bennett, No. 759; Bennet, No. 799; Democratic side-\nby-side amendment to the Vitter amendment; Vitter No. 787; Coburn, No. \n892; Casey, No. 755; Coburn, No. 893; Brown, No. 808; Graham, No. 910; \nLandrieu, No. 931, as modified, with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to speak in support of the Ensign \namendment. It should have been done long ago. There is no reason that \npeople who are working in a restaurant or at Wal-Mart in New Hampshire \nshould have to subsidize Warren Buffett's drugs, which is what happens \nunder present law. There is no requirement that people who are wealthy \nhave to pay anything on Part D premiums.\n  I certainly hope we will approve the Ensign amendment.\n  At this point, I suggest that we yield back all time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am prepared to yield back all time.\n  Mr. GREGG. We yield back all time, and we will go to the vote on the \nEnsign amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n805, offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

It was my intention to vote ``yes'' and I voted ``no.'' Since \nit will not change the outcome of the vote, I ask unanimous consent \nthat my vote be changed to reflect a ``yea'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I announced this morning, though only \nSenator McConnell and I were on the floor, that today we are going to \nenforce the rule. This vote was turned in at 20 minutes. The 10-minute \nvotes are going to be enforced. You have a 5-minute leeway. If you are \nnot here exactly on time, the vote will be turned in. The clerks have \nbeen instructed of that fact.\n  Senator McConnell and I believe we have to move this show along \ntoday. There is no reason to leave the Chamber. There is something to \ndrink in the cloakroom and a sandwich if someone wants one, but let's \ncooperate and get this done today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, now that colleagues are in the Chamber, \nwe will give you a status update. We now have over 100 amendments \npending. We can do three an hour. If we hold on that, and everybody \ninsists on a vote on their amendment, we will be here for at least 33 \nhours.\n  I implore colleagues on both sides, if you can take a voice vote on \nyour amendment, please be willing to do that. So I ask colleagues, if \nyou can take a voice vote on your amendment or if you can hold off to \nanother day, please do so; otherwise, we will be here clear through \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. GREGG. The next amendment is Senator McCain, I believe.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 882, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 882, as modified, offered by the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this proposal caps discretionary funding \nat a baseline level plus inflation, a dramatic difference between this \nproposal and the Senate budget committee proposal. The proposal by \nSenator Conrad increases domestic spending by 8 percent for 2010 and \nthen 1 percent in the years following.\n  We all know that is unrealistic. And we all know we will be back here \nnext year with another 8 percent increase in domestic spending. It is \ntime for some tough love. This is what this budget proposal is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the chairman's mark that was referenced \nincreases discretionary spending not by 8 percent but by 5.3 percent. \nThat is all domestic discretionary spending is increased--by 5.3 \npercent. It averages nondefense discretionary spending at a 2\\1/2\\-\npercent increase over the 5 years.\n  The McCain offer and the chairman's mark are almost identical with \nrespect to deficit levels and debt levels. In 2014, the debt is 98.3 \npercent of GDP under the McCain amendment; 98.7 percent under the \nChairman's mark--virtually no difference.\n  But there are differences. He takes $350 billion in savings out of \nmandatory programs and doesn't specify whether it comes out of Social \nSecurity or Medicare or agriculture--$350 billion. Where does it land?\n  If you want to risk cutting Social Security and Medicare by $350 \nbillion, vote for the McCain substitute. If not, vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 913\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, next in order is the Dodd-Shelby \namendment, No. 913.\n  Senator Dodd?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand Senator Shelby. This amendment calls for increased transparency and \ndisclosure at the Federal Reserve Bank in order to understand better \nthe risks the Fed is taking onto its balance sheets. It also calls for \na further evaluation of the costs of the existing Federal Reserve Bank \nsystem, which has not been done before.\n  Our colleagues from Vermont and Kentucky will offer an amendment \nafter our amendment is offered. There is a distinction between these \ntwo. The amendment offered by the Senators from Vermont and Kentucky \ngoes one step further than ours. Presently--and it has been the case \nfor years and years--you do not reveal the names of the companies that \nshow up at the discount window. There is a reason for that. The reason \nis obviously to avoid potential runs on those institutions. Our \namendment does not require the disclosure of those companies names. We \ncall for transparency, disclosure of the items I mentioned, the \ncollateral that the Fed is taking, but we stop short of insisting upon \nnaming the people who show up at the discount window. That is a \nfundamental distinction which our colleagues will have to decide on \nwhich course to follow.\n  We think there is some danger in going the route our colleagues from\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nVermont and Kentucky are proposing. If we end up naming those names, \nyou could well trigger runs on those institutions, and that could end \nup costing the taxpayer a lot more. The Dodd-Shelby amendment improves \ndisclosure and transparency at the Federal Reserve but does not risk \nthe problems associated with the other amendment. We urge our \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n  I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Shelby, proposes an amendment numbered 913.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for enhanced oversight of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System concerning the use of emergency economic \n                              assistance)\n\n       On page 48, line 21, strike ``banks'' and all that follows \n     through ``purposes,'' on line 25 and insert the following \n     ``banks, to include (1) an evaluation of the appropriate \n     number and the associated costs of Federal reserve banks; (2) \n     publication on its website, with respect to all lending and \n     financial assistance facilities created by the Board to \n     address the financial crisis, of (A) the nature and amounts \n     of the collateral that the central bank is accepting on \n     behalf of American taxpayers in the various lending programs, \n     on no less than a monthly basis; (B) the extent to which \n     changes in valuation of credit extensions to various special \n     purpose vehicles, such as Maiden Lane I, Maiden Lane II, and \n     Maiden Lane III, are a result of losses on collateral which \n     will not be recovered; (C) the number of borrowers that \n     participate in each of the lending programs and details of \n     the credit extended, including the extent to which the credit \n     is concentrated in one or more institutions; and (D) \n     information on the extent to which the central bank is \n     contracting for services of private sector firms for the \n     design, pricing, management, and accounting for the various \n     lending programs and the terms and nature of such contracts \n     and bidding processes,''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I do not see Senator Shelby in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time in opposition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Sanders will have the time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Dodd-Shelby amendment is a very good step forward in \nterms of long-overdue transparency of the Fed. I compliment both \nSenators for their effort, and I support their amendment.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment, as Senator Dodd has just told us, does \nnot go far enough. The bottom line is that the Fed has lent out some \n$2.2 trillion, and the American people and the Members of Congress do \nnot know which financial institutions have received that money or what \nthe exact terms of those transactions are. I think it is basically \nabsurd that $2.2 trillion is at risk without us knowing who has \nreceived that money.\n  I support the Dodd-Shelby amendment, and in a moment I will ask for \nsupport for the Sanders-Feingold-Webb amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 913.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n875, offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBunning be added as a cosponsor. I will yield 30 seconds to him and 10 \nseconds to Senator Webb, who is a very quick speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The taxpayers of this country, through the Fed, have \nlent $2.2 trillion to a number of financial institutions. We do not \nknow who these institutions are or what they received. This is totally \nabsurd. We need to name the names. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I yield to Senator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, this is a transparency amendment that \nallows the Fed, forces them, to reveal what banks have received over $2 \ntrillion in assistance. That is what the amendment says. That is what \nit does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask my colleagues to consider 10 words: The American \npeople deserve to know where their money went.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I share Senator Sander's concern \nregarding the transparency of these programs. We all do. We just voted \non the Dodd-Shelby amendment--96 to 2, it passed, I believe.\n  As Senator Dodd has pointed out, however, disclosing the names of the \ncompanies may create financial instability by unnecessarily raising \nconcerns about institutions that accessed these facilities, something \nwe should try to avoid. I believe the Senate has already spoken, and we \ncertainly do not need this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n875.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason this vote took a little longer is \nbecause people, even though it is a 10-minute vote, waited until the \nlast minute to come and vote or to change their vote. It is making it \nextremely difficult for the people at the desk to do this. There was a \nmistake made because people were switching votes, so it took a lot \nlonger.\n  If everyone would stay as close as they can to get the votes out of \nthe way and not wait until the last minute--the Republican cloakroom, \nwe have sent pages back to try to find Members, and to the Democratic \ncloakroom as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                    Senator Grassley's 10,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our good friend from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, has cast his 10,000th vote. Senator Grassley has been a \ndistinguished Member of this body for 29 years and, in my view, the \nNation is always a lot better off when people are paying very close \nattention to Chuck Grassley.\n  Over the course of the past two centuries, nearly 2,000 men and women \nhave served in the Senate. Fewer than 30 have cast more votes than \nChuck Grassley. Only one other Senator from Iowa has served longer. \nThis year Senator Grassley will mark 50 years of public service to the \npeople of the Hawkeye State. While some Members of Congress have a \ntendency to lose touch with their constituents, Senator Grassley has \nalways worked hard to make sure he never did. He has made it his \nbusiness to stay connected to the folks back home by holding at least \none townhall meeting a year in all of Iowa's 99 counties and by \nresponding to every letter, postcard, e-mail, and phone call his office \nreceives from Iowans.\n  He also stays close to the land by working his family farm, even \nwhile he keeps up with his duties in Washington. Chuck Grassley may be \na U.S. Senator, but he has always preferred to be known as ``a farmer \nfrom Butler County.'' Visitors to the Grassley farm say it is not \nuncommon to see Senator Grassley pulling a cell phone out from under \nhis baseball cap while riding on his tractor. Remind me never to borrow \nSenator Grassley's cell phone.\n  A 1955 graduate of the University of Northern Iowa, Senator Grassley \nran for the Iowa House at the age of 23 and lost. But this is a man, \nthe Des Moines Register once wrote, for whom the word ``dogged'' was \ninvented. Three years later, at age 25, he won that seat in the House, \nand Iowa voters have been reelecting him ever since, including five \nterms in the Senate.\n  Over the years, Senator Grassley has distinguished himself for his \ntenacity and his commitment to the public interest. Whistleblower \namendments that he has sponsored have recovered $18 billion to the U.S. \nTreasury. He has kept a watchful eye on spending at the Pentagon and, \nas the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, he has been an \nequal opportunity foe of loopholes, closing them to corporations and \nindividuals alike. He has also done the hard work of following up on \nthese and other accountability measures he has authored over the years.\n  Senator Grassley has a lot to be proud of in his career. He and \nBarbara are also rightly proud of their 54 years of marriage, their \nfive children, and nine grandchildren. Chuck couldn't have foreseen \nsuch an eventful life when he and Barbara met, and Barbara probably \ncertainly didn't expect that 30 years of marriage would pass before she \nfinally got her diamond engagement ring. We all know it is probably \nbecause Chuck didn't want to spend that money.\n  Senator Grassley has been a farmer, a father, a government watchdog, \na steward of the Nation's finances; in short, he is a real statesman. \nThe Senate would not be the same without him, and the Nation, I firmly \nbelieve, would be a lot worse off without the remarkable service of \nChuck Grassley. Senator, congratulations.\n  (Applause, Members rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join the Republican leader in \ncongratulating Chuck Grassley, our friend, on casting his 10,000th \nvote. Chuck was born in the city of New Hartford--but not Connecticut--\nIowa, where he and his wife Barbara raised their five children. They \nreside there today. After graduating Iowa State Teachers College, he \nearned a doctorate from the University of Iowa.\n  I have referred to Senator Grassley on a number of occasions as \nChuck, Senator, Hey You, but now Dr. Grassley. Everyone should \nunderstand that.\n  Chuck, in addition to his education excellence, worked as an assembly \nline laborer before he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives \nand later to the United States Congress. He has been in the Senate \nsince 1980. Chuck quickly became known as a friend to taxpayers and a \nfoe to government waste.\n  As former chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, on which I served \nunder him, Senator Grassley worked to expose the neglectful practices \nof many of America's nursing homes, and certainly Senator Grassley was \na catalyst for change. To ensure that government workers feel free to \nshine a light on corruption and misappropriation of public funds, Chuck \nGrassley coauthored the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.\n  As former chairman and now ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley has worked with Members of both sides of the aisle to \nfind bipartisan solutions to put taxpayers first.\n  He is a man of his word, and once he tells you what he has agreed to \ndo, he goes to the wall. I have found that on a number of different \nissues working with him.\n  Senator Grassley is a leader on health care issues. Senator Grassley \nreached across the aisle to coauthor legislation with Senator Kennedy \n12 years ago that provides middle-class families with the opportunity \nto buy into Medicare for children with special needs.\n  I particularly appreciate Senator Grassley's longstanding commitment \nto developing clean, homegrown renewable energy.\n  In addition to his leadership on a broad spectrum of national issues, \nIowans depend on Chuck Grassley for his responsiveness to constituent \nservices. He has accomplished the remarkable feat of visiting each one \nof Iowa's 99 counties--that is so hard for me to comprehend. The State \nof Nevada, as big as it is, only has 17 counties. Iowa has 99 counties, \nand he has visited those counties every year at least once since he was \nfirst elected to the Senate.\n  Chuck and Barbara, as Senator McConnell has mentioned, are the \nparents of five children: Lee, Wendy, Robin, Michele, and Jay.\n  An accomplishment for sure--10,000 votes cast in the U.S. Senate. It \nis a remarkable accomplishment. But as I look at his record, I think \none of his greatest accomplishments is the fact that the Senator from \nIowa will achieve, this year, his 55th wedding anniversary with \nBarbara.\n  Congratulations, Chuck.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join with the entire Senate family in \ncongratulating my colleague, my good friend, and the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa, on casting his 10,000th vote in the Senate. This is a truly \nremarkable milestone, but even more remarkable is the fact that Senator \nGrassley has cast nearly 6,000 votes without missing a vote. It has \nbeen 16 years since Senator Grassley has missed a vote. The last time \nhe missed a vote, he had to be\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nin Iowa during that terrible flooding we had in 1993. So he has not \nmissed a vote since. It has been 16 years that Senator Grassley has not \nmissed a vote.\n  I note for the record that Cal Ripken, the great shortstop and third \nbaseman for the Baltimore Orioles, went 16 years without missing a \ngame, and they called him the Iron Man. So now Senator Grassley has \ngone 16 years without missing a vote, so I guess now we can call him \nthe Iron Man of the U.S. Senate.\n  But the measure of a Senator is not just how many votes he or she \ncasts, it also includes what he or she accomplishes off the floor of \nthe Senate. That is also where Senator Grassley has truly distinguished \nhimself in this body over the last 28 years.\n  Count me as one of those who believes the executive branch of this \nGovernment has gotten too powerful, has arrogated too much power to \nthemselves in relation to the legislative branch.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And it is a power they flaunt. I do not care whether it \nis a Democratic administration or a Republican administration. I \ndaresay no Senator is more dedicated to providing rigourous, relentless \noversight of executive branch agencies--whether during Republican \nadministrations or Democratic administrations--than Senator Grassley. \nSenator Grassley's dedication to the oversight function has been \nexemplary, a model every Senator ought to strive to emulate.\n  Chuck Grassley and I have served together in the Congress since we \nwere both elected the same year in 1974. We took our oaths of office on \nthe same day in the House in 1975. Of course, he preceded me to the \nSenate. He came to the Senate in 1981. I followed him here in 1985. \nWell, we belong to different parties, but I like to think we share a \ndown-to-earth, commonsense Iowa way of looking at the world. I value \nhis friendship and his counsel. I have the highest respect for his work \nhere in the Senate and his work in Iowa on behalf of all Iowans.\n  So, again, I join my colleagues in congratulating my colleague, my \nfriend, and the senior Senator from Iowa on this remarkable milestone.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have lined up to speak. So many of us \nwant to congratulate the esteemed Senator from Iowa. I congratulate him \non his 10,000th vote.\n  Many of you know Chuck and I get together once a week. We started \nthis practice at least 8 or 9 years ago, and sometimes he is chairman, \nsometimes I am chairman; chairman or ranking member, vice versa, back \nand forth. We meet every Tuesday at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and we \nhave done this for 8 years. Maybe we have missed five or six or seven \ntimes, but constantly, consistently we get together to go over matters, \nminimize misunderstandings, and so forth. Lately, the last couple, 3 \nyears, the meetings have been in my office. I have a little bit bigger \nconference room. That is not the real reason, though. The real reason \nis, as Chuck always reminds me, in my office the coffee is free, so it \nis much better to meet in my office.\n  All of you who know Chuck know he passes the airport test; that is, \nif you are ever stranded in an airport for 10 or 12 hours and you are \nsitting next to somebody, you get to like the person or you do not get \nto like the person. Chuck more than passes the airport test. The more \nyou get to know Chuck Grassley, the more you will like him. It is his \ndecency, his honesty. He is unpretentious. It is his basic Iowa \ngrassroots personality. It means so much to me, in spending so much \ntime with him. The only time our meetings are cut short, I might say, \nis when Chuck has to dash out and get on the radio and talk to people \nback home in Iowa; otherwise, Chuck stays throughout the meeting. The \npeople in Iowa mean so much to him.\n  I might also say that we know how much he protects taxpayers' \ninterests. It has been mentioned--whistleblower legislation, which he \npromotes so aggressively. He is also downright parsimonious himself. He \nturns the balance of his office budget back to the taxpayers. Every \nyear, he returns a good portion back to the taxpayers. He also, I might \nsay, promotes ethanol for several reasons. One, it is good for Iowa. \nBut he also contributes to the reduction of fossil fuel consumption. \nWhen he comes back home from plowing his field, he is on his tractor, \nand he coasts downhill the last mile to save a few pennies of diesel \nfuel. He does. I checked that out a short while ago. Yes, he does that \njust to save a few pennies of diesel fuel.\n  Anyway, I want to tell you how much I appreciate him. He is one of my \nvery best friends.\n  I think the measure of a Senator really is whether he or she is \npopular in two different areas, with two different audiences. First is \nthe people back home--how popular is a Senator back home? The second \nis, how popular is he or she with his or her colleagues? There are two \nseparate audiences. There are two separate criteria. Clearly, Chuck is \npopular in both areas. He is very popular in Iowa. The people of Iowa \nlove him. The people, Members of the Senate love him. He is one heck of \na guy, and I just feel so honored to be able to serve with Chuck on the \nFinance Committee, but also, more importantly, he is a very good friend \nhere in the Senate.\n  So I congratulate you, Chuck.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do you know what, so many of you stayed \naround. I do not know how many times I have heard of other Senators \nhaving voted 10,000 or 12,000 times and I probably did not stay around, \nand I probably have not earned what you have said about me because I \ndid not pay that much attention to the rest of you who have gone \nbefore. So let me apologize for that, and I will bet next time I will \nstay around.\n  So I am not flying under false colors, I would like to say a couple \nthings. One person spoke about my being a farmer, and that is \nabsolutely right. I am. But I can tell you this, that when you get a \n25-year-old grandson, grandfathers are not as important in the farming \noperation as you would like to be. So I consider myself now more of a \nhired man for Robin Grassley and Pat Grassley than I am a family \nfarmer. But I still am a crop sharer with my son, and I market my own \ncrops, and I am there to help put the crop in when they need me--and \nwish they needed me more--and help get the crop out, and wish they \nneeded me more. So I do appreciate that.\n  As much as I would like to be called Dr. Grassley--you can get that \nimpression maybe because I did do 2 years of graduate work beyond my \nmaster's degree, but I did not quite finish it because I was elected to \nthe State legislature and I never went back to the University of Iowa \nto finish it, and I kind of regret that. But I did not get back.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. That was something that was prepared for me. \nYou always reminded me of having a Ph.D.\n  Anyway, here is the story. Somebody like you or me is going to go \ngive a speech--and they give us these speeches, and we walk out and \ngive them--and he is about halfway through his speech, and he comes to \na page that is blank, and he says: You are on your own, you SOB. So \nthat is kind of like this. I will check with my staff to make sure they \ndo not make a mistake like that again.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, it is one of these cases where I passed the \nFrench test, and I was ready to write a dissertation, and I never quite \ngot around to it.\n  One other thing I would like to say is, obviously, thank you for the \nrecognition. I enjoy my job in the Senate very much. I guess if you \nvote 10,000 times, you are just doing what we are paid to do.\n  It is a wonderful experience serving here in the Senate. And I think \nI can say--as Senator Baucus has inferred, I hope I am liked by \neverybody. I like every one of you. I do not know any of you who \nconsider me an enemy. And if you do, I do not want to know who you are.\n  (Laughter.)\n  If you wonder why there is some emphasis upon voting, people in this \ncountry are very cynical about those of us in elected office. I think: \nWhat can you\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\ndo to reduce cynicism? And I thought a long time ago, sitting in a \nrestaurant one time--and probably nobody at that time knew who I was. I \noverheard them saying something like: Well, it must be election time; \nthe politicians are in town.\n  I heard that 30 years ago, and I made up my mind that at least one \nway I was going to try to overcome that for politicians generally was \nto make sure the process of representive government works. So when I \nwas elected to the Senate, it was not something I promised the people \nof Iowa, it was just something I promised myself: that I am going to go \nto every county every year to hold at least one town meeting so that \nperson who was griping about only seeing a politician at election time \ncould not say that about Chuck Grassley, and I hope in the process it \nhas raised the respect people have for those of us who are elected.\n  The other thing about voting as often as I do here in the Senate, it \nis an opportunity to let people know when you are in session, you are \nhere working. And when we are not in session, I am back in Iowa with my \npeople. It is an opportunity to kind of quantify what our job is all \nabout and to get over this business of people who, I think, think we \nare only here in Washington sitting around with our feet up on our desk \nwaiting to take a phone call from somebody--that we are actually doing \nsomething. This is one way--maybe a very elementary way, but sometimes \nthat is the way you have to explain government to the American people--\nthat we are on the job, doing our job, and when we are not here, we are \nat home making the process of representative government work.\n  So I very much appreciate the kind words that have been said. And I \ndid not record them, but if I did, I would play them back during \nelection time.\n  Thank you very much for the honor.\n  I would yield to the Senator--oh, the Senator from Illinois said \nsomething nice about me one time, and I did use it in my literature. \nAnd some people of his party got on him: Why are you doing that?\n  Well, I think he said: It was true.\n  And he came to me one time and he said: Will you say something nice \nabout me? I could put it in my literature.\n  And I gave him a slip of paper that said: He is not as bad as you \nthink he is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I have at the desk a motion, and I would \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] moves to recommit \n     S. Con. Res. 13 to the Committee on the Budget with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days \n     making the following changes:\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe motion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       (1) Amend levels in the resolution as to report back a \n     resolution with an aggregate level of budget authority (and \n     associated outlays) for nondefense, nonveterans discretionary \n     accounts for fiscal year 2010 at the level enacted for fiscal \n     year 2009 level, increased by the rate of inflation for 2010 \n     as projected by the Congressional Budget Office.\n       (2) Amend spending levels in the resolution so as to report \n     back a resolution with aggregate spending levels for \n     discretionary nondefense, nonveterans spending for each \n     subsequent fiscal year in the budget window so as not to \n     exceed the immediately previous fiscal year spending level \n     for discretionary nondefense, nonveterans spending, increased \n     by the rate of inflation for the applicable year as projected \n     by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, the budget before us increases nondefense \ndiscretionary spending by $42 billion over last year's levels.\n  Here is what my motion does. It would limit the overall increase in \nthe budget to CBO's projected rate of inflation for nondefense, \nnonveterans spending. This motion will save $36 billion in 2010 and \n$194 billion over the 5-year budget window.\n  My motion only affects aggregate spending so it allows some programs \nto be larger than the rate of inflation; thus, any claim that it is \nunfair to one particular group would be inaccurate. The motion allows \nthe committee to take a scalpel to the budget, which is exactly what \nthe President called for. If not, our country continues to be in a dire \nsituation. This helps deal with the spending piece of this.\n  This motion will allow us to take a step back from bloated spending \nand step forward to fiscal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I urge my colleagues to vote yes and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in more normal times, this is an amendment \nI might well support, but these are not normal times. We are faced with \nthe steepest economic decline since the Great Depression. The \nunderlying budget mark already cuts nondefense discretionary spending \nby more than $160 billion. This would cut another $120 billion, much of \nit front end loaded, at the worst possible time for economic recovery.\n  One other point I would make. We have more than 200 amendments \npending now--more than 200. If the Senator's amendment were to pass--\nthis is a motion to recommit the budget resolution to the committee. If \nanybody wants to repeat the entire exercise of this week, the week we \nget back, I recommend you vote for the Senator's amendment. If you \nprefer to end this today, I recommend you vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 132 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to inform colleagues that when I \nsaid earlier we had 100 amendments pending, I was half right. That was \nlast night. As of now, we have over 230 amendments pending. If you \ndivide 230 by 3, that is almost 80 hours--about 76, 77 hours. That \nwould mean we would be here all day today, tomorrow, and all day \nSaturday. If everybody sticks to their amendment, that is what is going \nto happen.\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\n  I hope people in the calmness of the moment will think about other \noptions. No. 1, if you will accept a voice vote--Senator Gregg and I \nare trying to work things out on amendments that could be accepted. If \nnot, if you would withhold until there is another vehicle--and there \nwill be a lot of vehicles this year. Really, we have been doing this \nfor a lot of years. Amendments have sprouted here. I hope people will \nthink: Do we want to do this for 3 days straight?\n\n\n              Amendments Nos. 759, 799, 949, 755, and 808\n\n  We have an agreement to take several amendments here by unanimous \nconsent. They are: Bennett No. 759; Bennet No. 799; Democratic side-by-\nside to Vitter; Casey No. 755, and Brown No. 808. I ask unanimous \nconsent that these amendments be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 759\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit changing current tax laws for charitable \n  contribution tax deductions to pay for modernizing the health care \n                                system)\n\n       On page 31, line 9, after ``purposes,'' insert ``provided \n     that such legislation would not result in diminishing a \n     taxpayers' ability to deduct charitable contributions as an \n     offset to pay for such purposes, and'',\n\n\n                           amendment no. 799\n\n (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to address the \nsystemic inequities of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement that lead to \n access problems in rural areas, including access to primary care and \noutpatient services, hospitals, and an adequate supply of providers in \n                             the workforce)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the side by \nside to the Vitter amendment we approved by voice vote is No. 949.\n  With that, the next amendment up is the Vitter--I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on the Bennett amendment No. 759, Senator \nBennett of Utah wishes to be recognized for a brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand from the distinguished \nBudget Committee chairman that they have accepted this amendment by \nunanimous consent. Therefore, I congratulate them on their wisdom and \nthank them.\n  This is a serious amendment, which I hope will survive conference. I \nam glad to have it accepted. It deals with the tax treatment of \ncharitable contributions. I am happy to have it accepted by the other \nside so that the Senate is on record saying they want the President's \nbudget not to change the tax treatment of charitable contributions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Bennett amendment would express the \nimportance of taxpayers' ability to take deductions for contributions \nto charity. It is also important to recognize that this amendment is \nnot inconsistent with either current law or the President's budget.\n  This amendment is also consistent with the votes that we took last \nweek when we affirmed our support for charitable contributions.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 949\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on an amendment that we just adopted by \nvoice vote, the Reed amendment No. 949, there is a misunderstanding. \nThere was not unanimous consent. So I think in fairness we ought to go \nback to that amendment and have Senator Reed offer it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the adoption of the Reed amendment \nNo. 949.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be the pending amendment, No. 949, and Senator \nReed would be recognized to offer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would focus on the issue I \nthink we are all concerned about, and it would be a counterpoint to \nSenator Vitter's amendment, and that would be the administration of the \nTroubled Asset Relieve Program. My amendment would create a reserve \nfund, which would focus the remaining resources in the TARP fund on \nsupporting small businesses, saving homeowners from foreclosure, \nhelping the bond market, and making credit more widely available. It \nwould also strengthen the oversight entities, the Special Inspector \nGeneral, the Congressional Oversight Panel, and the Government \nAccountability Office.\n  Senator Vitter's amendment purports to take back the money by \nstriking certain functions, such as function 370. But that function \nalso has the funding for the FHA, the Rural Housing Program, and the \nSmall Business Administration. In effect, we will not be taking away \nthe TARP money, we will be challenging these other programs to find \nfunds.\n  I urge adoption of my amendment and the rejection of Senator Vitter's \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator offered the amendment?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I offer it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Reed) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 949.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the expenditure of the remaining Troubled \n        Asset Relief Program funds for the benefit of consumers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EXPENDITURE OF REMAINING TARP FUNDS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports that reaffirm that \n     the remaining Troubled Asset Relief Program funds shall be \n     used to save homes, save small businesses, help the municipal \n     bond market, make credit more widely available, and provide \n     additional resources for the Special Inspector General for \n     the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Congressional \n     Oversight Panel, and the Government Accountability Office for \n     vigorous audit and evaluation of all expenditures and \n     commitments made under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, by \n     the amounts provided in that legislation for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2019.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, next after this amendment is my amendment. \nIt would return TARP funds not already out the door, except for the \n$100 billion set aside for buying toxic assets, which is exactly what \nTARP was supposed to be about. But it ends everything else and invites \nthe Obama administration to come back to us regarding other programs.\n  The Reed amendment reaffirms TARP as it has been executed. So if you \nlike everything that has been done under TARP and how it has been done, \nthat model and program changing every other week, vote for the Reed \namendment and reaffirm TARP as it is. If you think a change and focus \nneeds to be brought to TARP, vote for the Vitter amendment, which is \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 949.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield time in opposition to Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Reed amendment, which we just adopted, \nfocuses the remaining TARP funds on functions that are critical to the \neconomic progress of the country--keeping people in homes, providing \nhelp for small business, supporting the traditional bond market, making \ncredit more widely available. The restriction of these funds proposed \nby Senator Vitter will undercut these objectives. In addition, the Reed \namendment has strengthened the oversight responsibilities.\n  Secretary Geithner has just announced a program that will focus on \nthese toxic assets. Keeping these TARP funds, I believe, will give the \nTreasury the flexibility to make that program work more effectively, \nand I oppose the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 35 seconds.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the program which Secretary Geithner has \nactually announced about toxic assets is protected even under my \namendment. What my amendment says is that we are not any longer going \nto allow the Treasury to do other things on an ad hoc basis, making it \nup as they go along every week.\n  In the process, we would reduce the debt of this country by at least \n$136 billion under this amendment. I urge support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since I am not a squish like Senator \nCoburn, I am going to go ahead.\n  My amendment is straightforward. This amendment creates a budget \npoint of order on legislation that increases the cost of energy for \nmiddle-class families. Why are we doing this? The climate change \nproposal that was in the President's budget would create a massive tax \nincrease on anybody who uses energy, and that would be every American \nmiddle-class family, which already has a tough time getting by. This \nwould be a point of order against any bill that would raise the cost of \nenergy on our middle-class families who are struggling to get by.\n  I ask the Senate to rally around this concept. We can deal with \nclimate change without passing a $3,000-per-household energy tax on the \nfamilies of America who are having a hard time paying their bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from South Carolina offering \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I am sorry. I thought we had done that. Everything I \nsaid still goes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the next amendment is the Landrieu \namendment with 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to establish a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund based on the current law supporting \nrevenue sharing for coastal States contributions to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and a fund for innovative energy technology.\n  It would save up to, which is the current law today, which 26 \nSenators voted on, up to 50 percent which can be set aside from future \noil and gas revenues for revenue sharing for coastal States for the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund and for funds to be created to invest \nin alternative energy technologies.\n  This is something that has been debated in the Senate but has been \nbroadly supported by Republicans and Democrats. There has been some \nopposition. I suspect there may be some today. But there has been broad \nbipartisan support for revenue sharing for coastal States contributions \nto the Land and Water Conservation Fund and alternative energy sources.\n  This does not change the current law, it does not direct drilling \nanywhere in the country that does not already exist. That is the \nessence of the amendment I offer with myself and Senator Begich from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu], for herself and \n     Mr. Begich, offers an amendment numbered 931, as modified.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR OUTER CONTINENTAL \n                   SHELF OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASING REVENUES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise the \n     allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this resolution \n     by the amounts provided by a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would provide \n     that up to 50 perecent of any revenues collected by the \n     United States from oil and natural gas leases in the outer \n     Continental Shelf shall be--\n       (1) distributed among coastal energy producing States; and/\n     or\n       (2) allocated for--\n       (A) the conduct of innovative alternative energy research; \n     and\n       (B) supporting parks and wildlife.\n       (b) Deficit Neutrality.--Subsection (a) applies only if the \n     legislation described in subsection (a) would not increase \n     the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2019.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is not an insignificant amendment. It \nis not small change. It has very significant consequences to all \nStates. A very small number of States, a handful, will\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nget a big windfall. All of the rest of the States will have money \notherwise raised from OCS--raised from revenues from mineral leasing \nroyalties not go to them at all.\n  Currently, revenue goes to all 50 States. There is a small carving \nout for some of the coastal States and Florida. This amendment says: \nAll the revenue raised, all the coastal revenue goes to only those few \ncoastal States, which means revenue would not go to the other States \nthat benefit currently from oil and gas leasing revenue.\n  The other big consequence is, this is a big tax increase. It is a \nrevenue-neutral provision. That means it is $110 billion, \nconservatively, over 10 years, which means we have to raise taxes $110 \nbillion to pay for giving money to a small handful of States and take \nit away from the majority of the States.\n  I strongly urge members not to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator Barrasso \nand I have offered to fully fund the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, \nby providing an additional $200 million for this purpose. I am very \npleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, has also joined \nus in this amendment as well as Senators Crapo, Kyl, Enzi, Bennett and \nHatch.\n  Significantly, this amendment would provide for full funding for this \nlegislation for the first time since its passage. I helped author the \nHealthy Forests Restoration Act in 2003--a bipartisan bill that I \nworked on with a number of my colleagues to help address serious forest \nhealth issues and a significant backlog of hazardous fuels that have \nbeen building up on our national forests.\n  When Congress passed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, HFRA, \nCongress authorized $760 million in new money to complete hazardous \nfuel reduction work on 20 million acres. Yet in each of the past years \nthe Bush administration's budget request has fallen short, in my \nestimation by well over $600 million less than Congress authorized. \nBecause the Healthy Forests Restoration Act was never fully funded in \nthe prior administration, it has never really had the chance to work. \nOur amendment would ensure that rural communities will finally get the \nresources they were promised. These funds will put these communities on \na path to preventing wildfires and bringing jobs back to the forest.\n  In hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nprevious administration leaders assured me that even in the face of \nsuch severe budget cuts, they could get the work done, possibly within \n8 to 10 years. Yet in hearings before the committee we also heard \nwitnesses from the GAO and USDA inspector general's office testify that \nthe agencies were falling far short of meeting this mandate and that \nhazardous fuels were building up in our forests as much as three times \nfaster than the agencies could remove them.\n  When you come from a State like mine, where the Federal Government \nowns so much of the land, the health of those public forests is a very \nserious issue--one with life or death consequences for communities that \nare next to these forests and could become raging infernos in the next \nfire season.\n  We can no longer dawdle on completing the thinning work that urgently \nneeds to be performed on our Nation's forests. This work would also \nprovide jobs thinning overstocked forests in rural communities, while \nreducing the threat of wildfires.\n  Those wildfires are getting more and more costly to fight and \nconsuming more and more of the budget of our public lands agencies. It \nsimply doesn't make sense to not spend the money on preventing the \nfires and then turn around during the fire season and watch the \nmillions of dollars flow freely while people's homes and livelihoods go \nup in smoke.\n  Full funding of the HFRA would also allow for funding to communities \nso they can implement ``community wildfire protection plans'' developed \nin areas that are part of ``wildland urban interface'' and living on \nthe edge of our public forests.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this commonsense amendment and get \nthe Healthy Forests Act back on track.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 840, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodification to the desk on behalf of Senator Brownback to his \namendment No. 840.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 866\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to the Hutchison amendment, \nNo. 866.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment would create a point of \norder against any legislation that would impose or increase the \nmarriage penalty tax. We have worked very hard in Congress to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty, which we have not been able to do completely, but \nwe have mitigated it, lowered it significantly.\n  Before we addressed this issue, the marriage penalty was an average \nof $1,100 per couple; that is, two single people getting married caused \nthem to have to pay $1,100 more in taxes because of the marriage \npenalty in the Tax Code. We have mitigated that to a great extent.\n  This amendment would create a point of order against any legislation \nthat would impose or increase the marriage penalty. We all know we \nshould not in any way discourage marriage in this country. We have been \nable to do that. I think we need to stick with it, and this is the way \nto do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think \nthere is strong support on this side.\n  Would the Senator be willing to take a voice vote?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Hutchison amendment No. 866 be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back time?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 866) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 840, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to Brownback amendment No. \n840. Senator Brownback would describe that amendment. This is a similar \ncircumstance. There is strong support on this side toward the Senator's \namendment, and we could take it on a voice vote if the Senator would be \nwilling to do that.\n  If the Senator would take a moment to describe his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would be happy to take a moment to \ndescribe the amendment. And if by going by voice vote it is more likely \nto stay in conference, I would be happy to do a voice vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is amazing how that will improve the chances.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Well, I am quite excited about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 840, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for a Commission on Budgetary Accountability \n                    and Review of Federal Agencies)\n\n       On page 25, line 24, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, increase the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 3, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 4, increase the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 7, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 8, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 11, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, increase the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 15, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 16, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 20, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 21, decrease the amount by $3,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 24, decrease the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 25, decrease the amount by $6,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 3, decrease the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 4, decrease the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 7, decrease the amount by $8,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 8, decrease the amount by $ 8,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 11, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 12, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, colleagues, this is an amendment that \npassed last year. It creates a commission, an independent commission, \nto review all of Federal spending, make recommendations to the body, \nand then requires a vote on those recommendations whether to continue \nthe program or discontinue it. It is a way for us to get at failed \nprograms. It is a way for us to get at inefficient programs or programs \nthat have accomplished their purposes.\n  This is at the core of what so many people want to see us do; that \nis, to get our spending under control so we can spend on higher \npriority categories. That is what this amendment would do, and it does \nit in a fashion and in a way that we have seen before that has worked \non eliminating wasteful Government spending.\n  This has had broad bipartisan support in the past. I would hope we \ncould accept it and it could stay in the overall budget in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have strong support for the amendment \non this side. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 840), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 898 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Graham, to withdraw amendment No. 898.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Without objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 953, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to the Boxer amendment, No. \n953, afterschool reserve fund.\n  Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senators, thank you so much, Senator Conrad \nand Senator Gregg. I say thank you very much to Senator Ensign. He and \nI have been working on afterschool for many years.\n  This is a Boxer-Ensign amendment. There is a modification at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] for herself and \n     Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 953, as modified.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To add a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the 21st Century \n            Community Learning Centers afterschool program)\n\n       At the end of Title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR 21ST CENTURY \n                   COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels and limits in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     motions, or conference reports that would increase funding \n     for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program by \n     the amounts provided in such legislation for such purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2019.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are not adding a penny. We are just \nsaying, within the amounts that are in the education budget, to fully \nfund afterschool programs. We all know it helps our kids, and there are \nmillions on the list. Senator Ensign explained many times--he wanted to \nspeak here today, but he is not on the floor--that afterschool programs \nreally saved his life when he was a young child.\n  So I hope this amendment will be accepted.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote, if we could do \nthat.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator would be willing to let us \npass over this amendment for a minute, we have some questions on our \nside, and hopefully we can clear them up.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry?\n  Mr. GREGG. We have some questions on our side. Hopefully, we can \nclear them up. I ask the Senator, can we move on to the next amendment \nand move back to yours?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Of course. Senator Ensign thought it was all taken care \nof, so he is off the floor. Maybe we can get him back out here. Thank \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \namendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 730\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to Reid amendment No. 730, \nand the leader is here.\n  Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, \nindividuals\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nwere entitled to deduct State and local sales taxes. When the deduction \nwas repealed, it put taxpayers in States without an income tax, such as \nNevada, Washington, and others, at a disadvantage. It took us 22 years \nbefore fairness was restored when the deduction was reinstated in 2004. \nThe problem is that deduction is not a permanent part of the law.\n  The amendment I have filed with Senators Ensign, Cantwell, Murray, \nNelson, Hutchison, and others fixes that by establishing a reserve fund \nfor legislation making the deduction permanent. Based on all the \ninformation we have, this would affect lots of people--almost half a \nmillion in Nevada. At a time when families are struggling to make ends \nmeet, every penny counts.\n  I would accept a voice vote on this amendment, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just been informed that the \nmatching amendment to the Reid amendment may be withdrawn. They are \nworking on that right now. So that would mean a vote on the Reid \namendment and the Hutchison amendment may not be necessary.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 953, as Modified\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask that we now return to the Boxer amendment \nbecause we have reached conclusion on that. We know it will require a \nvote. If the Senator would be so inclined, we could return to that \namendment and go to a vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator has used her minute.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Colleagues, if I could ask to be heard for one more \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  I simply want to say that we are a little caught off guard here \nbecause we were told this was cleared on the Republican side. This is a \nBoxer-Ensign amendment. It does not add one penny to the deficit. It \ndoes not change anything. It just says, within the funding for \neducation, let's fully fund afterschool programs because we have so \nmany kids who are waiting to get into those programs. I am hopeful we \nwill have a strong bipartisan vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n953, as modified. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 9, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 137 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--89\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--9\n\n     Bunning\n     Coburn\n     DeMint\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Sessions\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 953), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, if we are really going to have recorded \nrollcall votes--what was the final tally--on votes that are 89 to 9, we \nare going to be here a very long time.\n  Honestly, I have been doing this for 22 years. I don't know if I have \never seen a year where colleagues just seem to be absolutely insistent \non having rollcall votes on things that are going to keep us here a \nvery long time. We cannot make people give up their votes or take voice \nvotes. But at some point there has to be a serious consideration. Is \nthis what we are really going to do to each other? Are we going to be \nhere for 70 hours? That is where we are headed.\n  With that, we can go to the Snowe amendment--or has the Hutchison-\nReed amendment been resolved? We should pass over that and go to \nSenator Snowe's amendment. She is right here. If the Senator would \nexplain her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 773\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 773.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 773.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide for \n  the extension of the top individual tax rates for small businesses \n                              after 2010)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO PROVIDE FOR THE \n                   EXTENSION OF THE TOP INDIVIDUAL TAX RATES FOR \n                   SMALL BUSINESSES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports that maintains the \n     rates of tax under section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 for the highest two rate brackets at 33 percent and 35 \n     percent, respectively, for individuals who receive more than \n     50 percent of income from a small business concern (as \n     defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act), by the \n     amounts provided by that legislation for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2019.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, my amendment would create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for the tax cuts of 2001 to extend those tax rates to \nsmall businesses that earn 50 percent of their income from small \nbusiness.\n  If we fail to do that, we can expect small businesses to see their \ntaxes rise by 9 percent by allowing those rates to go up from 33 \npercent to 36 percent, and 36 percent to 39.6 percent. Why would we \nwant to impose a tax on the very entities that we are depending upon to \nlead us out of this economic morass by increasing their taxes?\n  Just this week, the Joint Tax Committee indicated there are 6.5 \npercent of those small businesses that earn over $250,000, which is \nthree times the original estimate by those who were opposed to this \namendment. Let me say that the Small Business Administration said 93 \npercent of all small business owners file an individual tax return. The \nTreasury Department has indicated that 9 percent earn 70 percent of the \nincome in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if she is willing to \ntake this on a voice vote?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n773, offered by the Senator from Maine.\n  The amendment (No. 773) was agreed to.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 816, 885, 872, 827, 764, 788, 795, 817, 837, 818, 874, \n                  839, 877, 797, 802, and 826 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I am in strong support of the Dodd-\nLieberman-Collins amendment.\n  A decade ago, many of us in this body worked together to create the \nFIRE Grant Program--the goal of which was simple, but essential: It \ngives local fire departments the ability to purchase new equipment and \ninitiate education and training programs.\n  Soon after we wrote that bill, we were reminded why it was so \ndesperately needed--the Worcester Cold Storage blaze on December 3, \n1999, that left 17 children without their fathers.\n  That story reminds us of the price our fire fighters pay every day to \nkeep our communities safe.\n  We also wrote the SAFER Act to put an additional 75,000 firefighters \non the job.\n  Today, the FIRE Act provides the single largest stream of Federal \nfunding to communities to train and equip firefighters. Along with the \nSAFER Act, it has already provided more than $3 billion in grants to \nhelp hire, train, and equip firefighters.\n  In essence, these historic pieces of legislation have made the \nFederal Government a partner with our Nation's firefighters.\n  But to make that partnership as strong as it needs to be to keep our \ncommunities safe, we need to ensure that the Federal Government \nprovides the necessary resources. We need to fund those programs.\n  In fiscal year 2009, the FIRE and SAFER Programs were funded at $565 \nmillion and $210 million respectively. FIRE is authorized through this \nfiscal year and will be reauthorized later this year, while SAFER is \nscheduled for reauthorization next year.\n  Our amendment will simply ensure there is adequate funding for the \nFIRE and SAFER Programs for fiscal years 2010 to 2014.\n  Economic recovery depends on safe and secure communities.\n  Just recently, East Hartford was forced to eliminate 19 municipal \njobs, including firefighters. Farmington is trying to budget for \nreplacing decade old fire engines, while Torrington and Greenwich are \ndeciding whether they will be able to repair and build a new firehouse. \nThis is happening in fire departments across my State.\n  We already made great strides with the economic recovery package \nproviding $210 million to help America's first responders. But with \nthis amendment, we can ensure that one thing that will not be left \nbehind during this economic downturn is the safety of our communities.\n  And so I thank my colleagues and urge them to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 874\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment would create a deficit \nneutral fund in order to provide for reform of the current foster care \nsystem.\n  The foster care system is broken tremendously overburdened and needs \nto be fixed.\n  The system is understaffed and under trained. Children linger too \nlong before securing a safe and permanent home. More funding could be \navailable for family reunification services. Administrative funds could \nbe used more efficiently.\n  Data collection is insufficient. The foster care financing structure \nis antiquated and inflexible and prevents states from responding to a \nvariety of challenges.\n  We need to replace the old system with one that improves the foster \ncare payment structure to support children\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nrather than programs, promotes and improves family preservation and \nensures that public funds are used effectively.\n  Our amendment sets us on a course to make these vital improvements to \nthe foster care system.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Landrieu-Grassley amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that is very helpful. That cleared a lot \nof amendments on both sides. I now go to Senator Hutchison for the \npurpose of withdrawing her amendment.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 868 Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment No. 868. I do \nsupport Senator Reid's amendment. It is important.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 868 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. That is very gracious of her. We \ncould go to the Reid amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Reid amendment No. 730 be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I want to \npoint out that in New Hampshire we have no sales or income tax. If \npeople want to escape these taxes, they should come to New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 730) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to permanently \n         extend the deduction for state and local sales taxes)\n\n       At the end of Title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __ .

Mr. President, that takes us to the Thune amendment No. \n803.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 803\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] for himself, Mr. \n     Bennett, and Mr. Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 803.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect charitable giving by ensuring that organizations \n that provide important religious, educational, cultural, health care, \n and environmental services are not negatively impacted by changes to \n       the Federal income tax deduction for charitable donations)\n\n       On page 68, after line 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER ON LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES REVENUE \n                   ABOVE THE LEVELS ESTABLISHED IN THE BUDGET \n                   RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--After a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget is agreed to, it shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment between Houses, \n     motion, or conference report that would cause revenues to be \n     more than the level of the revenues set forth, prior to any \n     adjustment made pursuant under any reserve fund, for that \n     first fiscal year or for the total of that fiscal year and \n     the ensuing fiscal years in the applicable resolution for \n     which allocations are provided under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It \ncreates a budget point of order against any legislation that would \nraise revenue from a reduction in the tax deduction for charitable \ndonations.\n  What the Senator from North Dakota is going to say is that it is not \nincluded in his budget. As we know, this is a long process, and we also \nknow the President, in his budget, included a proposal that would \nreduce the amount people could claim as a tax benefit for a charitable \ndonation.\n  Again, we don't know what is going to happen from this point forward \nin the budget process. This could go into conference, and a provision \nlike this could be added. Again, this places a point of order against \nany legislation that would raise revenue from the tax deduction for \ncharitable giving.\n  Americans gave $300 billion in 2007 to charitable causes, which is \nequal to 2 percent of our GDP.\n  A Washington Post article said this:\n\n       Diana Aviv, [president of Independent Sector, a national \n     membership organization of charities] said any decrease in \n     charitable giving caused by Obama's proposal, no matter how \n     small, would be `seen as a stake in the heart.'

It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, built into this budget is an assumption \nthat the 33 percent and 35 percent tax brackets would be allowed to \nexpire. As a result, many individuals and small businesses would see \ntheir taxes rise substantially in the very near future.\n\n  The Administration has been quick to explain that the tax hike \nwouldn't\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\ntake effect until January 2011 after the economy has rebounded. But no \none can be sure when our economy will turn the corner and the \nadministration's economic assumptions have been criticized as being \nmore optimistic than most.\n  While I do not support raising taxes--especially in this economic \nclimate--I realize I am in the minority in this Chamber. So I am here \nnow to offer my friends across the aisle a chance to improve this \nbudget resolution.\n  My amendment would block any tax increase until the economy has \nrecovered. A sure sign of recovery would be a reduction in the \nunemployment rate to 5.8 percent, a level many private sector \neconomists associate with a fully productive economy.\n  Common sense tells us that employment is a key indicator of our \neconomy's strength and potential for growth. The organization formally \ntasked with identifying U.S. recessions, the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research--NBER--used job numbers to determine the start date \nof our current recession and it is only right to use job numbers as a \nsignal that it has ended.\n  I don't support the tax increases in this budget, but if the majority \nin this Chamber insists on moving forward with higher taxes, they \nshouldn't do it while the economy is mired in recession.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we adopt \nthe Enzi amendment No. 824.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 824) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect taxpayers and businesses from the job-killing and \n  growth-stunting impact of tax increases imposed while the domestic \n                         economy is in crisis)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, I especially thank Senator Enzi, who \ndemonstrates once again why everybody regards him as a gentleman here. \nI appreciate his being gracious.\n  Madam President, that takes us next to the Conrad AMT amendment, \nwhich I will not pursue, and we will go directly to the Grassley \namendment on the alternative minimum tax.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 950\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the chairman's resolution patches the \nAMT for 2010 through 2012. Now, that is good, but it is not good \nenough. Since we have a 5-year window, we should patch AMT for all 5 \nyears. My amendment is to make sure that AMT is patched 2013 and 2014 \nso that the entire 5-year period has an AMT patch.\n  This would provide tax relief to 18 million families at a cost of \n$114 billion. This patch is essential to honest budgeting because we \nall know that the AMT will eventually pass without being patched. This \namendment also helps families plan their financial affairs properly, \nrather than leave them guessing as to what their future tax burden will \nbe.\n  Also, by giving greater stability to this area of the tax law, tax \nprofessionals will administer the law better, leading to better \ncompliance and a smaller tax gap.\n  I ask support for this amendment to patch AMT for 2013 and 2014, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we already have 3 full years of \nalternative minimum tax protection in the chairman's mark--3 full \nyears. We have never had that much before in any resolution.\n  The amendment of the Senator would add $117 billion to the debt. \nAfter we lost $2 trillion in the CBO forecast, we had to insist that \nsome additional things be paid for. I urge my colleagues to defeat the \nGrassley amendment and understand we have 3 full years of alternative \nminimum tax protection in the chairman's mark.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 950.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 742.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for advance appropriations for medical care for \n          veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs)\n\n       On page 57, strike line 23 and insert the following:\n\n     casting; and\n       (3) for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the Medical \n     Services, Medical Administration, Medical Facilities, and \n     Medical and Prosthetic Research accounts of the Veterans \n     Health Administration.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, this is one of the rare amendments we \nhave that is not going to cost anything but makes a rearrangement in \nthe flow of funding. One of the problems we are having now is that in \n19 out of the last 22 years, Congress has been unsuccessful in passing \nannual funding for veterans health care. In fact, over the last 7 \nyears, there has been a delay averaging 3 months in the funding flow \nfor the care of veterans.\n  This can be corrected. What this amendment does, it offers a solution \nby providing advance appropriations for veterans health care. It does \nnot mean it increases the cost. It means it actually comes in--and this \nis used in some other areas of Government. In fact, it is interesting \nthat in October of 2008, then-Senator Obama, a candidate, said:\n\n       The way our Nation provides funding for VA health care must \n     be reformed. . . . My administration will recommend passage \n     of advance appropriations legislation . . .\n\n  For this purpose.\n  Senator Danny Akaka is a cosponsor on this. I ask it be accepted. I \ndo not need a rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from Oklahoma be agreeable to a voice \nvote on this amendment?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that we accept the Inhofe \namendment, No. 742.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 742) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 811\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 811.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund to establish a \n              national usury law, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO ESTABLISH A NATIONAL \n                   USURY LAW.\n\n       The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for one or more bills, joint \n     resolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports to \n     establish a national usury law, provided that such \n     legislation does not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this amendment, No. 811, would simply \nestablish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to establish a national usury \nlaw. Establishing a national usury law is not a radical concept. About \nhalf the States in our country have usury laws now, capping interest \nrates on their books. Unfortunately, the State usury laws were made \nmeaningless by a 1978 Supreme Court decision that allowed national \nbanks to charge whatever interest rates they wanted if they move to \nStates without an interest rate cap.\n  The bottom line is people all over this country are tired of bailing \nout banks and then paying 25 or 30 percent interest rates on their \ncredit cards. That is wrong. We need a national usury rate, and this \namendment would begin the process of establishing one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, obviously, this is not the appropriate \nvehicle to legislate a national usury law. Even if a national usury law \nmade sense, which it does not, because this is clearly a States rights \nissue, I am not sure what we would use here. Would we use the Koran or \nthe Bible for setting this?\n  Let's be honest, a national usury law is not a good idea. Its time \nhas not come and this amendment should be defeated.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

So we are going to have to take a \nbreak.\n  Before we do that, I would like to dispose of the remaining \namendments in this tranche, and I would ask Senator Bond if we would be \nwilling to take a voice vote on his amendment if Senator Stabenow would \ntake a voice vote on hers?\n  Mr. BOND.

No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, OK. That means two more votes. I do not know how \nmany times we voted on this already. But if people are insistent on \nhaving votes, we will get to stay here.\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the chairman of the committee yield? Is it not the \ncase that most of the amendments, perhaps 90 percent of the amendments \nwe have voted on today, would have no real policy implications?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is probably a pretty fair estimate. The Budget \nCommittee does not have the authority to tell committees of \njurisdiction the specifics of legislative outcomes. These are message \namendments, and the truth is, we all do it. We do it on both sides. But \nI have to say to my colleagues, it has run amok this year. For some \nreason this year we have hundreds of amendments out there, and people \nare just stuck. Even when they could get a voice vote and it pass, they \nstill want votes. We have had votes that were nine in opposition. But \nthat is a Senator's right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield further for a question, might \nit not be advisable, given the fact that most amendments have no policy \nimplications at all, if they are made to the Budget Act, just to accept \nall amendments en bloc by UC and discard all of those without merit \nonce you get to conference?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The problem is, that would take unanimous consent. It is \nvery clear we cannot get unanimous consent.\n  Is Senator Coburn in the Chamber? I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside for a moment the Stabenow and Bond amendments for the purpose of \ngoing to the Coburn amendment because I am told that Senator Coburn \nwould be willing to take a voice vote; is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would take it by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Even better. I ask unanimous consent that the Coburn \namendment, No. 894, be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 894) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a deficit-neutral reserve fund to set performance \n           standards to identify failing Government programs)\n\n       On page 49, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 216. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR SETTING \n                   PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO IDENTIFY FAILING \n                   GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports that would develop \n     performance measures for each program receiving Federal \n     assistance under their jurisdiction, by the amounts provided \n     in that legislation for that purpose, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2010 through 2019.\n\n                           Amendment No. 879\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank our colleague. That takes us back to Stabenow \namendment No. 879.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for herself, Mr. \n     Brown, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Shaheen, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 879.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify the authorization for climate change legislation)\n\n       On page 33, line 20, strike ``or help'' and insert ``create \n     new jobs in a clean technology economy, strengthen the \n     manufacturing competitiveness of the United States, diversify \n     the domestic clean energy supply to increase the energy \n     security of the United States, protect consumers (including \n     policies that address regional differences), provide \n     incentives for cost-savings achieved through energy \n     efficiencies, provide voluntary opportunities for agriculture \n     and forestry communities to contribute to reducing the levels \n     of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and help''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We have had a number of votes that indicated what we \nshould not do as it relates to a climate change policy. This is about \nwhat we should do. I believe, just as with any piece of legislation, if \nit is done right, it can be very positive.\n  I believe it can be about creating jobs and revitalizing the economy. \nI would like to thank Senators Brown, Boxer, and Shaheen for supporting \nthis amendment which lays out a framework for a balanced climate change \npolicy to create jobs and a clean technology economy, strengthening \nmanufacturing competitiveness, diversifying domestic clean energy \nsupplies, protecting consumers, including policies that address \nregional differences, provide incentives for cost savings achieved \nthrough energy efficiencies, and allowing voluntary opportunities for \nagriculture and forestry to participate in this process of lowering \ngreenhouse gases.\n  I ask for support from my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator take a voice vote?\n  Ms. STABENOW. My question, I guess, through the Chair would be, is \nSenator Bond also willing to take a voice vote on his amendment?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, my amendment shoots with real bullets. It \nprovides a Budget Act point of order for any climate change legislation \nthat brings in more revenue than that set forth in the budget \nresolution.\n  So it does--if that will be accepted by voice vote, it is creating a \nnew Budget Act point of order. We would like a vote. But it does have \nreal teeth.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would just say to the Senator, we would be willing to \ntake yours on a voice vote, Senator Stabenow's on a voice vote, then go \nto the Bennett for a vote. And we could take a break because people \nhave not had a break.\n  We have voted on this over and over and over. I do not think the \nrecord could be more clear.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, assuming a voice vote means approval, I \nam willing to take a voice vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is in a separate category. We will have a vote on \nyours.\n  Mr. GREGG. We will vote on both.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 879.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 25, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 141 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--25\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 879) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

I say to Senator Bond, yours will be the first vote when we come \nback. I say to colleagues, we need to take a break to try to put \ntogether a managers' package and determine the final amendments that \nrequire a vote.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT CAUSES \n                   SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSS.\n\n       (a) In General.--After a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget is agreed to, it shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, resolution, amendment between Houses, \n     motion, or conference report that--\n       (1) would cause revenues to be more than the level of \n     revenues set forth for that first fiscal year or for the \n     total of that fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years in the \n     applicable resolution for which allocations are provided \n     under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     and (2) would cause significant job loss in manufacturing- or \n     coal-dependent regions of the United States such as the \n     Midwest, Great Plains or South.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment provides a new point of order \nto prevent climate change legislation from raising more revenue than in \nthe resolution, killing jobs in the coal and manufacturing-dependent \nregions of the United States, such as the Midwest, the Great Plains, \nand the South.\n  There is no question climate change legislation will raise trillions \nof dollars in Federal revenue through its Government auction of carbon \nallowances.\n  President Obama said ``electricity rates would necessarily \nskyrocket.''\n  This new energy tax will kill jobs in energy-intensive sectors such \nas manufacturing, auto assembly, steel, cement, plastics, glass, and \nfertilizer.\n  Experts predicted last year's Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade bill \nwould have killed 3 million to 4 million jobs. The Northeast and west \ncoast will avoid the full impacts because they rely on lower carbon \nnatural gas to generate electricity. However, climate legislation will \nhit hard the coal and manufacturing-dependent Midwest, Great Plains, \nand South.\n  I ask my colleagues to protect our workers by supporting this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Michigan, \nMs. Stabenow, who had the time in opposition, I wish to indicate that \nwhat the Senator is talking about is not part of the chairman's mark. \nThe chairman's mark provides an energy initiatives reserve fund. It is \nentirely up to the committees of jurisdiction what legislation they \nwrite to reduce our dependence on foreign energy, to deal with global \nclimate change. This resolution makes absolutely no determination about \nwhat those committees will report. The effect of this amendment, to me, \nis a nullity because it is creating a budget point of order against \nsomething that does not exist in the chairman's mark.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment, on behalf of Senator \nStabenow.\n  Mr. BOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, Senator Bennett can conclude his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, according to CBO, the stimulus bill will \nspend over $150 billion between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. My \namendment will remove that amount from this budget resolution because \nit seems to me we do not need to fund the same things twice.\n  By reducing the proposed spending amounts in the budget resolution, \nCongress will be recognizing that we have already passed money to spend \nin that area. For those who say, yes, but the stimulus is different, we \nare all hoping that the need for stimulus will be passed by the time we \nget to 2014 and it will not be stimulative but, rather, inflationary. \nIt is for that reason that I offer the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would eliminate 20 \npercent of the economic recovery package we passed weeks ago. The \nSenator's amendment would cut defense by over $2 billion, would cut \nveterans by over $400 million, would cut areas in education, health, \nand infrastructure.\n  If there is one thing that united this body, it was investments in \ninfrastructure, much of what would be cut under this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, we are now making significant progress on \nputting together a managers' package and on putting together those \namendments that will require a vote. We still have a certain amount of \nclearing to be done in order to be ready to go to those final lists and \nget them locked in, but that work is going on right now between the two \nsides.\n  Let me just give a status report, if I could. We are down to about 55 \namendments. That is pretty good, given the fact we started at 231. But \n55 at 3 an hour would be another 18 hours. So the word needs to go out \nthat we are asking colleagues who can withhold on amendments that they \nhave filed to use them for a later date. Those who would be willing to \naccept a voice vote, if they could make certain our staffs are notified \nof that, we will then be able to proceed in the most efficient way \npossible.\n  Mr. President, we also should notify Members that at 8 p.m., give or \ntake a few minutes, we intend to vote on the amendment on estate tax. \nThat is the Lincoln-Kyl amendment. We just want to give people a heads-\nup that the amendment will be voted on at about that time--roughly 8 \np.m., give or take.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we need to alert colleagues that we really \nneed them, if they have amendments, to be on the floor or in the \ncloakroom. We have amendments that we are ready to go to, but we can't \nfind the Senators. So let me just tell you, if we can't find the \nSenators, they are going to lose their chance to offer their amendment. \nWe are going to give a 5-minute grace period, but if Senators have \namendments, they have to be in a place where we can reach them.\n\n\n Amendment Nos. 889, 881, 955, 809, 912, 794, 876, 899, 883, 970, 820, \n                         887, 917, 838, and 916\n\n  Mr. President, we are ready to go to the next managers' package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the managers' package be considered en \nbloc and agreed to en bloc. It includes the following: Klobuchar \namendment No. 889, Dorgan amendment No. 881, Dodd amendment No. 955, \nBrown amendment No. 809, Begich amendment No. 912, Pryor amendment No. \n794, Lincoln-Snowe amendment No. 876, Lincoln-Snowe amendment No. 899, \nCollins amendment No. 883, Hatch amendment No. 970, Enzi amendment No. \n820, Klobuchar amendment No. 887, McCaskill amendment No. 917, Dorgan \namendment No. 838, and Tester amendment No. 916.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about the \nDorgan-Snow amendment No. 881.\n  The IRA rollover was first enacted as temporary provision in the \nPension Protection Act which I championed in 2006. Rollovers to grant-\nmaking charitable organizations with some element of donor control, \nsuch as private foundations, donor advised funds, and supporting \norganizations, were specifically prohibited. These entities were \nspecifically prohibited from receiving rollover funds because I wanted \nto make sure that the money would actually get to charities doing work \non the frontlines rather than sit in a donor-controlled account.\n  The provision has become one of the annual ``tax extender'' \nprovisions. So under current law, which expires December 31, 2009, an \nindividual may rollover up to $100,000 from their IRA to a public \ncharity but not to one of the prohibited entities. Amendment No. 881 to \nthe budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 13, promotes the extension of \ncurrent-law regarding IRA rollovers to charity, which I also support.\n  However, the amendment also promotes an expansion of the provision by \nallowing split-interest trusts to receive IRA rollover contributions. \nSplit-interest trusts are more worrisome than those that are currently \nprohibited from receiving IRA rollover contributions. These trusts \nallow donors to retain an income stream from the contributed assets for \na defined period. So, just like with donor-advised funds and supporting \norganizations, the contribution does not result in an immediate benefit \nto a charity actually providing services while the donor receives \nsignificant tax benefits at the time of the contribution.\n  The cost of extending current law through 2009 was almost $1 \nbillion--expanding the IRA rollover provision to allow more entities to \nreceive them would increase the cost. Before we do that, I believe we \nshould make sure that grant-making entities, including split-interest \ntrusts, are accountable for paying out minimum amounts to actual \ncharities before we allow them to receive IRA rollovers.\n  I understand that Senator Dorgan is willing to work with me and my \nstaff if and when Senator Baucus and I consider an expansion of the IRA \nrollover provision in the Finance Committee. In light of this good \nfaith offer, I will not object to the unanimous consent request for \nthis amendment today and look forward to working with Senator Dorgan to \nresolve our differences.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 876\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate amendment \nNo. 876, which I have cosponsored with my colleague Senator Lincoln. \nOur bipartisan amendment would simply clarify that a deficit-neutral \nreserve that would transform the health system will specifically \naddress the needs of small businesses and the self-employed. More than \nhalf--52 percent--of our nation's uninsured either work for a small \nbusiness or are dependent on someone who does. Yet remarkably, this \nbudget resolution fails to even mention the crucial priority of small \nbusiness health insurance reform.\n  As former chair and now ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, one of the top issues facing small \nbusiness continues to be access to affordable health insurance. Since \n2000, health insurance premiums have increased by 89 percent--far \noutpacing inflation and wage gains, and only 49 percent of our Nation's \nsmallest employers, with less than 10 employees, are now able to offer \nhealth insurance to their employees as a workplace benefit.\n  Further compounding the crisis, small businesses are trapped in \ndysfunctional markets that possess little, if any, meaningful \ncompetition among insurers. Just last month, the Government \nAccountability Office released a report that I requested, along with \nSenators Bond, Durbin, and Lincoln, which highlighted an alarming trend \nof consolidation in the state small group insurance markets. For \nexample, the combined market share of the five largest carriers \nrepresented 75 percent or more in 34 of 39 States surveyed, compared to \n26 States in 2005. Large insurers dominated over 90 percent of the \nmarket in 23 States, including Maine, where five insurers now control \n96 percent of the market.\n  The sad truth remains that small business insurance markets continue \nto lack competition among insurers. No competition means higher costs, \nand higher costs translate to no health insurance.\n  That is why I will soon reintroduce, with Assistant Majority Leader \nDurbin and Senator Lincoln, the Small Business Health Options Program--\nSHOP--Act, a bipartisan measure that has generated a broad array of \nsupport, including NFIB, the National Association of Realtors, SEIU, \nAARP, and Families USA. Our bipartisan measure would inject competition \ninto reformed state insurance markets, allow small businesses and the \nself employed to pool together nationally, and provide a targeted tax \ncredit to small business owners. I firmly believe that the policies in \nthe SHOP Act, including fairer insurance ``rating'' rules that are not \nbased on an individual's health status, must be included in the broader \nhealth reform debate that is underway in Congress.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of aisle to support this \nnon-controversial amendment, which would clarify that when Congress \npasses broader health reform and universal coverage this year, it will \nfully consider the issue of small business health insurance reform.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n  I rise as a cosponsor to support amendment No. 899 introduced by my \ncolleague Senator Blanche Lincoln that creates a deficit neutral \nreserve fund to promote financial security through financial literacy, \nretirement planning, and savings incentives, including individual \ndevelopment accounts and child savings accounts. I am proud that we \nhave worked together on the issue of financial security and financial \nliteracy over the last several years, in particular on the issue of \nindividual development accounts, IDAs, that will allow low-income \nindividuals to pay for education expenses, first-time homebuyer costs, \nand business capitalization or expansion costs.\n  I join Senator Lincoln in support of this crucial amendment because \nwe must boost savings in the United States, as a sound national savings \npolicy is essential to helping Americans build a better future for \nthemselves. Higher rates of saving can also strengthen the national \neconomy. A paradox of the current economic recession is that our \nnational savings rate has risen as Americans prepare for possible bad \ntimes ahead. Personal saving, as a percentage of disposable personal \nincome, was 4.2 percent in February. It was 4.4 percent in January. The \nlast time the saving rate exceeded 4.0 percent two straight months was \nAugust and September 1998, up 4.3 percent and 4.2 percent, \nrespectively.\n  It was more than 10 years ago the last time we had a savings rate \nabove 4 percent. I am glad to see it happening, but we need to increase \neducation on financial security so that Americans have a cushion to get \nthrough difficult economic times. I thank the new Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy for adding \nme as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank all our colleagues for cooperating \non these managers' packages. We are working to clear additional \namendments right now. I think at this point, until Senator Gregg \nreturns, we need to note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 957\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment that requires a vote is \nthe Lautenberg amendment as it affects Amtrak. The Senator is not quite \nready. We will give him a minute to do that.\n  While we are waiting, let me indicate to colleagues, we need Senators \nwho have amendments to be here or to be in\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\nthe cloakroom. We have dead time here because, for amendments that are \ngoing to require a vote, Senators who are insisting on votes are not \nhere. That is not going to work.\n  We have now worked on another group of amendments. Momentarily we \nwill be prepared to offer another managers' amendment. I remind \ncolleagues that the estate tax amendment of Senator Lincoln and Senator \nKyl will be voted on about 8 o'clock. We need to keep that in mind as \nwe plan the time.\n  I say to the Senator, we are ready to accept that amendment by \nunanimous consent. If the Senator wishes to speak, he could, for a \nminute, or we could take the amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to offer a straightforward \namendment that recognizes that investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure system must be a priority for our country. The amendment \nwould simply add transportation, including passenger and freight rail, \nas an eligible project under the ``Investments in America's \nInfrastructure'' reserve fund. It is already included in the budget.\n  Our highways and skyways are so congested and crowded that passengers \nand freight are routinely delayed. The estimates show these problems \nwill only get worse with the growth of freight traffic, expected to \ndouble its size by 2025. Railroads are the one mode of transportation \nthat can grow to help alleviate the congestion.\n  Amtrak needs more and better passenger and freight rail service. I \nask support for this amendment.\n  I call up the amendment and ask for its immediate consideration, \namendment No. 957.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 957.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To include funding for freight and passenger rail in the \n       deficit-neutral reserve fund for investments in America's \n                            infrastructure)\n\n       On page 35, line 18, insert ``transportation, including \n     freight and passenger rail,'' after ``energy, water,''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to take that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing on the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 957) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 934\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Cornyn is prepared with an \namendment. Would the Senator describe his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 934 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 934.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase transparency by requiring five days of public \n          review of legislation before passage by the Senate)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  _. REQUIREMENT THAT LEGISLATION BE AVAILABLE AND SCORED \n                   5 DAYS BEFORE A VOTE ON PASSAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order, \n     to vote on final passage on any bill, joint resolution, or \n     conference report unless the text and a budget score from the \n     Congressional Budget Office of the legislation, are available \n     on a publicly accessible Congressional website five days \n     prior to the vote on passage of the legislation.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment would pose a 60-vote point of \norder against a bill that had not been made available for public review \nalong with the score of the Congressional Budget Office on a \ncongressional Web site for at least 5 days.\n  As everyone will recall, the President himself said this was his \ngoal, to offer greater transparency, hence greater accountability, and \nthus instill greater confidence in the people and their Government. \nUnfortunately, that pledge has been violated more times than it has \nbeen honored, and in our rush to pass the stimulus bill that was \ncirculated--the conference report--at 11 o'clock on a Thursday night, \nwe were required to vote on it less than 24 hours later and thus the \nuproar over the AIG bonuses ensued because, frankly, Members of the \nSenate did not know what they were voting on and could not know what \nthey were voting on without this kind of transparency.\n  I commend this to my colleagues. It is consistent with what the \nPresident has advocated and I think it is a good way to do business.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Texas, would \nhe be willing to allow us to take this on a voice vote or by unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I have three amendments which I have on the dock. This is \nthe only one of those three that I would like to have a record vote on.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can I put this another way? This amendment is not \ngermane. So we can have a vote on it, it probably will not succeed, or \nwe could voice vote it and you would succeed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Well, we have had this proposition tendered before. I \nrealize that in all likelihood this amendment would be stripped out in \nconference behind closed doors. I do not think that is particularly an \nhonest way to deal with these important issues--to say yes on the floor \nand then to strip them out behind closed doors and to act like we are \nbeing consistent and not hypocritical.\n  I understand what the chairman has to do. He will do what he has to \ndo. But I would like a record vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator certainly has that right. Let \nme raise the germaneness point of order.\n  Let me ask the Parliamentarian, is the amendment of the Senator \ngermane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, it is not \ngermane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I raise the germaneness point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 144 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 798\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 798 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 798.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that law abiding Amtrak passengers are allowed to \n         securely transport firearms in their checked baggage)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       (d) Allowing Amtrak Passengers to Securely Transport \n     Firearms on Passenger Trains.--None of amounts made available \n     in the reserve fund authorized under this section may be used \n     to provide financial assistance for the National Railroad \n     Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) unless Amtrak passengers are \n     allowed to securely transport firearms in their checked \n     baggage.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. The amendment is very simple and straightforward. It aims \nto ensure that gun owners and sportsmen are able to transport securely \nfirearms aboard Amtrak trains in checked baggage, a practice that is \ndone thousands of times a day at airports across the country. I \nemphasize that this amendment deals with checked, secured baggage only. \nIt would return Amtrak to a pre-9/11 practice. It does not deal with \ncarry-on baggage. Unlike the airline industry, Amtrak does not allow \nthe transport of firearms in checked bags. This means that sportsmen \nwho wish to use Amtrak trains for hunting trips cannot do so because \nthey are not allowed to check safely a firearm. I emphasize, this bill \ndeals with checked, secure luggage, not carry-on luggage. It would \napply to Amtrak the same as airlines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the time in opposition to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object to this disruptive amendment offered by the \nSenator from Mississippi. He wants to enable the carrying of weapons, \nguns, in checked baggage. One doesn't have to be very much concerned \nabout what we are doing when they look at the history of attacks on \nrailroads in Spain and the UK and such places.\n  This amendment has no place here interrupting the budgetary \nprocedure. The pending amendment is not germane and, therefore, I raise \na point of order that the amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the germaneness well taken on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to the Wicker amendment No. 798.\n  Mr. GREGG. I didn't even make the motion to waive, but I am happy to \nhave the question be on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, that motion is \nautomatic.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 63, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 145 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--63\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sanders\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Ensign \nfor joining me in this amendment. This is a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund amendment that would help prevent forest fires.

Mr. President, next we go to the Lincoln-Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 873\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, before I begin, I wish to say a word of \nthanks to Chairman Conrad, who has done a tremendous job providing \ngreat leadership. He and his staff have done a wonderful job reflecting \nthe President's priorities and, more importantly, putting balance to \nthe budget before us.\n  Because my time is limited, I wish to take a moment to read to you a \nfew excerpts from an editorial that appeared in the Arkansas Democrat-\nGazette earlier this year. It was submitted by a member of a family who \nruns a timber operation in southwest Arkansas and that has been in the \nfamily since 1907. He said:\n\n       The estate tax kills jobs. It kills companies that provide \n     jobs. In the process it kills towns and communities, \n     particularly those in rural areas dependent upon the land and \n     local industry.\n\n  Five times this man's family has been subjected to the estate tax--\nfive times.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Between the 1950s and 1980s, vast amounts of money--tens of \n     millions of dollars--were raised to pay the tax. Lands were \n     clear cut, mills liquidated, communities destroyed. . . .The \n     next hit will be too great.\n\n  Think about this type of family business. They have grown their \nbusiness, reinvested in it over a century's worth of time, put almost \nall their profits back into it, and now this particular company employs \nover 1,000 Arkansans and has multiple mills that are worth a good bit \nof money--millions of dollars.\n  This amendment provides real relief to our family-owned businesses. \nIn a time when our Government has handed out billions upon billions to \nfailed Wall Street banks, it is time we provide a little relief to our \nbusinesses on Main Street that are in need of help right now. These are \npeople who employ more than half the workers in Arkansas. These are the \npeople who, if we reform the estate tax, will invest in their \nbusinesses and create more jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask my colleagues to look at this seriously and \nrealize we are not protecting the ultrawealthy. We are working for \nsmall businesses, family businesses in each and every one of our \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). I remind the Senator that the \namendment has not been called up.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Kyl, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mrs. Landrieu, and Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 873.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for estate tax \n                                relief)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR ESTATE TAX RELIEF.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports that would provide \n     for estate tax reform legislation establishing--\n       (1) an estate tax exemption level of $5,000,000, indexed \n     for inflation,\n       (2) a maximum estate tax rate of 35 percent,\n       (3) a reunification of the estate and gift credits, and\n       (4) portability of exemption between spouses, and\n\n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2019.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to remind all colleagues that the \nchairman's mark takes the estate tax exemption from $1 million per \nperson in 2011 to $3.5 million, $7 million a couple. The proposal by \nthe Senator from Arkansas would take it to $5 million, and $10 million \na couple, reduces the rate from 45 percent to 35 percent. It is in a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund. The cost of this amendment from 2012 to \n2021, when it is fully effective, is over $100 billion. Where does the \nmoney come from? Either by cutting spending somewhere else or raising \nother taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed for a few moments on \nmy leader time. I am speaking in effect for Senator Kyl, who has been \nour leader on the issue of the death tax for many years.\n  The Lincoln-Kyl amendment, on which we are about to vote, would \ndecrease the burden on those who get hit with the death tax by \nincreasing the exemption by $1.5 million to $5 million\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nand by reducing the rate of taxation down by 10 percent to 35 percent.\n  No one should have to be taxed on their assets twice, and no one \nshould have to visit the tax man and the undertaker on the same day. It \nis the Government's final outrage. But if we can't repeal this tax, \nthen we should at least lower it at a time when Americans are already \nburdened by shrinking retirement savings.\n  This budget, in keeping with the administration's plan, seeks to keep \nthe death tax exemption at $3.5 million and the tax rate at 45 percent. \nBy offering an amendment that would lower the rate and the exemption, \nSenators Kyl and Lincoln are offering crucial support and protection to \nsmall businesses, family ranchers, and farms.\n  This amendment has wide bipartisan support, including Senators \nNelson, Pryor, and Landrieu--all on the Democratic side--and Senators \nGrassley, Roberts, Enzi, and Collins on the Republican side. It also \nhas strong support from the small business community, which desperately \nneeds relief at the current moment. It would spur economic growth, \nwhich we need, and it makes good overall economic sense since the death \ntax costs more to comply with than it raises in revenue.\n  The Lincoln-Kyl amendment is important, it is timely, and I strongly \nurge its support.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, my \nfriend, Senator Reid quoted me by name in his remarks in opposition to \nthe Lincoln-Kyl amendment.\n  The distinguished leader quoted me as describing death tax relief \nlegislation as ``unseemly.''\n  Since that quote was used to argue against Senator Lincoln's \namendment, which I support, I thought it important to respond to the \ndistinguished leader and set the record straight.\n  The distinguished leader is correct. I did say, at that time shortly \nafter the Katrina hurricane hit, that proceeding to death tax relief \nwould be ``unseemly.''\n  It is important for everyone to understand the context of that \nstatement. It was made shortly after the terrible hurricane hit the \ngulf states. At that time, the Senate was about to reconvene after the \nAugust recess. The pending business was a cloture motion on the motion \nto proceed to a House bill that provided death tax relief.\n  The majority leader, Senator Frist, had filed the cloture motion \nbefore the Senate departed for the August recess. Of course, that \nprocedural action occurred weeks before the hurricane hit. When asked \nabout the Senate schedule, I responded that proceeding to the death tax \nbill, and, thereby not dealing with the hurricane victims, would be \nunseemly.\n  The distinguished leader's comments caused me to recall how the \nfinance Committee, which I chaired at the time, dealt with Katrina.\n  Senator Frist did the right thing and set the Senate in motion to \ndeal with the hurricane victims. The Finance Committee acted with \nlightning speed on a bipartisan basis, and in concert with the House, \nto deliver relief to hurricane victims. I was quite proud of our \nefforts to help people in need. That was the first Katrina tax relief \nbill.\n  The second Katrina tax relief bill, unfortunately, took a lot longer \nto do. Some on the other side saw the Katrina bill as a chance to enact \na National agenda of greatly enhancing social programs. I did not \nquestion their motives at the time and do not now. But, the bottom line \nwas that this attempt to leverage a crisis for a National agenda, \nsignificantly delayed our efforts to rebuild the hard-hit gulf zone.\n  As the distinguished leader will recall, the gulf state Senators, led \nby Senator Lott, forced the Senate to focus on helping their states \nrebuild and recover. A similar effort was underway in the House.\n  Fortunately, the efforts of the bipartisan group of gulf state \nSenators caused the leadership on the other side to abandon their \nefforts to leverage the hurricane disaster for a National agenda. No \none accused the leadership on the other side of being unseemly.\n  Senator Frist did the right thing and focused on the hurricane \nvictims. The leadership on the other side did the right thing and \nfocused on bipartisan hurricane relief efforts.\n  There is a lesson in this history for all of us. Do not try to \nleverage a crisis for unrelated purposes.\n  Senator Lincoln's amendment was not ``unseemly.'' To use my reaction \nto a question about the Senate schedule is to miss the point I was \nmaking The Lincoln/Kyl amendment is a reasonable effort to find a \nbipartisan compromise on a time-sensitive tax issue. It is an effort to \nenable a solution to a problem that vexes family farmers and small \nbusinesses. The amendment's purpose and substance are the opposite of \nunseemly. The Lincoln/Kyl amendment is ``decorous.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use my leader time. This chart says \nit all. In February, 651,000 Americans lost their jobs. Five million \nAmericans have lost their jobs this past year--5 million. Our \nunemployment rate currently stands at 8.1 percent. Nevada's \nunemployment is 10 percent, but Nevada is not the highest. We have some \nStates that are far more than 10 percent unemployed. Three million more \nchildren will likely be living in poverty by the end of this year. The \nnet worth of American households dropped by a combined total of $11 \ntrillion last year--$11 trillion.\n  These statistics tell a story--a very clear story--but what is even \nclearer is the suffering every American sees and feels every day.\n  Families whose incomes have fallen are now concerned that they won't \nbe able to make their next mortgage payment. Students at this time of \nthe year should be overjoyed with receiving acceptance to go to \ncollege, but because of what is happening at home--their dad or mom has \nlost a job--they can't go to college. Workers who have given decades of \nloyal service at the office or factory realize now they can't retire \nbecause their pensions are gone and their retirement savings have \ndisappeared. Senior citizens on a fixed income used to have to make a \ndecision as to whether it would be medicine or food. Now many seniors \ndon't have the choice for either.\n  We know what caused this crisis: 8 years of fiscal policies under the \nprevious administration and its allies in Congress who gave away the \nstore at the expense of the rest of America.\n  President Obama inherited a crisis that no President should have to \ninherit or fix. Instead of focusing full time on the future, he and we \nin Congress must first clean up the devastating mistakes of the past. \nWe can only turn the page from the recession to recovery if we watch \nevery single taxpayer dollar the way families watch every dollar in \ntheir budget. Every dollar counts.\n  That is why it is so stunning, so outrageous, that some would choose \nthis hour of national crisis to push an amendment to slash the estate \ntax for the superwealthy. This isn't for the wealthy; this is for the \nsuperwealthy. Yet that is what we see here today.\n  The proposal now before us would take $100 billion of American \ntaxpayer money--actually, it is more than that--more than $100 billion \nof taxpayer money over the next few years and spend it on slashing \ntaxes on the estates of the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of \nAmericans. So 99.8 percent of Americans would derive no benefit--none. \nIn fact, 99.8 percent of Americans would actually see their tax dollars \nredirected to the estates of those who are at the very top of the \neconomic food chain.\n  Here is what one newspaper said today:\n\n       The proverbial millionaires next door--the plumbers, \n     contractors, and accountants who amass substantial wealth \n     through hard work and modest living--are not the intended \n     beneficiaries of the proposed cut. The Obama budget already \n     takes care of them. That means 99.8 percent of estates will \n     never, ever pay a penny of estate tax.\n\n  Here is what another newspaper said today, entitled ``More Tax Cuts \nfor the Rich\":\n\n       The hypocrisy here is breathtaking. More fundamentally, it \n     is hard to stomach those who argue for more tax cuts--and \n     then bemoan the failure to stanch rising deficits. A vote for \n     this amendment, at this time of so much red ink and so much \n     suffering, would reflect the most skewed of priorities.\n\n  This is only a couple of the Americans all over America today trying \nto understand what is going on in Washington.\n  In recent years, Congress has already reduced tax rates on the \nultrawealthy estates. In fact, the Tax Policy Center calculates that a \n$20 million estate\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\nright now--now--will pay an effective tax rate of 23 percent. Nurses \npay more than that, schoolteachers pay more than that, and secretaries \npay a higher tax rate than that, but we say for an estate of $20 \nmillion, 23 percent is OK. That is what the Tax Policy Center \ncalculates.\n  But for the proponents of the amendment now before us, that is not \ngood enough. So they propose that we spend $100 billion on a tax cut \nfor the top two-tenths of 1 percent. Proponents of this legislation say \nthey will find offsets for this $100 billion giveaway that will make it \ndeficit neutral. Think about that. Deficit neutral. That means you have \nto get offsets.\n  Where are we going to get offsets? They have to come from somewhere. \nThey are not coming from the sky. Are we going to take them from \nMedicare? From Senator Inouye's defense budget? From the Peace Corps? \nFrom education?\n  Even in the best of times, there is no question that we could find a \nbetter use for an extra $100 billion. We could put new textbooks in \nclassrooms. We could build better renewable energy transmission lines. \nWe could provide health care to more working families. If it got out of \nhand, we could do what we did in the last years of the Clinton \nadministration: Reduce the debt.\n  I can think of no way to describe this amendment other than stunning \nhypocrisy.\n  Many of the very same Republicans who held hands with President Bush \nas he squandered a record budget surplus and turned it into a record \ndeficit suddenly claim to be ``deficit hawks.'' They tell us we cannot \ninvest in the middle class--the very people their disastrous policies \nhave harmed.\n  These same Republicans tried to stop us from providing health \ninsurance to millions of children of low-income families, so that these \nkids could go to a doctor when they are sick or hurt. They fought \nagainst President Obama's economic recovery plan, because it had the \naudacity to invest in creating jobs for victims of the recession Bush \ncreated.\n  Now they are fighting against a budget that cuts taxes for the middle \nclass, puts us on a path toward cutting the Republican deficit in half, \nand invests in middle-class priorities, such as health care, education, \nand clean, renewable energy. That is what Chairman Conrad has done.\n  After 8 years of creating a record deficit so that they could slash \ntaxes on the ultrawealthy, now they oppose our efforts to help the \nmiddle class.\n  These newly hatched deficit hawks say no to any proposal that invests \nin the people their policies harmed. But when it comes to giving away \nanother $100 billion plus of taxpayer money to the top two-tenths of 1 \npercent--money that could pay down the deficit they claim to care so \nmuch about--these same Senators line up in support.\n  Again, this is stunning hypocrisy. Not only that; it is outrageous \nhypocrisy.\n  When the estate tax issue was debated back in 2005, in the aftermath \nof Hurricane Katrina, the then-chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley, said this--remember, at that time there was a defined \ngroup of people who were suffering in the gulf, but now it is the whole \ncountry. Today, it was announced on the radio that, for the first time \nsince the Great Depression, all 50 States, without exception, have a \ndownturn in their economy. Here is what Senator Grassley said then, \nafter Hurricane Katrina:\n\n       It's a little unseemly to be talking about doing away with \n     or enhancing the estate tax at a time when people are \n     suffering.\n\n  If Katrina, which was a disaster for this country, was a reason not \nto do the estate tax, why now when all 300 million Americans are \nsuffering? People are suffering now in every city, State, and town in \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It amounts to nothing \nbut a giveaway to the wealthiest two-tenths of 1 percent of Americans, \nat the expense of the other 99.8 percent of Americans.\n  Especially in this time of economic crisis, this is the wrong \npriority for our country. I ask everybody to vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Lincoln \namendment No. 873.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 974, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 974, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that no additional estate tax relief beyond that \n which is already assumed in this resolution, which protects over 99.7 \n  percent of estates from the estate tax, shall be allowed under any \n deficit-neutral reserve fund unless an equal amount of aggregate tax \n  relief is also provided to Americans earning less than $100,000 per \n                                 year)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.__. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES \n                   ADDITIONAL RELIEF FOR THE ESTATE TAX BEYOND THE \n                   LEVELS ASSUMED IN THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION UNLESS \n                   AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL TAX RELIEF IS \n                   PROVIDED TO MIDDLE-CLASS TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order to \n     consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that would provide estate tax relief beyond \n     $3,500,000 per person ($7,000,000 per married couple) and a \n     graduated rate ending at less that 45 percent unless an equal \n     amount of tax relief is provided to Americans earning less \n     than $100,000 per year and that such relief is in addition to \n     the amounts assumed in this budget resolution.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate duly chosen and sworn shall be required \n     to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on any point \n     of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the midst of the worst recession in 75 \nyears, with hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs and \ntheir homes, 51 Members of the Senate believe our highest priority is \nto give a generous tax break to the wealthiest people in America. Many \nof these same Senators have been wailing for weeks about deficits but \nobviously believe deficits do not count when it comes to tax breaks for \nthe wealthy.\n  At this point, it is clear they would move forward with these tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest people in America. My amendment is simple. It \ncreates a point of order. It says we should help struggling Americans \nfirst. Before we give an additional $100 billion in tax breaks to the \nsuperwealthy, we must first give at least as much in tax relief to \nAmericans earning less than $100,000. It will be tax relief beyond that \nalready included in this budget resolution.\n  The amendment creates a point of order that if the people insist, a \nmajority of Senators, that we give this estate tax to the wealthiest, \nat least let's help working families first before we do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate just voted to support estate tax \nrelief set at $5 million per person to be exempted and at no more than \na 35-percent rate. The Durbin amendment creates a point of order unless \nyou have a rate of at least 45 percent and a $3.5 million per person \nexempted amount. It is directly contrary to what we just voted for. \nWere this to be adopted, you would have two absolutely contradictory \ninstructions--one for a $5 million exempted amount; the Durbin \namendment, $3.5 million. Having voted the way we did, the Durbin \namendment should be defeated.\n  To the extent that it suggests there should be other tax relief, I \nstipulate to that, I am all for it. But the point of order relates to \nanything above the $3.5 million or below the 45-percent rate.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 974, as modified.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the attacks of September 11, 2001, \nCongress has taken steps to give the Federal law enforcement and \nintelligence community the necessary tools to keep our citizens safe \nfrom terrorist attacks. Last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. When asked about \nexpiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act, Director Mueller urged Congress \nto renew these provisions. He referred to them as ``exceptional tools \nto help protect our national security.'' Director Mueller further \nprovided the committee with information regarding the use of these \nprovisions.\n  From 2004 to 2007, the roving wiretaps provision was used 225 times--\nthat is--25 times over 3 years. That breaks down to 75 times a year. \nRoving wiretaps were only used 147 times in 3 years. Congress granted \nthe FBI the authority to use national security letters, NSL, in \ncounterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations. The use of \nNSLs is invaluable in these investigations. Their use also predates the \nattacks on 9/11.\n  The uninformed and the paranoid portray these tools as an example of \nunchecked government monitoring reminiscent of a scene from George \nOrwell's book ``1984.'' I would submit to my colleagues that these \nfigures show that these necessary tools have not been overused. Fail-\nsafes and checks against overuse and improper application exist at \nnumerous levels in this process. Changing administrations does not \ndiminish the terrorism threat to our country. Two days ago, a Taliban \nleader responsible for brazen attacks in Pakistan issued a threat to \nattack the White House.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, This amendment will go far in meeting the \nFederal Government's trust responsibility to provide health care \nservices to Native Americans.\n  There is a health care crisis in Indian Country and I have spoken \nmany times on the Senate floor about the importance of funding and \nmeeting our obligation to provide for the health care of the First \nAmericans. There are over 4 million Native Americans in this country, \njust fewer than 2 million of which depend on the Indian Health Service \nfor their health care needs. However, the Indian Health Service is \nseverely underfunded. Despite our trust obligation to Indian Tribes, \nthe Federal Government spends twice as much on the health care of \nFederal prisoners as we do on American Indians.\n  My amendment will increase the budget authority for the Indian Health \nService by an additional $200 million to obtain a total of $600 million \nin increased budget authority over the fiscal year 2009 enacted level. \nThe President's request for ``over $4 billion'' for total IHS funding, \nasks for an increase for IHS of over $400 million. My amendment will \nincrease the President's budget request from $400 million to $600 \nmillion in increased budget authority for the Indian Health Service. \nThis brings us to the total that committee Vice Chairman Barrasso and I \nrecommended for the Indian Health Service for fiscal year 2010 in our \nviews and estimates letter to the Senate Budget Committee on March 13, \n2009. As my colleagues will remember, last year, Congress \noverwhelmingly passed a similar amendment requesting a $1 billion \nincrease in Indian Health Service budget authority by a vote of 69 to \n31. I ask my colleagues to again consider the great need for assistance \nin Indian health, even in these tough economic times.\n  While $200 million is small in comparison to the unmet needs of the \nIndian Health Service, when included with the President's request, the \namendment makes the overall increase in budget authority equal to $600 \nmillion. This amendment is crucial because it shows that Congress is \ncommitted to funding the Indian Health Service at a higher level and \nemphasizes the government's effort to continue to fulfill its trust \nresponsibility to provide health care in Indian Country.\n  We passed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act on the floor of the \nSenate in the 110th Congress. I am proud of that because it had been \nmany years since this Congress had addressed the issue of Indian health \ncare. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass the House and Indian Country \nsuffers the consequences.\n  Through a number of hearings by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, \nwe have confirmed extensive unmet health care needs in Indian Country. \nThe need includes over $3 billion just for health facilities and an \never growing $1 billion for contract health services. The health status \nof Native Americans are staggering. For example, Native Americans die \nat higher rates than other Americans from tuberculosis 600 percent \nhigher, alcoholism, 510 percent higher, diabetes, 189 percent higher, \nand suicide, 70 percent higher. Third\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\nworld conditions exist right here in this country on Indian lands.\n  The story of Jami Rose Jetty highlights what underfunding the Indian \nhealth care system means to the lives of our youth and families in \nIndian Country and communities across the U.S. In February, I held an \nIndian Affairs oversight hearing on youth suicide. At that hearing, a \nyoung woman of 16 years old, named Dana Lee Jetty of the Spirit Lake \nNation in North Dakota testified. She told the story of losing her \nsister, Jami Rose Jetty, who committed suicide at just 14 years old.\n  Dana described her sister Jami as someone who had a lot of friends \nand was mature for her age. Jami was an open-minded, caring, and \ncompassionate teenager. The sisters were best friends and part of a \nmiddle-class, loving home.\n  Jami's mother knew there was something wrong with her daughter. She \ntook Jami to Indian health care facilities over and over again, but no \ndoctor properly diagnosed her depression. Even though her mother knew \nbetter, the doctors would say Jami was ``just a typical teenager'' and \nsend the family home. In November 2008, Jami took her own life.\n  During her testimony, Dana emphasized that she felt her sister Jami \nwould still be alive had there been trained mental health professionals \navailable near the Spirit Lake Reservation. Unfortunately, Jami didn't \nreceive the services she needed. Dana, her family, and the entire \nSpirit Lake community were affected by the loss of this precious young \nlife.\n  Jami did not receive the care she needed because we have a health \ncare system in Indian Country that is not working. It is dramatically \nunderfunded. We are rationing health care and people are dying as a \nresult. It is truly a scandal, which should be front-page news.\n  Mr. President, by asking for an increase in Indian health funding, my \namendment allows us to continue the dialogue with Indian Country. It \nemphasizes that the United States understands the health disparities \nthat Native Americans face and that we will make Indian Country a \npriority this Congress. I thank my colleagues for joining me today and \nin the future in supporting efforts to improve the health of Native \nAmericans throughout the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 965\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, next we go to an amendment by Senator \nDeMint with respect to the auto industry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I call up amendment No. 965.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 965.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prevent taxpayer-funded bailotus for auto manufacturers)\n\n       On page 4, line 13, decrease the amount by $10,829,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, decrease the amount by $131,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $195,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $279,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $379,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $485,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, decrease the amount by $10,829,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $131,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $195,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $279,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, decrease the amount by $379,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, decrease the amount by $485,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $10,829,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $131,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $195,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $279,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $379,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $485,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $10,829,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $10,960,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $11,155,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $11,434,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by $11,813,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 21, decrease the amount by $12,298,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 24, decrease the amount by $10,829,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 25, decrease the amount by $10,960,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 1, decrease the amount by $11,155,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 2, decrease the amount by $11,434,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 3, decrease the amount by $11,813,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 4, decrease the amount by $12,298,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 17, decrease the amount by \n     $10,800,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 18, decrease the amount by \n     $10,800,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 20, decrease the amount by $29,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $29,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $131,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $131,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 3, decrease the amount by $195,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $195,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, decrease the amount by $279,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, decrease the amount by $279,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 11, decrease the amount by $379,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, decrease the amount by $379,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 15, decrease the amount by $485,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $485,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this amendment is called the Auto Bailout \nPrevention Amendment. We are debating an amendment which spends more, \nborrows more, and taxes more than any budget in history. Americans are \nalready fed up with how much we spent on all the bailouts. One of the \nareas they are most frustrated with is the auto bailouts. We have \nalready taken over $17 billion from funds designated to financial \ninstitutions and now the administration is talking about some form of \nbankruptcy while General Motors and Chrysler have asked for another \n$21.6 billion.\n  This amendment reduces function 370 funds by $21.6 billion, which \nprevents the President from further using TARP to prop up General \nMotors and Chrysler with taxpayer dollars.\n  Enough is enough. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Stabenow has the time in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, just 3 days ago, President Obama \nreleased a bold new plan to revitalize the American auto industry. We \nneed to give this plan a chance to work. There are two or three \ndifferent outcomes. But they are in the middle of the boldest \nrestructuring of the American auto industry we have ever seen. This \nwould cut the legs out from under that.\n  Our President has made it clear that we are not going to walk away \nfrom the people, the communities or the businesses--the thousands of \nbusinesses that depend on the auto industry.\n  I would finally say that all around the world countries such as Japan \nhelping Toyota, Germany, Korea, China, France--around the world, other \ncountries understand the critical nature for their own national \nsecurity in terms of the auto industry; their economic security in \nterms of building a middle class, and they have stepped forward in this \nglobal credit crisis to help their auto industries.\n  We are now in the middle of a plan to save jobs in communities and \nrestructure. I urge strongly a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 965.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd)\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 31, nays 66, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 148 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--31\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--66\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Kennedy\n       \n  The amendment (No. 965) was rejected.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate \nunanimously approved my amendment to maximize college affordability and \naccess by helping to preserve competition and choice in the student \nloan program. I look forward to working with my colleagues to preserve \nthe Federal Family Education Loan--FFEL--program as a viable program \nfor students and institutions of higher education.\n  My amendment is very straightforward and it calls on the Congress to \nmaintain ``a competitive student loan program that provides students \nand institutions of higher education with a comprehensive choice of \nloan products and services.'' We know that institutions of higher \neducation like the ability to choose which program to participate in, \nand 73 percent of schools choose to use the FFEL program.\n  I think that we should maintain that ability of institutions to \nchoose which program to participate in so that we can give them, and \ntheir students, the best options, the best services, and the best \nprograms.\n  The President's budget proposes to originate all new student loans in \nthe Direct Loan program, which is a proposal that I do not support. \nWhen I was U.S. Secretary of Education, I opposed the creation of the \nDirect Loan program because I felt that the Federal Government \nshouldn't be in the business of being a bank. I still feel that way. \nThe problem with the government operating as a bank is that we would \nhave to borrow a lot of money and add to the Federal deficit. The FFEL \nprogram last year generated $52.9 billion in loans, while the Direct \nLoan program generated $21.8 billion. If we were to move all of the \nFFEL loans to the government's loan program, that's a lot more debt to \nadd to our books. I don't think we should do that right now when we \nknow that the FFEL program is working.\n  I also thought that the Federal Government wouldn't be able to manage \nthat many loans very effectively or efficiently for the students, and I \nhaven't changed my mind on that. There are 6,000 colleges and \nuniversities, and over 15 million loans each year to students and \nparents. The Department of Education can't manage that many loans, nor \nshould they. It is a massive undertaking that calls on over 30,000 \npeople throughout our Nation working for banks, guarantors, and \nnonprofit lenders. We don't need to increase the Department of \nEducation staffing by 30,000 people, so I don't see why we should move \nall of the loans and operations to that agency.\n  As the president of one of our lenders in Tennessee recently wrote in \nthe Knoxville News Sentinel, ``Nationalizing the student loan industry \nwould be the equivalent of the government taking over the parcel \nshipping industry and doing away with FedEx and UPS, relying entirely \non the U.S. Postal Service.'' We can't afford to take that risk when we \nare dealing with students.\n  In the past week we have all heard from many of the institutions of \nhigher education in our States favoring the continuation of the FFEL \nprogram. My amendment does just that, and it sends the message that the \nU.S. Senate supports giving colleges and universities--and ultimately \nparents and students--the choice which student loan program works best \nfor them.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say that we are just about ready.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 967\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to go to DeMint amendment \nNo. 967.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to call up DeMint Amendment \nNo. 967.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To implement President Obama's earmark reforms)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EARMARK POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider a bill, resolution, amendment, or conference report \n     that includes--\n       (1) a congressional earmark to a private for profit entity \n     that is not subject to the same competitive bidding \n     requirements as other Federal contracts;\n       (2) a congressional earmark which has not been the subject \n     of a public hearing in the committee of jurisdiction where \n     the member requesting the earmark has testified on its \n     behalf; or\n       (3) a congressional earmark which has not been posted on \n     the Member sponsor's website at least 72 hours before \n     consideration of the legislation.\n       (b) Trading Earmarks.--A Senator may not trade a \n     congressional earmark for any political favor, including a \n     campaign contribution.\n       (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeals.--\n       (1) Waiver.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of \n     the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of subsection (a) shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``congressional \n     earmark'' means a provision or report language included \n     primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident \n     Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or \n     recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget \n     authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for \n     a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or \n     other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a \n     specific State, locality or Congressional district, other \n     than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or \n     competitive award process.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, one of the changes President Obama said he \nwould bring to Washington is earmark reform.\n  Last month, on March 11, he laid out his plan. And that is what this \namendment is. It is a four-point plan. I will explain it with quotes \nfrom the President: Any earmark for a for-profit private company should \nbe subject to the same competitive bidding requirements as other \nFederal contracts; No. 2, each earmark must be open to scrutiny at \npublic hearings where Members will have to justify their expense to the \ntaxpayer; No. 3, earmarks that Members do seek might be aired on those \nMembers' websites in advance so the public and the press can examine \nthem and judge their merits for themselves; and, No. 4, that he would \nprohibit the trading of earmarks for public favors.\n  It is just that simple. This is the President's plan for earmark \nreform. I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Chairman Inouye has the time in opposition.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at this moment, if you are trying to get \nan earmark in the bill, you have to have it posted on your Web site 30 \ndays before markup to give the public an opportunity to look at the Web \nsite.\n  Secondly, there is much transparency, much more than ever before.\n  Thirdly, we have reduced earmarks to less than 1 percent. And now \nthat, as our Senator has indicated, on March 11, the President spoke on \nthe earmarks, it went something further.\n  The President said:\n\n       I recognize that Congress has the power of the purse, and I \n     believe that individual Members of the Congress understand \n     their districts best. They should have the ability to respond \n     to the needs of the communities.\n\n  Yes, all of us were elected to represent our districts and our \nStates. We were not elected to be rubberstamps of anyone.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from South \nCarolina creates a point of order against legislation that does not \ncomply with President Obama's recently proposed earmark reforms.\n  The amendment ignores the layers of reforms that Congress has adopted \nin recent years and the reduction in the amount of earmarks that has \nalready taken place.\n  For the coming fiscal cycle the Appropriations Committee has required \nthat earmarks be posted on the requesting Members' Web sites well in \nadvance of the appropriations bills even being considered in \nsubcommittee. This well exceeds the 72 hour threshold sought by \nPresident Obama. And I note that President Obama will not make public \nhis own earmark requests prior to publication of his budget.\n  The amendment would require all Senators to testify at hearings in \nsupport of any earmarks they seek. If testimony by Senators is to be \nrequired to justify legislative initiatives, why on Earth would we want \nto limit this to earmarks? Shouldn't Senators be required to testify at \nhearings in support of any legislative initiative they advocate? When \nwas the hearing on the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina?\n  The amendment purports to prohibit earmarks from being traded for \n``political favors.'' Mr. President, does this mean it is OK to trade \nany other official act for political favors? Does this give Members \nlicense to pursue legislative provisions for labor interests or for \nparticular industries in exchange for political favors? Of course, it \ndoesn't. My colleagues are well aware that trading earmarks or any \nother official act for political favors is already against the laws and \nethics rules of this body.\n  I am happy for earmarks and all other legislative matters to be \nsubject to the scrutiny of the legislative process. That is exactly as \nit should be. I hope my colleagues will support efforts to consider \nindividual appropriations bills this summer in an orderly and timely \nmanner so that the Senator from South Carolina and all other Members \ncan offer amendments to eliminate spending that they see as wasteful.\n  But we don't need new points of order to do this. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \namendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is considered made.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and as a longstanding steward \nof the environment, I have continuously requested increased funding for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star for Small Business \nProgram, which has documented how voluntary action by small business \nowners can reduce energy costs by 30 percent or more.\n  The Snowe-Landrieu amendment would require that a minimum of 2 \npercent of the EPA's Energy Star Program's total budget be allocated to \nthe Energy Star for Small Business Program. This critical program \nprovides free unbiased information and technical support for small \nbusinesses to improve their company's financial performance by reducing \nenergy waste and energy costs, while protecting the Earth's \nenvironment.\n  Regrettably, in the past, less than 2 percent of Energy Star's annual \nfunding has been allocated to the Small Business program which is \nresponsible for reaching the entire small business community, thereby \nrestricting its tremendous potential impact. This inadequate percentage \ngrossly underestimates the critical role small businesses can play in \nimproving our Nation's energy efficiency and reducing our carbon \nfootprint.\n  Through efforts to increase energy efficiency, small businesses can \ncontribute to America's energy security,\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\nhelp to combat global warming, while strengthening their competitive \nadvantage all at the same time. With 27 million small businesses in the \nU.S. comprising 99.7 percent of all domestic employer firms and \nproducing approximately half of all the commercial and industrial \nenergy in the United States, the role small businesses can play in \nforging a solution to global climate change and rising energy prices is \nundeniable.\n  This amendment would provide small businesses with the funding, \ntechnical assistance, and resources necessary to improve small business \nenergy efficiency. Every effort must be made at the Federal level to \nensure the connection small businesses can engage in clean and \nrenewable energy. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator Brown, \nwhich I am cosponsoring, to create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \nsupport funding for critical workforce strategy programs that help \nindividuals seeking specialized training for emerging industries. This \nreserve fund will help highlight the need for resources to grow new \nemployment opportunities that are critical to economic recovery by \nsupporting workforce strategy programs that help those in need of \ntraining.\n  Any effort to further stabilize our careening economy must include \nconsideration of job training and transformation. Improving and \nreauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, to help the millions \nof unemployed--and millions more underemployed--must be a critical \nelement of bolstering our economy.\n  Much has been made of the phenomena of ``green jobs'' and a ``green \ntechnology.''At a recent speech in Atlanta, author Tom Friedman urged \nAmerica to retake the lead in the world through innovation in ``ET''--\nEnergy Technology. Friedman said the United States needs to ``invent a \nsource of abundant, cheap, clean, reliable electrons.'' He compared the \n``ET'' movement to the ``IT''--Information Technology--movement of the \nlast decade. There are thousands of entrepreneurs who are developing \nthe next energy concept that will revolutionize our energy policies, \nand those concepts will need a highly educated and prepared workforce \nto make them a reality. The job training programs already in place \nunder the Workforce Investment Act can help activate Americans, and \nexpedite the transformation into a new energy economy. I believe this \namendment will help ensure funding for our workers to get the best \ntraining and pave the way for just such a revolutionary shift in the \nfuture of this country.\n  Throughout the Nation, workforce strategy programs, like those within \nWIA, are being used to promote the long-term competitiveness of \nindustries and to advance employment opportunities. For example, the \nState of Maine has created a program called the North Star Alliance \nInitiative. The Alliance has brought together Maine's boat builders, \nthe University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Centers, \nMaine's marine and composite trade association, economic development \ngroups, and investment organizations for the purpose of advancing \nworkforce training.\n  In order to promote programs like the North Star Alliance Initiative, \nSenator Brown and I introduced the SECTORS Act, S. 777, which provides \ngrants to industry clusters--interrelated group of businesses, service \nproviders, and associated institutions in order to establish and expand \nsector partnerships. By providing financial assistance to these \npartnerships, this legislation would create customized workforce \ntraining solutions for specific industries at a regional level. A \nsector approach is beneficial because it can focus on the dual goals of \npromoting the long-term competitiveness of industries and advancing \nemployment opportunities for workers, thereby encouraging economic \ngrowth. Existing sector partnerships have long been recognized as key \nstrategic elements within some of the most successful economic \ndevelopment initiatives throughout the country. Unfortunately, current \nfederal policy does not provide sufficient support for these critical \nventures. This amendment will help ensure that critical funding will be \nmade available for the SECTORS Act if it is passed into law.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 969\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, now we wish to go to the Sessions \namendment No. 969.\n  Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  This Congress passed the Secure Fence Act of 2006 by a vote of 80 to \n19, with broad bipartisan support, including then-Senators Obama, \nBiden, and Clinton. We committed to 700 miles of barriers. Today we are \nless than halfway there. The funding has simply not been there.\n  Some progress is being made in areas where the fencing is in place. \nWe have had a dramatic reduction in crime in the San Diego area since \nthe fence was completed a number of years ago. This will help us reduce \ncrime. It will help us reduce drug smuggling, gun smuggling, and \nimmigration violations. We have a lawless border.\n  Progress is being made, colleagues. We are seeing a reduction in the \nnumber of people entering America, a reduction in the number of \narrests. And if we follow through with what we have told the American \npeople we intend to do, we will be able to create a lawful system of \nimmigration, which is a responsibility this Congress has.\n  I urge support of this amendment. It is consistent with previous \nvotes. It puts a budget point of order against an appropriation in this \narea that does not fund the fence completion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 969.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a point of order against any appropriations \nbill that fails to fully fund the construction of the Southwest border \n                                 fence)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, Senator Schumer has the time in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, many of us supported the fence. Many of \nus opposed it. But one thing is for sure, there is only about $120 \nmillion left to complete this section of the fence.\n  The amendment we have before us--without an evaluation as to whether \nit is effective, without an evaluation of where the new parts should \ngo, without an evaluation as to whether there are other, better ways to \ndeal with the problem of undocumented and illegal immigration--says \nvote $2.6 billion whether it works or not. That does not make much \nsense at a time when we are trying to balance the budget, be fiscally \naustere.\n  I had prepared a side by side. Let's have an evaluation by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Border Patrol and everyone else \nas to whether the fence is working. I do not think that is clear. We \nshould find out where it is working, how to make it better.\n  Another thing we do here, without even any test, is set a double \nfence--$2.6 billion whether we know it works or not. I urge the \namendment be defeated; we let the Department of Homeland Security study \nthe most effective\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nway to deal with illegal immigration, and if a double fence or another \nthing is needed, we will learn about that in time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a number of concerns about this \nbudget, and I have heard from a number of Americans who see in the \nbudget hundreds of millions of dollars for health care which suggests \nthat the Government is not only going to expand into banks and auto \ncompanies and education but to expand into health care. One of the \npropositions President Obama made is that Americans will always be able \nto pick their own plans and choose their own doctors. This amendment \nsimply codifies that. It creates a point of order against any \nlegislation that would eliminate the ability of a patient to pick their \nown plans or their own doctor.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Mr. President, would Senator DeMint be willing \nto accept a voice vote?\n  Mr. DeMINT. If you can assure me we will win.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I assure you.\n  Mr. DeMINT. It is a done deal. Thank you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask to take this on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 963) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that gives us five. We are going to go to \nthe countdown; five plus final passage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 964\n\n  DeMint No. 964 is the next amendment in order.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 964.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 964.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect small \nand home businesses from the burdensome and impractical requirements of \n          the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO \n                   BAN ON LEAD IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of 1 or more \n     committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for \n     the programs described in paragraphs (1) through (6) in 1 or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that fund consumer product safety, \n     including any program that--\n       (1) delays the lead ban in section 101 of the Consumer \n     Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (15 U.S.C. 1278a) by 6 \n     months;\n       (2) exempts thrift stores, consignment shops, and other \n     second hand sellers from the provisions of such section;\n       (3) exempts children's motorcycles and all terrain vehicles \n     from treatment as banned hazardous substances under such \n     section;\n       (4) exempts books from treatment as banned hazardous \n     substances under such section;\n       (5) allows a product to comply with the lead ban in such \n     section if every component of the product complies with the \n     ban; or\n       (6) does not require products manufactured before the \n     effective date of the ban under such section to be removed \n     from store shelves.\n       (b) Limitation.--The authority described in subsection (a) \n     may not be used unless the appropriations in the legislation \n     described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) \n     would not increase the deficit over--\n       (1) the 6-year period beginning with the first day of \n     fiscal year 2009; or\n       (2) the 11-year period beginning with the first day of \n     fiscal year 2009.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors Senators Bennett, Enzi, Brownback, Coburn, and Vitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for my colleagues' attention because \nthis is not a partisan amendment; it is not a messaging amendment.\n  Many of my colleagues have probably heard from a number of \nconstituents about some problems with the Consumer Product Safety Act \nthat we passed. This amendment simply allows for the improvement of \nthat bill with certain considerations such as allowing current \ninventory to sell through, exempting thrift stores and secondhand \nsellers, exempting book sales and children's motorcycles, allowing \nmanufacturers to prove there is no lead content\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\nby proving that their components have no lead contents. This means they \ndon't have to destroy existing inventory if they can prove it is safe. \nThis amendment does nothing to diminish safety, but it is common sense.\n  Please, this is costing millions of dollars, thousands of jobs across \nthis country. I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Pryor has the time in opposition.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Pryor has the time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this amendment is a bad amendment. Last \nyear, the Senate passed this legislation with 97 votes. It is a good \nbill. It bans lead in children's toys. It does so many other great \nthings to make sure our marketplace is safe. It protects us from unsafe \nChinese toys.\n  We need to vote against this amendment. The problem is not with the \nact. It is very clear from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nwhere the Commissioner, who is not the Chairman, says that the single \nmost important step that needs to be taken in furtherance of the \nimplementation of the CPSIA at the agency is to have a third \nCommissioner who would also be a chairman appointed to lead the agency. \nUntil then, any legislative fixes are premature.\n  The CPSC has the authority to fix all the problems that have been \nraised by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I strongly urge that we vote for our children and vote no on the \nDeMint amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Thune \namendment, No. 870, be modified with the changes which are at the desk, \nnotwithstanding adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 24, line 24, increase the amount by $99,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $28,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $59,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, decrease the amount by $99,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 3, decrease the amount by $28,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, decrease the amount by $59,000,000.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are now down to three amendments and \nfinal passage, and one of the three can be done on a voice vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 828\n\n  The next amendment in order is Coburn amendment No. 828.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, imagine tomorrow morning, if we are in \nsession, and you no longer get to vote your conscience, that a Federal \nbureaucrat will tell you what you can and cannot do.\n  The fact is, we have wonderful physicians in this country who make \ndecisions every day based on a multitude of factors, including what \nthey think in their conscience is right. This is an amendment which \nsimply protects that right, just as you would want the right for your \nvote in this body to be protected. It also protects the conscience of a \npatient to be able to choose the physician and the caregiver to whom \nthey trust their body and their health.\n  I hope this body will support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 828.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the freedom of conscience for patients and the \n  right of health care providers to serve patients without violating \n                 their moral and religious convictions)\n\n       On page 31, strike lines 3 through 7 and insert the \n     following: ``cans;\n       (8) maintain long-term fiscal sustainability and pays for \n     itself by reducing health care cost growth, improving \n     productivity, or dedicating additional sources of revenue; or\n       (9)(A) subject to subparagraph (B), protect the freedom of \n     conscience for patients and the right of health care \n     providers to serve patients without violating their moral and \n     religious convictions, which includes, but is not limited to, \n     prohibiting--\n       (i) discrimination on the basis of a provider's objection \n     to perform or participate in specific surgical or medical \n     procedures or prescribe certain pharmaceuticals;\n       (ii) legal coercion against a provider who expresses a \n     conscience objection to perform or participate in specific \n     surgical or medical procedures or prescribe certain \n     pharmaceuticals; and\n       (iii) government coercion of patients to enroll in specific \n     health insurance plans or see pre-selected health care \n     providers; and\n       (B) require the principles described in subparagraph (A) \n     shall not be construed to authorize or shield from liability \n     the denial, on the basis of a patient's race or present or \n     predicted disability, of a surgical or medical procedure or \n     pharmaceutical that a provider offers to others;''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Murray has the time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this amendment would put in place a \nregulation that would mean health care providers--not just doctors but \nanybody in a health care clinic or hospital--could refuse millions of \nwomen health care for critical services. It jeopardizes Federal family \nplanning services, Medicaid, and title X, and it undermines State laws \nthat guarantee women access to contraceptive services.\n  Health and Human Services has proposed to rescind this rule which the \nBush administration published when their clock was running out.\n  This amendment puts ideology ahead of science and ahead of women's \nhealth care. Federal law already permits medical professionals to \ndecline to assist in abortions based on their religious beliefs. But \nstopping this regulation will not change that. This amendment goes way \ntoo far and ignores the needs of patients and denies women reproductive \nhealth care services.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nreading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require States to implement drug testing programs for \n    applicants for and recipients of assistance under the Temporary \n  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which would encourage \n healthy, drug-free families instead of encouraging dependent behavior \n                        or on-going drug abuse)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.__. RESERVE FUND TO REQUIRE DRUG TESTING AND TO PROVIDE \n                   DRUG TREATMENT FOR TANF RECIPIENTS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for a bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     that--\n       (1) Would require that States operate a drug testing \n     program as part of their Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Families (TANF) program;\n       (2) Would provide treatment programs for those who test \n     positive for illegal drug use or are convicted of drug-\n     related crime;\n       (3) Would withhold TANF assistance for two years to any \n     recipient who, after initially testing positive and having \n     been offered treatment, again tests positive; and\n       (4) Would not reduce or deny TANF assistance allocated for \n     dependents if the dependent's caretaker tests positive for \n     drug use or is convicted of drug-related crime; by the \n     amounts provided in that legislation for that purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase deficit \n     over either the total of the period of fiscal years 2009 \n     through 2014 or the period of the total of fiscal years of \n     2009 through 2019.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It advances \nthe policy of drug testing for welfare or TANF recipients. If a \nrecipient were to test positive, they would get treatment. If they \ntested positive again, then and only then would they be denied the \nbenefit.\n  Under no circumstances, would the children of that beneficiary be \ndenied the children's benefit because they, of course, would not be a \nguilty party in any way.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Baucus will speak in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment for a lot of \nreasons. No. 1, this is an unfunded mandate. The TANF program, the low-\nincome program, the welfare program, is a block grant program. We give \nto all the States and the States set up their own systems under TANF. \nThis is an unfunded mandate. It tells States they have to test all low-\nincome people for drugs.\n  I think, frankly, it is a mean-spirited amendment. I believe we \nshould not equate all low-income families with drug addiction. States \ncan decide for themselves if they want to drug test. My State of \nMontana does. TANF, again, is a block grant program. States can decide \nfor themselves what they want to do. We should not equate all low-\nincome families with drug addiction, and I strongly encourage this \namendment be soundly defeated.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I don't understand what is mean spirited \nabout not giving tax money to folks who have drug problems and about \ntrying to get them help, which is the first and most important thing we \ncan do to actually help them.\n  I urge broad bipartisan support for this commonsense amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during these recent budget debates, I have \nbeen reminded that some in Washington used to mock President Reagan for \nthe ``rosy economic scenarios'' they said his budgets relied upon. But \nnever--until now--has any President's economic model differed so \nfundamentally from those predicted by most independent analysts.\n  President Obama's budget chief, Peter Orszag, predicts that from \n2010-2013 the economy will grow 4 percent a year. But the blue-chip \neconomic forecasters say it is much lower--about 2.7 percent. That is a \nbig difference when we are talking about hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  President Obama claims his budget will halve the deficit by 2014. But \nthe way it gets there is by first running up a huge deficit and then \ncutting that number in half. The Congressional Budget Office now \nprojects a $1.669 trillion deficit in 2009 that will bottom out at $658 \nbillion in 2012, which is still more than 40 percent above the highest \ndeficit during the Bush administration. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice also says the deficits accumulated by Obama's budget will then \nsurge to $9.2 trillion in 2019.\n  President Obama has said he will cut taxes for 95 percent of \nAmericans. But his budget would raise taxes by $1.4 trillion over 10 \nyears. It not only lets some of the existing tax rates expire--thus \nraising taxes--but implements a colossal energy tax that will impact \nevery American household--regardless of income--and is estimated to \ndrop an additional $3,168 annual bill on every family, on top of its \nexisting energy costs. Remember, candidate Obama told us that under \nthis energy plan, ``electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' \nWhy is this a good idea?\n  Economic historian John Steele Gordon draws this analogy to an energy \ntax in the recent issue of Commentary magazine: ``If passed it will act \non the economy as a whole exactly the way a governor acts on a steam \nengine, increasingly resisting any increase in revolutions per minute. \n. . . The more the economy tries to speed up the more [this tax] will \nwork to prevent it from doing so.''\n  Think about the incongruity between the growth predicted in President \nObama's budget and the policies his budget would partially implement. \nThis budget would saddle American taxpayers, businesses, and industry--\neveryone--with a bevy of new tax increases and regulations that, once \nenacted, will unavoidably harm job creation and growth by making it \nmore expensive for businesses to hire and by removing money from the \nprivate economy and transferring it to Washington.\n  How can our economy recover with the Government hampering job \ncreation and growth?\n  Facts are stubborn things, as President Reagan used to say. We know \nthat raising taxes in time of recession has never helped the economy \ngrow. Why would this time be different?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly believe that the Senate needs \nto address the serious and pressing problem of climate change, and I \nlook forward to that debate this Congress. I do not, however, believe \nit would be appropriate to use the fast-track procedure known as \nreconciliation to consider climate change legislation. Reconciliation \nis intended for legislation that reduces the deficit. I have strongly \nopposed past efforts to use reconciliation to address policy matters, \nsuch as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It wasn't \nappropriate then; it isn't appropriate now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in approaching the budget for fiscal year \n2010, I am heavily influenced by the $700 billion expenditure in \nPresident Bush's bailout package--it was badly administered and I voted \nagainst release of the second $350 billion--and the President Obama \ntwin brother $787 billion stimulus package. We have to take a closer \nlook than usual at the mounting deficits and mounting national debt. \nThese budget votes are all going to be determined by the Democratic \nmajority largely on party lines so my vote is really a protest vote and \nto show there is substantial concern, at least with the loyal \nopposition, to limit Federal expenditures. To that end, I supported \namendments offered by Senators Sessions, No. 772, and Crapo No. 844, to \nfreeze domestic discretionary spending. I also supported amendments by \nSenators Alexander, No. 747, and Gregg, No. 739, to require a 60-vote \nthreshold on any budget resolution that increases public debt.\n  Congress must take action to address the current deficit spending \nespecially the increasing funds for entitlement programs. I supported \nan amendment offered by Senator Gregg, No. 835, to establish a \ncommission to examine the long-term obligations of the Federal \nGovernment and make recommendations to reduce that spending. Similarly, \nI voted in favor of the McCain amendment, No. 882, as an alternative \nbudget resolution to lay down a marker to encourage reductions in \nFederal expenditures. The budget is just an outline without any of \nthese votes being determinative as to what will occur on appropriations \nbills, where I will take another look at spending proposals depending \non circumstances at that time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 2010. The resolution embraces many priorities that I strongly \nsupport. They include a renewed commitment to energy efficiency, \neducational improvements, middle-class tax cuts, and our veterans.\n  The resolution preserves the major priorities in President Obama's \nbudget that was submitted to Congress. The President's budget outlined \na blueprint for addressing and reversing the effects of the deep \nrecession, collapse of the housing and credit markets, and the rise in \njoblessness that we inherited from the previous administration by \nsetting the stage for sustained economic growth through investments in \nenergy, education, and infrastructure, which were begun in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA. Since President Obama's budget was \nsubmitted to Congress, the CBO's re-estimate of that budget has added \n$2.3 trillion to long-term deficit projections. Accordingly, the \nresolution adjusts the President's budget to cut the long-term deficit \nin half from $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 2010 to $508 billion in \nfiscal year 2014 while retaining the President's core priorities.\n  The resolution matches the funding level in the President's budget \nfor fiscal year 2010 energy discretionary funding to reduce our \ndependence on foreign sources of fuel, produce green jobs, promote \nrenewable energy development, and improve the electric transmission \ngrid, while encouraging energy conservation and efficiency.\n  I am pleased that this resolution continues with green investments \nmade in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and provides \nincreases for the energy efficiency and renewable energy program. The \nresolution will enable investments in further research and development \nin clean and sustainable energy technologies from resources that are \nabundant in my State of Hawaii, such as wind, solar, ocean, hydrogen, \nand biomass.\n  The resolution invests in our Nation's future by fully funding the \nPresident's request for discretionary education and training programs. \nThis includes expanding early childhood education programs that have \nproven to be so instrumental in preparing our Nation's children for \nfuture success. The\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\nbudget also increases support for programs designed to reach out to \nlow-income students so that every child has an equal opportunity to \nsucceed. Similarly, by providing the necessary funding to support a \n$5,550 maximum Pell grant award in the 2010-2011 school year, this \nbudget resolution will provide much needed assistance to individuals \nstriving to achieve their higher education goals including adults \nreturning to school to revise and revamp their skills in order to more \neffectively compete in today's workforce.\n  I was also pleased to see that funding was included in the budget \nresolution to enhance and improve the capability of the Federal \nacquisition workforce. In my role as both chairman of the Subcommittee \non Oversight of Government Management and a senior member of the Armed \nServices Committee, I have long advocated for improvements in the \nhiring and retention of Federal employees. Similarly, I strongly \nsupport funding for the reform of Department of Defense processes for \nthe acquisition of weapons systems including the reduction of no-bid \nand cost-plus contracts.\n  As chairman of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee, I am pleased the \nresolution provides pay parity between Federal civilian and military \nservicemembers in the average annual pay raise, which is consistent \nwith more than 20 years of congressional precedent and my priorities.\n  Turning to items in the budget resolution for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, the resolution includes the President's request, plus \n$540 million to compensate for the ill-advised proposal that would have \nbilled veterans' insurance companies for service-connected care. \nPresident Obama made the right decision not to move forward with that \nproposal. Veterans' care and benefits are a cost of war and treatment \nfor conditions directly related to service is the responsibility of the \ngovernment alone.\n  The resolution also includes mandatory budget authority for important \nbenefits, such as compensation and pension, for veterans and their \nsurvivors. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the \nadministration to enact the funding increases and targeted programs to \nhelp VA adapt to the changing needs of veterans and their loved ones.\n  My colleagues, this resolution, with its targeted investments and \nchanged public-policy priorities, will help us address the essential \nneeds of the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the budget resolution for fiscal year \n2010.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I believe the document we are now \ndebating reflects two basic realities. First, it reflects the deep \ntroubles that we have inherited from years of lax regulation, excessive \nrisk, neglected oversight, even fraud and criminal behavior in our \nfinancial sector.\n  As President Obama said when he addressed the Joint Session of \nCongress, America's ``day of reckoning'' has arrived. The deficit \nspending of the past administration and the economic collapse that \nbegan last fall have created deep structural problems that this budget \ninherits.\n  Along with short-sighted budget policies that have put us deeper into \ndebt, the collapse of our financial sector has brought down virtually \nevery other sector of our economy. Those facts set the difficult \ncontext in which we do our work.\n  Delaware has not been spared from the waves of bad economic news that \nhave swept over our Nation. We have seen the job losses in our \nmanufacturing industries, layoffs in flagship companies like DuPont, \nand downsizing in our financial services industry.\n  Nationally, we just lost another three-quarters of a million jobs \nlast month. In Delaware, our statewide unemployment rate has hit 7.4 \npercent, a level we have not seen in a generation.\n  As families in Delaware and around the country sit at their kitchen \ntables, they know that the world outside has changed. For those who \nhave lost their jobs, for the husbands, the mothers, who have come home \nwith that heartbreaking news--the process of sorting out mortgage \npayments, health insurance, groceries--even school books and lunch \nmoney--has taken on a sad urgency.\n  For the others, whose neighbors are out of work, whose neighborhood \nnow has a foreclosure or two mixed in with the for sale signs, whose \nown jobs could be among the next to go--basic decisions about family \npriorities are growing tougher every day.\n  We must not forget those families as we do our work here on the \nFederal budget this week.\n  But this budget reflects another reality, as well. It reflects the \nfundamental strengths of our country--our faith in the future, our \nability to pull together, the strengths of our national character.\n  And this budget reflects the change in direction, the change in \npriorities and values, the American people voted for last November.\n  To help with family finances, this budget provides tax cuts to \nmiddle-class families.\n  To begin the work of making our health care system more affordable, \nthis budget makes health care more accessible for families and small \nbusinesses.\n  It makes a college education more accessible and more affordable, so \nour children can qualify for the jobs that will define our economic \nfuture.\n  This budget starts winding down our dependence on imported fossil \nfuels, by investments in clean and renewable energy we can provide \nright here--creating new processes, new products, and new jobs.\n  And it begins the process of restoring the balance to our Nation's \nfinances--a balance we had achieved just eight years ago--indeed, a \nbudget surplus that was squandered.\n  Just as the economic crisis has hit the paychecks of American \nworkers, it has lowered the economic activity that funds the revenues \nwe need to pay for our national priorities.\n  One key part of our response to this crisis must be to fill the hole \nleft in our economy by the loss of 5 million jobs, the loss of so much \neconomic activity. Our economic recovery package, passed earlier this \nyear, is a part of that response.\n  So a key function of this budget will be to continue to fill that gap \nin our economy, to continue to provide families, businesses, and state \nand local governments with the resources they need to slow, stop, and \nreverse the decline in our economy.\n  But if we are to move beyond the current crisis, we must make the \ninvestments that will reshape our future.\n  This budget is a clear statement of new priorities: it lays down a \nnew foundation for economic growth. These are the priorities, these are \nthe commitments President Obama and Vice President Biden campaigned on. \nThese are the priorities the American people voted for last November.\n  We must not lose sight of the lesson before us: under the previous \nadministration we gave free rein--and huge financial rewards--to short-\nterm risk-taking, to highly leveraged debt, to deals that many times \nwere not worth the paper they were written on.\n  We now know that tens of billions, or maybe more, of those paper \nprofits were created by criminal enterprises like the one run by Bernie \nMadoff. Others, while legal, tread on the very border of our outdated \nand poorly enforced rules and regulations.\n  At the same time, we failed to recognize and support average families \nin their struggles with rising health care costs, with the rising costs \nof a college education.\n  We wasted years when we could have invested in cleaner and more \nefficient domestic sources of energy, while our dependence on dirty, \ndangerous, uncertain sources of imported oil increased. Those wasted \nyears made our country more vulnerable to those who control oil \nreserves.\n  The American people have rejected those failed policies and misplaced \npriorities. This budget replaces them with an agenda for rebuilding our \neconomy and reasserting our values.\n  Budgets are statements of our priorities, here in Washington, at the \nkitchen tables of families in Delaware, in the homes of families around \nthe country.\n  No budget is perfect. All budgets reflect difficult choices. In this \neconomic crisis, our choices are more difficult, and our decisions \ncarry more importance.\n  I believe this budget reflects the best balance of addressing our \npresent crisis, building a foundation for the future, and putting our \nfinances on a sustainable path.\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for this budget resolution. It \nrightfully recognizes that our way through these difficult times is by \ninvesting in our future, with significant funding for infrastructure, \nenergy independence and programs that ensure the safety, health, and \neducation of our Nation's children. This budget resolution makes clear \nthat we cannot continue to cut taxes for a handful of wealthy \nindividuals, at the expense of the many and hope that someday the \nbenefits will trickle down. That course of action would lead to deeper \nand deeper deficits.\n  The prior administration's fiscal policies failed. They left us in \ndifficult and uncertain times. Unemployment in my state of Michigan and \nacross the country is sky high. The financial markets are in turmoil, \nand millions of hard-working Americans that still have jobs are not \nonly concerned about their depleted savings and retirement accounts, \nbut making their mortgage payments. And now, some of the greatest \ncompanies in our country are under great duress.\n  Our shared ability to navigate these troubled waters will depend upon \nour willingness to come together. Through this budget resolution, the \nSenate will set the blueprint for its work to help reverse the past \nadministration's failed fiscal policies that have been so damaging to \nour economy.\n  The Budget Committee includes in this resolution deficit-neutral \nreserve funds to promote economic recovery and growth, investments in \ninfrastructure, and a long overdue commitment to the health of \nAmericans. With adequate funds, we can modernize the health care system \nby continuing to progress towards health information technology. With \nadditional dollars to help support and strengthen the health care \nworkforce, we are making a firm statement that we will no longer shirk \nour responsibilities and will continue to fight for the 45.7 million \nuninsured individuals who have not had access to health care.\n  This budget will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. It allows \nus to improve our educational system. And it provides tax relief to \nmillions of middle-income Americans, including providing much-needed \nrelief from the alternative minimum tax. Congress, and our citizens, \nhave long known that this tax was never intended to hit middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I am also pleased that this budget paves the way for using our \ncommitted resources to restore our financial system, while providing \ncritical transparency and accountability for taxpayers. While I was \npleased to support the economic stimulus packages, they only provided a \npartial solution to fixing our economy's problems. We cannot stop now. \nAlthough we have already taken unprecedented efforts to stimulate and \nrevive our economy, there is more work ahead. While hard-working \nfamilies struggle to make ends meet, we owe it to them to continue to \ninvest in their futures.\n  I am pleased that this budget resolution includes my proposal to \nestablish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to promote American \nmanufacturing. Congress needs to take bold, decisive action to \nrevitalize our domestic manufacturing sector. The U.S. has lost more \nthan 4.1 million manufacturing jobs since January 2001 and over 300,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in Michigan since January 2001. It is important that \nwe revitalize and maintain a strong manufacturing base in the U.S. The \nmanufacturing industry faces pressure from international corporations \nthat are strongly supported by their respective governments; our own \ngovernment needs to lend similar support to keep American manufacturing \ncompanies competitive in the global marketplace.\n  The deficit-neutral reserve fund included in this budget lays the \ngroundwork for legislation to address important initiatives to boost \nAmerican manufacturing. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues to stimulate the manufacturing sector in a meaningful way, \nand make a wise investment in the long-term growth, health, and \nstability of the manufacturing industry.\n  The budget wisely includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \naccommodate legislation that would provide investments in clean energy \nand reduce greenhouse gas emissions, leaving the details of the \nlegislation to the appropriate committees of jurisdiction. The threat \nof climate change is real and its impacts could be catastrophic if we \ndo not act quickly. Clean energy and advanced technologies hold the \npromise for making real progress on reducing harmful greenhouse gases.\n  While swift action is needed to confront the daunting challenges of \nglobal climate change, I oppose misusing the budget reconciliation \nprocess in the consideration of climate legislation. That legislation \nwould influence every sector of the U.S. economy and could have far-\nreaching impacts across the globe. For this reason, I supported an \namendment offered by Senator Johanns that would prohibit the use of \nreconciliation for climate legislation. I voted in support of the \nJohanns amendment to reaffirm my opposition to an extremely truncated \nprocess for climate legislation, which would make a deliberative \napproach impossible. Taking action on climate change legislation to \nprotect public health, the economy, and natural security should be done \nin a thoughtful way and not rushed through Congress.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Dorgan in proposing an amendment to \nprovide an increase of $10 million for organ donation activities at the \nHealth Resources Services Administration. This modest amendment is \naimed at fulfilling the promise of the Organ Donation and Recovery \nImprovement Act of 2004, to increase the number of organ donations. \nCurrently, over 100,000 individuals are on the organ transplant waiting \nlist, and more than 83,000 of those are in need of a kidney transplant. \nOn average, patients wait 4 years before receiving a kidney transplant. \nMedicare spends about $55,000 per patient per year for dialysis. This \nmeans that every kidney donation has the potential to save Medicare as \nmuch as $220,000. Unfortunately, nearly 6,000 people die every year \nwhile waiting for a transplant. By doing more to educate people about \ndonation and developing programs to encourage donation, we can take \nsteps to reduce that number.\n  Mr. President, this budget will continue the job of getting our great \nNation back on track, and it deserves to pass.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to say a brief word so we know what \nwe are going to do when we get back on Monday, 2 weeks from Monday.\n  First of all, I express my appreciation to the whole Senate for the \noutstanding work done by the managers of this bill, Chairman Conrad, \nRanking Member Gregg. They did wonderful work. All the Senate speaks \nwith one voice in recognizing the tremendous difficulty of this \nresolution. The work was done with civility. We had difficult \namendments. This is a day the Senate should be proud.\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\n  I applaud and commend, I repeat, on behalf of the entire Senate, the \nbrilliant work done by these two fine gentlemen.\n  When we come back, I was hoping we would not have to have this vote \non Monday, but it appears we are going to have to. We have two wars \ngoing on. One, as we know, Afghanistan, and one we cannot put out of \nour mind in Iraq. One of the great career senior foreign service \nofficers whom we have had in recent years, Christopher R. Hill of Rhode \nIsland, has been nominated by the President to be Ambassador to Iraq.\n  It is hard to comprehend, but I am going to have to file cloture on \nthat tonight before we leave. I would hope everyone who is trying to \nhold up this man would give this some thought. How does this look? It \ndoes not look very good. But we are going to go ahead, and we are going \nto have this cloture vote on Monday. We have a lot of other things we \ncould work on. We have a lot to do. We have a 5-week work period when \nwe get back. I have already informed the Republican leader as to what \ndays we are not going to have votes; there are three of them.\n  I hope everyone has a good 2 weeks. We have a lot of time we need to \nspend at home. We have not been home. These have been very long \nperiods, two long work periods we have had since we have become a new \nCongress.\n  Of course, I have to say for all of us, it is very exiting to all of \nus to see the Presiding Officer.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to thank the \nmajority leader and Republican leader for their assistance in helping \nus move this bill in a reasonably expeditious way, considering it is \nthe budget.\n  I especially wish to thank the chairman and his staff, headed up by \nMary Naylor. They do an extraordinary job. They are extremely \nprofessional and very courteous to the minority. It is always an open \nand fair process when we take up the budget, and they set an excellent \nstandard.\n  I additionally wish to thank my staff, headed up by Cheri Reidy and \nJim Hearn, Allison Parent, and they do a fabulous job. I also wish to \nthank the folks up there on the dais because they stay here all day and \nmake sure we are in order and keeping things on the move and we thank \nthem very much for their time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member did such a wonderful job. I think we should all express \nour appreciation.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to thank all of our colleagues. \nThis is a tough, difficult day for all of us. I think the Senate has \nconducted itself well and distinguished itself today.\n  I wish to thank each of our colleagues for that. I especially wish to \nthank Leader Reid for his support throughout this process; Senator \nMurray, who I think has a special knack for convincing people not to \noffer amendments. Thank goodness for Senator Murray. To my colleague, \nSenator Gregg, you could not ask for a better partner. There is no one \nmore professional, more decent or somebody whose word is better than \nSenator Gregg. I deeply appreciate it, as well as his professional \nstaff, who have been terrific to work with.\n  On our side, Mary Naylor, my staff director; John Righter and Joel \nFriedman, my deputies; Joe Gaeta, Steve Bailey, Mike Jones, Jamie \nMorin, Stu Nagurka, Steve Posner, Sarah Kuehl, and all the others who \nhave contributed.\n  This has been a labor of love. They have worked night and day, \nweekends for months, and I deeply appreciate their sacrifice.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me briefly echo the remarks of the \nmajority leader and congratulate Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member \nGregg and say we have a lot of freshmen Senators. You probably think \nthis is a tough day. I might mention to you, this is one of the least \ntough budget days we have had in the time that I have been here. I \nthink I see the Vice President smiling. He would agree with that.\n  That is a tribute largely to Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad. Thank \nyou so much for an excellent job.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to make a plea, if I can publicly. \nThere is still time between now and tomorrow to try to do something \ndifferently on this question of sending our Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Senator Lugar is supportive. I am supportive. There is bipartisan \nsupport for this nominee. He is going to be approved. We all know that. \nIraq is experiencing increasing political difficulties, and the missing \ningredient of our capacity to get the success we want is political \nreconciliation.\n  Ambassador Crocker has not been well recently. He has put enormous \nenergy in this effort. Getting Christopher Hill there in the next 2 \nweeks can make a difference. I would urge our colleagues, if there are \nother issues linked to this, there are other ways to work it through.\n  My hope would be that we would be able to free him up. It is a \nterrible message to send, to tie him to issues of North Korea or \notherwise extraneous. It handicaps our capacity to maximize our efforts \nin a war.\n  If we are going to treat a war seriously, we ought to treat this \nAmbassador nomination seriously. I would ask my colleagues to think \nabout that while there is an opportunity to be able to approve it in \nthese next 24 hours.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I hate to throw a little cold water on \nthis whole ``Kumbaya'' party we are having, but I think it is an \nimportant precedent that we determine tonight.\n  I rise to make a parliamentary inquiry regarding the status of the \nbudget resolution: Specifically, I rise to inquire if the resolution \nremains a privileged measure, notwithstanding the adoption of 10 \ncorrosive points of order, 8 of which reach into the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee, 1 of which reaches into the Veterans' Committee, \nand 1 into the Judiciary Committee.\n  In the case of the Durbin amendment, No. 974, the point of order \nspecifies, with exacting detail, what level of taxpayer must receive a \ntax cut in order to allow death taxes to go forward.\n  Therefore, I put the question to the Chair: Does the pending budget \nresolution retain its privileged status despite these corrosive points \nof order having been adopted?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. It does.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Further parliamentary inquiry: Does that mean it would \nrequire 60 votes for passage?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. It does not require 60 votes for passage.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Further parliamentary inquiry: Is losing its privileged \nstatus at this point, does that mean it would be still fully debatable?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. It has not lost its privileged status.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. So that would be the precedent for the future, 8 to 10 \ncorrosive amendments does not lose its privileged status.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. This particular budget resolution has not lost \nits privileged status.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Chair.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, to briefly respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the chairman of the distinguished Foreign Relations \nCommittee has raised a serious issue about Ambassador Hill.\n  A number of us on our side have serious questions about Ambassador \nHill and how he conducted himself in the last assignment. I would like \nto see what some of those instructions were from that assignment.\n  I recognize the seriousness of the situation we are in in Iraq, no \nquestion about that. But I have serious reservations about his position \nin going to that. I think this will be a good period of time for us to \nget some of these questions answered from the State Department.\n  I have proffered a letter to them. I have some serious questions \nabout what took place during the negotiations with North Korea and a \npossible missile launch that will take place even in this interim, and \nthis was our lead negotiator there.\n  For those reasons, I, amongst others, am raising questions at this \ntime. I think they need to be answered before\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\nhe is approved for such an important spot for the United States.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the adoption of the concurrent \nresolution, as amended.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I had the intent, when we got to executive \nsession, of asking unanimous consent that Calendar item No. 47, Ashton \nCarter's nomination, be agreed to by unanimous consent. There is a hold \non this nomination. The two Senators who have that hold have indicated \nto me their reasons for it. One of those Senators--and I have talked to \nSenator Shelby; there is no objection to my identifying him this way--\nhas not had the opportunity that he seeks to talk to Mr. Carter. He has \nmade a commitment that he will do so as quickly as he possibly can \nafter the recess so we can hopefully get to this nomination very \npromptly. It is essential this be taken up.\n\n  So in light of the assurance I have received from Senator Shelby \nparticularly, and I have talked also to Senator Sessions about this \nmatter, I am not going to make that unanimous consent request tonight.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, in a few minutes there will be a unanimous \nconsent request on a voice vote for a nominee to the No. 2 position at \nHomeland Security--a very nice lady by the name of Ms. Lute.\n  I would make the point, as the second most senior member on Homeland \nSecurity on the minority side, I cast a ``no'' vote for this person in \ncommittee, and that is very well detailed in my statement.\n  But I think there are some important things the American people \nshould know about her previous service in terms of the peacekeeping \nforces under her direction as far as the procurement, management, and \nfollowup.\n  Here is what we know. Forty-three percent of all the money spent on \ninternational peacekeeping at the United Nations was either involved in \nfraud or kickback schemes and illegal contracting.\n  The other thing we know is that the international peacekeepers raped \nand abused hundreds and hundreds of people, for which at this time \ntoday the services under the direction of Ms. Lute have not been \ndirected toward or the care given for those individuals who suffered \nthose consequences.\n  The other thing we know is that the contracting associated with her \nadministration in the U.N. was associated with several no-bid contracts \nthat were inefficiently done and ineffectively carried out. It is on \nthat basis that I agreed not to hold up her nomination. She will go \nthrough, and she will be confirmed. But this nominee has to prove \nherself at the Department of Homeland Security. I am willing to be \nproven wrong, but the fact is, her reason for the problems she had at \nthe U.N. was the lack of cooperation at the U.N. She is going to be \nrunning a much larger budget with greater responsibilities, and if, in \nfact, that is the case, and it was all the U.N., then her limited \nexperience, we can hope, will grow, and she will be an effective \nAssistant Secretary.\n  There are other people much more qualified who could fill this \nposition. As I said, this is a very humble lady. She has served with \ngreat distinguished service in the Armed Services of this country. \nThere is no personal animosity nor direction toward her individually. \nBut the fact is, one of our most difficult agencies is the Department \nof Homeland Security. It has big problems, conflicts, lack of \ntransparency, and inefficiency.\n  It is my hope that after she is confirmed, she will, in fact, be up \nto the task, and we, both in the Senate and as American taxpayers, will \nget real value out of her service.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4293-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4293-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship unanimously reported the President's \nnomination of Karen Gordon Mills to serve as Administrator for the \nSmall Business Administration. I would like to thank my ranking member, \nSenator Snowe, who recommended Ms. Mills for this post and her staff \nfor their work on this nomination.\n  I am pleased that President Obama nominated Karen Mills. I believe \nshe has the right mix of experience and education and a willingness to \nserve that will benefit her in this challenging position. As our new \nSBA Administrator, Ms. Mills will be an extraordinary role model for \nentrepreneurs across America--particularly for women entrepreneurs.\n  Ms. Mills graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a degree in \neconomics. She then stayed at Harvard to earn her MBA. She started out \nworking as a product manager for General Mills and then segued into \nwhat was to become her true passion--growing new businesses. Ms. Mills \nis a founding partner and was managing director of Solera Capital, a \nNY-based venture capital firm run largely by women. She currently \nserves as President at MMP Group, Inc., a private equity investment and \nadvising firm.\n  Ms. Mills has balanced her role in private, for-profit enterprises \nwith active involvement in her community. This has been demonstrated in \nthe work she has done in Maine, serving on the boards of many \nnonprofits that work to promote economic development. It also shows in \nthe work that she has done for organizations like the Council on \nForeign Relations.\n  From my meetings with Ms. Mills, it is clear that we share many of \nthe same priorities--for example, assisting women and minority \nentrepreneurs and making sure small businesses can access credit in \nthese trying economic times.\n  The SBA is an agency at a crossroads. Under the previous \nadministration, the agency's funding was slashed by 28 percent--the \nbiggest cut of any Federal agency. In my view, the agency was relegated \nto the back benches during important policy debates on health care, \ntrade and technology innovation, to name a few.\n  We need strong, capable leadership to return this agency to its \nrightful place as a Federal advocate for small business interests. In \nMs. Mills, I am confident that we have it.\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4296-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4296-S4301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF JANE HOLL LUTE TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HOMELAND \n                                SECURITY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to Calendar No. 57, the nomination of Jane Holl Lute.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Jane Holl \nLute, of New York, to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my unqualified \nendorsement of Jane Holl Lute to be Deputy Secretary for the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Mrs. Lute has impressive educational credentials--including a Ph.D. \nfrom Stanford, a J.D. from Georgetown, and 3 years as a professor at \nWest Point--an outstanding professional history, and broad national \nsecurity and management experience, all of which is more than ample \npreparation for the position to which she has been nominated.\n  She had a distinguished career in the military, served as the \nEuropean specialist at the National Security Council during the first \nBush and Clinton administrations, and for the past several years has \nworked in various positions with United Nations Peacekeeping \nOperations.\n  Mrs. Lute joined the Army right out of college and spent the next 16 \nyears serving in a variety of capacities, including as an action \nofficer in Operation Desert Storm, U.S. Army Central Command, Riyadh; \nas company commander, U.S. Signal Command, a brigade signal officer; \nand as director for european affairs on the National Security Council \nfor President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton. Her military \nexperience with signals intelligence and on the National Security \nCouncil has helped prepare her for the intelligence and \ncounterterrorism missions of DHS.\n  Since 2003, she has served in a variety of senior leadership \npositions with the U.N., including as the Assistant Secretary-General \nof Peacekeeping Operations, and most recently as the Assistant \nSecretary General for Peacekeeping Support in the Executive Office of \nthe Secretary-General of the U.N.\n  As Assistant Secretary-General, Mrs. Lute has managed a very large \nand complex Peacekeeping workforce, with responsibility for hundreds of \nthousands of military and civilian personnel in over 30 countries, \nincluding hotspots such as Kosovo, the Congo, and Darfur, to name just \na few. This was no small accomplishment. Her leadership helped to \nensure the security and welfare of people around the globe living in \nunaccommodating and hostile circumstances.\n  She also managed multibillion-dollar budgets and welcomed oversight \nand constructive criticism of her department, in an organization that \nmany have described as ``openly hostile'' to such transparency.\n  At the U.N., she managed support operations for the second largest \ndeployed military force in the world, and oversaw a multibillion \nbudget, which grew from $2 billion to nearly $8 billion annually. She \nundertook a variety of initiatives to improve the management and \nfinancial accountability of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, \nwhich included instituting a requirements review panel for acquisitions \nand a mission startup monitoring process.\n  When she noticed that the U.N. was short on the procurement personnel \nwith the language skills and expertise needed for the complex \ntransactions they would work on, she helped institute a program to \nidentify, recruit, and train additional staff.\n  She also instituted advanced training programs for senior \nadministrative and management personnel, in response to deficiencies \nshe observed.\n  I am particularly impressed by Mrs. Lute's leadership and management \nexperience in a career dedicated to public service. In her testimony \nbefore the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last \nweek, it was apparent that her experiences have helped her develop into \nthe leader she is today: One who recognizes that, in her own words, \n``people are the most important resource any . . . organization has.''\n  It is a testimony to Mrs. Lute and her work that the committee has \nreceived numerous letters supporting her nomination. Letters have come \nfrom the International Association of Emergency Managers, the National \nEmergency Managers Association, the International Association of Fire \nChiefs, the Major Cities Chiefs, the National Sheriffs' Association, \nLee Baca, the Sheriff of L.A. County, Lee Hamilton, former congressman \nand current President and Director, Woodrow Wilson International Center \nfor Scholars, HRH Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein, Jordan's Ambassador to \nthe U.S., and many others.\n  Managing the Department of Homeland Security is no small task, \ndemanding a smart and steady hand. The Deputy Secretary post carries \nwith it diverse responsibilities that range from overseeing \npreparations to respond to a nuclear terrorist attack to ensuring that \nDHS employees have adequate office space.\n  DHS has at times struggled to gain solid footing over the course of \nits six-year lifespan. Each year it becomes stronger, I am happy to \nnote. And I don't think there is any question that the country is safer \nas a result of the Department's efforts.\n  But the Department has a difficult and varied mission and its work is \ncentral to the security of all Americans. So we must continue to press \nforward to improve upon its capabilities.\n  To that end, I am working to draft the Senate's first authorization \nbill for the Department as a means of laying out what I believe should \nbe its priorities and to make the Department more efficient and \neffective in its missions. Needless to say, we will be seeking input \nfrom the administration.\n  One of the biggest problems the Department faces is its management of \nacquisitions. Some of the Department's largest and most troubled \nacquisition programs--Deepwater, SBINet, radiation detection portal \nmonitors--need stronger oversight and more decisive leadership than \nthey have gotten in the past.\n  Furthermore, the Department's heavy reliance on contractors to \nperform basic services raises serious questions about whether DHS is \nbuilding sufficient internal capacity and institutional knowledge. \nRight now, DHS still has insufficient capacity to develop requirements \nand evaluate the technical feasibility of contractors' proposals.\n  In recent years the United States has seen serious threats to our \ncyber networks and we have not yet developed the tools to detect and \ndefend against these threats. Due to the vulnerabilities that still \nexist, we have experienced massive identity theft, monetary loss, and \nleaks of sensitive information. Moreover, if these vulnerabilities are \never fully exploited, there is the potential to do significant damage \nto our Nation's critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity has the important responsibility of leading Federal efforts to \nprotect domestic cyber networks, both public and private. The \nDepartment has made some progress in developing its capabilities in \nthis area, but much more work remains to be done. I look forward to \nworking with Mrs. Lute to bolster the nation's cyber security.\n  Clearly, our southern border security has also become a central focus \nfor the Department and the Obama administration. Senator Collins and I \nsuccessfully amended the budget resolution this week to add $550 \nmillion for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to help \nstem the flow of drugs and people moving north into the U.S. and guns \nand money moving south into Mexico. I look forward to a close \ncollaboration with the Department in this area.\n  The Department faces many other challenges that must be met and \nconquered if it is to succeed in its ultimate mission of protecting the \nnation from terrorism and natural disasters. This committee has always \nworked cooperatively with the Department and will continue to do so to \nensure its success.\n  If confirmed, Mrs. Lute will play a large part in setting the \nDepartment on course to overcome these challenges. I want to thank her \nfor her many years of service and say that I believe she is \nexceptionally qualified to take on DHS' challenges. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support her confirmation.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Jane Holl Lute has been nominated to \nbecome the Deputy Secretary for Management at the Department of \nHomeland Security, (DHS). If confirmed, she would be responsible for \nthe following at DHS: budget, appropriations, expenditure of funds, \naccounting and finance; procurement; human resources and personnel; \ninformation technology systems; facilities, property, equipment, and \nother material resources; and performance measurements tracking.\n  After reviewing the parts of her U.N. record that had to be leaked \nfor any of us to know about it, it is clear that Ms. Lute is either not \nqualified or not experienced to manage the DHS. When pressed to explain \nthe mismanagement, fraud, and corruption that took place under her \nwatch at U.N. Peacekeeping Operations, Ms. Lute consistently diverted \nblame to other U.N. officials or departments--making it appear she \nreally didn't manage much of the U.N. If accurate, she is not \nexperienced. When pressed to explain how she is experienced enough to \nmanage DHS, Ms. Lute then claims she was at the center of Peacekeeping \nOperations, managed the internal operations--making it appear that she \nwas responsible for everything. If accurate, this means she is also \nresponsible for the mismanagement and waste. Ms. Lute cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  An overall assessment of Peacekeeping Operations is that they are \nsaturated in fraud and abuse.\n  In 2007 and 2008, the U.N. Procurement Task Force, a branch of the \nU.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services, OIOS, issued several \nreports that had to be leaked in order for anyone outside the U.N. to \nknow about them.\n  The reports were based on investigations related to U.N. peacekeeping \nmanagement and procurement that uncovered a significant amount of \ncorruption, fraud, waste, overpayments, abuse, negligence and \nmismanagement in a number of high value contracts. This reflects a lack \nof an internal control system within U.N. Peacekeeping procurement \nunder Ms. Lute's management.\\1\\\n  The findings of the U.N. audit reports are alarming.\n  For example, the reports found 43 percent of mostly U.N. peacekeeping \nprocurement tainted by fraud. Out of $1.4 billion in U.N. contracts \ninternally investigated, $610 million was tainted by 10 ``significant \nfraud and corruption schemes.'' \\2\\ Since 43 percent of the procurement \ncontracts are tainted and the U.S. taxpayer contributes up to 26 \npercent of all U.N. funding, it is safe to say the entire U.S. \ncontribution in this case was tainted by corruption an waste.\n  ``Total disregard for controls'' is how the task force described \nsenior U.N. officials involved in peacekeeping procurement fraud.\\3\\ In \nan environment of no controls, Ms. Lute's Peacekeeping Operations \nsuffered from numerous problems that greatly increased the cost of \noperations or lost resources altogether.\n  Specific examples listed in the report include criminal acts such as \nbribery and kickback schemes, overpayments to vendors, lack of \ncompetitive bidding, lack of acquisition plans, lack of qualified \nprocurement staff, splitting single contracts apart to avoid reporting \nrequirements, transactions with no contract in place, unauthorized \ncontracts issued, use of uneconomical contractors, unnecessary \nexpenditures, and dysfunctional asset and property management.\n  The task force found that significant Peacekeeping missions lacked \n``indicators of achievement and performance measures'' for the \npolitical and civilian affairs components of operations. Specifically, \nroles and responsibilities were not formally established, and there \nwere no defined reporting lines and accountability.\\4\\\n  The task force reports that a major roadblock to its investigation is \ndue to ``limited cooperation'' from U.N. staff and vendors due to the \nlack of a compulsory process for obtaining documents and testimony.\\5\\\n  Even after the task force exposed Peacekeeping mismanagement, \npeacekeeping and procurement management were not ``consistent in \napplying the standards to which they are supposed to hold staff \naccountable.'' \\6\\\n  For each of its audits and investigations, the task force made \nrecommendations to Ms. Lute and her U.N. Peacekeeping team on how to \naddress the serious fraud and mismanagement issues. A number of \ncritical recommendations were not accepted.\\7\\\n  Regarding Peacekeeping procurement, Ms. Lute tries to have it both \nways by diverting blame but also claiming she still has procurement \nexperience.\n  When asked at her nomination hearing about the procurement corruption \nunder her watch, Ms. Lute claimed that the corruption and mismanagement \nwas not her fault but the fault of procurement staff in the field.\n  Since she indicated at the hearing that she had little or no \nresponsibility for the Peacekeeping procurement, Ms. Lute was asked in \nher questions for the record what other procurement experience she had \nthat would qualify her for managing procurement at DHS. Her written \nresponse reveals that Ms. Lute was much more responsible for \nPeacekeeping procurement than she admitted at the hearing. She wrote in \nher response that she had ``responsibility for oversight of personnel \nresponsible for directly engaging and supervising the provision of \ncontract services.''\n  Another indication that Ms. Lute has a much larger role and influence \non Peacekeeping procurement than she admitted at her hearing is how she \npushed through a no-bid contract for her mission to Darfur in 2007. In \n2007, Lute personally steered a $250 million no-bid contract for U.N. \npeacekeeping in Darfur to a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin.\n  At the time, the Officer-in-Charge of the U.N. Department of \nManagement where much of the U.N.'s procurement took place sent Ms. \nLute a memo responding to her charges that Peacekeeping procurement \nproblems was the fault of the U.N. Department of Management.\n  While the Department of Management has many faults and has an equally \ntarnished record within the U.N., the comments in the memo are telling \nin that they reinforce the findings of several OIOS and Procurement \nTask Force reports.\n  According to the memo, Ms. Lute failed to plan for the Darfur \npeacekeeping mission which led to sole source contracting despite \nhaving 18 months to prepare. The memo also indicates Ms. Lute failed \nthe preparedness test by not having a logistics concept in place to \nembark on a logistics delivery capability at short notice that will \nalso meet U.N. procurement rules. Finally, the memo states that the \ndelays in startup of the mission were due to Ms. Lute constantly \nchanging mission requirements. According to the memo, these delays \n``constitute a pattern, to which oversight bodies of the U.N. may be \nless charitable towards and may well find the pattern as troubling.''\n  In a 2008 OIOIS Procurement Task Force report, U.N. auditors \nexpressed concerns that based on prior audits and investigations that \nPeacekeeping Operations will face a ``higher-risk exposure to \nmismanagement, fraud and corruption'' as a result of the no-bid \ncontract requested by Ms. Lute.\\8\\\n  It is also important to point out that almost the entire U.N. shares \nconcerns about what Ms. Lute did with this contract. In 2007, the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly voted 142 to 1, sadly with only the United States \ndissenting, to express concern about the no-bid contract \\9\\\n  Even though Ms. Lute claimed at her hearing that she had little \nresponsibility in contracting decisions or oversight, she clearly had \nenough influence on the process to pressure her U.N. colleagues to \naccept a no-bid contract. Why would she then be unable to use this same \ninfluence to press for controls, transparency, and accountability in \norder to protect her Peacekeeping Operations from being undermined by \ncost overruns, waste, and illicit behavior?\n  If the assessment from the U.N. official in the Management Department \nis correct, Ms. Lute failed the preparedness test when it came to rapid \ndeployment of resources and personnel to respond to new crises. \nPreparedness is what she was responsible for at U.N. Peacekeeping, and \nit will be what she is responsible for at DHS.\n  Another indication that Ms. Lute had more responsibility for \nPeacekeeping procurement than what she admitted to at her hearing was \nthat she publicly defended the Peacekeeping procurement fraud when it \nwas made public in\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nthe media. In 2007, the Washington Post published its report on the \nPeacekeeping procurement fraud after the U.N. audits were leaked. Ms. \nLute chose to respond on behalf of U.N. Peacekeeping. In her op-ed, she \nmakes excuses for the fraud, claims there is no pattern of abuse in \npeacekeeping procurement, and misrepresented the Washington Post \narticle in order to discredit it. She claims the article was misleading \nwhen it said that peacekeeping ``suffered losses in the hundreds of \nmillions.'' In reality, the article quoted directly from the U.N. \naudits saying correctly that U.N. auditors found multiple instances of \nfraud that tainted $610 million worth of contracts.\\10\\\n\n  If Ms. Lute was truly not responsible for the massive amount of \nprocurement fraud, it is odd that she would then choose to represent \npeacekeeping procurement and rebut this article. Even if she had no \nresponsibility for the mismanagement and fraud, it would have been much \nmore productive if Ms. Lute chose instead to use this opportunity in \nher op-ed to make the case for reforming Peacekeeping operations and \nprocurement, offer suggestions for cutting waste, and laying out a \nbetter preparedness plan and logistics concept. Unfortunately, we have \nno record of Ms. Lute speaking out about the problems that were \nundermining U.N. Peacekeeping or offering reform ideas whether at a \npress conference or in a report to the U.N. Security Council.\n  The Procurement Task Force released a report in July of 2007 \nregarding its investigation of ground fuel procurement in the U.N. \npeacekeeping mission to Haiti, MINUSTAH.\\11\\ The conclusion of the \nreport indicated the ground fuel procurement process was not conducted \nin a fair and transparent manner resulting in bid rigging and the \nawarding of the contract to a company initially ranked as ``non-\ncompliant.'' U.N. staff from both Procurement and Peacekeeping \nDepartments was responsible. This report made several findings that \nreflect on Ms. Lute's performance as manager of resources and field \ndeployment.\n  For example, it reports that Ms. Lute failed to staff MINUSTAH with \nexperienced fuel staff that could evaluate the technical and commercial \naspects of the fuel contracting.\\12\\\n  It also illustrates that Ms. Lute failed to act on the continual \nsupply chain inconsistencies. The report shows that Peacekeeping staff \nreported problems including the discrepancy between how much fuel was \npurchased and what was actually delivered, the contractor's use of \nsubstandard fuel tankers, and other problems. Even after the problem \nhad been flagged, the contract was never pulled and reassigned.\\13\\\n  Making the U.N.'s risk exposure even worse, under Ms. Lute's watch, \nMINUSTAH received its fuel supply with an expired contract. The initial \nfuel contract expired, and while the long-term contract was being \nprepared, the poor-performing contractor continued to supply fuel to \nthe mission without a written contract.\\14\\\n  Ms. Lute failed to step in when poor-performing contractor was given \nlong-term contract despite repeated reports of inconsistent fuel supply \nand poor performance measurements.\\15\\ Bid rigging by U.N. Peacekeeping \nand Procurement staff was again to blame.\\16\\\n  Since this took place towards the end of her time managing U.N. \nPeacekeeping, it is telling that, even after five years managing \nPeacekeeping Operations, Ms. Lute failed to have the proper controls in \nplace that would prevent this from occurring or from being overlooked \nso many times.\n  Another U.N. audit report written towards the end of Ms. Lute's time \nmanaging Peacekeeping revealed another mission she deployed without \nproper controls in place. The Procurement Task Force released an audit \nin May of 2007 regarding its assessment of procurement fraud indicators \nin the mission to Liberia, UMIL.\\17\\ The audit was designed to test \nwhether UNMIL had the proper controls in place to protect against fraud \nand corruption.\n  Regarding UNMIL's requisitioning office, which is under Ms. Lute's \nmanagement, the audit found that Ms. Lute failed to initiate good \nbusiness practice and internal control principles by not limiting the \nnumber of persons that can raise requisitions.\\18\\ It also found that \nMs. Lute failed to staff the requisition office with qualified staff \nthat could ensure specifications on the requisition are accurate. This \ncould lead to inefficient procurement, wasteful purchases, and loss of \nfunds.\\19\\\n  Ms. Lute's record responding to Peacekeeper rape and sexual \nexploitation of women and children is also troubling.\n  For years, U.N. watchdogs, human rights groups, and now U.N. auditors \nhave been documenting hundreds of allegations and confirmed instances \nof sexual crimes against women and small children under U.N. \npeacekeeping care and protection. The perpetrators include both \nmilitary and civilian Peacekeeping personnel. Allegations of misconduct \nhave been made in every major Peacekeeping operation including the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Bosnia, Burundi, Cambodia, Guinea, Haiti, \nIvory Coast, Kosovo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the Sudan.\\20\\\n  Ms. Lute was responsible for the U.N. response to and prevention of \nthe rape and sexual exploitation. Despite claiming a ``zero tolerance'' \npolicy and having systems in place to help prevent this abuse, Ms. \nLute's record suggests otherwise with abuse continuing to plague \npeacekeeping operations and no known prosecution and imprisonment of a \nsingle perpetrator.\n  In 2004, reports first began emerging of the rampant sexual \nexploitation of children at the Republic of Congo, DRC, peacekeeping \nmission. According to press reports, in June 2004, U.N. Peacekeeping \nmanagers were informed by the head of the DRC Mission that there were \ninitially 50 allegations of sexual abuse, 42 involving minors, but \ntotal allegations rose to 72 in a followup report.\\21\\ The report \ndetailed acts such as the rape of a minor in a U.N. armored personnel \ncarrier and a prostitution network of minors at the U.N. airport.\n  The media reports indicate that the investigation done by Ms. Lute \nand the other managers of U.N. Peacekeeping Operations was fatally \nflawed. There was no witness protection offered to the victims which \nled to witnesses being bribed or threatened to change their testimony. \nInvestigators were reportedly ordered to only investigate claims in one \ntown while ignoring the numerous claims made throughout the DRC.\n  It is also reported that a high-ranking Peacekeeping official for the \nU.N. Mission to the DRC was sexually exploiting minors as young as 13, \nand eventually 150 cases were brought against Peacekeeping soldiers and \ncivilians ranging from abduction and rape of minors to the finding of \nmore than 250 images of child pornography involving Congolese children \non the laptop of a U.N. official.\n  The OIOS documented in January, 2005 at least 7 cases of underage \nsexual abuse committed by U.N. peacekeepers, and all but one of them \nwere fully substantiated.\n  There were also press reports of abuses in the Sudan during this same \ntime period. According to The Daily Telegraph, in 2005, U.N. officials \nknew of the sexual abuse of children as young as 12 that began in 2005 \nsoon after the U.N. Peacekeeping mission in Southern Sudan, UNMIS, went \nto work to rebuild the region.\\22\\ A leaked internal report compiled by \nthe U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, in July 2005 referred to the sexual \nexploitation perpetrated by U.N. peacekeepers, military policy, and \ncivilian staff. According to the paper, this report was substantiated \nby a preliminary report from a leading U.N. affiliated NGO that was \nunwilling to be named for political reasons.\n  Allegedly hundreds of children have been abused, and the Telegraph \nhas independently documented at least 20 victims claiming U.N. \npeacekeepers and civilian staff regularly picked up young children in \nU.N. vehicles and raped them.\n  As Under Secretary General for Field Support, Ms. Lute was \nresponsible for responding to this issue and implementing policies to \nprevent this abuse and bring the perpetrators to justice. Sadly, even \nafter implementing weak reforms--such as what amounts to sexual \nharassment training for peacekeepers--the abuse continued and there are \nno known prosecutions or imprisonments for the perpetrators.\n  In 2006, U.N. investigators at the OIOS substantiated reports that \nU.N. peacekeepers in Liberia had sexually\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\nabused an under-age girl and U.N. peacekeepers in the Sudan had \nsexually abused four women.\\23\\ In 2008, the NGO Save the Children \nreported that peacekeepers were sexually abusing very young children in \nwar zones and disaster areas in the Ivory Coast, southern Sudan, and \nHaiti-- and going largely unpunished.\\24\\ Save the Children reports, \n``Children as young as six are trading sex with aid workers and \npeacekeepers in exchange for food, money, soap and, in very few cases, \nluxury items such as mobile phones.''\n\n  According to Marianne Mollman of Human Rights Watch, the current \nstatus of the U.N. response to peacekeeping abuses continues to be \npoor.\\25\\ Mollman describes investigations of the abuse carried out by \nMs. Lute as follows: lack of speed of investigations, lack of \ntransparency and follow through of investigations, and lack of breadth \nof investigations.\n  There are other instances of illicit behavior going largely \nunpunished during Ms. Lute's tenure at Peacekeeping. In 2008, Human \nRights Watch issued a letter regarding several cases where Peacekeepers \nwere involved in other illicit activities such as gold-smuggling and \nweapons trading. In these cases, like the sexual abuse case, Human \nRights Watch reports that ``the slow process in carrying out this \ninvestigation and the continued lack of action raises important \nquestions on how the U.N. investigates itself.'' \\26\\\n  When I questioned Ms. Lute about the number of victims she provided \nassistance to, the budget of her victims' assistance program, the \nnumber of perpetrators she successfully had prosecuted, and other basic \ninformation, she responded saying she knows of no reports that track \nthis information. This is a disturbing answer from someone claiming to \neffectively deploy victims' assistance into the field while reports on \nthe ground claim there are many victims that have been waiting for over \n4 years but still have not received assistance from Ms. Lute. This \ncertainly does not sound like a policy of ``zero tolerance.''\n  In her response, Ms. Lute also points out that she coordinated \nmeetings and discussions and conferences at the U.N. regarding \nPeacekeeping abuse and victims' assistance. But she cannot produce any \nevidence or information illustrating she carried out the victims' \nassistance programs or whether any such programs were effective.\n  In my questions for the Record, in order to ascertain whether or not \nMs. Lute has the qualifications to manage DHS, I asked Ms. Lute whether \nshe had experience managing DHS issues and activities such as border \nsecurity, immigration, port security, counterterrorism, or other DHS-\nspecific portfolios. In her written response, Ms. Lute claims she had \n``responsibilities for border security and management where stopping \nthe flow of illegal arms and narcotics is a central part of the \nMission's mandate.''\n  It is important to point out that we have no evidence or data that \nsuggests Ms. Lute has been successful in this endeavor. Using the \nPeacekeeping Mission to Lebanon as an example, this one mission alone \nillustrates Ms. Lute's poor performance at stopping the flow of illegal \narms as Hezbollah has, on multiple occasions, successfully armed and \nrearmed on the Israeli border. There are also multiple reports of \nillegal arms smuggling involving Peacekeepers in Africa supplying arms \nto local militias.\\27\\\n  Ms. Lute also pointed out that she operated a port in the Congo along \na river. When I questioned her at the hearing regarding her \nresponsibility for the abuse that took place in the Congo on her watch, \nshe claimed that she had little ``on the ground'' management \nresponsibilities. Her story changes when asked to provide her \nexperience and qualifications to manage DHS.\n  In her response to my prehearing questions, Ms. Lute indicated that \nshe utilized several performance indicators to determine whether or not \nher programs were effective. I then asked Ms. Lute whether there is any \nrecord of these performance measures or any reports that audit her \noperations based on these indicators. Ms. Lute responded that she \n``cannot recall specifically which report or which measure'' were \ntracking her performance. In other words, it appears Ms. Lute has not \nreceived specific performance reports and lacks a working knowledge of \nhow she performed according to those standards. I believe it is \nimpossible to manage what you do not measure.\n  Unfortunately for Ms. Lute, the entire U.N. system, including \nPeacekeeping Operations, lacks even the most basic transparency or \naccountability. Without transparency, we cannot discover whether or not \nthere is evidence that Ms. Lute, during her tenure at U.N. \nPeacekeeping, was able to turn her operations around, institute \ncontrols, make policy reforms, and whether these efforts were \nsuccessful.\n  Every U.N. report that we were able to receive after they were first \nleaked indicates that operations under Ms. Lute's management were \nundermined by fraud, waste, corruption, and mismanagement. We have no \npositive record of Ms. Lute's performance measurements. Several former \nU.N. officials have written letters of endorsement for Ms. Lute, but \nthe endorsements were based on Ms. Lute's verbal commitment to address \nthe waste and fraud, and none of these officials actually investigated \nwhat Ms. Lute did in response or whether her response was effective.\n  I believe that Ms. Lute is unqualified and inexperienced to manage \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Given her record that we are able \nto document, I cannot in good conscience support her nomination.\n\n\n                                ENDNOTES\n\n       \\1\\ Report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services \n     Part two: peacekeeping operations,'' U.N.

The question is, Shall the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Jane\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nHoll Lute to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate was poised today to confirm \nthree more superbly qualified nominees to fill top leadership positions \nat the Department of Justice before adjourning for the 2-week April \nrecess. Instead, the Republican minority has returned to the tactics of \nanonymous and unaccountable holds they employed when they were in the \nmajority to block scores of President Clinton's nominees.\n  Attorney General Holder needs his leadership team in place to rebuild \nand restore the Department. Tony West, President Obama's nominee to \nlead the Civil Division, Lanny Breuer, nominated to head the Criminal \nDivision, and Christine Varney, nominated to head the Antitrust \nDivision, have all chosen to leave lucrative private practices to \nreturn to Government service.\n  None of these are controversial nominees. They all received numerous \nletters of strong support, and endorsements from both Republican and \nDemocratic former public officials. They were all reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee last week by unanimous consent. We should be \nconfirming them today, not holding them hostage to the tired partisan \nplaybook of Senate Republicans.\n  Tony West knows the Department of Justice well. He served in the \nDepartment as a Special Assistant to Deputy Attorneys General Philip \nHeymann and Jamie Gorelick. He then worked as a Federal prosecutor in \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. His \ncommitment to public service continued when he became a Special \nAssistant Attorney General in the California Department of Justice. He \nhas also worked in private practice. Mr. West is a graduate of Harvard \nUniversity and Stanford University Law School, where he served as \npresident of the Stanford Law Review.\n  His nomination has earned support from both sides of the aisle. The \nformer chairman of the California Republican Party, George Sundheim, \nsent a letter to the committee stating that Mr. West is admired by \n``both sides of the aisle'' for his ``integrity, honesty and decency,'' \nand that there is no one ``more qualified to assume a position of \nleadership in the Department of Justice.'' The Federal prosecutors who \nworked across the table from Mr. West during the high-profile \nprosecution of John Walker Lindh witnessed Mr. West's ``extraordinary \nprofessionalism,'' and ``smart advocacy . . . executed with the highest \ndegree of integrity.'' We should be confirming this outstanding leader \nfor the Civil Division today.\n  President Obama has said that Lanny Breuer has the ``depth of \nexperience and integrity'' to fulfill the highest standards of the \nAmerican people and the Department of Justice. I agree. Mr. Breuer \nbegan his legal career as an assistant district attorney in the \nManhattan District Attorney's Office. He told us during his hearing \nthat his commitment to ensuring justice for all Americans stemmed from \nhis days working on the front lines of the fight against crime as a \nManhattan prosecutor. His call to public service continued while \nserving in the White House Counsel's Office as a special counsel to \nPresident Clinton. Mr. Breuer has also worked in private practice for \nthe prestigious Washington, DC, law firm of Covington & Burling. He is \na graduate of Columbia Law School and Columbia University.\n  Michael Chertoff, who led the Criminal Division at the Department of \nJustice during the Bush administration, endorsed Mr. Breuer's \nnomination, saying he has ``exceptionally broad legal experience as a \nformer prosecutor and defense attorney'' and has ``outstanding \njudgment, a keen sense of fairness, high integrity and an even \ntemperament.'' Brad Berenson, a veteran of the Bush administration's \nWhite House counsel's office, writes that Mr. Breuer is ``everything \none could hope for in a leader of the Criminal Division.''\n  Mr. Breuer's former colleagues from the Manhattan District Attorney's \nOffice have said that as a criminal prosecutor, he ``distinguished \nhimself as a tenacious but scrupulously fair trial lawyer, driven by \nthe unwavering goal of achieving justice.'' Former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Larry D. Thompson and former Congressman and DEA Administrator \nAsa Hutchinson have also written to the committee in support of Mr. \nBreuer's nomination. I agree with all their comments and wish the \nRepublican minority was not stalling confirmation of Mr. Breuer's \nnomination.\n  Christine Varney was confirmed to be a U.S. Federal Trade \nCommissioner in 1994, after being nominated by President Clinton. As a \nFederal Trade Commissioner, Ms. Varney gained valuable experience in \nantitrust enforcement and in reducing anticompetitive measures that \nharm American consumers. Her Government service work includes a high \nlevel position in President Clinton's White House, where she served as \nan assistant to the President and secretary to the Cabinet. She has \nworked in private practice for the prestigious Washington, DC, law firm \nof Hogan & Hartson. She also graduated from my alma mater, the \nGeorgetown University Law Center.\n  Her nomination is supported by individuals who served in the \nAntitrust Division during both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. John Shenefield and James Rill, both former heads of \nthe Antitrust Division, say that she is ``extraordinarily well \nqualified to lead the Antitrust Division.'' Twenty former chairs of the \nAmerican Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law have described Ms. \nVarney as a ``highly accomplished, capable nominee who will serve \nconsumers and this country with distinction'' and who will have \n``immediate credibility'' in her new position.\n  I agree. At a time when our economy is suffering, there is a \ntemptation to act anticompetitively. We need to make sure that we have \na strong and effective advocate for competition and the interests of \nconsumers in place. Now is not the time for delay.\n  Republican Senators delayed for weeks the confirmation of Harvard Law \nSchool Dean Elena Kagan to be the Solicitor General of the United \nStates, before demanding an extended debate on her nomination. They \nhave yet to consent to a time agreement on the nomination of Dawn \nJohnsen to lead the critical Office of Legal Counsel. And they are now \nholding up three nominations today, including the nomination of \nChristine Varney to head the Antitrust Division. I am concerned that \nRepublican delay tactics are creating a double standard for these \nhighly qualified women. Republicans did not apply the same standards or \nmake the same demands for extensive followup information and meetings \nwhen supporting President Bush's nominations to the same posts.\n  Indeed, The New York Times and Roll Call yesterday each featured \nreports suggesting that Senate Republicans intend to, and are planning \nto, filibuster the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to serve as the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice \nDepartment. I cannot remember a time when Democratic Senators \nfilibustered a Justice Department nomination. Speech after speech by \nRepublican Senators just a few short years ago about how it would be \nunconstitutional to filibuster Presidential nominees appear now to be \njust speeches that served a partisan political purpose at the time.\n  During last week's formal installation of the Attorney General, \nPresident Obama reminded Americans and the world that what makes our \ncountry unique is that ``we are bound together not by a shared \nbloodline or allegiance to any one leader or faith or creed, but by an \nadherence to a set of ideals.'' The men and women at the Department of \nJustice have a special duty to uphold the rule of law because ``laws \nare only as effective, only as compassionate, [and] only as fair as \nthose who enforce them.''\n  All of the nominees we should be considering and confirming today fit \nthe mold described by President Obama and the best traditions of the \nDepartment of Justice. I urge Republican Senators to reconsider their \npartisan obstructionist approach and return from recess ready to end \nthe delays and confirm these nominees.\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4301-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to express my sympathy over the \nloss of Marine Cpl Michael W. Ouellette, a 29-year-old native of \nManchester, NH. Corporal Ouellette died on March 22, 2009, as a result \nof injuries sustained from an improvised explosive device while on foot \npatrol in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. Another marine was \nkilled in the attack and two others were injured.\n  Corporal Ouellette graduated from Memorial High School in Manchester \nin 1999. He joined the Marines in June 2005 and was trained as an \ninfantryman. He served two terms in Iraq, deploying there in March 2006 \nand again in July 2007. He began his third tour overseas when he \ndeployed to Afghanistan in November 2008. Ouellette was assigned to the \n3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine \nExpeditionary Force out of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  Corporal Ouellette served with honor and distinction throughout his \nhighly decorated military career. He received a number of awards for \nhis duty, including the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Combat Action \nRibbon, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War \non Terrorism Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Iraq \nCampaign Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  New Hampshire is proud of Corporal Oullette's service to and \nsacrifice for our country. He, and the thousands of brave men and women \nof the U.S. Armed Forces serving today, deserve America's highest honor \nand recognition.\n  Corporal Ouellette is survived by his parents, Donna and Leonard \nOuellette, as well as a brother, Alan, and a sister, Stephanie. He will \nbe missed dearly by all those who knew him.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring U.S. \nMarine Cpl Michael Ouellette.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and a deep \nsense of gratitude to pay tribute to Cpl Michael Ouellette of \nManchester, NH, for his service and the sacrifice he paid for his \ncountry.\n  Michael exhibited willingness and enthusiasm to serve and defend his \ncountry after visiting hurricane-ravaged New Orleans in 2005. He \nsubsequently joined the U.S. Marine Corps and served two tours of duty \nin Iraq before deploying to Afghanistan. Tragically, on March 22, 2009, \nMichael paid the ultimate sacrifice. In support of his brothers in arms \nand the country he loved, Michael was killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Corporal Ouellette will live \non as a decorated hero and the epitome of a patriot.\n  Michael graduated from Manchester Memorial High School in 1999. A \nbeloved member of the Manchester community, Michael was the embodiment \nof selflessness. With the same sense of altruistic integrity that led \nhim to help an unfamiliar and unsuspecting Memorial High classmate fix \na flat tire; Michael answered the call to help his country.\n  In giving his life to protect our freedoms, Michael personified our \ngreatest attributes as citizens. His hard work and dedication was \nparamount to his unit's success and places him among the great heroes \nand citizens our state has known. Michael was regularly recognized for \nhis courageous actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, receiving the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, the Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Iraq Campaign Medal, and \nthe National Defense Service Medal. He will always be remembered for \nhis courage, kindness, and unwavering devotion.\n  My thoughts, condolences, and prayers go out to Michael's family. I \noffer them my deepest sympathies and heartfelt thanks for Michael's \nservice. We will keep his memory alive knowing that his efforts have \nmade us safer and have preserved the liberties we enjoy every day. God \nBless Michael Ouellette.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4301-7", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4301-S4302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President. I wish today to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  Sixty years ago this April, NATO was created to ensure the freedom \nand security of western nations in the aftermath of the Second World \nWar. Since\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nthen, it has evolved into the most comprehensive international security \norganization the world has ever known and has become a reliable \ncornerstone of America's national security.\n  As many of my Senate colleagues know, I was an active proponent of \nNATO expansion in 1999 and again in 2004. For me, the debate over \nwhether to expand NATO had deep personal resonance. For many of the \ncountries aspiring to join NATO at that time, freedom did not come to \nevery nation in Europe at the end of the Second World War. For those \ncountries caught behind the Iron Curtain, the end of the Second World \nWar marked the beginning of a long struggle for freedom and democracy. \nEven after the Iron Curtain fell, their freedom and security was not \nensured. For many of those countries, joining NATO in the expansion \nrounds in 1999 and 2004 provided true security for the first time.\n  For me, growing up as a Polish American in east Baltimore, I learned \nabout the burning of Warsaw. I knew about the occupation of Poland by \nthe Nazis. I learned about the burning of Warsaw at the end of World \nWar II, when the Germans burned it because of the Warsaw uprising, \nSoviet troops stood on the other side of the Vistula River and watched \nit burn. I learned about the Katyn massacre, where Russians murdered \nmore than 4,000 military officers and intellectuals in the Katyn Forest \nat the start of the Second World War, so there would not be an \nintellectual force in Poland, ever, to lead it to democracy. I learned \nthat these terrible events must never be permitted again. When the \nSenate voted to ratify the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic, and \nHungary into NATO, I knew that Poland could finally emerge from the \nshadow of the Cold War to join the family of Western nations.\n  In the 60 years since it was created, NATO has been an unprecedented \nsuccess in deterring conflict and promoting peace and stability. To \nremain relevant and successful in the future, NATO must keep its doors \nopen to those European democracies ready to bear the responsibilities, \nas well as the burdens, of membership. We must all remember that for \nmany nations that have been occupied and oppressed over the last 100 \nyears, NATO represents an institution that will guard against a repeat \nof the despicable and inhumane practices of the old century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4302-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM CUBAN PATRIOTS\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues a \nrecent letter from 17 courageous activists within Cuba who are calling \nfor democracy for their country. These individuals represent peaceful \nlocal movements across the nation. They represent Cuba's future more \nthan the aged military elite now ruling that country alongside Raul \nCastro. They are asking for the support of the United States, including \na policy that does not ``sacrifice the moral leadership of the United \nStates in the face of commercial temptations.''\n  Though Cubans have suffered oppression under the Castro regime for \nmore than 50 years, this is an especially appropriate time to raise \nawareness of the ongoing plight of the Cuban people. In recent weeks, \nthe Cuban regime has tightened its grip on the reins of power and \ninstalled hard-line military officers in top government posts. \nIronically, at a time with increasing harassment and imprisonments \ntaking place in Cuba, there are efforts within this Congress to adjust \nU.S. policy in a way that would essentially reward the Cuban regime.\n  Before any Member of this body or the President considers loosening \nthe sanctions we have on Cuba, I commend the following letter to their \nreading:\n  The material follows:\n\n                         [Informal Translation]\n\n       Dear President Obama, Your election is a formidable symbol \n     of what civic determination can do to institute \n     transcendental social and political change. By assuming and \n     conducting your important Presidential duties, you honor the \n     millions of Americans who have fought for liberty, social \n     justice, civil rights and human dignity.\n       In Cuba, there is a movement representing a broad racial \n     and religious spectrum, formed by women, men, workers, and \n     young people that--despite being the object of terrible \n     repression by the regime in power--is conducting a peaceful \n     civic struggle for democracy and human rights.\n       Our movement includes the desire for CHANGE by thousands of \n     Cubans who have defied the repression, the intimidation and \n     have overcome the fear to sign their names in petitions for \n     constitutional reforms and academic freedom. Thousands more \n     have refused to join in the attacks or ``actos de repudio'' \n     ordered by the political police against those who aspire for \n     peaceful political change. We are sustained by the \n     inspiration of the more than 1.4 million Cubans that \n     boycotted the elections of a single party and candidate \n     organized by the regime in January and February 2008. Every \n     day, in subtle and not so subtle ways, in visible and \n     invisible ways, the Cuban people increasingly deny their \n     support to the regime in power through acts of civil \n     disobedience.\n       A great majority of Cubans, including many within the \n     government, yearn for deep democratic changes in Cuba.\n       The great example of the civil rights movement in the \n     United States is a ray of hope that the full dignity of every \n     Cuban will be restored. We want to determine our future \n     through democratic means.\n       It is our understanding that your administration will \n     redirect the policy of the United States on Cuba and the \n     regime. We ask that you do not put commercial considerations \n     ahead of political freedom for our people. The regime's \n     repression has increased considerably during the last year, \n     and the militarization at high levels of government is a \n     clear signal of the government's lack of will to initiate \n     real changes. Today, hundreds of political prisoners languish \n     in terrible conditions in Castro's jails. Their only crime \n     has been to fight for the same freedoms that Americans such \n     as Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. gave their \n     lives for. Have no doubt Mr. President Obama that their fight \n     is our fight now.\n       We ask that you consider an international, multilateral \n     strategy that would compel the regime to open itself to its \n     own people by freeing the political prisoners, restoring the \n     civil rights of the Cuban people and organizing free \n     elections with international supervision. Such a policy would \n     reinforce and strengthen the work of many groups of Cubans \n     dedicated to the peaceful political change.\n       This movement for change seeks to peacefully and deeply \n     transform the political scene of Cuba.\n       We invite you to not sacrifice the moral leadership of the \n     United States in the face of commercial temptations. Your \n     presidency is a tribute to everything that can be conquered \n     when a cause is just and correct. We dedicate our lives to \n     the movement for the freedom of Cuba and expect--one day--to \n     have a democratically-elected Cuban president who would \n     welcome you to Havana.\n       Do not forget us. We need your support. We, too, ``have a \n     dream'' of freedom.\n       Attentively,\n       1. Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ``Antunez'', Presidio Politico \n     Pedro Luis Boitel\n       2.

Mr. President, since I last came to the floor to discuss a \nproposal for a Commission of Inquiry, Americans have learned disturbing \nnew facts that underscore the need for such a nonpartisan review. In \nthe last 8 years, expansive views of Presidential authority and \nmisguided policies have dominated the question of how best to preserve \nand protect national security. As Senators, we each take an oath to \n``support and defend the Constitution of the United States.'' In the \nmonths and years following 9/11, driven by an inflated view of \nexecutive power, the Bush-Cheney administration compromised many of the \nvery laws and\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\nprotections that are the heart of our democracy. Their policies, which \ncondoned torture, extraordinary renditions, and the warrantless \nwiretapping of Americans, have left a stain on America's reputation in \nthe world.\n  In recent weeks, we have also seen a few more opinions previously \nissued by the Office of Legal Counsel after 9/11 that had been kept \nsecret until now. I commend the new Attorney General on their release. \nI have asked that more be released, and it is my hope that they will be \nsoon. These opinions sought to excuse policies that trample upon the \nConstitution and our duly enacted legal protections. These opinions \narise from an arrogant rationale that the President can do anything he \nwants to do, that the President is above the law. The last President to \nmake that claim was Richard Nixon. We saw the results of that policy in \nWatergate. It was through efforts like the Church Committee that we \nrevised our laws and moved forward. In my view, it is time to do so \nagain.\n  Perhaps the most persuasive new revelation that demonstrates why we \ncannot just turn the page without reading it is Mark Danner's account \nof a leaked copy of a report on the treatment of detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay. The report, compiled by the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross, is nothing short of chilling. One detainee interviewed \ndescribes: ``Two black wooden boxes were brought into the room outside \nmy cell. One was tall, slightly higher than me and narrow .The other \nwas shorter, perhaps only [3\\1/2\\ feet] in height. I was taken out of \nmy cell and one of the interrogators wrapped a towel around my neck, \nthey then used it to swing me around and smash me repeatedly against \nthe hard walls of the room. . . . I was then put into the tall black \nbox for what I think was about one and a half to two hours. . . . They \nput a cloth or cover over the outside of the box to cut out the light \nand restrict my air supply. It was difficult to breathe.''\n  The report continues to describe how these men were kept naked, \nshackled to a chair for weeks in freezing cold temperatures, forced \nwith cold water to stay awake for days on end, bombarded with loud \nmusic, starved, and beaten over and over again. In one interview, a man \ndescribes how he was waterboarded: He was ``dragged from the small box, \nunable to walk properly and put on what looked like a hospital bed, and \nstrapped down very tightly with belts.'' As they poured water on him, \nhe said ``I struggled against the straps, trying to breathe, but it was \nhopeless. I thought I was going to die.''\n  The report concludes that from those descriptions, this was torture. \nAnd there is mounting evidence to suggest it was a Bush administration \npolicy. Media reports suggest that the CIA briefed high-level \nadministration officials on the interrogation plan. Vice President \nCheney admitted in an interview with ABC News that he supported the \nplan that authorized these measures, including waterboarding. In fact \nhe continues to claim, without any basis, that the Bush \nadministration's interrogation tactics, including torture, were \nappropriate and effective.\n  This past Sunday, a Washington Post article described how the \nwaterboarding of Abu Zubaida failed to produce any useful intelligence. \nOf course, Zubaida is a detainee who many Bush administration officials \nhad long claimed provided useful intelligence only after he was \nsubjected to harsh interrogation techniques. According to Post \ninterviews of former senior government officials, ``not a single \nsignificant plot was foiled as a result of Abu Zubaida's tortured \nconfessions . . . Nearly all of the leads attained through the harsh \nmeasures quickly evaporated, while most of the useful information from \nAbu Zubaida . . . was obtained before waterboarding was introduced.''\n  Jack Goldsmith refers to the August 2002 ``Bybee memo'' as the \n``golden shield,'' because it redefined torture in order to shield \ndecisionmakers from liability for these tactics. The release of related \nmemos is needed. Whether they end up shielding decisionmakers from \nprosecution, they should not shield them from accountability. \nAccountability does not only happen in a courtroom. We need to know \nwhat was done. Transparency and accountability can help restore our \nreputation around the world. Most importantly, to reestablish the trust \nof the American public in their government, they deserve to know and \nunderstand what happened.\n  Just last week, we heard about the Bush administration's attempt to \nsilence Binyam Mohammed, a British citizen held for years as an enemy \ncombatant at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. He claims that \nhe was tortured during the course of his detention. Bush administration \nofficials apparently demanded that he sign a secret plea bargain which \nwould have prohibited him from ever suing the United States over his \nalleged torture in order to be sent back to the United Kingdom. He did \nnot and now Britain is investigating his allegations. When asked about \nthe involvement of a particular British intelligence agent, Mr. \nMohammed said, ``I feel very strongly that we shouldn't scapegoat the \nlittle people. We certainly shouldn't blame `Witness B,' he was only \nfollowing orders.''\n  One of my concerns in proposing the Commission of Inquiry is that we \nnot scapegoat or punish those of lesser rank. Such a commission's \nobjective would be to find the truth to provide accountability for the \npast. People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge \nand experiences, not for purposes of constructing criminal indictments, \nbut to assemble the facts, to know what happened and to make sure \nmistakes are not repeated. We have had successful oversight in some \nareas, but on issues including harsh interrogation tactics, \nextraordinary rendition and executive override of the laws, the last \nadministration successfully kept many of us in the dark about what \nhappened and who ordered it.\n  One month ago, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing to explore my \nproposal. A bipartisan panel of respected witnesses explained why we \nneed such a commission. Since that time, this idea has received a wide \nrange of support from people all across this country. I am not \ninterested in a panel comprised of partisans intent on advancing \npartisan conclusions. I regret that Senate Republicans have approached \nthis matter to date as partisans. That was not my intent or focus. \nIndeed, it will take bipartisan support in order to move this forward.\n  I continue to talk about this prospect with others in Congress, and \nwith outside groups and experts. I continue to call on Republicans to \nrecognize that this is not about partisan politics. It is about being \nhonest with ourselves as a country. We need to move forward together.\n  I recently heard from the Nobel Prize recipient Bishop Desmond Tutu \nabout this proposal. Bishop Tutu, respected throughout the world for \nhis efforts for peace and justice in his own country of South Africa, \noffered his support for what we are trying to do.\n  The legacy of the last administration left us facing crises in more \nareas than just the economy, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the \nworst recession since the Great Depression. There is no question that \nthose are all pressing issues. But we cannot ignore the failures of \ngovernment forever. We do so at our peril.\n  We are tackling tough issues in these difficult and uncertain times. \nThe Judiciary Committee has a full legislative agenda, having reported \nbipartisan legislation to fight fraud, public corruption and to aid the \neconomy through patent reform. But the fact remains that under the most \nremarkably broad expansion of executive authority in my lifetime, we \nhave seen policies on detention and interrogation that undermined our \nvalues, our reputation and, many believe, our efforts to ensure \nnational security.\n  The country will need to have an honest discourse about what happened \nand what went wrong. I continue to feel strongly that a Commission of \nInquiry would provide us the best nonpartisan setting in which to \nundertake that study and national conversation. I think we should \nproceed sooner rather than later. I am continuing to reach out and to \nwork on the proposal. But a conversation is not something I can \nundertake unilaterally. As strongly as I feel, it will take the \ncooperation and commitment of others for this proposal to serve its \nintended purpose so that we can join together to move past the mistakes \nof the recent past.\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4304-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING HOSTELLING INTERNATIONAL USA\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, last October marked the fifth anniversary \nof the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of Yukos, \nRussia's largest oil company. The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and \nAmnesty International, among others, have concluded he was charged and \nimprisoned in a process that did not follow the rule of law and was \npolitically influenced. This miscarriage of justice in 2003 is \nsignificant because it was one of the early signs that Russia was \nretreating from democratic values and the rule of law.\n  Last month, Russian authorities decided to go to trial with a second \nset of charges first introduced in 2007 when Khodorkovsky was to become \neligible for parole. Despite credible reports that he was a model \nprisoner, parole was denied on apparently flimsy and contrived \ntechnical grounds. Yet the Russian judiciary recently saw fit to grant \nparole to Colonel Yuri Budanov, who was serving a sentence for raping \nand murdering a Chechen girl. I would also like to note that it was \nStanislav Markelov, a courageous attorney who was instrumental in \nputting Budanov behind bars. But Budanov is now free and Markelov was \ngunned down, along with Anastasia Baburova a journalist for Russia's \npremier independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, in broad daylight in \ncentral Moscow last January. The message this sends is loud and clear \nand profoundly disturbing.\n  Based on the observations of many independent international lawyers \nand organizations, there was no compelling evidence that Khodorkovsky \nor any of his associates were guilty of the crimes for which they were \noriginally charged or that the legal process reflected the rule of law \nor international standards of justice. Even Russian officials have \nacknowledged that Khodorkovsky's arrest and imprisonment were \npolitically motivated. As reported by the Economist, Igor Shuvalov, \nFirst Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, admitted that Khodorkovsky was \nin a Siberian prison camp ``for political reasons.'' He added that \n``Once you behead someone, you give a good example (to other Russian \ntycoons) of how to behave.'' In other words, freedom for Russia's \nbusinessmen is determined by the Kremlin's political expediency. As \nreported by The Washington Post and the Boston Globe, Shuvalov has \ncalled the trial and continued imprisonment of Khodorkovsky a \n``showflogging'' intended to serve as an example to others on the \npolitical consequences of challenging the Kremlin's economic ambitions.\n  The current charges against Khodorkovsky amount to legal hooliganism \nand highlight the petty meanness of the senior government officials \nbehind this travesty of justice.The charges and verdicts have been \ninexplicable to Russian and Western lawyers, leading international \norganizations, courts, and human rights groups to condemn the trial as \npolitically inspired. The second set of charges against Khodorkovsky \nshould be dropped and the new trial should be abandoned.\n  I strongly support President Obama's call to reset the U.S.-Russian \nrelationship and welcome the statement that emerged from his meeting in \nLondon with Russian President Medvedev. We have many common interests \nwith Russia and must seek to improve the atmosophere and substance of \nour ties with Moscow. But the Helsinki process is predicated on the \nidea that domestic politics and inter-state relations are linked. I \nhope that President Medvedev, a trained jurist from whom many hope to \nsee evidence of a reformist approach, will make that connection. The \ncase of Mikhail Khodorsky is a good place to start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4304-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4304-S4306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Due to the price of gas, my husband might get laid off. He \n     shuttles the railroad employees around Idaho. At this time I \n     do not have a job due to being laid off from St. Al's, so gas \n     prices have and will continue to affect our family until \n     something is done about it!\n     Sarah.\n                                  ____\n\n       In short, the fuel prices are making small farming \n     extremely difficult. I have been retired for seven years, and \n     have a small farm to help supplement our income. I have \n     empathy for all citizens in this fine country who are \n     struggling. The time is far spent; our resources need to be \n     utilized now. The environmental hacks and the tree huggers as \n     well as the nuke protestors [have caused harm to our \n     country]. America is hurting because of political gaming. My \n     grandchildren desire to see my wife and me; however, we can \n     no longer afford the fuel for long trips. I am thankful for \n     being able to plant two gardens with intentions of helping \n     less fortunate with food items as they struggle to make ends \n     meet. I have discontinued use of any recreational outings to \n     help stave off the discomfort of tight budgets. A sad \n     commentary after working and saving for over 45 years, and \n     this is the kind of retirement that has been foisted upon \n     millions of us seniors.\n     Ralph, Mountain Home.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking: Here is the data--I spend $85 a week \n     or $340 a month driving to work. I spend an equal amount for \n     health care; or that amounts to two paychecks in a month \n     leaving me and family two paychecks for food and housing. \n     Simple math makes one question--in whose interests are our \n     elected leaders working?\n     Floyd, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       When we talk about energy, most people think of two things; \n     Gasoline and the power and gas for their homes. When I hear \n     you politicians talk about weaning ourselves off of fossil \n     fuels, it makes me cringe. How far are from having the \n     technology to produce electric engines that will fly an \n     airplane and what will it cost to produce them? Right now we \n     are at least 50 years from become free of fossil fuels unless \n     I am not up to speed on things, (which is possible). Let us \n     not forget also all the other petroleum-based products we use \n     in our everyday lives. Plastics, foam, etc., are all going to \n     still be wanted and they are also going up in price. I like \n     where you stand on nuclear energy, but until we can quiet the \n     environmental extremists on this point, we will not soon get \n     there. As long as this country is held hostage by special \n     interest environmental groups we will continue to slide \n     economically. I hope [conservatives have not] moved so far \n     left already to start curbing some of this.\n       My husband and I live in Oakley, which is a small farming \n     community located 20 miles from the nearest town of Burley. \n     Our farmers are getting hit extremely hard due to the cost of \n     diesel, which also raises the cost of shipping. We owned a \n     trucking company that we were forced to close due to the \n     rising costs of fuel. My husband is also a disabled Viet Nam \n     veteran and must drive to the VA hospital every week for \n     various treatments. That is a distance of 200 miles. Since we \n     are on a very small fixed income, we are soon going to be \n     unable to afford to pay our basic living expenses. Our \n     elderly parents live on the coast, and we have had to cancel \n     all plans to visit them this summer. Please stop\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\n     this runaway inflation. I am in favor of using domestic \n     energy sources but congress has been ignoring it. It will \n     soon be too late for most of us.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yes, I am spending more on gas this year. Yet, I believe we \n     need to put more of our government money into conservation \n     and alternative energies not increasing energy exploitation \n     in the U.S. We have the technology and the innovation as \n     Americans to be creative about this problem. I would love a \n     tax break to purchase a hybrid vehicle or a vehicle that uses \n     biodiesel. Please represent us well and keep our pristine, \n     beautiful environment in Idaho and the coastal U.S. any \n     further.\n     Jennifer, Victor.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband is a dentist and earns a good living, but we \n     have felt a need to curtail our usual driving habits because \n     of fuel prices. My husband drives a diesel pickup to and from \n     work and we also use it to pull our boat. He has been \n     considering buying a scooter/m.bike to ride because of the \n     high diesel price, but I really do not want him crossing busy \n     roads on a vehicle that is harder for another driver to see. \n     I have curtailed my trips to town which cuts down on my \n     consumerism. Not a bad idea, but it will likely be what \n     others are doing which is not good for the local economy. Our \n     own dental practice feels the crunch of conservative \n     spending. Our grown children that live away from this area \n     are cutting back on their visits. I do not like not being \n     able to see my grandchildren as often. Higher gas prices \n     limits the lifestyle of everyone. We are so spread out in \n     this country that it is an investment to go anywhere. Let us \n     get drilling!!!\n     Renee, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am in the insurance business and use my vehicle for work. \n     The high fuel prices are really eating into my margins and \n     are making it increasingly hard to stay on top of my personal \n     and business finances. The way I see it is we need to: First, \n     increase our refinery capacity. Build new refineries. Second, \n     increase drilling for more crude. But this will not help \n     until we have the refinery capacity to process it. Third \n     build nuclear power plants for inexpensive electricity.\n       Of course, all of the above are extremely difficult with \n     the left wing environmentalists fighting us but somehow we \n     have got to get it done! I am just not sure alternative fuels \n     are the answer because of the cost of production.\n     Kent, Paul.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have supported you because you have always listened and \n     tried your best to solve the problems of all of your \n     constituents. Now you ask for stories about how the high \n     price of oil has affected Idaho families. I would like to \n     give you rather than a story is a solution, albeit a simple-\n     minded one.\n       As gasoline prices keep racing towards $5 per gallon, I \n     think it is time to rethink some of our policies. OPEC feels \n     it has a stranglehold on the West and continues to tighten. \n     Now a real simplistic approach to this problem from a purely \n     capitalist point of view would be to look at what goods these \n     countries cannot produce themselves and increase prices there \n     until they feel the pressure to release oil at a more \n     reasonable cost per barrel. You know it is supply versus \n     demand. Last time I checked, they cannot grow enough grain or \n     other food products to sustain life in that region and yet we \n     continue to give away everything. I know this does not \n     breed friendship abroad but they are not our friends \n     anyway, they have proved that time and again.\n       We also need to release all the energy alternatives that \n     oil companies have been withholding from this country to \n     continue [their] stranglehold on the United States for their \n     profits. This would allow us to relinquish our addiction to \n     foreign oil and strengthen our economy, rather than making \n     continually throwing money at our enemies. Then and only then \n     can we become the Land of the Free and Home of the Brave once \n     again.\n       Just my opinion, Thank you for your time and allowing me to \n     vent these ideas to you.\n     Jeff, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I like many Idahoans and Americans are feeling \n     the pinch with energy costs rising. There are many issues \n     that attribute to the problem and I feel helpless as an \n     individual that any of these issues will be resolved but we \n     must try, we have no alternatives but to try. If I could \n     prioritize a list of things that I feel we should to do help \n     immediately relieve some of the pain, I would say do the \n     following in order of priority:\n       (1) Stop the big oil companies from getting so much profit \n     by putting controls on their profits and not help them get \n     such big profits;\n       (2) Use domestic energy sources;\n       (3) Nuclear power; and\n       (4) Renewable and alternative sources of energy.\n       Now the number one priority in my opinion will be the \n     toughest because I believe like so many other Americans that \n     most government officials will not allow this to happen \n     either because of special interest or under the table money \n     they are receiving from big oil companies. The problem is our \n     government officials are doing nothing illegal in most cases \n     because it is not against the law for special interest groups \n     to contribute to or otherwise [provide a political benefit to \n     their supporters]. As long as this is going on, our rising \n     energy problems will never be solved. We need to get this \n     under control otherwise the big oil companies will pillage us \n     Americans as long as they can.\n       Other obvious fixes are to use domestic energy sources and \n     nuclear power as much as possible. But as long as the oil \n     companies have free reign, our skyrocketing energy costs will \n     never get under control. We need to pass laws against extreme \n     profits and against allowing big oil companies to lobby our \n     Senators and Congreesman.\n     Dirck and Cindy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Promoting the transition to a hydrogen economy (fuel cell-\n     powered cars) benefits Idaho in two ways: (1) It reduces our \n     dependence on oil and (2) It will fuel the expansion of Idaho \n     National Lab's nuclear research efforts. The two best \n     contenders to replace fossil fuels are batteries or fuel \n     cells. Fuel cells are more compact and better suited for \n     cars, but energy to charge a car battery is much more readily \n     available.\n       The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) being developed at \n     INL (among other national labs) will produce hydrogen at low \n     cost with no carbon emissions. By promoting the growth of the \n     hydrogen economy, Congress will steer research in the \n     direction of NGNP as a replacement to current oil-derived \n     hydrogen.\n       To make hydrogen viable, the government needs to make more \n     hydrogen available. This means subsidizing hydrogen ``gas \n     stations'' in high-commuter areas and pushing the NGNP \n     concept through DOE funding. Idaho is a big part of the \n     solution, but the federal government needs to start tapping \n     its valuable scientific resources now.\n     Aaron.\n                                  ____\n\n       We live in Parma. There is nothing here, a little store and \n     a gas station, but nothing else. To do any serious shopping \n     we have to go into Caldwell or Nampa or Boise, at a cost of \n     over $50 for one trip. We do not go shopping often and paying \n     for the gas makes it so expensive we have to cut down on \n     other purchases. We are eating a lot of beans and cornbread, \n     grinding our own wheat and raising a garden because I cannot \n     afford both fuel and food for my little family.\n       What's going to happen this winter? Where are the programs \n     for underwriting the cost of propane and natural gas? How \n     about helping with the purchase of wood? Have you considered \n     a quick program that would insulate the homes, or help \n     purchase new windows and doors?\n       There is a new solar energy development from NanoSolar that \n     no one will make available to homeowners. We could have solar \n     power for a few cents a foot on our roofs. Solar is free and \n     clean, unlike the deadly option like nuclear power. If we do \n     not know how to take care of the garbage from nuclear, then \n     we should not have nuclear power in the first place.\n       If action is not taken in a big way to save what we have \n     and get into renewable power, the country is not going to \n     survive and this winter will be deadly.\n     Ann, Parma.\n                                  ____\n\n       I first want to thank Mike Crapo for taking an interest in \n     what we the people are worried about. Finally, someone in our \n     government that is listening to the people and their \n     concerns. I hope that these concerns do not fall on deaf ears \n     and can promise each of you if they do, you will not remain \n     in office long. We as Americans will not tolerate being \n     ignored.\n       I work in a hospital and help people in need every day by \n     using my field of expertise. (I expect the same from our \n     government representation.) However when I see people holding \n     off until they have no choice but to come in for major \n     medical issues because of financial concerns and when I see \n     many who die because they did not get help soon enough, I \n     feel it time for someone to stand up for them and say enough \n     is enough. It is time for a change.\n       I do not make a ton of money but know that I am in much \n     better shape than those who work so hard in housekeeping, \n     maintenance, and other lower paying areas in our hospital. I \n     feel the crunch pretty hard with five kids, a mortgage and \n     such and have tried not to drive but walk or ride my bike \n     when I can. However, with the winters, we have and the \n     distance we have to travel in our great state, this is often \n     not possible. So I have to drive. When I get down to a half a \n     tank of fuel, I fill up. Why? Well, it costs me $72 for a \n     half a tank of diesel and I fear that I would have a stroke \n     on the spot if I had to fill it from empty. That gentleman is \n     ridiculous! I cannot even imagine how those in lower-paying \n     jobs can even make it! When I go to the store and see food \n     prices I am again appalled at what is happening. When I buy \n     clothing, still again I am shocked at the staggering prices. \n     Everything seems to be going up but our wages. Now we do not \n     have the best. We do not buy name brand. We have tightened \n     our belt, and there was not a lot of fat to trim before that. \n     Then we have tightened again. There is not much more to \n     tighten. And I would consider us to be a family in a very \n     modest home, with not much in the way of extras and we have \n     tried to keep our debt to home and car (and never a new car). \n     But with the price of fuel, both for cars and home, things \n     are getting out of hand in a hurry. Why? Greed and power \n     through fear!\n       Here is the deal. We sit on more oil then OPEC. And yet we \n     have closed at least three refineries in the last ten years. \n     We have never been able to refine oil as cleanly and\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\n     efficiently then we can now and yet our government chooses \n     not to build more refineries and sink more oil wells. Supply \n     and demand still runs any business and yet if we were to \n     increase supply, we could still make a healthy profit. Enough \n     to pay for the refineries in a hurry and to put more research \n     into alternative fuels. Not to mention lower dramatically the \n     prices not only at the pump, but everywhere else as well. We \n     might even start to help replenish our failing Social \n     security and pay down our national debt. Business sense is \n     what we need in Washington. Reagan Economics that helps to \n     build for the future, not run our great nation further into \n     the ground. We do not need more taxes; we need more \n     initiative in Washington. We need leaders that put the \n     interests of the people first and the world second. We need \n     to use what we have while developing new technology for \n     the future. We need some good old fashion farm boy ``fix \n     it''--live within your means, balance your own checkbook \n     logic. Occam's Razor says that ``the simplest answer is \n     usually the best one''. We do not need bickering and \n     fighting; we need cooperation. We do not need pork bellies \n     and hidden agendas; we need playing well in the sandbox. \n     We do not need environmentalists dictating to us; we need \n     people who look out for the environment while utilizing in \n     the best way we can, the resources that we have. We need \n     to tap into the creative genius of a nation that has \n     continued to wow the world for over 200 years. We need God \n     and we need to humble ourselves enough to see the other \n     person's ideas for what they are, [accept] what we can use \n     and build together the nation we have had in the past. It \n     is time to put away selfishness and start working with \n     each other toward a stronger more sound America.\n       Remember that people cannot create and press forward when \n     they can hear nothing but their bellies growling and feel the \n     discomfort of not having their physical needs met. It is when \n     their physical needs are met that they can concentrate on \n     other higher creative thought processes.\n       Fuel has brought us down in a hurry of late and is a great \n     place to start to bring us back up. Roll up your sleeves and \n     get to work. Supply and demand is still what runs a business, \n     and it seems that we have more than enough supply of \n     professional politicians, saying one thing and doing another \n     or just plain ignoring what we the people say, each of you \n     know where that leads. Be the one to stand shoulder to \n     shoulder with those that have Americas best interest at heart \n     and make a change for the better. We sure do need it if we \n     are to survive.\n     Steven, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for giving the people the opportunity to be \n     involved. There is definitely a need for concern about the \n     energy crisis, economy and environmental impacts. These \n     problems are linked and have been around for a long time. \n     They are only going to get worse unless we take stronger \n     action now. There is a solution for the crisis and there \n     always has been. The solution is to unite the people for the \n     cause. ``For united we stand and divided we fall''.\n       The following are topics that can immediately be addressed: \n     (1) personal choices; (2) clean energy economy; (3) adoption \n     of renewables; (4) enhanced energy efficiencies; (5) \n     innovative leadership. Visit www.wecansolveit.org for more \n     details.\n       My story is to get involved and encourage others to get \n     involved! We can start with personal choices by using \n     products and technologies that enhance energy efficiencies \n     such as light bulbs, water saving and efficient toilets, \n     dishwashers, clothes washers, moisture controlled sprinkler \n     systems, biodegradable products, etc.\n       Fuel reformulators would increase fuel economy by as much \n     20% and decrease hydrocarbons in the atmosphere by at least \n     30%.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nreflecting on the memory and deeds of a remarkable American, Andrea \nMead Lawrence, who passed away March 31 in the town of Mammoth Lakes in \nMono County.\n  Andrea was born in Vermont, where she developed a life-long love of \nwinter sports. At the age of 15, she participated in the 1948 Winter \nOlympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland. In the 1952 Winter Olympics she \nwon two Gold Medals in the Olympic Special and Giant Slalom races in \nOslo, Norway. She also competed in the 1956 Olympics in Cortina \nd'Ampezzo, Italy. She was inducted into the U.S. National Ski Hall of \nFame in 1958 at the age of 25. In 1960, she was the torch lighter at \nthe Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, CA. She remains the only American \ndouble-Gold Medalist in Alpine Skiing. Additional honors and her love \nof winter sports continued the rest of her life.\n  In 1967, she moved to Mammoth Lakes in California's spectacularly \nbeautiful Eastern Sierra, a place that she fought to protect, for the \nrest of her life. Serving 16 years on the Mono County Board of \nSupervisors, she worked tirelessly to protect and restore Mono Lake and \nas a member of the Great Basin Air Pollution Control District, she saw \nthat air pollution caused by the de-watering of Owens Lake was reduced. \nShe founded the Andrea Lawrence Institute for Mountains and Rivers in \n2003 to work for environmental protection and economic vitality in the \nregion she loved so much.\n  Last summer, she testified before the Mono County Board of \nSupervisors in favor of the Eastern Sierra Wild Heritage Act, a bill \nthat became law with the signature of President Barack Obama, the day \nbefore she died. Andrea knew that this legislation to protect nearly \n500,000 acres of her beloved Eastern Sierra had become law.\n  Andrea Mead Lawrence passed away surrounded by her children, \nCortlandt, Matthew, Dierdre, Leslie and Quentin, and leaves four \ngrandchildren. She was 76 years old. Andrea had a remarkable and \nwonderful life and she will be sorely missed by all those who were \nfortunate enough to know her. She leaves a rich legacy that will \ncontinue to benefit present and future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4306-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4306-S4307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  150TH ANNIVERSARY OF CARIBOU, MAINE\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with pride and gratitude \nthat today I commemorate the 150th anniversary of Caribou, ME, which \nhappens to be my hometown.\n  The early settlers of Caribou were brave, self-reliant pioneers who \nleft the comfort and security of established communities behind to make \ntheir own way in the wilderness of northern Maine. I am proud that my \nancestors, led by Samuel Wilson Collins, were among that intrepid \nnumber, and grateful that for six generations my family has been a part \nof this wonderful community.\n  I have great memories of growing up in Caribou, where my parents both \nserved as mayor, and where my brothers now run our fifth generation \nfamily lumber business. I remember fondly starting the school year in \nAugust so that we could take time off to pick potatoes, working at the \npublic library, and the fun we had going to high school basketball \nteams, especially during the exciting 1969 State championship season.\n  But more than anything, I remember what it was like to grow up in a \nplace that had such a strong sense of community. We learned to care for \nour friends and neighbors and to value our family members. We learned \nto help those in need. And Caribou's farm and lumber roots taught us \nthe importance of hard work. The lessons I learned growing up in \nCaribou have stayed with me my entire life and I know many others who \nwould say the same.\n  This sesquicentennial year is a time to honor those who turned a \nremote settlement into a center of commerce, education, arts and \nrecreation. It is a time to honor the valiant young men who served in \nmany wars, beginning with the Civil War, and who have risen to our \nNation's defense ever since.\n  It is a time to honor the people of Caribou who celebrate each \nothers' joys and who share each others' burdens.\n  Mr. President, a couple of years ago, the television host and author \nLarry King asked me to contribute to a book he was compiling of short \nessays describing an all-important lesson the contributors learned \ngrowing up. I was delighted by the request and had no trouble recalling \nthat defining moment.\n  One of my earliest childhood memories is of being taken to the \nCaribou Memorial Day Parade by my Dad. A decorated World War II \nveteran, with the modesty characteristic of all who serve our Nation in \nuniform, he would hoist me onto his shoulders so I could better see the \nparade. And what I was able to see was the entire street lined by the \npeople of Caribou, taking off their hats and putting their hands over \ntheir hearts as our flag went by, their eyes shining with pride in \ntheir country and with gratitude for those who serve her. A community \nthat joins together to honor its past and to face its\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\nfuture that is Caribou. That is my hometown.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of what the people of Caribou, ME, have \naccomplished in building a great American community. I am deeply \ngrateful for the many blessings that this community has given me, and \nso many others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4307-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL ROBERT PEARY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \nexpedition of ADM Robert Peary and his discovery of the North Pole 100 \nyears ago, on April 6, 1909.\n  While Robert Peary was born in Pennsylvania, he was educated in the \nState of Maine, at Bowdoin College in Brunswick. He graduated in 1877. \nHe lived in Portland and Fryeburg, and built a home on Eagle Island, \nwhich is now a State park.\n  A century ago, Admiral Peary and his men set sail for the North Pole \nin the Maine-built SS Roosevelt. They sailed through the frigid, ice-\nladen North Atlantic and froze the ship into a bay off northern \nEllesmere Island. After more than a month of dog sledging over the \nmoving sea ice covering the Arctic Ocean, Admiral Peary, Matthew \nHenson, and four Inughuit men stood at the northernmost place on \nEarth--the sea ice that marked the North Pole.\n  Peary's success had come after a number of previous failures and \nlessons learned. Nations had competed to get there; countless men had \nsuffered trying to do so, and some had even perished.\n  The story of Robert Peary, his expeditions, and his attainment of \nreaching the North Pole is a celebration of the triumph of leadership, \ncreativity and ingenuity.\n  Though traveling there has become significantly easier than it was in \n1909, the North Pole remains a destination for scientists. The fact is, \nhowever, the North Pole of today is not the same North Pole that \nAdmiral Peary discovered. The thick, multiyear sea ice that Admiral \nPeary encountered has disappeared. In the last 30 years, the Arctic has \nlost sea ice cover over an area ten times as large as the State of \nMaine, and at this rate the Arctic Ocean will be ice free by 2050. \nGlobal climate change is one of the most significant environmental \nchallenges facing our country, and it has renewed scientific interest \nin the North Pole.\n  Today, visitors to the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum at Bowdoin \nCollege can learn more about Admiral Peary's historic journey to the \ntop of the Earth. In special recognition of the 100th anniversary of \nthe expedition, the museum has brought together an impressive \ncollection of objects that were at the North Pole on April 6, 1909, \nincluding an American flag that flew at the pole on that day, a page \nfrom his diary where he reflects on his accomplishment, and one of his \nsledges.\n  The people of Maine, and especially those at Bowdoin College, are \nproud of Robert Peary and of all of those involved in his epic journey. \nI am pleased to honor the anniversary of this historic \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4307-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EITELJORG MUSEUM OF AMERICAN INDIANS AND \n                              WESTERN ART\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize a hallmark event taking place this year in \nIndianapolis, IN--the 20th anniversary of the Eiteljorg Museum of \nAmerican Indians and Western Art.\n  The museum's facility first opened its doors on June 24, 1989, and \nwas one of the first cultural institutions to take residence in White \nRiver State Park, which has in turn become a vibrant hub of \nrecreational and cultural activities in Indianapolis and greater \ncentral Indiana. A popular attraction since its opening, the Eiteljorg \nMuseum continues to thrive. Recently, in 2005, it underwent an \nimportant expansion that doubled its space by creating a variety of new \ngalleries, an education center, a cafe, and a resource center and \nlibrary.\n  But it is not only its facility and its existing collections that are \nto be lauded, for the Eiteljorg is also actively engaged in supporting \nnew generations of artists and their work. This is perhaps best \nhighlighted through the museum's Eiteljorg Fellowship for Native \nAmerican Fine Art and its artists-in-residence program.\n  In honor of this year's special anniversary occasion, the museum has \nplanned a series of events for its patrons and the community. The \nfestivities officially began last month, on March 14, 2008, when the \nnew ``Facing West: Celebrating 20 Years of the Eiteljorg Museum'' \nexhibition was unveiled during a special opening day celebration. \nCelebratory events will continue throughout this summer and fall, \nhowever, and will include a lecture series, festival days at the museum \nand the holding of an anniversary gala later this month.\n  Like so many of my fellow Hoosiers, I take pride in the Eiteljorg's \npresence in our State and am thankful for its continued commitment to \nits mission: ``to inspire an appreciation and understanding of the art, \nhistory and cultures of the American West and the indigenous peoples of \nNorth America.'' In the actualization of this mission, the Eiteljorg \nhas reached a wide patronage of both local residents and visitors alike \nwho have come to this unique and inspiring facility to take advantage \nof its wonderful offerings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4307-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MIKE FIELD\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about \nMike Field, a man whose public service has done much to improve the \nquality of life for people in our home State of Idaho.\n  Like many Western States, much of Idaho is made up of large swathes \nof rural areas where it can be challenging to provide the housing, \ninfrastructure and economic opportunities for those residents. Having \ngrown up in the rural community of Grandview, Mike learned this \nfirsthand. Raised by loving and civic-minded parents, Oscar and \nFrancis, he saw the work ethic and generosity that was demonstrated \nwithin his own family and by his neighbors. It became a foundation he \nused as he built his career in extending the helping hand of the State \nand Federal governments to Idahoans in our rural areas.\n  He started his work in this body, the U.S. Senate, where he served \nunder Senators Jim McClure and Larry Craig. Mike worked with fellow \nIdahoans and helped them sort out their difficulties with Federal \nagencies. Showing a deft touch with people, he became the Idaho State \ndirector of USDA Rural Development and later the USDA Farm Service \nAgency. In both roles, Mike naturally led and served Idaho's many \nfarmers and ranchers, in part based on his days growing up and working \nwith them. Mike then was appointed as a council member to the Northwest \nPower Planning Council, where he worked to provide an infrastructure \nfor reliable and cost effective power that would reach many areas of \nIdaho. He also dealt with natural resource issues that impacted the \nlivelihood of many in the rural parts of our State.\n  From there, he returned as the head of the USDA Rural Development \nIDAHO, where he has served over the past 8 years. In that capacity he \nhas used his optimism and good nature to lead and motivate a team that \nhas brought hundreds of millions of dollars in improvements to our \nState. He oversaw many positive changes in housing, drinking water and \njobs throughout our rural areas. Mike built a strong trust between the \ndifferent levels of government, tribes and agencies as he worked to \nimproving the quality of life for rural Idahoans.\n  I cannot imagine what Idaho, and particularly its rural areas, would \nlook like today without the efforts of Mike Field. Together, with his \nwife Debbie, they have greatly improved the lives of Idahoans with \ntheir dedicated public service.\n  I congratulate Mike for his many years of outstanding leadership and \nservice to his fellow Idahoans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4307-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4307-S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AL SCHOCK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Al Schock of \nSioux Falls, SD, for his years of extraordinary service to his \ncommunity as a member of the Downtown Lions Club. Mayor Dave Munson of \nSioux Falls will be recognizing his lifetime of accomplishments by \nproclaiming April 14, 2009, to be Al Schock, Lion King Day.\n  Al Schock has been a dedicated member of the Downtown Lions Club \nsince\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\n1949 and has worked to promote its humanitarian mission of improving \nlives and communities around the world. He has served in almost every \ncapacity possible, including club president, district governor, and \nmember of the Lions International Board of Directors. Since he first \njoined the Lions Club, he has shown tremendous leadership by recruiting \na total of over 100 new members to the organization. He has also \nexcelled in fundraising for the South Dakota Lions Foundation, having \nsold over 50,000 tickets to community fundraising events.\n  Schock has also contributed to the community of Sioux Falls through \nhis involvement with the Chamber of Commerce, the Sioux Falls \nDevelopment Foundation, Augustana College, the YMCA, the First Lutheran \nChurch, Luther Manor health care, and The Banquet. He and his brother, \nOzzie Schock, started the Shock Foundation, a nonprofit organization \nthat works to support local charitable organizations. Al Shock's \nselfless devotion and faithful service to others and to his community \nis truly commendable.\n  It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Al Schock for receiving \nthis honor, and to thank him for all his years of service to South \nDakota and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4308-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4308-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4308-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1388.

A bill to provide for the recognition of certain Native \ncommunities and the settlement of certain claims under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to allow \nfive Southeast Alaska communities to finally be allowed to form urban \ncorporations under the terms of 1971's Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct, the Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition \nand Compensation Act.\n  At the very beginning of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of \n1971 there are a series of findings and declarations of congressional \npolicy that explain the underpinnings of this landmark legislation.\n  The first clause reads, ``There is an immediate need for a fair and \njust settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, \nbased on aboriginal land claims.'' The second clause states, ``The \nsettlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in \nconformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives.''\n  Mr. President, 37, going on 38, years have passed since the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act became law and still the Native peoples of \nfive communities in Southeast Alaska--Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, \nTenakee and Haines--the five ``landless communities'' are still waiting \nfor their fair and just settlement.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act awarded $966 million and 44 \nmillion acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for the \nestablishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage such funds \nand lands. The beneficiaries of the settlement were issued stock in one \nof 13 regional Alaska Native corporations--12 based in Alaska. Most \nbeneficiaries also had the option to enroll and receive stock in a \nvillage, group or urban corporation.\n  For reasons that still defy clear explanation the Native peoples of \nthe ``landless communities,'' were not permitted by the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act to form village or urban corporations. These \ncommunities were excluded from this benefit even though they did not \ndiffer significantly from other communities in Southeast Alaska that \nwere permitted to form village or urban corporations under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. For example, Ketchikan had more Native \nresidents in 1970, the year of a member census, than Juneau, which was \npermitted to form the Goldbelt urban corporation. This finding was \nconfirmed in a February 1994 report submitted by the Secretary of the \nInterior at the direction of the Congress. That study was conducted by \nthe Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of \nAlaska.\n  The Native people of Southeast Alaska have recognized the injustice \nof this oversight for more than 34 years. An independent study issued \nmore than 12 years ago confirms that the grievance of the landless \ncommunities is legitimate. Legislation has been introduced in the past \nsessions of Congress to remedy this injustice. Hearings have been held \nand reports written. Yet legislation to right the wrong has inevitably \nstalled out. This December marks the 38th anniversary of Congress' \npromise to the Native peoples of Alaska, the promise of a rapid and \ncertain settlement. And still the landless communities of Southeast \nAlaska are landless.\n  I am convinced that this cause is just, it is right, and it is about \ntime that the Native peoples of the five landless communities receive \nwhat has been denied them for so long.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would enable the Native \npeoples of the five ``landless communities'' to organize five ``urban \ncorporations,'' one for each unrecognized community. These newly formed \ncorporations would be offered and could accept the surface estate to \n23,040 acres of land--one township as granted all other village \ncorporations. Sealaska Corporation, the regional Alaska Native \nCorporation for Southeast Alaska, would receive title to the subsurface \nestate to the designated lands. The urban corporations would each \nreceive a lump sum payment to be used as start-up funds for the newly \nestablished corporation. The Secretary of the Interior would determine \nother appropriate compensation to redress the inequities faced by the \nunrecognized communities.\n  It is long past time that we return to the Native peoples of \nSoutheast Alaska a small slice of the aboriginal lands that were once \ntheirs alone. It is time that we open our minds and open our hearts to \ncorrecting this injustice that has gone on far too long and finally \ngive the Native peoples of Southeast Alaska the rapid and certain \nsettlement for which they have been waiting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 785. A bill to establish a grant program to encourage retooling of \nentities in the timber industry in Alaska, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a bill that I \nhave introduced, the Southeast Alaska Timber Industry Retooling and \nRestructuring Act, which is intended to stimulate employment in \nSoutheast Alaska, by helping firms that have focused on the region's \ntimber industry to modernize or branch out into new industries.\n  In 1954, the US Department of Agriculture encouraged the development \nof a sawmill and pulp mill timber industry in the Tongass National \nForest in Southeast Alaska, which at 16.98 million acres is the largest \nnational forest in America. From the startup of the pulp mills in \nKetchikan and in Sitka in 1961 to passage of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act in 1980, the Tongass was producing \nabout 600 million board feet of timber a year, generating 3,500 direct \nand 2,500 indirect jobs and providing the largest number of year-round \njobs in the region.\n  But following passage of ANILCA that created 14 wilderness areas \ncovering about 4.9 million acres and the follow up Tongass Timber \nReform Act of 1990 that placed another 727,762 acres into protected \nnon-roaded status and created another 12 wilderness areas containing \n300,000 acres, the timber harvest and thus timber industry-related \nemployment plummeted in the region--an area nearly the size of Maine. \nWhile the two pulp mills closed in the mid 1990's, sawmills have tried \nto survive on the then anticipated 268 mmbf of allowable timber \nharvest. But a litany of Federal forest policy changes from the \nClinton-era roadless policy, to changes in Forest Service sale and road \npolicies, to sale delays caused by litigation have resulted in harvest \nlevels falling to 28 million board feet from Federal lands and less \nthan 50 million from private lands in 2008. That harvest level is far \nbelow the 192 mmbf reached in 2006 and about half of the 144 mmbf of \n2007. Recent years have been drastically down from the 495 million \nboard feet harvested from all lands as recently as 1997.\n  Year round timber employment, according to U.S. Forest Service in \n2007, the last year of current full data, was 402 jobs, just 13 percent \nof the employment of a decade earlier. The impacts on the region's \neconomy have been clearly documented. According to a report by The \nMcDowell Group consultants, total timber-related payroll in 2007 hit \njust $17 million, compared to $300 million in 1990. Currently, \naccording to the State of Alaska, unemployment in December 2008 has \nreached 16.5 percent on Prince of Wales Island, the resource base for \ntraditional southern timber operations, and 24.6 percent in the Hoonah \nand Angoon area, the former resource base for central timber\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\noperations--three times the rising national average.\n  This bill is a measure that calls on the Federal Government to \nfinally acknowledge its role in the reduction of economic activity in \nthe region. By the act, the Government would on a one-time basis, allow \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants to allow existing timber \nfacilities to retool either to adopt new timber production practices \nthat can operate profitably on far smaller harvests or to convert \ntimber plants to totally new types of manufacturing/business \noperations, leaving timber-dependent work. Firms--sawmills, logging \ncompanies and road construction companies involved in timber work for \nat least a decade--that seek funding for ``retooling projects'' must \nsubmit business plans and demonstrate the likelihood of success. More \nimportantly they must commit to the ``extent practicable'' to continue \nto employ substantially the same number of employees for a \n``reasonable'' period after completion of a retooling project. To limit \nthe impact of the aid, grants may only go to businesses hat operated in \nthe Tongass for not less than 10 years prior to Jan. 1, 2009. The \nprogram sunsets within 2 years with the maximum authorization of aid \nbeing $40 million subject to appropriation.\n  The bill would allow companies that used to build Forest Service \ntimber roads, for example, to buy more appropriate equipment to bid on \nFederal highway work and water and sewer line work. It could help firms \nmove into sand and gravel operations. It could allow sawmills with \nwater access to be converted to marine repair facilities or into wood \ntreatment plants. And it might allow some mills to convert to higher \nvalue-added products requiring less raw materials, like door and window \nsash manufacturing.\n  The changes would ease environmental pressures on timber stands, \nwhile aiding the economy by helping to replace the former year-round \njobs in a region now nearly solely dependent on fishing and tourism \nincome, besides government-sector spending, for employment. In a region \nwhere non-government jobs are precious, it could stimulate job \nretention and help create new employment. At a time when Congress is \ncontemplating spending nearly $1 trillion to stimulate employment, this \nmeasure is a reasonable expenditure to help potentially transition \nemployees to 21st century jobs. The Federal Government was the leading \nadvocate for the establishment of a pulp-timber industry in the region \nfollowing World War II. It is more than fitting that it provide more \nassistance to help the region transition to a new era of reduced timber \nharvests--an era prompted by major environmental legislation that this \nCongress passed in 1980 and 1990 that is largely responsible for the \nsharp drop in timber harvests. I hope this body will give fair and \nswift consideration to this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 786. A bill to authorize a grant program to provide for expanded \naccess to mainstream financial institutions; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Improving \nAccess to Mainstream Financial Institutions Act of 2009. This bill \nprovides economic empowerment and educational opportunities for working \nfamilies by helping bank the unbanked and increasing access to \nfinancial literacy opportunities. It will also encourage the use of \nmainstream financial institutions for working families that need small \nloans. I thank my cosponsors, Senators Schumer, Inouye, and Lieberman.\n  Too many Americans lack basic financial literacy. Americans of all \nages and backgrounds face increasingly complex financial decisions as \nmembers of the nation's workforce, managers of their families' \nresources, and voting citizens. Many find these decisions confusing and \nfrustrating because they lack the tools necessary that would enable \nthem to make wise, personal choices about their finances.\n  Without a sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, \nindividuals will not be able to appropriately manage their finances, \neffectively evaluate credit opportunities, successfully invest for \nlong-term financial goals in an increasingly complex marketplace, or be \nable to cope with difficult financial situations. Unfortunately, today \ntoo many working families are struggling as they are confronted with \nincreases in energy and food costs or the loss of a job.\n  We must work toward improving education, consumer protections, and \nempowering individuals and families through economic and financial \nliteracy in order to build stronger families, businesses, and \ncommunities. The bill that I am introducing today would help to \neducate, empower and protect consumers.\n  Millions of working families do not have a bank or credit union \naccount. The unbanked rely on alternative financial service providers \nto obtain cash from checks, pay bills, and send remittances. Many of \nthe unbanked are low- and moderate-income families that can ill afford \nto have their earnings diminished by reliance on these high-cost and \noften predatory financial services. Among those families who make up \nthe bottom 20 percent of earners, one in four does not have a \ntransaction account according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of \nConsumer Finances. Indeed, the unbanked are often among the most \nvulnerable. More than 15 percent of families headed by a single parent \nare unbanked. The unbanked are unable to save securely to prepare for \nthe loss of a job, a family illness, a down payment on a first home, or \neducation expenses making it difficult for these individuals to better \ntheir finances.\n  My bill authorizes grants intended to help low- and moderate-income \nunbanked individuals establish bank or credit union accounts. Providing \naccess to a bank or credit union account can empower families with \ntremendous financial opportunities. An account at a bank or credit \nunion provides consumers with alternatives to rapid refund loans, check \ncashing services, and high cost remittances. In addition, bank and \ncredit union accounts provide access to saving and borrowing services.\n  Low- and moderate-income individuals are often challenged with a \nnumber of barriers that limit their ability to open and maintain \naccounts. Regular checking accounts may be too costly for some \nconsumers unable to maintain minimum balances or unable to afford \nmonthly fees. Poor credit histories may also hinder their ability to \nopen accounts. By providing Federal resources for product development, \nadministration, outreach, and financial education, banks and credit \nunions will be better able to reach out and bank the unbanked.\n  The second grant program authorized by my legislation provides \nconsumers with a lower cost, short term alternative to payday loans. \nMore needs to be done to encourage mainstream financial service \nproviders to develop affordable small loan products. My legislation \nwill help support the development of affordable credit products at bank \nand credit unions. Working families would be better off by going to \ntheir credit unions and banks, mainstream financial services providers, \nthan payday loan shops. Payday loans are cash loans repaid by \nborrowers' postdated checks or borrowers' authorizations to make \nelectronic debits against existing financial accounts. Payday loans \noften have triple digit interest rates that range from 390 percent to \n780 percent when expressed as an annual percentage rate. Loan flipping, \nwhich is a common practice, is the renewing of loans at maturity by \npaying additional fees without any principal reduction. Loan flipping \noften leads to instances where the fees paid for a payday loan well \nexceed the principal borrowed. This situation often creates a cycle of \ndebt that is hard to break.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. My legislation would encourage banks and credit \nunions to develop payday loan alternatives. Consumers who apply for \nthese loans would be provided with financial literacy and educational \nopportunities. Loans extended to consumers under the grant would be \nsubject to the annual percentage rate promulgated by the National \nCredit Union Administration's, Loan Interest Rates. Several credit \nunions have developed similar products.\n  I will work to enact this legislation so vital to empowering our \ncitizens. In our current, modern, complex economy, not having a bank or \ncredit union\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\naccount severely hinders the ability of families to improve their \nfinancial condition or help them navigate difficult financial \ncircumstances. Instead of borrowing money from payday lenders at \noutrageous fees, we need to encourage people to utilize their credit \nunions and banks for affordable small loans. Banks and credit unions \nhave the ability to make the lives of working families better by \nhelping them save,\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Carper, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Gillibrand, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 787. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the jurisdiction of the United States over waters of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrestore Clean Water Act protections for the same waters that were \ncovered by the Act prior to two recent divisive U.S. Supreme Court \ndecisions. I want to thank Senators Boxer, Cardin, Brown, Cantwell, \nCarper, Dodd, Durbin, Gillibrand, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, Leahy, \nLevin, Lieberman, Menendez, Merkley, Reed, Sanders, Schumer, Shaheen, \nStabenow, Whitehouse, and Wyden for joining me in introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  For 35 years, the American people have relied upon the Clean Water \nAct to protect and restore the health of the Nation's waters. The \nprimary goal of the act to make rivers, streams, wetlands, lakes, and \ncoastal waters safe for fishing, swimming and other recreation, \nsuitable for our drinking water supply and agricultural and industrial \nuses, and available for wildlife and fish habitat has broad public \nsupport not only as a worthy endeavor but also as a fundamental \nexpectation of Government providing for its citizens. It is our \nresponsibility to ensure that our freshwater resources are able to \nenhance human health, contribute to the economy, and help the \nenvironment.\n  We must remain committed to the Clean Water Act of 1972, and to that \nend, Congress must enact legislation. Every day that Congress fails to \nact, more and more rivers, streams, wetlands and other waters that have \nlong\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nbeen protected by the Clean Water Act are being stripped of their Clean \nWater Act protections and being polluted or destroyed altogether. \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, over 20,000 \ndeterminations have been made since the court decisions on whether \nspecific water bodies are covered by the act. Congress should not delay \naction until protections are stripped from more water bodies throughout \nthe country. The EPA estimates that the court decisions could \nultimately impact over half the stream miles and 20 percent of wetlands \nin the lower 48 States. Lost protections for these waters means the \ndrinking water sources for over 110 million Americans are in jeopardy \nof pollution.\n  The Clean Water Restoration Act must be enacted to restore historical \nprotections, using a surgical fix that reaffirms protections for the \nsame categories of waters identified in the over three-decade-old EPA \nregulatory definition of ``waters of the United States.''\n  This is a serious problem, demanding serious debate and action. If we \ndo not act, we will be allowing the Clean Water Act to be rolled back. \nThat would mean increased uncertainty, confusion, litigation, and \npermitting delays resulting from the court decisions and subsequent \nagency guidelines. It also would pose a very real threat to Clean Water \nAct protections for public water supplies, industrial and agriculture \nuses, fish and wildlife, and recreation.\n  I am pleased to lead the effort to protect the Clean Water Act in the \nSenate, and to have support from a range of interested parties, \nincluding former EPA Administrators from both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations; governors; attorneys general; State agencies; \nprofessional societies and associations; labor and business \nprofessionals and unions; farming organizations; and over 400 hunting, \nfishing, recreational, and conservation organizations.\n  In response to suggestions I received last Congress, I made several \nrevisions to the bill to make Congressional intent very clear.\n  My bill, the Clean Water Restoration Act, would continue to protect \nonly those waters historically protected by the Clean Water Act prior \nto the Supreme Court decisions. This is the crux of my bill, Section 4. \nIn 1972, Congress granted Clean Water Act protections to ``navigable \nwaters'' and broadly defined those as ``the waters of the United \nStates, including the territorial seas'', in stark contrast to the 1899 \nRivers and Harbors Act, which had only provided protections for the \ncommercially navigable waters. Since the 1970s, EPA and Corps \nregulations, 40 CFR 122.2 and 33 CFR 328.3, have properly established \nthe scope of ``waters of the United States'' to be protected, including \nall intrastate and interstate rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. My \nbill simply takes the longstanding, existing regulatory definition for \n``waters of the United States'' and puts it into law, in lieu of \ndefining ``navigable waters'' as ``waters of the United States,'' as \nthe Act does now. This surgical fix is necessary because the Supreme \nCourt used the word ``navigable'' to create a more narrow definition \nfor ``waters of the United States'' than the definition used for over \n30 years. The Court did not, however, limit protections more \ndrastically to only ``navigable-in-fact'' and continuously flowing \nwaters as some interests have called for. This might have been the law \nin 1899 when the Rivers and Harbors Act focused on commercial \nnavigation, but it would be entirely inappropriate for the modern day \nclean water protections provided by the Clean Water Act of 1972.\n  My bill also asserts appropriate constitutional authority to protect \nthe Nation's waters. Despite claims to the contrary, Congress has broad \nconstitutional authority, including under the Commerce Clause, Property \nClause, Treaty Clause, and Necessary and Proper Clause, to enact laws \nprotecting our nation's water quality. To prevent future courts from \nnarrowly applying Congress's constitutional authority, my bill includes \nthe phrase ``activities affecting those waters.''\n  My bill also maintains existing exemptions for farming, silviculture, \nranching, and other activities, and leaves unchanged the activities \nthat require a permit. The bill only ensures that the same types of \nwaters covered before the Supreme Court decisions continue to be \nprotected and does not affect the activities that require permits. In \nshort, if you have not needed a permit for the last thirty-five years \nfor an activity, you will not need one when this bill is enacted.\n  Importantly, in 1977, when the Act was modified, a significant \ncompromise was reached to exempt farming, silviculture, and forestry \nactivities from the Act. I stand by this understanding, and just to be \nsure, the Clean Water Restoration Act explicitly states that the Act's \nexisting exemptions are maintained. As stated in the Act and left \nunchanged by my bill, agricultural activities are largely exempt from \nthe Clean Water Act [the main permitting programs affecting agriculture \naddress point-source discharge, Section 402, not non-point, and the \ndredging and filling of waters, Section 404. The following agricultural \nactivities are exempt: normal farming activities (which casts a wide \nnet for plowing, cultivating, harvesting, conservation practices, \netc.), agriculture run-off/stormwater discharges, return flows from \nirrigation, maintenance and construction of farm roads, farm and stock \nponds, and irrigation ditches, and maintenance of drainage ditches. \nThere are additional EPA regulatory exemptions for prior converted \ncropland, and wastewater treatment systems, including treatment lagoons \nand ponds. Again, my bill does not affect these exemptions and the \nfindings make Congressional intent very clear in this regard.\n  In short, my bill will allow those waters always protected by the \nClean Water Act to continue to receive basic protections. I appreciate \nthe depth and breadth of support for reaffirming the Clean Water Act of \n1972 and importantly, rejecting efforts to roll back the law.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, If there is one environmental issue that \ndivides us more than unites us, it's water, especially in the West.\n  Farmers, ranchers, cities, towns, all compete for limited supplies. \nSalmon and other economically and culturally important fish depend on \nits flow. If it is not water quantity, then it is water quality that \nmakes what gets passed on to the next water user the source of \ncontention.\n  The Clean Water Act has been enormously successful at making water \nusers clean up the water that they use before it is discharged back \ninto lakes, rivers, and streams, and, before it's used by the next \nperson downstream. It has also helped ensure the survival of fish and \nwildlife.\n  Over the past 8 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has rendered two major \ndecisions that have restricted the scope of the Act. As it is now being \ninterpreted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Corps \nof Engineers, the Act no longer prevents the discharge of pollution or \nfill into many wetlands or intermittent streams, lakes and ponds. By \nsome estimates, more than half the streams in Oregon could be \nclassified as intermittent streams and no longer protected. Another \nestimate concludes that over one million Oregonians get their drinking \nwater from sources that would no longer be fully protected by the Clean \nWater Act. I think this is the wrong thing to do.\n  Last year, I cosponsored S. 1870--the Clean Water Restoration Act--\nlegislation which was intended to return the protections of the Clean \nWater Act to the way they were before these two Supreme Court decisions \noccurred. No more, and no less.\n  In my town hall meetings around Oregon, I have received questions and \ncomplaints about this legislation. The biggest concern that many people \nhad was that this new bill was actually going to expand the reach of \nthe Federal Government over water regulation in ways that would \nliterally threaten the ability of farmers to farm and ranchers to \nranch. People were also concerned that this legislation would not only \nregulate discharges into rivers and streams, but it would also regulate \nthe quantity of water they use.\n  I am no supporter of Federal water grabs. I would not have \ncosponsored this legislation in the last Congress if it would threaten \nOregon farmers' ability to farm or our ranchers' ability to ranch. I \nwould have opposed it.\n  Ranchers and farmers and forest owners know how to be stewards of the \nland they ranch and farm and manage because their livelihoods depend on \nit,\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nand if they are not careful about how they manage that land there will \nbe nothing to pass on to the next generation. The same is true for how \nwe must treat our rivers, streams and wetlands.\n  So over the past few months, my staff and I have worked with Senator \nFeingold, the primary sponsor of the bill, to clarify that intent of \nthis legislation is to simply restore the interpretation of the Clean \nWater Act to what it had been before these Supreme Court decisions. No \nmore, and no less.\n  Earlier this year, in response to my concerns about how the bill \nwould impact rural Oregon, Senator Feingold reiterated in a letter to \nme his intent that the Clean Water Restoration Act not expand the scope \nof the law. Sen. Feingold also revised the text of the bill in a way \nthat I believe makes it even clearer that the goal is not to expand the \nscope of the Clean Water Act beyond what it was in 2001 before the \nSupreme Court decisions.\n  First of all, the bill again includes a savings clause that clearly \ncontinues the existing exemption for irrigation return flows from Clean \nWater Act regulation. It continues the exemption for dredged or fill \nmaterials from normal farming, silviculture and ranching activities. It \ncontinues the exemption for construction and maintenance of farm or \nstock ponds or irrigation ditches and drainage ditches. It continues \nthe exemption for construction and maintenance of farm roads or forest \nroads.\n  Second, the bill now contains a much more detailed set of findings \nthat make it absolutely clear that the intent of Congress with \nenactment of the bill is to restore the regulatory system for the Clean \nWater Act to what it was before these two Supreme Court decisions. \nThese findings also make it clear that the bill is not regulating \nground water, only surface water, just as the Clean Water Act has \nalways done. The findings make it clear that exclusions for prior \nconverted cropland and manmade impoundments remain in place. They make \nit clear that the intent is to regulate water quality, not quantity or \nownership.\n  If more changes are needed to ensure that the bill does what Sen. \nFeingold and I say it does, than I am certainly open to making more \nchanges to make sure the Senate gets this crucial issue right.\n  Some people do not like the pre-2001 Clean Water Act regulatory \nsystem. Some believe that the Supreme Court did the right thing by \nremoving many wetlands and intermittent streams and lakes from the \nprotections of the Clean Water Act. I disagree. I think those \nprotections are needed to protect our water supplies and our \nenvironment and wildlife habitat. Farmers and ranchers need those \nprotections for their livelihoods. But I want to be absolutely clear, \nthat I will not support expanding Federal authority in this area beyond \nwhat it was before 2001.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your commitment to \n     reinstating longstanding Clean Water Act protections, which \n     have been unquestionably reduced and blurred by recent \n     Supreme Court decisions. I appreciate you contacting me on \n     behalf of your constituents with some important questions \n     about the intent and effect of my bill, the Clean Water \n     Restoration Act.\n       Like you, I am committed to restoring the scope of the \n     Clean Water Act of 1972 and strongly oppose efforts to roll \n     back the Act--which is happening and will continue to happen \n     until Congress acts. A recent investigation by the House \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure found that the \n     2006 Rapanos case and subsequent agency guidance are directly \n     responsible for ``a drastic deterioration of [the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's] Clean Water Act \n     enforcement program . . . hundreds of violations have not \n     been pursued.'' The investigation revealed that top EPA \n     officials warned that ``the difficulty in interpreting and \n     applying the Rapanos decision and the Inter-Agency guidance \n     has created a drain on [EPA] resources, caused delays and \n     uncertainty in compliance determinations. . . .'' According \n     to the EPA, over 50 percent of U.S. streams, 20 million acres \n     of wetlands, and the drinking water for 110 million Americans \n     remain in jeopardy of being polluted or destroyed as a result \n     of the Supreme Court decisions.\n       Since Congress is the only branch of government that can \n     reinstate protections and prevent a significant roll-back of \n     the Act. I introduced the Clean Water Restoration Act to do \n     just that, and only that.\n       The bill will not increase permitting and does not change \n     the requirements for what activities need a permit. The Clean \n     Water Restoration Act would only modify one term in the Act \n     and does not alter any other sections of law, including those \n     identifying what activities need a permit. Nevertheless, when \n     the bill was reintroduced in the 110th Congress, we added a \n     savings clause to make it explicitly clear that the \n     exemptions for agriculture, ranching, and forestry are \n     maintained. The Act was amended in 1977 to add these \n     permitting exemptions and my bill will not change those \n     exemptions, or existing exemptions in the regulations that do \n     not require permits for agricultural activities affecting \n     prior converted cropland or for wastewater treatment systems.\n       As you know, the Clean Water Act protects ``navigable \n     waters,'' which the Act broadly defines as ``waters of the \n     United States, including the territorial seas'' (though often \n     a source of confusion, the term ``navigable waters'' has a \n     very different meaning in the Clean Water Act than it does in \n     the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which extends only very \n     narrow protections to commercially navigable waters). \n     ``Navigable waters'' and ``waters of the United States'' are \n     broadly defined, for purposes of the Clean Water Act, in the \n     Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers' regulations to cover all waters necessary to \n     achieve the Act's water quality purposes. This includes such \n     so-called isolated wetlands as prairie potholes and playa \n     lakes, which have been jeopardized since the 2001 SWAIVCC \n     case, as well as intermittent streams, which remain \n     jeopardized by the 2006 Rapanos case and subsequent agency \n     guidance. In order to meet the intent and purpose of the \n     Clean Water Act of 1972, we must ensure all these waters \n     continue to be protected--which is why the Clean Water \n     Restoration Act defines ``waters of the United States'' using \n     the same list of waters.\n       In your letter, you asked about an exchange at a hearing on \n     the bill in 2008 where the former Administrator of the EPA, \n     Carol Browner, responded to a question about whether a \n     ``puddle'' is a ``wetland.'' Though the question was likely \n     intended in jest, there is a longstanding, scientific process \n     for determining and delineating a wetland. Professional \n     determinations are made, for purposes of Section 404 of the \n     Clean Water Act, using the Corps regulatory definition of a \n     wetland. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, \n     and similar areas (33 CFR 328.3(b)).\n       Lastly, the Clean Water Act does not regulate water \n     quantity, only water quality. Its purpose is to ``restore and \n     maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of \n     the nation's waters'' (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). I am pleased \n     to lead the effort to protect the Clean Water Act in the \n     Senate, and to have your support, as well as that of a range \n     of interested parties, including former EPA Administrators \n     from both Republican and Democratic administrations; \n     governors; attorneys general; state agencies; professional \n     societies and associations; labor and business professionals \n     and unions; farming organizations; and over 400 hunting. \n     fishing, recreational, and conservation organizations.\n       Thanks for your efforts to educate others about the \n     importance of this legislation and the true purpose of the \n     Clean Water Restoration Act. As always. I am committed to \n     working with you and others to restore historical protections \n     to the waters of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Russell D. Feingold.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Nelson, of Florida):\n  S. 788. A bill to prohibit unsolicited mobile text message spam; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Bill \nNelson, to introduce legislation that would curb a growing nuisance \nthat millions of wireless customers experience on a daily basis--\nunsolicited text messages or mobile spam.\n  Spam has long been loathed by email users around the world. It is for \ngood reason--percent of all email sent worldwide is considered spam, \nwhich means close to 200 billion spam messages are sent every day. The \nvast majority of the spam sent on the Internet is done so illegally \nthrough the use of botnets, which are ``networks'' of hijacked or \ncompromised computers. One botnet, Srizbi, which consists of more than \n450,000 compromised PCs is able to send on average more than 60 billion \nspam messages per day. Many of these spam messages include viruses, \nmalicious spyware, or are phishing attacks.\n  With more data functionality and improved user interfaces with \nwireless devices, it is expected that mobile spam will grow over the \nnext several years. Those viruses and malware that are so prevalent on \na user's computer could\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\nand most likely will show up on their cell phones through m-spam. So a \nvery significant threat to wireless users looms.\n  While the FCC and the FTC have adopted rules to prohibit sending \nunwanted commercial e-mail messages to wireless devices without prior \npermission, text messages are not covered by their rules so it is not \nhaving the desired effect of deterring distribution of mobile spam, let \nalone email spam. The m-SPAM Act would provide more government \nattention to this growing problem and makes modifications to existing \nlaw in order to improve efforts to restrain mobile spam--before it \nbecomes more than an annoyance.\n  More text and voice spam are steadily invading handsets. Wireless \nusers in the U.S. received more than 1.1 million spam text messages in \n2007, up 38 percent from 2006. Mobile spam not only clutters a wireless \nuser's inbox, but it also unduly increases the monthly wireless bill--\nwireless subscribers typically are charged for sending and receiving \ntext messages--sometimes as much as 20 cents per message.\n  Some telephone companies have been proactive in preventing spam--\nwireless carriers already block up to 200 million unsolicited text \nmessages per month, but many times the senders cannot be located and \nbrought to justice without Government help. In May 2007, Verizon \nWireless sued telemarketers that had inundated the company with more \nthan 12 million mobile spam messages. The carrier was able to block \nmost of them but the inundation still hit consumers with unwanted \ncharges and the carrier with a congested network. So more can be done \nto prevent this aggravating practice and relieve consumers of having to \nresolve these charges on their bills. Even the wireless industry \nrecently has urged government to do more to catch and prosecute \nspammers.\n  That is why I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join Senator \nBill Nelson and me in supporting this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Udall, \n        of New Mexico):\n  S. 790. A bill to improve access to health care services in rural, \nfrontier, and urban underserved areas in the United States by \naddressing the supply of health professionals and the distribution of \nhealth professionals to areas of need; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Robert Casey, \nHerb Kohl, and Tom Udall to introduce the Health Access and Health \nProfessions Supply Act of 2009.\n  Health care reform is a national priority--far too many Americans do \nnot have access to meaningful, affordable health insurance. But even if \nevery person in the U.S. had health insurance, we do not have a \ncohesive or coordinated strategy to address health workforce \nemergencies and shortages, and problems with reliable access to \nquality, affordable care. Over 20 percent of Americans are living in \nhealth professions shortage areas without access to adequate medical, \ndental, and mental and behavioral health services. This workforce \ndeficiency will worsen as the population ages and grows by an estimated \n25 million individuals per decade and, could be severely exacerbated by \nepidemics and disasters. It is estimated that without intervention, the \nUnited States will experience shortages of as many as 200,000 \nphysicians and one million nurses by 2020. It takes many years to \ncreate a pipeline of health professionals. I am introducing the Health \nAccess and Health Professions Supply Act of 2009 to coordinate our \nhealth workforce strategy, to build and maintain this pipeline, so that \nhealth and safety of every American is protected. The legislation is \nbased on the most recent recommendations developed by Council on \nGraduate Medical Education and other health workforce experts.\n  This legislation addresses these issues in an unprecedented and \ncomprehensive manner. It creates a Permanent National Health Workforce \nCommission to assure that the Federal investment in the education of \nhealth professionals is a public good that address the needs of the \nAmerican people. The Commission is tasked to design, revise, implement \nand evaluate programs, grants, and regulations related to the nation's \nhealth workforce.\n  The Health Access and Health Professions Supply Act of 2009 expands \nthe Medicare medical home demonstration project. This pilot program \nwould include 1,000 medical home primary care providers working in \ninterdisciplinary teams. These clinicians will provide the highest \nquality medical care using the best health information technology, and \npersonalized, coordinated, and accessible care.\n  But new models are not enough. We have allowed our primary care \neducational infrastructure to crumble. Without intervention, the \ndecline will likely continue, and access to care in underserved areas \nwill rapidly deteriorate. Family physicians represent 58 percent of the \nrural physician workforce, 70 percent of non-federal physicians in \nwhole-county health professional shortage areas, and 78 percent of \nprimary care physician full-time equivalents in the National Health \nService Corps. Yet, the number of graduates from medical school in the \nU.S. who choose to practice family medicine has plummeted 50 percent in \nless than 10 years. Currently, less than 5 percent of graduates from \nmedical school specialize in primary care. This is despite the fact \nthat one of the most significant measures of the effectiveness and \nefficiency of a healthcare system is the degree to which the population \nhas access to meaningful and coordinated primary care.\n  Experts tell us that the dearth of primary care providers may be \nattributed to many factors including low reimbursement levels and a \nlack of federal incentives to teaching institutions to promote primary \ncare. My legislation would allow the National Health Workforce \nCommission to analyze these issues and recommend solutions including \nchanges in Federal reimbursement systems. For example, this bill calls \nfor improved transparency and accountability for Federal dollars spent \nfor medical education through direct Graduate Medical Education, GME, \nand Indirect Medical Education, IME, and money paid in Disproportionate \nShare, DSH, support for safety net services provided under the Medicare \nand Medicaid programs.\n  This legislation also substantially increases funding for the \nNational Health Service Corps. This will help provide healthcare access \nto the areas of our country that are in most desperate need. Also, \nincluded are expanded loan forgiveness and grant programs to develop \nnew training programs in rural and other underserved communities to \nhelp us train health professionals in areas where they are needed.\n  The Health Access and Health Professions Supply Act of 2009 \nestablishes a U.S. Public Health Sciences Track to train physicians, \ndentists, nurses, physician assistants, mental and behavior health \nspecialists, pharmacists, and public health professionals emphasizing \nteam-based service, public health, epidemiology, and emergency \npreparedness and response in affiliated institutions. Students in this \nprogram are accepted as Commission Corps officers in the U.S. Public \nHealth Service and will receive tuition remission and a stipend with a \ntwo year service commitment for each year of school covered. This group \nwill form an elite cadre of healthcare professionals that can be \ndeployed when epidemics, natural or other disasters strike.\n  I am introducing the Health Access and Health Professions Supply Act \nof 2009 with the understanding that our health workforce shortfall \ncannot be solved using a piecemeal approach. We must address health \nworkforce issues in health care reform to guarantee access to quality \ncare for all Americans but we must also ensure that taxpayer dollars \nused to support health professions education are spent wisely.\n  This legislation has received widespread support and is endorsement \nby the: National Association of Community Health Centers, National \nRural Health Association, American Medical Students Association, Trust \nfor America's Health, American Psychological Association, American \nAssociation of Colleges of Pharmacy, American Academy of Physician \nAssistants, Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S. Public Health \nService, National Rural Recruitment and Retention Network, American \nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, New Mexico Health \nResources, New Mexico Medical Society, New Mexico Chapter of the \nAmerican College of Physicians, and the Santa Fe Project Access.\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in support of the \nHealth Access and Health Professions Supply Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings Related to Health Care Access in Rural, \n     Frontier, and Urban Underserved Areas of the United States.--\n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States does not have a cohesive or \n     coordinated approach to addressing health workforce shortages \n     and problems with reliable access to quality, affordable \n     health care.\n       (2) There are 50,000,000 citizens of the United States \n     living in areas that are designated under section \n     332(a)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act as health \n     professional shortage areas.\n       (3) The population of the United States will grow by \n     25,000,000 each decade.\n       (4) The number of individuals over 65 years of age in the \n     United States will double between 2000 and 2030, with such \n     individuals accounting for 20 percent of the total population \n     of the United States in 2030.\n       (5) Individuals over 65 years of age have twice as many \n     doctor visits as those individuals under 65 years of age, \n     resulting in an increase in the demand for physicians, \n     physician assistants, pharmacists behavioral and mental \n     health professionals, nurses, and dentists.\n       (6) The rates of chronic diseases (such as diabetes) are \n     increasing in the population of the United States.\n       (7) There are 47,000,000 citizens of the United States who \n     do not have health insurance, and over 130,000,000 \n     individuals within the United States who do not have dental \n     insurance. Those individuals who are uninsured have limited \n     access to health care.\n       (8) Academic health centers, Federal medical facilities, \n     and teaching hospitals provide a substantial percentage of \n     safety net services in the United States to uninsured and \n     underinsured populations and to those individuals who have 1 \n     or more chronic diseases. Such centers, facilities, and \n     teaching hospitals provide those safety net services while \n     concurrently providing for the training of health \n     professionals.\n       (9) The pipeline for the education of health \n     professionals--\n       (A) begins and often ends in urban areas;\n       (B) does not reliably include Federal support for \n     nonphysician training;\n       (C) does not incorporate modern training venues and \n     techniques, including community-based ambulatory sites; and\n       (D) discourages interdisciplinary, team, and care \n     coordination models as a result of restrictive regulations.\n       (10) Health reform must include measures to transform the \n     health delivery system to assure access, quality, and \n     efficiency by utilizing contemporary models and venues of \n     care.\n       (11) Reform of the health delivery system will require \n     modernization of the training of health professionals to \n     ensure that health professionals--\n       (A) practice in integrated teams in a variety of delivery \n     venues (including inpatient and ambulatory settings and long-\n     term care facilities) to utilize decision support and health \n     information systems;\n       (B) deliver patient-centered care;\n       (C) practice evidence-based health care;\n       (D) learn performance-based compensation systems, \n     comparative effectiveness, and costs of care across the \n     spectrum; and\n       (E) deliver culturally appropriate, personalized care.\n       (b) Findings Related to Access to Oral Health.--Congress \n     finds the following:\n       (1) Dental care is the number 1 unmet health care need in \n     children, and is 1 of the top 5 unmet health care needs in \n     adults.\n       (2) Over 130,000,000 citizens of the United States are \n     without dental insurance.\n       (3) Over 45,000,000 citizens of the United States live in \n     areas that are designated under section 332(a)(1)(A) of the \n     Public Health Service Act as dental health professional \n     shortage areas.\n       (4) Rural counties have less than half the number of \n     dentists per capita compared to large metropolitan areas (29 \n     versus 62 for population of 100,000).\n       (5) In 2006, over 9,000 dentists were needed in such dental \n     health professional shortage areas.\n       (6) Between 27 and 29 percent of children and adults in the \n     United States have untreated cavities.\n       (7) The number of dental school graduates in the United \n     States decreased by 20 percent between 1982 and 2003 and the \n     average age of practicing dentists in the United States is \n     49.\n       (8) There were over 400 dental faculty vacancies in the \n     school year beginning in 2006.\n       (9) In 2007, the average debt of a dental student at \n     graduation was $172,627.\n       (c) Findings Related to Physician Shortages, Education, and \n     Distribution.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) By 2020, physician shortages are forecasted to be in \n     the range of 55,000 to 200,000.\n       (2) Although 21 percent of the population of the United \n     States lives in rural areas, only 10 percent of physicians \n     work in rural areas and, for every 1 physician who goes into \n     practice in regions with a low supply of physicians, 4 \n     physicians go into practice in regions with a high supply of \n     physicians.\n       (3) According to a 2004 report by Green et al. for the \n     Robert Graham Center of the American Academy of Family \n     Physicians, the number of applicants from rural areas \n     accepted to medical school has decreased by 40 percent in the \n     last 20 years while the number of such applications has \n     remained the same.\n       (4) In order to respond to forecasted shortages, experts \n     have recommended an increase between 15 and 30 percent in \n     class size at medical schools over the next 10 years.\n       (5) There are 55,000,000 citizens of the United States who \n     lack adequate access to primary health care because of \n     shortages of primary care providers in their communities.\n       (6) The number of graduates from medical school in the \n     United States who choose to practice family medicine has \n     plummeted 50 percent in less than 10 years. Without \n     congressional intervention, such decline will likely \n     continue, and access to care in underserved areas will \n     rapidly deteriorate. Family physicians represent 58 percent \n     of the rural physician workforce, 70 percent of non-Federal \n     physicians in whole-county health professional shortage \n     areas, and 78 percent of primary care physician full-time \n     equivalents in the National Health Service Corps.\n       (7) Current trends indicate that fewer resident trainees \n     from pediatric and internal medicine residencies pursue \n     generalist practice at graduation.\n       (8) Funding for medical education which is provided through \n     direct Graduate Medical Education (GME) and Indirect Medical \n     Education (IME) under the Medicare program is not transparent \n     or accountable, nor is it aligned to the types of health \n     professionals most needed or to the areas in which health \n     professionals are most needed.\n       (9) Physician supply varies 200 percent across regions and \n     there is no relationship between regional physician supply \n     and health needs.\n       (10) The Council on Graduate Medical Education's 18th \n     Report (issued in 2007), entitled ``New Paradigms for \n     Physician Training for Improving Access to Health Care'', and \n     19th Report (issued in 2007), entitled ``Enhancing \n     Flexibility in Graduate Medical Education'', each call for \n     changes to address the healthcare needs of the United States \n     by removing barriers to expanding and more appropriately \n     training the physician workforce.\n       (d) Findings Related to Nursing Shortages, Education, and \n     Distribution.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) By 2020, nursing shortages are forecast to be in the \n     range of 300,000 to 1,000,000 and the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics of the Department of Labor estimates that more \n     than 1,200,000 new and replacement registered nurses will be \n     needed by 2014.\n       (2) Nurse vacancy rates are currently 8 percent or greater \n     in hospitals and community health centers receiving \n     assistance under\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\n     section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, and for nursing \n     faculty positions.\n       (3) Surveys indicate that 40 percent of nurses in hospitals \n     are dissatisfied with their work and, of nurses who graduate \n     and go into nursing, 50 percent leave their first employer \n     within 2 years.\n       (4) Nursing baccalaureate and graduate programs rejected \n     more than 40,000 qualified nursing school applicants in 2006, \n     with faculty shortages identified by such programs as a major \n     reason for turning away qualified applicants.\n       (5) More than 70 percent of nursing schools cited faculty \n     shortages as the primary reason for not accepting all \n     qualified applicants into entry-level nursing programs.\n       (6) The nursing faculty workforce is aging and retiring \n     and, by 2019, approximately 75 percent of the nursing faculty \n     workforce is expected to retire.\n       (7) The average age of nurses in the United States is 49 \n     and the average age of an associate professor nurse faculty \n     member in the United States is 56.\n       (8) Geriatric patients receiving care from nurses trained \n     in geriatrics are less frequently readmitted to hospitals or \n     transferred from skilled nursing facilities and nursing \n     facilities to hospitals.\n       (e) Findings Related to Public Health Workforce \n     Shortages.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States has an estimated 50,000 fewer public \n     health workers than it did 20 years ago while the population \n     has grown by approximately 22 percent.\n       (2) Government public health departments are facing \n     significant workforce shortages that could be exacerbated \n     through retirements.\n       (3) Twenty percent of the average State health agency's \n     workforce will be eligible to retire within 3 years, and by \n     2012, over 50 percent of some State health agency workforces \n     will be eligible to retire.\n       (4) Approximately 20 percent of local health department \n     employees will be eligible for retirement by 2010.\n       (5) The average age of new hires in State health agencies \n     is 40.\n       (6) 4 out of 5 current public health workers have not had \n     formal training for their specific job functions.\n       (f) Findings Related to Physician Assistant Shortages.--\n     Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The purpose of the physician assistant profession is to \n     extend the ability of physicians to provide primary care \n     services, particularly in rural and other medically \n     underserved communities.\n       (2) Physician assistants always practice medicine as a team \n     with their supervising physicians, however, supervising \n     physicians need not be physically present when physician \n     assistants provide medical care.\n       (3) Physician assistants are legally regulated in all \n     States, the District of Columbia, and Guam. All States, the \n     District of Columbia, and Guam authorize physicians to \n     delegate prescriptive authority to physician assistants.\n       (4) In 2007, physician assistants made approximately \n     245,000,000 patient visits and prescribed or recommended \n     approximately 303,000,000 medications.\n       (5) The National Association of Community Health Centers, \n     the George Washington University, and the Robert Graham \n     Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care \n     found that while the number of patients who seek care at \n     community health centers has increased, the number of primary \n     care providers, including physician assistants, has not. The \n     report estimates a need for 15,500 primary health care \n     providers to provide care at community health centers.\n       (g) Findings Related to Mental Health Professional \n     Shortages.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that \n     26.2 percent of citizens of the United States ages 18 and \n     older suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder. \n     Approximately 20 percent of children in the United States \n     have diagnosable mental disorders with at least mild \n     functional impairment.\n       (2) The Health Resources and Services Administration \n     reports that there are 3,059 mental health professional \n     shortage areas within the United States with 77,000,000 \n     people living in those areas. More than 5,000 additional \n     mental health professionals are needed to meet demand.\n       (3) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, minority representation is lacking in the mental \n     health workforce. Although 12 percent of the population of \n     the United States is African-American, only 2 percent of \n     psychologists, 2 percent of psychiatrists, and 4 percent of \n     social workers are African-American. Moreover, there are only \n     29 mental health professionals who are Hispanic for every \n     100,000 individuals who are Hispanic in the United States, \n     compared with 173 non-Hispanic White providers for every \n     100,000 individuals who are non-Hispanic White in the United \n     States.\n       (h) Findings Related to Health Professional Shortage \n     Areas.--\n       (1) In 2006, the National Health Service Corps had a total \n     of 4,200 vacant positions in health professional shortage \n     areas, but only 1,200 of those positions were funded. For \n     each National Health Service Corps award, there are 7 \n     applicants.\n       (2) Community health centers receiving assistance under \n     section 330 of the Public Health Service Act have expanded to \n     serve 16,000,000 individuals in over 1,000 sites. Such \n     community health centers have high vacancy rates for family \n     physicians (13 percent), obstetricians and gynecologists (21 \n     percent), dentists, nurses, and other health professionals.\n       (3) The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has \n     recommended that medical education and public health issues \n     be more closely aligned, especially in relation to \n     preparedness for natural disasters, pandemic, bioterrorism, \n     and other threats to public health.\n       (4) The education of health professionals must be more \n     closely aligned with health care needs in the United States, \n     with special attention to underserved populations and areas, \n     health disparities, the aging population, and individuals \n     with 1 or more chronic diseases.\n       (5) There is some duplication, and little coordination, \n     between the Council on Graduate Medical Education (related to \n     the physician workforce), the National Advisory Committee on \n     Nursing Programs (related to the nursing workforce), the \n     Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and \n     Dentistry, and other advisory committees and councils.\n       (6) The Association of Academic Health Centers calls for \n     making the health workforce of the United States a priority \n     domestic policy issue and creating a national health \n     workforce planning body that engages Federal, State, public, \n     and private stakeholders.\n\n             TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT\n\n     SEC. 101. PERMANENT NATIONAL HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established the \n     Permanent National Health Workforce Commission (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Duties.--\n       (1) Review of federal policies and annual reports.--\n       (A) Review.--The Commission shall review Federal policies \n     with respect to the training, financing, and distribution of \n     the health professional workforce, particularly with respect \n     to such workforce in rural, frontier, and urban underserved \n     areas, including the specific topics described in paragraph \n     (2). Such review shall include a comprehensive analysis and \n     reporting of--\n       (i) the most recent COHPPERDDUST Annual Report;\n       (ii) the number of medical students and residents, \n     physician assistant students, pharmacy students and \n     residents, behavioral and mental health students and \n     residents, dental students and residents, nursing students \n     and advance practice nursing trainees, and other health \n     professionals in need of training, the rates of payment for \n     such training; and the methodologies for funding such \n     training;\n       (iii) how to align payments for direct graduate medical \n     education costs under section 1886(h) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)) and payments for the indirect costs \n     of medical education under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(B)) with other \n     Federal and State subsidies and payments for health \n     professions education with desired outcomes for the health \n     professional workforce;\n       (iv) whether Federal medical facilities should be permitted \n     to train health professionals with support paid directly by \n     the entity sponsoring the health professional;\n       (v) whether the establishment of transparent, accountable \n     Federal payment policies for training health professionals \n     would ensure that the types of health professionals trained \n     and the distribution of such health professionals would meet \n     the health care needs of the population of the United States;\n       (vi) the feasibility of establishing a National Health \n     Professions Education Trust Fund to ensure an open and fair \n     system of Federal, State, and private support for providing \n     education for health professionals; and\n       (vii) any other issues related to such Federal policies as \n     the Commission determines appropriate.\n       (B) COHPPERDDUST annual reports.--Not later than each of \n     January 1 of each year (beginning with 2012) the Commission \n     shall submit to the Secretary and to Congress a report \n     containing--\n       (i) the results of the review conducted under subparagraph \n     (A); and\n       (ii) recommendations--\n\n       (I) with respect to the Health Professions Pipeline, \n     Education, Research, Diversity & Distribution to Underserved \n     Areas Utilizing Service/Training Models; and\n       (II) for such legislation or administrative action, \n     including regulations, as the Commission determines \n     appropriate.\n\n       (2) Specific topics described.--\n       (A) Payments for health professions education.--\n     Specifically, the Commission shall review, with respect to \n     the training, financing, and distribution of the health \n     professional workforce, the following:\n       (i) The regular update, revision, and standardization of \n     hospital-specific and sponsoring institution-specific base-\n     period per resident amounts and cost reporting periods for \n     payments for direct graduate medical education costs under \n     section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(h)) and payments for the indirect costs of medical \n     education under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(B)).\n       (ii) The feasibility of the Secretary, subject to review by \n     the Commission, granting a waiver under the Medicare program, \n     such as\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\n     the waiver granted to the Utah Medical Education Commission, \n     which would allow States flexibility to utilize funding under \n     titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI of the Social Security Act for \n     direct graduate medical education and indirect graduate \n     medical education to support coordinated and comprehensive \n     health workforce training innovations.\n       (iii) Replacement of the current methodology for making \n     payments for such direct graduate medical education costs and \n     such indirect costs of medical education with a workforce \n     adjustment payment, based on a Sustainable Growth Rate \n     formula or a prospective payment system, under which--\n\n       (I) payments would be made directly to the sponsoring \n     institution where such education is provided; and\n       (II) payments would be separated to reflect the costs to \n     the professional and facility components of such education.\n\n       (iv) The establishment of standards for the financing of \n     education for health professionals who are not physicians.\n       (v) The expansion of the definition, for purposes of making \n     payments for health professions education (including such \n     direct graduate medical education costs and such indirect \n     costs of medical education), of the term ``sponsoring \n     institution'', which traditionally has been a teaching \n     hospital or medical school, to include nonteaching hospital-\n     based entities (such as managed care organizations and public \n     and private healthcare consortia) that are capable of \n     assembling all of the resources necessary for effectively \n     providing the training and education required to address \n     healthcare access, quality, and costs and to meet workforce \n     needs.\n       (vi) The provision of health professions education by \n     nonteaching hospital-based entities (including rural health \n     clinics (as defined in subsection (aa)(2) of section 1861 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x)), community health \n     centers (as defined in section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b)), and Federally qualified health \n     centers (as defined in subsection (aa)(4) of such section \n     1861) that are not sponsoring institutions (as defined under \n     clause (v)) as affiliates of the sponsoring institution for \n     purposes of providing more limited, but highly valuable \n     clinical training.\n       (vii) The establishment of incentives to promote \n     interdisciplinary, team-based, and care coordination-based \n     education of health professionals, including incentives to \n     encourage the development of health information technology \n     (such as a repository of consumer health status information \n     in computer processable form) which can be used for \n     diagnosis, management, and treatment and includes price and \n     cost information.\n       (viii) Adjustment to the Medicare caps on graduate medical \n     education positions to increase the number of primary care \n     residents, general dentistry residents, geriatric fellowship \n     trainees, and other health professionals trained in Federal \n     medical facilities.\n       (ix) The development of pay-for-performance methodologies \n     for payments for health professions education (including such \n     direct graduate medical education costs, payments for such \n     indirect costs of medical education, and disproportionate \n     share payments under section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(F))) to--\n\n       (I) increase payments to sponsoring institutions and the \n     affiliates of such institutions that achieve desired \n     outcomes;

Such payment would, as the Secretary \n     determines appropriate, in consultation with the Commission, \n     replace or supplement the provisions under clause (iii).\n       (B) Data collection and review.--Specifically, the \n     Commission shall review, with respect to the adequacy, \n     supply, and distribution of undergraduate and graduate \n     education programs for health professionals, the following:\n       (i) Available data on the adequacy, supply, and \n     distribution of such education programs for physicians, \n     physician assistants, nurses, dentists, psychologists, \n     pharmacists, behavioral and mental health professionals (as \n     defined in section 331(a)(3)(E)(i) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254d(a)(3)(E)(i)), public health \n     professionals, and other health professionals, including data \n     collected under the State Health Workforce Centers Program \n     established under section 102.\n       (ii) Processes for improving the collection of data on \n     health professionals, including the collection of more \n     consistent, independent, and comprehensive data from entities \n     (such as State licensure boards) to inform health professions \n     workforce issues. In conducting such review, the Commission \n     shall determine the costs of implementing such data \n     collection.\n       (3) Conduct of hearings.--\n       (A) In general.--The Commission shall conduct hearings on \n     health professions education to assess performance, identify \n     barriers, speed approval of innovative programs, improve \n     flexibility, and reduce bureaucratic obstacles balancing \n     hospital training while emphasizing sustained affiliation \n     agreements with community-based, interdisciplinary, team, and \n     care management methodologies and education designed to \n     improve quality and efficiency of patient care across the \n     care delivery system.\n       (B) Testimony.--In conducting hearings under subparagraph \n     (A), the Commission shall solicit testimony from the \n     Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, \n     Residency Review Committees, and other appropriate \n     organizations that accredit education programs for health \n     professionals.\n       (C) Information from federal agencies.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission may secure directly from a \n     Federal agency such information as the Commission considers \n     necessary to carry out this section.\n       (ii) Provision of information.--The head of the agency \n     shall provide the information to the Commission at the \n     request of the Chairperson of the Commission.\n       (4) Reducing health professional isolation and building \n     community health professional training infrastructure.--\n       (A) Identification of programs.--The Commission shall \n     identify programs to reduce health professional isolation and \n     build community health professional training infrastructure \n     in rural, frontier, and urban underserved areas through \n     continuing education (including continuing education \n     utilizing information technology, such as telehealth and \n     health information technology), mentoring, and precepting \n     activities.\n       (B) Analysis.--The Commission shall examine--\n       (i) whether the establishment of regional or statewide \n     Health Advice Lines would reduce after-hours calls \n     responsibilities for overworked health professionals in \n     remote sites with few health professionals available to \n     fulfill such responsibilities; and\n       (ii) what support should be given to health professionals \n     fulfilling such responsibilities--\n\n       (I) in hospitals and emergency departments in areas \n     designated under section 332 of the Public Health Service Act \n     as health professional shortage areas;\n       (II) under practice relief programs that allow health \n     professionals practicing in such areas to have their practice \n     and calls covered when they are ill, pursuing continuing \n     education, or taking a vacation;\n       (III) with respect to field faculty development to become \n     supervisors, mentors, and preceptors for health professional \n     students and trainees;\n\n       (iii) support structures (such as Area Health Education \n     Centers) for health professionals; and\n       (iv) whether the establishment of Rural Health Education \n     Offices, based on the model of agricultural extension \n     offices, would--\n\n       (I) help build community health professional service and \n     training capacity; and\n       (II) spur local economic development.\n\n       (5) Development of guiding principles and accountability \n     standards.--The Commission shall develop guiding principles \n     and accountability standards for Federal, State, and private \n     sector education of health professionals. Such guidelines \n     shall be crafted to assure that the Federal investment in the \n     education of health professionals is a public good, \n     regardless of whether a portion of such education is funded \n     by other sources.\n       (6) Identification of state and regional health professions \n     education commissions.--The Commission shall identify State \n     and regional Health Professions Education Centers. The \n     Commission shall enter into agreements with such Centers \n     under which the Centers shall provide data and reports to the \n     Commission to provide a balanced and adequate assessment of \n     the entire Nation's healthcare workforce.\n       (c) Secretarial Responsibilities.--Not later than 18 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, \n     in consultation with the Commission, and through negotiated \n     rulemaking, promulgate regulations to address the matters \n     reviewed under clauses (i) through (vii) of subsection \n     (b)(1)(A), as the Secretary determines appropriate to address \n     access and health professional shortages and needs identified \n     by the Commission with respect to titles XVIII, XIX, and XXI \n     of the Social Security Act.\n       (d) Membership.--\n       (1) Number of appointment.--The Commission shall be \n     composed of 20 members appointed by the Comptroller General \n     of the United States.\n       (2) Qualifications.--The membership of the Commission shall \n     include representatives of--\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n       (A) dentists and dental hygienists who practice in urban \n     underserved and rural areas;\n       (B) primary care providers who practice in urban \n     underserved and rural areas;\n       (C) nurses and physician assistants who practice in urban \n     underserved and rural areas;\n       (D) psychologists and other behavioral and mental health \n     professionals (as defined in section 331(a)(3)(E)(i) of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254d(a)(3)(E)(i)) who \n     practice in urban underserved and rural areas;\n       (E) public health professionals;\n       (F) clinical pharmacists who practice in a Federal market \n     or are sole-community providers;\n       (G) national and specialty physician and nursing \n     organizations;\n       (H) schools of medicine, osteopathy, and nursing, \n     educational programs for public health professionals, \n     behavioral and mental health professionals (as so defined), \n     and physician assistants, public and private teaching \n     hospitals, and ambulatory health facilities, including \n     Federal medical facilities;\n       (I) health insurers;\n       (J) business;\n       (K) labor;

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance the social \nsecurity of the Nation by ensuring adequate public-private \ninfrastructure and to resolve to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, \nand prosecute elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Senator \nHerb Kohl, Senator Olympia Snowe and I will be introducing the Elder \nJustice Act. The Elder Justice Act we are introducing today was \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee during the last Congress. In \nfact, this legislation has been introduced consistently since the 107th \nCongress. Additionally, it has been reported unanimously by the Finance \nCommittee during the last three Congresses.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Blanche Lincoln, the other \nlead sponsor of the Elder Justice Act. Senator Lincoln's strong \ncommitment to reducing elder abuse has made a tremendous difference. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with her on this important legislation.\n  In addition, I want to acknowledge the other original cosponsors of \nthis bill, Senator Herb Kohl and Senator Olympia Snowe. Over the years, \nSenator Kohl has been strong supporter of this legislation and, as \nChairman of the Select Committee on Aging, his support has been greatly \nappreciated by me. Senator Snowe has been a strong supporter of the \nElder Justice Act for many years.\n  The Elder Justice Coalition, headed by Bob Blancato, also has been a \ngreat ally of the Elder Justice Act. The coalition, which has close to \n560 members, is dedicated to eliminating elder abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation in our country. Over the years, coalition members have \nworked hard to educate Congress about the Elder Justice Act.\n  I also must acknowledge the work of former Senator John Breaux on \nthis important legislation. Senator Breaux was the original sponsor of \nthe Elder Justice Act.\n  In fact, Senator Breaux and I first introduced this legislation in \nthe 107th Congress.\n  Even though Senator Breaux is no longer in the Senate, he has still \nfought for passage of this legislation and currently serves as the \nHonorary Chairman of the Elder Justice Coalition.\n  As far as the Elder Justice Act is concerned, one of the most \nsignificant provisions of this bill is the creation of an Elder Justice \nCoordinating Council and an Advisory Board on elder abuse, neglect and \nexploitation.\n  The Coordinating Council, which would be chaired by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, would be made up of Federal agency \nrepresentatives who would be responsible for overseeing programs \nrelated to elder abuse.\n  Advisory Board members would include citizens who have extensively \nstudied issues surrounding elder abuse.\n  Together, the Council and Advisory Board would be responsible for \ncoordinating public and private activities and programs related to \nelder abuse.\n  Today, that goal is unattainable because quite simply, the approach \nto addressing elder abuse is disjointed among Federal agencies.\n  Therefore, the major goal of the Elder Justice Act would be to \nencourage a comprehensive and coordinated response by these Federal \nagencies to elder abuse.\n  I also want to take a minute to address a concern that has been \nraised by some who believe that the Elder Justice Act is duplicative \nbecause federal programs already exist to address elder abuse.\n  I respectfully disagree with that assessment. In fact, last Congress, \nwe spent a lot of time with agency officials to address some of the \nconcerns raised about the bill. It is my hope that we will continue \nthose discussions this year.\n  That being said, I truly believe that our government needs to do more \nwhen it comes to elder abuse. As more and more baby boomers retire over \nthe next 3 decades, we can no longer ignore the reality that elder \nabuse is prevalent within our society and we must do something to \naddress it. Enacting the Elder Justice Act is the first step.\n  Senior citizens cannot wait any longer for this legislation to pass. \nGetting this bill signed into law continues to be one of my top \npriorities. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Elder \nJustice Act and support the passage of this legislation.\n  Our seniors deserve no less.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wish today to express my support for the \nElder Justice Act of 2009. As in previous years, I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor. I wish to thank my colleague, Senators Hatch, \nLincoln, and Snowe for their leadership to address the often-hidden \nscourge of elder abuse. For years, Congress has failed to take concrete \naction to address the consequences of elder abuse, and that must \nchange.\n  The Elder Justice Act takes several important steps to help protect \nour vulnerable elders. First, it boosts funding for the long-term care \nombudsman program, which is the chief source of advocacy for \nindividuals who live in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. \nThe bill would advance the understanding of how to prosecute and \naddress elder abuse by providing funds to focus on and develop the \nforensics of elder abuse. In addition, it elevates the importance of \nelder justice issues by creating a coordinating council of Federal \nagencies that will make policy recommendations and submit reports to \nCongress every 2 years. The legislation provides funding for adult \nprotective services programs and improves training and working \nconditions for long-term care professionals.\n  We must also act to prevent abuse of our elders whenever and wherever \npossible. The Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act, which I recently \nreintroduced with my colleague, Senator Collins, would do much to \nprevent physical, emotional and financial abuse by providing States \nwith the resources they need to significantly improve background check \nscreening processes for vulnerable populations, including frail elders \nand individuals with disabilities. We know from the results of a 3-year \npilot program that thousands of predators can be eliminated from the \nlong-term care workforce that serves elders simply by improving and \ntightening screening standards.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to support both the Elder Justice \nAct and the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act. Thousands of \nindividuals with a history of substantiated abuse or a criminal record \nare hired every year to work closely with exposed and defenseless \nseniors within our Nation's nursing homes and other long-term care \nfacilities. Because the current system of State-based background checks \nis haphazard, inconsistent, and full of gaping holes, predators can \nevade detection throughout the hiring process, securing jobs that allow \nthem to assault, abuse, and steal from defenseless elders.\n  I thank Senators Hatch, Lincoln, and Snowe for their commitment to \nthe cause of elder justice. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact the legislation we are introducing today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 796. A bill to modify the requirements applicable to locatable \nminerals on public domain land, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hardrock \nMining and Reclamation Act of 2009. This legislation would reform the \nantiquated Mining Law of 1872, a law that governs the mining of \nhardrock minerals, such as gold, silver, and copper, from our Federal \nlands.\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\n  When the Mining Law was enacted in 1872, in the aftermath of the \nCalifornia gold rush, Congress sought to encourage settlement of the \nWest. Congress did this by offering free minerals and land to those who \nwere willing to go West and mine. Congress put in place a system \nwhereby miners could enter the public lands and locate claims for \nvaluable mineral deposits, and mine the minerals with no further \npayment to the government. In the 1872 law, Congress also provided that \nthe Federal Government would patent, or transfer title in fee simple, \nto the mining claims on the public domain for $2.50 or $5.00 an acre.\n  In 1920, Congress enacted the Mineral Leasing Act, and removed oil, \ngas, coal, and certain other minerals from the operation of the Mining \nLaw. In so doing, Congress enacted a management regime that requires \nthe leasing of these minerals. In addition, Congress required payment \nof per-acre rentals and ad valorem royalties based on the value of \nproduction of the oil, gas and coal, providing a return to the public \nfor the production of publicly-owned resources.\n  However, as we all know, the Mining Law of 1872 continues to govern \nthe disposition of hardrock minerals from Federal lands. While Congress \nhas stepped in and prevented the patenting of lands through annual \nappropriations riders, patenting provisions allowing the transfer of \nmineralized Federal lands for $2.50 or $5.00 per acre are still on the \nbooks. In addition, to this day under the Mining Law, billions of \ndollars of hardrock minerals can be mined from Federal lands without \npayment of a royalty. General land management and environmental laws \napply, but there are no specific statutory provisions under the Mining \nLaw setting surface management or environmental standards.\n  Efforts to comprehensively reform the Mining Law have been ongoing \nliterally for decades, but results have thus far been elusive. Congress \ncame close to enacting comprehensive reform in 1994, and Congress has \nenacted moratoria on patent issuance and has imposed claim maintenance \nfees through the appropriations process. The House passed reform \nlegislation last Congress and several of us in the Senate had \ndiscussions regarding how we could address this issue.\n  There is a growing number of people saying that finally this Congress \nmay be the time to achieve this long-awaited reform. Chairman Rahall, a \nchampion of reform in the House of Representatives, has again \nintroduced mining reform legislation. The bill that I introduce today \ndiffers in many significant ways from the House legislation, and builds \non discussions in the Senate last Congress. My bill, like other reform \nproposals, reflects a view that the law needs to be amended to ensure \nthat the public gets a fair return for its resources, that \nenvironmental and land use requirements are modernized, and that \ncertainty is provided to the mining industry.\n\n  I note that my bill includes a range for both the royalty rate and \nthe reclamation fee which will be set by the Secretary through a \nrulemaking process. This ensures that the Secretary will have the \nbenefit of comments and information from interested parties and the \npublic in setting the royalty and fee. We must look comprehensively at \nthe subject of royalties and fees to ensure that we continue to \nmaintain a healthy domestic hardrock mining industry with the benefits \nthat the nation derives from that industry, including jobs and \nstrategic minerals. At the same time, we want to ensure that the public \ngets the fair return on these resources that the American people \ndeserve. I hope to receive additional input on this issue of royalties \nand fees during consideration of the bill.\n  Another part of this legislation warrants special attention--that is \nthe provisions relating to abandoned hardrock mine reclamation. While \nestimates vary, a recent survey of States indicated that there are as \nmany as 500,000 abandoned hardrock mine sites nationwide with most of \nthese in the West. These abandoned mines pose serious public health and \nsafety risks. They also degrade our environment and pose special \nthreats to our most precious resource: water.\n  As we discuss the size and shape of legislation to reform the 1872 \nlaw, there appears to be substantial support for enacting a robust \nhardrock abandoned mine land program. My legislation would enact a \nreclamation fee to fund this effort. In 1977, Congress enacted a coal \nAML program as part of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act \nto address the serious problem of abandoned coal mines. This program \nwas funded by a fee levied on coal production. We are overdue to enact \na similar program to deal with abandoned hardrock mines.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today reforms the Mining Law of \n1872 in important ways. The key provisions of this bill are outlined.\n  The bill eliminates patenting of Federal lands, but grandfathers \npatent applications filed and meeting all requirements by September 30, \n1994.\n  The bill makes modest increases in the annual claim maintenance fee, \nfrom $125 to $150, and claim location fee, from $30 to $50. The \nlegislation requires the mine operator to pay a fee in exchange for the \nuse of Federal land that is included within the mine permit area. The \nbill provides that fees collected are to be used for the administration \nof hardrock mining on Federal lands. Any excess funds are deposited \ninto the Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund.\n  The bill provides that the production of all locatable minerals is \nsubject to a royalty to be determined by the Secretary by regulation of \nnot less than 2 percent and not more than 5 percent of the value of \nproduction, not including reasonable transportation, beneficiation, and \nprocessing costs. The royalty may vary based on the particular mineral \nconcerned. No royalty will be collected from lands under permit that \nare producing in commercial quantities on the date of enactment. \nRoyalty revenues will be deposited into the Hardrock Minerals \nReclamation Fund.\n  The bill includes a provision for royalty reductions for all or part \nof a mining operation where the person conducting the mineral \nactivities shows by clear and convincing evidence that without the \nreduction, production would not occur.\n  The bill states that permits are required for all mineral activities \non Federal land except for ``casual use'' that ordinarily results in no \nor negligible disturbance. Mining permits are for a term of 30 years \nand so long thereafter as production occurs in commercial quantities. \nThe operator must provide evidence of approved financial assurances \nsufficient to ensure completion of reclamation if performed by the \nSecretary concerned.\n  Financial assurances attributable to the cost of water treatment will \nnot be released until the discharge has ceased for at least 5 years or \nthe operator has met all applicable water quality standards for at \nleast 5 years. The operator may be required to establish a trust fund \nor other long-term funding mechanism to provide financial assurances \nfor long-term treatment of water or other long-term post-mining \nmaintenance or monitoring requirements.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture must take any action necessary to \nprevent unnecessary or undue degradation in administering mineral \nactivities on National Forest System land. The bill directs the \nSecretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to jointly issue \nregulations.\n  The bill requires within 3 years a review of certain lands to \ndetermine whether they will be available for future mining claim \nlocation. The Governor of a state, Chairman of an Indian tribe, or \nappropriate local official may petition the Secretary to undertake a \nreview of an area.\n  The bill establishes a program for the reclamation of abandoned \nhardrock mines in 14 western states. Creates a Hardrock Minerals \nReclamation Fund comprised of hardrock royalties, fees, and donations. \nEach operator of a hardrock mining operation on Federal, state, tribal \nor private land, must pay a reclamation fee established by the \nSecretary of not less than 0.3 percent, and not more than 1.0 percent, \nof the value of the production of the hardrock minerals for deposit \ninto the Fund. The bill provides grant programs for all states for \nhardrock reclamation projects and for public entities and nonprofit \norganizations for collaborative restoration projects to improve fish \nand wildlife habitat affected by past hardrock mining.\n  Reform of the Mining Law of 1872 is a matter that has come before the \nCongress repeatedly and that we simply must address. I ask that my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            The Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2009\n\n       Eliminates Patenting--Eliminates the practice of patenting \n     Federal land (i.e., transferring title) while grandfathering \n     patent applications filed and meeting all requirements by \n     September 30, 1994.\n       Claim Maintenance and Location Fees--Increases the current \n     annual claim maintenance fee to $150 (up from $125 under \n     current law) which is paid in lieu of annual assessment work, \n     with an exception for claim holders with 10 or fewer claims. \n     Increases the current claim location fee to $50 per claim (up \n     from $30 under current law). Provides that fees collected are \n     to be used for the administration of hardrock mining on \n     Federal lands. Any excess is deposited into the Hardrock \n     Minerals Reclamation Fund. Provides for adjustment of the \n     fees to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.\n       Royalties--Production of all locatable minerals is subject \n     to a royalty to be determined by the Secretary by regulation \n     of not less than 2 percent and not more than 5 percent of the \n     value of production, not including reasonable transportation, \n     beneficiation, and processing costs. The royalty may vary \n     based on the particular mineral concerned. No royalty will be \n     collected from existing mines that are producing in \n     commercial quantities on the date of enactment. Royalty \n     revenues will be deposited into the Hardrock Minerals \n     Reclamation Fund. Provides for royalty reductions for all or \n     part of a mining operation where the person conducting the \n     mineral activities shows by clear and convincing evidence \n     that without the reduction, production would not occur. \n     Provides for enforcement for royalty and certain fee \n     collections. Provides for a look-back report on the impacts \n     of royalties and fees.\n       Permits--Permits are required for all mineral activities on \n     Federal land except for ``casual use'' that ordinarily \n     results in no or negligible disturbance. Mining permits are \n     for a term of 30 years and so long thereafter as production \n     occurs in commercial quantities.\n       Land Use Fees--With respect to new mines, requires the \n     operator to pay a land use fee as determined by the Secretary \n     by regulation equal to 4 times the claim maintenance fee \n     imposed for each 20 acres of Federal land that is included \n     within the mine permit area. Upon approval of the mining \n     permit and payment of the fee, the operator may use and \n     occupy the Federal land within the permit area, consistent \n     with the mining permit and all applicable law.\n       Financial Assurances--The operator must provide evidence of \n     approved financial assurances sufficient to ensure completion \n     of reclamation if performed by the Secretary concerned.\n       Water Reclamation--Financial assurances attributable to the \n     cost of water treatment will not be released until the \n     discharge has ceased for at least 5 years or the operator has \n     met all applicable water quality standards for at least 5 \n     years. The operator may be required to establish a trust fund \n     or other long-term funding mechanism to provide financial \n     assurances for long-term treatment of water or other long-\n     term post-mining maintenance or monitoring requirements.\n       Operation and Reclamation--Creates a uniform standard for \n     operation and reclamation on both BLM and Forest Service \n     lands by applying the ``unnecessary or undue degradation'' \n     standard currently applicable to BLM land to National Forest \n     System land. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and \n     Agriculture to jointly issue regulations.\n       Land Open to Location--Amends the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act to require within 3 years that local Federal \n     land managers review specified categories of lands for \n     withdrawal from operation of the Mining Law, subject to valid \n     existing rights. The categories to be reviewed are: \n     designated wilderness study areas and National Forest System \n     land identified as suitable for wilderness designation; areas \n     of critical environmental concern; Federal land in which \n     mineral activities pose a reasonable likelihood of \n     substantial adverse impacts on National Conservation System \n     units as defined in the bill; certain areas with potential \n     for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System as \n     specified; and areas identified in the set of inventoried \n     roadless area maps contained in the Forest Service Roadless \n     Areas Conservation, Final Environmental Impact Statement, \n     Volume 2, dated November 2000). Based on the review and \n     recommendation of the local Federal land manager, areas can \n     be removed from operation of the Mining Law, subject to valid \n     existing rights. The Governor of a state, head of an Indian \n     tribe, or appropriate local official may petition the \n     Secretary to direct the local Federal land manager to \n     undertake a review of an area to determine whether land \n     should be withdrawn, subject to valid existing rights.\n       Inspection and Monitoring--Requires the Secretary concerned \n     to conduct inspections at least once each quarter. All \n     operators must develop and maintain a monitoring and \n     evaluation system.\n       Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund--Provides for the \n     payment of royalties, fees, and donations into a Hardrock \n     Minerals Reclamation Fund to be administered by the Secretary \n     of the Interior through the Office of Surface Mining \n     Reclamation and Enforcement.\n       Use of the Fund--The Secretary may use amounts in the Fund \n     without further appropriation for the reclamation of land and \n     water (Federal, State, tribal and private) affected by past \n     hardrock mining and related activities in 14 western states \n     when there is no continuing reclamation responsibility of the \n     claim holder or operator, and for hardrock reclamation grant \n     programs nationwide as specified in the bill.\n       Allocation of the Fund--Provides for allocation of the \n     Fund: to states and tribes based on current hardrock \n     production and on the quantity of hardrock minerals \n     historically produced; to agencies for expenditure on Federal \n     land; for grants to states other than the 14 designated \n     western states for reclamation of abandoned hardrock mine \n     sites; for grants to public entities and nonprofit \n     organizations for collaborative restoration projects to \n     improve fish and wildlife habitat affected by past hardrock \n     mining; and for program administration.\n       Abandoned Mine Land Fee--Each operator of a hardrock \n     mineral mining operation on Federal, state, tribal or private \n     land, shall pay to the Secretary a reclamation fee \n     established by the Secretary by regulation of not less than \n     0.3 percent, and not more than 1.0 percent, of the value of \n     the production of the hardrock minerals mining operation for \n     each calendar year for deposit into the Fund.\n       Transition--If a plan of operations is approved or a notice \n     of operations is filed for mineral activities before the date \n     of enactment, mineral activities will be subject to the \n     approved plan of operations or the notice for 10 years after \n     the date of enactment. All fees apply starting on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, except that the land use fee applies \n     only to mining permits or modifications after the date of \n     enactment. No royalty is required on production from Federal \n     land that is subject to an operations permit on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and that produces valuable locatable \n     minerals in commercial quantities on the date of enactment.\n       Enforcement--Provides for enforcement, including civil \n     penalty authority for the Secretary.\n       Uncommon Varieties--Subject to valid existing rights, makes \n     minerals classified as ``common varieties with distinct and \n     special value'' subject to disposal under the Materials Act \n     of 1947.\n       Review of Uranium Development on Federal Land--Provides for \n     a National Academy of Sciences review of legal and related \n     requirements applicable to the development of uranium on \n     Federal lands.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Johnson, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tester, Mr. Begich, and \n        Mr. Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 797. A bill to amend the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act, the \nIndian Tribal Justice Act, the Indian Tribal Justice Technical and \nLegal Assistance Act of 2000, and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to improve the prosecution of, and response to, \ncrimes in Indian country, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tribal Law \nand Order Act of 2009.\n  Last Congress, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I \nchaired eight hearings on the criminal justice system as it relates to \nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native communities. Those hearings confirmed \nthat a longstanding and life threatening public safety crisis exists on \nmany of our Nation's American Indian reservations.\n  One of the primary causes for violent crime in Indian Country is the \nbroken system of justice. The current system limits local tribal \ngovernment authority to combat crime in their own communities, and \nrequires reservation residents to rely on Federal officials to \ninvestigate and prosecute violent crimes in district courts that are \noften hundreds of miles away from the reservation.\n  The United States created this system. In so doing, our Government \naccepted the responsibility to police Indian lands, and incurred a \nlegal obligation to provide for the public safety of tribal \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately, we are not meeting that obligation.\n  The following is a partial listing of Indian Country criminal justice \nstatistics. These statistics represent more than numbers. They \nrepresent the dark reality faced by hundreds of tribal communities on a \ndaily basis.\n  The violent crime rate in Indian country is nearly twice the national \naverage, and more than 20 times the national average on some \nreservations.\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\n  Thirty-four percent of Native women will be raped in their lifetimes; \nand 39 percent will be subject to domestic violence.\n  Fewer than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement officers patrol \nmore than 56,000,000 acres of Indian lands--less than \\1/2\\ of the law \nenforcement presence in comparable communities nationwide.\n  The lack of police presence has resulted in significant delays in \nresponding to victims' calls for assistance, which in turn adversely \naffects the collection of evidence needed to prosecute domestic \nviolence and sexual assaults.\n  In addition, Federal officials have seized business documents from \norganized crime operations citing the lack of police presence and \njurisdictional confusion as reasons for targeting Indian reservations \nfor the manufacture and distribution of drugs.\n  An Interior Department report found that 90 percent of existing \nBureau of Indian Affairs and tribal detention facilities must be \nreplaced. The lack of jail bed space has forced tribal courts to \nrelease a number of offenders.\n  Tribal communities rely solely on the U.S. to investigate and \nprosecute felony-level crimes occurring on the reservation. However, \nbetween 2004 and 2007, Federal prosecutors declined 62 percent of \nIndian country criminal cases, including 72 percent of child and adult \nsex crimes.\n  To address this crisis, I am introducing the Tribal Law and Order Act \nof 2009 with the support of my colleagues Committee Vice Chairman \nBarrasso, and Senators Baucus, Bingaman, Begich, Cantwell, Johnson, \nKyl, Lieberman, Murkowski, Tester, Thune, Udall, and Wyden.\n  This bill will take initial steps to mend this broken system by \narming tribal justice officials with the needed tools to protect their \ncommunities. Importantly, the bill would enable tribal courts to \nsentence offenders up to 3 years in prison for violations of tribal \nlaw, an increase from the current limit of 1 year. It also arms tribal \npolice with better access to national criminal databases, and improves \ntheir ability to makes arrests for reservation crimes.\n  In addition, the bill would provide for greater accountability on the \npart of Federal officials responsible for investigating and prosecuting \nreservation crimes. To increase coordination of prosecutions, the bill \nwould require U.S. Attorneys to file declination reports and maintain \ndata when refusing to pursue a case. Maintaining consistent data on \ndeclinations will enable Congress to direct funding where the \nadditional resources are needed. It would also require greater \nconsultation and coordination between federal law enforcement \nofficials, tribal leaders, and community members.\n  To address the epidemic of domestic violence, the bill would require \nFederal health and law enforcement officials to establish consistent \nsexual assault protocols. It would require officials to testify to aid \ntribal court prosecutions. The bill would also require Federal \nofficials to receive specialized training to properly interview victims \nof domestic and sexual violence, and improve evidence collection and \npreservation, which will help improve the prosecution of domestic \nviolence and sexual assaults in Federal and tribal courts.\n  Improving the system will ensure that Federal dollars appropriated to \nfight reservation crime will be used in a more efficient manner. To \nthat end, the bill also reauthorizes and amends several Federal \nprograms designed to supplement tribal justice systems to enable them \nto better combat crime locally. These programs would provide funding \nfor tribal courts, tribal police, Indian youth programs, and tribal \njails construction.\n  This bill was developed in consultation with tribal, Federal and \nState law enforcement officials, judges, prosecutors, public defenders, \nvictims, victims' advocates and many others.\n  I want to again thank the co-sponsors for their support. Many of the \nco-sponsors sit on the Indian Affairs Committee with me, and have \nrepeatedly heard from Federal and tribal officials about this \nlongstanding problem. The residents of Indian Country deserve our \ntimely consideration of this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has distinct legal, treaty, and trust \n     obligations to provide for the public safety of tribal \n     communities;\n       (2) several States have been delegated or have accepted \n     responsibility to provide for the public safety of tribal \n     communities within the borders of the States;\n       (3) Congress and the President have acknowledged that--\n       (A) tribal law enforcement officers are often the first \n     responders to crimes on Indian reservations; and\n       (B) tribal justice systems are ultimately the most \n     appropriate institutions for maintaining law and order in \n     tribal communities;\n       (4) less than 3,000 tribal and Federal law enforcement \n     officers patrol more than 56,000,000 acres of Indian country, \n     which reflects less than \\1/2\\ of the law enforcement \n     presence in comparable rural communities nationwide;\n       (5) on many Indian reservations, law enforcement officers \n     respond to distress or emergency calls without backup and \n     travel to remote locations without adequate radio \n     communication or access to national crime information \n     database systems;\n       (6) the majority of tribal detention facilities were \n     constructed decades before the date of enactment of this Act \n     and must be or will soon need to be replaced, creating a \n     multibillion-dollar backlog in facility needs;\n       (7) a number of Indian country offenders face no \n     consequences for minor crimes, and many such offenders are \n     released due to severe overcrowding in existing detention \n     facilities;\n       (8) tribal courts--\n       (A) are the primary arbiters of criminal and civil justice \n     for actions arising in Indian country; but\n       (B) have been historically underfunded;\n       (9) tribal courts have no criminal jurisdiction over non-\n     Indian persons, and the sentencing authority of tribal courts \n     is limited to sentences of not more than 1 year of \n     imprisonment for Indian offenders, forcing tribal communities \n     to rely solely on the Federal Government and certain State \n     governments for the prosecution of--\n       (A) misdemeanors committed by non-Indian persons; and\n       (B) all felony crimes in Indian country;\n       (10) a significant percentage of cases referred to Federal \n     agencies for prosecution of\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\n     crimes allegedly occurring in tribal communities are declined \n     to be prosecuted;\n       (11) the complicated jurisdictional scheme that exists in \n     Indian country--\n       (A) has a significant negative impact on the ability to \n     provide public safety to Indian communities; and\n       (B) has been increasingly exploited by criminals;\n       (12) the violent crime rate in Indian country is--\n       (A) nearly twice the national average; and\n       (B) more than 20 times the national average on some Indian \n     reservations;\n       (13)(A) domestic and sexual violence against Indian and \n     Alaska Native women has reached epidemic proportions;\n       (B) 34 percent of Indian and Alaska Native women will be \n     raped in their lifetimes; and\n       (C) 39 percent of Indian and Alaska Native women will be \n     subject to domestic violence;\n       (14) the lack of police presence and resources in Indian \n     country has resulted in significant delays in responding to \n     victims' calls for assistance, which adversely affects the \n     collection of evidence needed to prosecute crimes, \n     particularly crimes of domestic and sexual violence;\n       (15) alcohol and drug abuse plays a role in more than 80 \n     percent of crimes committed in tribal communities;\n       (16) the rate of methamphetamine addiction in tribal \n     communities is 3 times the national average;\n       (17) the Department of Justice has reported that drug \n     organizations have increasingly targeted Indian country to \n     produce and distribute methamphetamine, citing the limited \n     law enforcement presence and jurisdictional confusion as \n     reasons for the increased activity;\n       (18) tribal communities face significant increases in \n     instances of domestic violence, burglary, assault, and child \n     abuse as a direct result of increased methamphetamine use on \n     Indian reservations;\n       (19)(A) criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, \n     and responsibility for Indian country law enforcement is \n     shared among Federal, tribal, and State authorities; and\n       (B) that complexity requires a high degree of commitment \n     and cooperation from Federal and State officials that can be \n     difficult to establish;\n       (20) agreements for cooperation among certified tribal and \n     State law enforcement officers have proven to improve law \n     enforcement in tribal communities;\n       (21) consistent communication among tribal, Federal, and \n     State law enforcement agencies has proven to increase public \n     safety and justice in tribal and nearby communities; and\n       (22) crime data is a fundamental tool of law enforcement, \n     but for decades the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the \n     Department of Justice have not been able to coordinate or \n     consistently report crime and prosecution rates in tribal \n     communities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, State, \n     tribal, and local governments with respect to crimes \n     committed in tribal communities;\n       (2) to increase coordination and communication among \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies;\n       (3) to empower tribal governments with the authority, \n     resources, and information necessary to safely and \n     effectively provide for the safety of the public in tribal \n     communities;\n       (4) to reduce the prevalence of violent crime in tribal \n     communities and to combat violence against Indian and Alaska \n     Native women;\n       (5) to address and prevent drug trafficking and reduce \n     rates of alcohol and drug addiction in Indian country; and\n       (6) to increase and standardize the collection of criminal \n     data and the sharing of criminal history information among \n     Federal, State, and tribal officials responsible for \n     responding to and investigating crimes in tribal communities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Mr. Dorgan, \nin introducing the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2009. This bill \nrepresents a bipartisan effort and crucial step in addressing a serious \npublic safety crisis in many Indian communities throughout our Nation.\n  During the 110th Congress, the Committee on Indian Affairs held no \nless than seven hearings on the issue of law and order on Indian \nreservations. The committee found recurring themes of insufficient \nresources for law enforcement agencies, inadequate responses to \ncriminal activity, and ineffective communication and coordination.\n  Criminal elements are well aware of the conditions of near \nlawlessness in some reservation areas. With great regret, I point to \nthe Wind River Indian Reservation of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern \nArapaho peoples in my home state of Wyoming as an example. The Wind \nRiver Indian Reservation consists of approximately 2.2 million acres \nand has a tribal population of over 11,000.\n  During fiscal year 2008, the Wind River Indian Reservation had a \nviolent crime rate that was 3.58 times the national crime rate, \naccording to the crime reports published by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs within the Department of the Interior. Between 2007 and 2008, \nthe crime rate on the Wind River Indian Reservation escalated from 677 \nto 748 incidents per 100,000 inhabitants.\n  Yet despite these troubling statistics, the Wind River Indian \nReservation has only 9 law enforcement officers to cover all shifts. \nAccording to the Bureau of Indian Affairs' fiscal year 2008 crime \nreport, an additional 22 police officers would be necessary to meet the \nminimum safety needs of this community. This situation would never be \ntolerated in other communities. We must address the needs for public \nsafety, law enforcement and justice on Indian reservations head on.\n  Senator Dorgan and I have worked together to ensure that this bill \nwill assist in increasing the number of police officers on the ground. \nThrough this bill we are sending a strong message that Indian \nreservations will not be a haven for criminal activity, drug \ntrafficking, gangs, or abuse.\n  We have set important goals for this legislation. To achieve them, we \nare proposing some significant changes to the status quo. As we move \nforward, I intend to solicit more input from stakeholders. The bill \nwill inevitably require some modifications, and I look forward to that \nprocess. I consider the introduced legislation to be the beginning of a \ndialogue that will hopefully lead to refinement and improvement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, \n        Mr. Sanders, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 799. A bill to designate as wilderness certain Federal portions of \nthe red rock canyons of the Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin \nDeserts in the State of Utah for the benefit of present and future \ngenerations of people in the United States; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce America's Red \nRock Wilderness Act of 2009. This legislation continues our commitment \nto preserve natural resources in this country.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will designate as wilderness some \nof our nation's most remarkable, but currently unprotected public \nlands. Bureau of Land Management, BLM, lands in Utah harbor some of the \nlargest and most remarkable roadless desert areas anywhere in the \nworld. Included in the 9.4 million acres I seek to protect are well \nknown landscapes, such as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \nMonument, and lesser known areas just outside Zion National Park, \nCanyonlands National Park, and Arches National Park. Together this wild \nlandscape offers spectacular vistas of rare rock formations, canyons \nand desert lands, important archaeological sites, and habitat for rare \nplant and animal species.\n  I have visited many of the areas this act would designate as \nwilderness. I can tell you that the natural beauty of these landscapes \nis a compelling reason for Congress to grant these lands wilderness \nprotection. I have the honor of introducing legislation on the 20th \nanniversary of the year it was first introduced by my friend and former \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Wayne Owens. As a member of \nthe Utah delegation, Congressman Owens pioneered the Congressional \neffort to protect Utah's red rock wilderness. He did this with broad \npublic support, which still exists not only in Utah, but in all corners \nof Nation.\n  The wilderness designated in this bill was chosen based on more than \n20 years of meticulous research and surveying. Volunteers have taken \ninventories of thousands of square miles of BLM land in Utah to help \ndetermine which lands should be protected. These volunteers provided \nextensive documentation to ensure that these areas meet Federal \nwilderness criteria. The BLM also completed an inventory of \napproximately 7.5 million acres of the land that would be protected by \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act and agreed that the vast majority \nqualify for wilderness designation.\n  For more than 20 years, Utah conservationists have been working to \nadd the last great blocks of undeveloped BLM-administered land in Utah \nto the National Wilderness Preservation System. Together, we celebrate \nthe recent passage of a national public lands bill that protects over \n180,000 acres of wilderness in Washington County, UT, for future \ngenerations. The more than 9 million acres of lands that would be \nprotected by this legislation surround eleven of Utah's national park, \nmonument and recreation areas. These proposed BLM wilderness areas \neasily equal their neighboring national parklands in scenic beauty, \nopportunities for recreation, and ecological importance. Yet, unlike \nthe parks, most of these scenic treasures lack any form of long-term \nprotection from commercial development, damaging off-road vehicle use, \nor oil and gas exploration.\n  Americans understand the need for wise stewardship of these wild \nlandscapes. This legislation represents a realistic balance between the \nneed to\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\nprotect our natural heritage and demand for energy. While wilderness \ndesignation has been portrayed as a barrier to energy independence, it \nis important to note that within the entire 9.4 million acres of \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act the amount of ``technically \nrecoverable'' undiscovered natural gas and oil resources amounts to \nless than four days of oil and four weeks of natural gas at current \nconsumption levels. In fact, protecting these lands benefits local \neconomies because of the recreational opportunities they provide.\n  Unfortunately, scientists have already begun to see the impacts of \nglobal warming on public lands throughout the West. Hotter and drier \nconditions, larger wildfires, shrinking water resources, the spread of \ninvasive species, soil erosion, and dust storms are all expected to \nincrease over the next century. These threats make the need to protect \nthe remaining undisturbed landscapes and wildlife habitats in Utah's \nred rock wilderness even more urgent.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is a lasting gift to the American \npublic. By protecting this serene yet wild land we are giving future \ngenerations the opportunity to enjoy the same untrammeled landscape \nthat so many now cherish.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues who are original cosponsors of \nthis measure. Origin cosponsors are Senators Boxer, Cantwell, Cardin, \nFeingold, Harkin, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Leahy, Lieberman, \nMenendez, Reed, Sanders, Stabenow, and Whitehouse. Additionally, I \nwould like to thank the Utah Wilderness Coalition, which includes The \nWilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Earthjustice, and the Wasatch Mountain Club; the Southern Utah \nWilderness Alliance; and all of the other national, regional and local, \nhard-working groups who, for years, have championed this legislation.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated:\n\n       The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources \n     as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \n     increased and not impaired in value.\n\n  Enactment of this legislation will help us realize Roosevelt's \nvision. To protect these precious resources in Utah for future \ngenerations, I urge my colleagues to support America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to again join with the \nSenior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to designate areas of pristine Federal lands in Utah as \nwilderness.\n  I support this legislation, for a few reasons, but most of all \nbecause I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know the \nmarvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, lands of Southern Utah.\n  I had an opportunity to travel twice to Utah and view firsthand some \nof the lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator \nDurbin's bill. I was able to view most of the proposed wilderness areas \nfrom the air, and was able to enhance my understanding through hikes \noutside of the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench wilderness \nunit contained in this proposal and inside the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek Falls. I also viewed \nthe lands proposed for designation in this bill from a river trip down \nthe Colorado River, and in the San Rafael Swell with members of the \nEmery County government.\n  Second, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the \nappropriate benchmark for the lands that should be protected in \nSouthern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers wilderness \nlegislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those \nlands which are deserving of wilderness protection. This bill \nencompasses all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has not always had the benefit of \nconsidering wilderness designations for all of the deserving lands in \nSouthern Utah. Last Congress, a provision was air-dropped into a bill \nconsidered by the Senate--without having been considered by the House \nor the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee--that designated \nless than 45 percent of the wilderness quality lands included in the \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act for Washington County, Utah. \nFurthermore, the public lands package omitted a wilderness unit, Dry \nCreek, that Senator Bennett has previously agreed to protect in his \nWashington County Growth and Conservation Act of 2008, S. 2834. During \nthe 104th Congress, I joined with the former Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Bradley, in opposing omnibus parks legislation that contained \nprovisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home State \nof Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of \nthe Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such \nprotection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded \ndesignated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me over the last few years, my constituents \nhave described these lands as places of solitude, special family \nmoments, and incredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the \nCapital Times, a paper in Madison, WI, wrote: ``Other remaining \nwilderness in the U.S. is at first daunting, but then endearing and \nalways a treasure for all Americans. The sensually sculpted slickrock \nof the Colorado Plateau and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin \ninclude some of the last of our country's wilderness, which is not \nfully protected. We must ask our elected officials to redress this \ncircumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect those \nnational lands within the boundaries of Utah. This wilderness is a \ntreasure we can lose only once or a legacy we can be forever proud to \nbestow to our children.''\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. The measure protects wild lands that really are not done \njustice by any description. In my trip I found widely varied and \ndistinct terrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff \nwalls, desert, canyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of \nthe Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great \nBasin. The lands also include mountain ranges in western Utah, and \nstark areas like the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. These \nregions appeal to all types of American outdoor interests from hiking \nand sightseeing to hunting.\n  Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe that \nWisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save Utah's lands as a \nsign of where the nation is headed with respect to its stewardship of \nnatural resources. Legislation to protect existing wilderness ensures \nthat future generations may have an experience on public lands equal to \nthat which is available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild \nlands by extending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will \npublicly codify that expectation and promise.\n  Finally, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nFederal Government for the people of the U.S. Thus, while they are \nphysically located in Utah, their preservation is important to the \ncitizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans. I am eager to work \nwith my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to protect these lands. I \ncommend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 800. A bill to require the President to update and modify the \nwebsite recovery.gov; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to enhance \nthe availability of information to the public concerning the programs \nfunded pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \nenacted in February. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Casey in \nintroducing this bill.\n  In a recent meeting that I had with constituents from the Maine \nMunicipal Association, several questions arose regarding application \ndeadlines and when funding will be distributed under the act. \nAdditionally, because there is no centralized location listing the \nopportunities available, some Mayors and First Selectmen had little \nidea of all the programs for which they may be eligible. Indeed, the \nofficials spoke of finding out about various programs either through \nmeetings or colleagues, and they noted that a regularly updated online \ndatabase of catalogued programs would be extremely useful.\n  This modest bill would require that the administration's recovery.gov \nwebsite be expanded so that States and localities can easily ascertain \nstimulus funds for which they may be eligible. Cities and towns could \nbenefit greatly if they could use Recovery.gov to quickly learn about \nfunding for which they may be eligible, application deadlines, and who \nto contact for more information.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncreate a program within the Department of Veterans Affairs for family \ncaregivers. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senator Burr, \nthe Ranking Member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Tester, \nSenator Burns, and Senator Rockefeller, former Chairman of the \nCommittee.\n  Some veterans returning from the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nas well as previous conflicts, suffer from disabilities that prevent \nthem from being fully independent. This is a sad fact of war. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is designed to provide for several \nimprovements in health care for veterans by supporting the family \nmembers who care for them.\n  The challenges faced by family caregivers are well known to us. We \nhave been working on this issue for nearly two years. Provisions that \nthen-Senator Clinton included in a health care omnibus bill reported by \nthe Committee last Congress would have provided for pilot programs to \nserve caregivers. We have since learned much more about the role family \nmembers play in caring for injured veterans, and the needs of family \ncaregivers. I think we are now beyond the scope of that original pilot \nprogram and I believe that a full-fledged permanent program is needed \nin VA.\n  First, it is well known that the involvement of family members in the \nprovision of health care dramatically improves speed and success of \nrecovery. This bill will give family members the resources needed to be \ninvolved in the care for their loved one. Second, many disabled \nveterans are not able to complete some tasks of daily living on their \nown, but do not require care in an institution. Allowing a veteran to \nremain in the home, while having family members meet the veteran's \nneeds, will vastly improve quality of life for the veteran.\n  Caregivers, who are members of a veteran's family, often put their \nlives on hold in order to provide care for the injured or disabled \nveteran at home. In some instances, these caregivers are unable to \nmaintain regular jobs because of the time consumed in providing \nsufficient care to the veteran. This has the compound effect of \ndecreasing household income, and possibly preventing the caregiver from \nkeeping health insurance. This legislation would help alleviate these \nproblems so as to allow the caregiver to focus entirely on caring for \nthe veteran.\n  This bill includes provisions for training and certifying family \ncaregivers or personal care attendants. It would provide for mental \nhealth counseling, health care eligibility, a living stipend, and other \ncritical services to support these caregivers. Additionally, this bill \nwould make improvements to the services VA provides to family members \nwho must travel to take the veteran to a VA facility to receive \ntreatment.\n  I look forward to working with all of our colleagues to pass this \nmuch needed legislation. I especially thank Senators Burr and \nRockefeller for cosponsoring this bill. I would also like to thank the \ndedicated members of the Wounded Warrior Project and Paralyzed Veterans \nof America for their tireless efforts in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Caregiver Program Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend subpart 2 of part A of title I of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish incentives \nfor States to extend the minimum length of the school year to 200 full \ndays by 2014, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the School Day \nFactor Act of 2009.\n  This bill would encourage States to provide students with the time \nthey need to master knowledge and skills they will need to succeed in \nthe 21st century, and to provide teachers with sufficient time to \ndeliver effective instruction.\n  Twenty-first century learners, and their teachers, are faced with \neducational demands that simply did not exist decades ago. Right now, \nour economy is struggling. But we have a plan to get it back on track \nby investing aggressively in scientific R, and the deployment of new \ntechnologies. If we are to maintain and increase our Nation's \ncompetitiveness in the global economy for decades to come, we must \nallow every child the opportunity for a quality 21st century education. \nToday's students need to master mathematics, science, and technology, \nlanguage arts and social studies, and they must also have opportunities \nto study foreign languages, the arts, and physical education. No one of \nthese subject areas should be sacrificed at the expense of another. But \nthat is the choices that teachers and students are faced with in \nschools across the United States. Teachers are being asked to cover \nmore material than before, without being given more time. Students are \nexpected to master more material than students of decades ago, without \nbeing given more time. Meanwhile, researchers have demonstrated that \nreducing instructional time hinders learning. As summarized by the \nNational Research Council, in its report on How People Learn, ``. . . \nsignificant learning takes major investments of time.''\n  How can a quality, well rounded education be achieved when the \naverage school year in this country includes only 180 days--less than \nhalf the number of days in a calendar year? Children today are spending \nonly 20 percent to 30 percent of their waking hours in school, even if \nthey have a record of perfect attendance. According to the American \nAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, by the time American \nstudents finish high school, they will have spent more time watching \ntelevision than in the classroom.\n  In 1991, Congress established the National Education Commission on \nTime and Learning, an independent advisory group charged with studying \nthe relationship between instructional time and student learning in \nAmerican schools. Members of the commission visited schools in the U.S. \nand abroad, and interviewed teachers, administrators, parents, and \nstudents. The Commission concluded that students and teachers in \nAmerican schools are ``prisoners of time,'' captives of an agrarian-\nbased school calendar that robs them of the opportunity for a quality \neducation. To quote from their report, ``we have been asking the \nimpossible of our students--that they learn as much as their foreign \npeers while spending only half as much time in core academic \nsubjects.'' I add that this means we have also been asking the \nimpossible of our teachers--to deliver effective instruction, without \nsufficient time. Clearly, our school calendars have not moved forward \nalong with our societal and technological advances.\n  The Commission's 1994 report was not the first to recommend \nlengthening the school year. In 1983, the Nation at Risk report \nrecommended increasing the school day to 7 hours per day, and the \nschool year to 200 to 220 days per year, as a means to strengthen our \nnation's grip on global competitiveness. Well, it has been 25 years \nsince that report, and I believe the time has come to give students and \nteachers the time they need for a quality education.\n  The School Day Factor Act will support efforts to expand the school \nyear, by coordinating school funding with the length of the school \nyear, and by encouraging schools to add five days to their calendar \neach year, for the next 4 years. This bill introduces a variable, the \n``School Day Factor,'' that will reflect the number of mandatory full \ndays included in a state's school year, and it may be adjusted to \nreflect any increases in instructional hours per day. This variable \nwill be added to existing Title I allocation formulas that determine \neducation grants to States.\n  The existing funding allocation formulas would be essentially \nunchanged for States whose school calendars meet a base level number of \ndays per school year. By raising the base level school year length by 5 \nschool days per year, over a 4 year period, the average school year \ncalendar would reach the target of 200 school days per year by 2014. \nInclusion of the School Day Factor will result in higher grants to \nstates with school years that exceed the base level number of school \ndays per year, and smaller grants to states with school years that fall \nbelow the base level.\n  I believe that schools are not only ready for this change, but that \nthey are setting the pace for this movement. Some States and school \ndistricts have\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nalready taken the initiative to expand their school year by 20 days per \nyear. In my own State of New Mexico, a State initiated pilot program to \nextend kindergarten by 20 to 25 days per year led to such positive \noutcomes that the program was recently extended to third grade. \nRequests to participate have increased, as more school districts \nunderstand the benefits afforded by expanding students' and teachers' \neducational time. The School Day Factor Act is an investment that will \nsupport the efforts to dramatically increase this participation rate \nsuch that the 200 day school year is the norm, not an expanded \ncalendar.\n  Clearly, more time alone is not sufficient to insure quality \nlearning. By including the School Day Factor Act in the reauthorization \nof ESEA, it will be paired with actions designed to enhance and support \nquality instruction delivered by highly qualified teachers. I hope that \nthis legislation will be included in the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Day Factor Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics the length of the average school year steadily \n     increased from 144 to 178 days between 1869 and 1949. In \n     2008, the average number of school days per year remains at \n     178.5.\n       (2) In 1983, a recommendation in the Nation at Risk report \n     was to increase students' instructional time by lengthening \n     the school day or the school year, as a means to strengthen \n     our Nation's grip on global competitiveness. Since then, no \n     systematic school day or school year increase has occurred.\n       (3) In 2008, 42 States mandate a school year of 180 or \n     fewer days per year, or the equivalent thereof. Across \n     States, the number of school days per year ranges from 173 to \n     182.\n       (4) Researchers have demonstrated that--\n       (A) when class material is covered in a streamlined, \n     shortened unit, students' conceptual mastery of the content \n     suffers; and\n       (B) significant learning requires investment of time.\n       (5) Research has demonstrated that all students are at risk \n     for losing educational gains during extended summer breaks in \n     the typical school calendar, particularly children from low \n     income households. The continued lack of out-of-school \n     learning opportunities contributes to a growing achievement \n     gap. Even more so than achievement gaps present at \n     kindergarten, differences in out-of-school learning \n     opportunities experienced by economically advantaged versus \n     disadvantaged youth contribute to the cumulative achievement \n     difference registered by 9th grade, which affects high school \n     placements, high school exit, and postsecondary school \n     attendance.\n       (6) Since 1991, over 300 expanded learning initiatives have \n     occurred, across 30 States, aimed primarily at schools with \n     high-poverty and high-minority student populations. Outcomes \n     of these initiatives include enhanced student achievement, \n     lower student and teacher absenteeism, and satisfaction of \n     parents, teachers, and students.\n       (7) Research demonstrates that the increased school time is \n     beneficial not only for students, but also for teachers. \n     Teachers gain planning time, more opportunities for \n     cooperative planning, professional development opportunities, \n     and additional time to individualize instruction. Teacher \n     employment increases from part-year to up to full year, \n     depending on the calendar conversion adopted.\n       (8) Regarding the costs of expanded learning initiatives, \n     the cost per hour of instruction decreases with the addition \n     of more learning time.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to ensure that all children \n     have sufficient time to achieve in school, that all children \n     have access to a high quality and well-rounded education, and \n     that teachers have sufficient time to deliver quality \n     instruction. Such purposes can be achieved by--\n       (1) encouraging States to expand the minimum number of days \n     in their school year, to 200 full days, by 2014, without \n     reducing the length of the school day;\n       (2) modifying the allocations under subpart 2 of part A of \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 6331 et seq.) regarding basic, concentration, \n     targeted, and education finance incentive grants, so that \n     each of the formulas used to determine allocations includes a \n     factor that reflects all of the following:\n       (A) the minimum number of school days in the State-mandated \n     school year length;\n       (B) the most recent increase in the number of school days \n     in the State-mandated academic year; and\n       (C) whether the number of school days in an academic year \n     meets, exceeds, or falls short of the base level school year \n     length described in the amendment made by this Act; and\n       (3) encouraging States to increase the length of the school \n     day.\n\n     SEC. 4.

School day factor.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 806. A bill to provide for the establishment, administration, and \nfunding of Federal Executive Boards, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Akaka to \nintroduce the Federal Executive Board Authorization Act of 2009 in \norder to provide for the establishment, administration and funding of \nFederal Executive Boards, FEBs.\n  As you may know, President Kennedy issued a ``Memorandum on the Need \nfor Greater Coordination of Regional and Field Activities of the \nGovernment'' in 1961 that noted that more than 90 percent of Federal \nemployees work outside of Washington, DC. President Kennedy wanted to \nstrengthen the coordination of their activities, so he directed ``the \nestablishment of a Board of Federal Executives'' to ``consider \nmanagement matters and interdepartmental cooperation and establish \nliaison with State and local government officials in their regions.'' \nThat Memorandum led to the creation of ten FEBs to ``increase the \neffectiveness and economy of Federal agencies.''\n  These FEBs proved their worth, because the number of FEBs across the \nNation has increased to 28 FEBs total in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, \nBuffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver, \nDetroit, Honolulu, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Minnesota, \nNewark, New Mexico, New Orleans, New York City, Oklahoma, Oregon, \nPhiladelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, \nSeattle, and South Florida. Those FEBs serve an important role in \ncoordinating Federal activities. For example, earlier this year a \nproactive FEB executive director sent an e-mail to her FEB colleagues \nin an effort to coordinate stimulus spending.\n  However, a 2007 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report, \n``Additional Steps Needed to Take Advantage of Federal Executive \nBoards' Ability to Contribute to Emergency Operations,'' noted that \nFEBs have no congressional charter and rely on voluntary contributions \nfrom their member agencies for funding. Because such voluntary \ncontributions result in financial uncertainty on the part of FEBs, GAO \nrecommended that the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, develop a \nproposal to address the uncertainty of funding sources for FEBs. Based \non that recommendation, the Federal Executive Board Authorization Act \nof 2009 provides for the establishment, administration and funding of \nFEBs.\n  The legislation is based in large part on Title 5 of the Code of \nFederal Regulations, where OPM has set forth regulations relating to \nthe authority, location, and membership of FEBs. Similar to those \nprovisions, this bill calls on the Director of OPM to determine where \nto establish FEBs and requires the Director to consult with agencies in \nmaking that determination. The bill also provides that FEBs shall \nconsist of senior officials from appropriate agencies in those areas. \nAlso similar to provisions in the Code of Federal Regulations, the bill \nauthorizes the Director of OPM to establish staffing policies for FEBs, \ndesignate an agency to staff each FEB, establish communications \npolicies, performance standards and accountability initiatives for \nFEBs, and administer FEB funding.\n  The Federal Executive Board Authorization Act of 2009 also requires \neach FEB to adopt bylaws or other rules for its internal governance, \nelect a chairman from among its members, provide a forum for the \nexchange of information, and develop coordinated approaches to the \ndevelopment and operation of programs that have common characteristics. \nUnder the bill, FEBs would be required to communicate management \ninitiatives and other concerns from Washington, DC to the field and \ndevelop relationships with State and local governments and private \nsector organizations to help coordinate emergency management and \nhomeland security matters.\n  To address GAO's concern about the uncertainty of FEB funding, the \nlegislation establishes a fund for FEB operations which would be \nadministered by OPM. The fund would consist of contributions from OPM \nfor administrative and oversight activities as well as contributions \nfrom each agency participating in FEBs for staffing and operations. \nEach agency's contribution would be determined by a formula established \nby the Director of OPM in consultation with agencies and the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and that formula must take into account each \nagency's number of employees in areas served by FEBs.\n  President Kennedy showed great foresight when he called for the \ncoordination of Federal agencies' activities in 1961, and FEBs have \ndone a good job since then in coordinating their work. These FEBs need \na congressional charter and a set source of funding, so I hope the \nSenate will act quickly to pass this legislation, which OPM and GAO \nwere consulted in drafting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 806\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Federal Executive Boards.''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend Senator \nVoinovich as we introduce the Federal Executive Board Authorization Act \nof 2009 to formalize Federal Executive Boards, FEBs, in the Executive \nBranch of the Federal Government.\n  President Kennedy issued a Directive in 1961 creating FEBs to allow \nthe heads of Federal agencies outside of Washington, DC to come \ntogether to address local issues in their Federal communities. There \nare now 28 Boards in 20 States, including Hawaii. Because they have \nnever been authorized in legislation, FEBs have no institutionalized \nstructure; each has its own operating structure. Some have an executive \ndirector, while some have no permanent staff at all. They also do not \nreceive specific appropriations. As a result, FEBs must cobble together \nvoluntary funding from participating agencies.\n  The Office of Personnel Management oversees the mission and \nactivities of FEBs. Part of FEBs' mission is to offer agencies outside \nof Washington, DC an opportunity to share information, collaborate to \naddress shared concerns, discuss management and administrative \nchallenges, and come together as a Federal community. Each Board sets \nits own specific priorities and activities based on local concerns and \nthe leadership in a given area.\n  Additionally, FEBs' mission is to play a critical support role in \ncoordinating emergency preparedness and response efforts for a given \narea. The Honolulu-Pacific Federal Executive Board regularly hosts and \nparticipates in preparedness exercises in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. \nWhen the Interstate 35 West Bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River \nin Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 1, 2007, the Executive Director of \nthe Minnesota FEB helped disseminate critical information to over 100 \nFederal agencies and coordinate with the State and local emergency \nresponse network. FEBs have shared information with each other to \nassist in preparing for large events as well. For example, the Boston \nFEB used their experience with the Democratic National Convention in \n2004 to help the Denver and Minnesota FEBs prepare for the National \nParty Conventions in 2008.\n  At a hearing of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia on \nSeptember 28, 2007, which I chaired, it was clear that FEBs lack of \nformal structure hinders their critical support role in emergency \npreparedness and response. At that hearing, the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, testified that FEBs have no clear role in \nnational emergency planning, no framework to operate, no accountability \nin performing their duties, and no funding to carry out their missions. \nAdditionally, FEB Executive Directors from around the country testified \nabout the frustrations of operating without stable funding or a clear \nstructure.\n  Since the hearing, FEBs have been included in FEMA's National \nResponse Framework, and OPM and FEMA have signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding, MOU, giving FEBs a formal role in emergency preparedness \nand response. The Federal Executive Board Authorization Act of 2009 \nwould implement other recommendations made by GAO and the \nrepresentatives from FEBs at the 2007 hearing. More specifically, the \nbill would formalize the role of Federal Executive Boards, which would \ninclude interagency collaboration and Federal agency emergency \npreparedness and response outside of Washington, DC; establish a \nprocess for establishing new FEBs; require OPM to establish performance \nstandards for\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\nFEBs; specify a funding formula, which OPM will administer, for FEBs \nbased on the number of employees in a Federal agency in a given area; \nand authorize staffing levels for each FEB to have at least an \nExecutive Director and one support staff member.\n  Eighty-five percent of the Federal workforce is employed outside of \nthe Washington, DC area. We spend billions of dollars preparing the \nNational Capital Region for emergencies, but we must focus more on \nFederal Government agency emergency preparedness and response outside \nof the Washington area. This legislation will address that pressing \nneed. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 808. A bill to amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to \nreauthorize the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senators \nBond, Akaka, Boxer, Collins, Durbin, Kerry, Klobuchar, Landrieu, \nLautenberg, Lieberman, Schumer, and Whitehouse, the Homeless Emergency \nAssistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act, HEARTH Act. \nRepresentative Gwen Moore is introducing a bipartisan companion bill \ntoday as well. This legislation would reauthorize and amend the housing \ntitles of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. \nSpecifically, our bill would consolidate and improve the homeless \nassistance programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nto better accomplish the goals of preventing and ending homelessness.\n  According to the Homelessness Research Institute at the National \nAlliance to End Homelessness, 2.5 to 3.5 million Americans experience \nhomelessness each year. On any one night, approximately 672,000 men, \nwomen, and children are without homes. While strides have been made to \nreduce homelessness over the last couple of years, the current economic \ndecline has halted such progress. We have already seen tent cities \nforming, shelters turning away people, and cities reporting increased \nnumbers of homeless people. As unemployment continues to rise, more and \nmore people cannot afford to pay their mortgages or rent, and \nnonprofits and local governments are unable to keep up.\n  As a result of the recession, 1.5 million additional Americans are \nlikely to experience homelessness over the next two years according to \nestimates by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. This means more \ntrauma for children and adults, more dislocation from schools and \ncommunities, and more of a drain on local community services.\n  Sadly, many of those who are homeless have served our country in \nuniform. Their numbers range between 150,000 and 200,000 on any given \nnight. Three times that many veterans are housed, but are struggling \nwith excessive rent burdens and an increased risk of homelessness. \nDifferent sources estimate that between 23 and 40 percent of homeless \nadults are veterans.\n  Statistics regarding the number of children who experience \nhomelessness are especially troubling. Each year, it is estimated that \nat least 1.35 million children experience homelessness. According to \nHUD's 3rd Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, on any given \nnight, 248,500 persons in families are homeless. Each year, over \n800,000 homeless children and youth are identified and enrolled in \npublic schools. However, this count does not include preschool \nchildren, and at least half of all homeless children are under the age \nof five. Whatever their age, we know that children who are homeless are \nin poorer health, have developmental delays, and suffer academically.\n  In addition, many of those who are homeless have a disability. \nAccording to the Homelessness Research Institute, about 23 percent of \nhomeless people were found to be ``chronically homeless,'' which \naccording to the current HUD definition means that they are homeless \nfor long periods of time or homeless repeatedly, and they have a \ndisability. For many of these individuals and families, housing alone, \nwithout some supportive services, may not be enough.\n  Finally, as rents have soared and affordable housing units have \ndisappeared from the market during the past several years, even more \nworking Americans have been left unable to afford housing. According to \nthe National Low Income Housing Coalition's most recent ``Out of \nReach'' report, nowhere in the country can a minimum wage earner afford \nto rent a one-bedroom home. Low income renters who live paycheck to \npaycheck are in precarious circumstances and sometimes must make tough \nchoices between paying rent and buying food, prescription drugs, or \nother necessities. If one unforeseen event occurs in their lives, they \ncan end up homeless.\n  There is also a great societal cost to homelessness, including \nexpenses for emergency rooms, jails, shelters, foster care, \ndetoxification, and emergency mental health treatment. Indeed, studies \nhave shown it costs just as much, if not more in overall expenditures, \nto allow men, women, and children to remain homeless as it does to \nprovide them with assistance and get them back on the road to self-\nsufficiency.\n  It has been 22 years since the enactment of the Steward B. McKinney \nHomeless Assistance Act, and we have learned a lot about the problem of \nhomelessness since then. At the time of its adoption in 1987, this law \nwas viewed as an emergency response to a national crisis, and was to be \nfollowed by measures to prevent homelessness and to create more \nsystemic solutions to the problem. It is now time to take what we have \nlearned during the past 22 years, and put those best practices and \nproposals into action.\n  First and foremost, the HEARTH Act focuses federal funding on \nprevention. It allows up to 20 percent of funds to be used to serve \npeople who are at risk of homelessness under a new ``Emergency \nSolutions Grants'' program. At the same time, it expands the definition \nof homelessness, which determines eligibility for much of the homeless \nassistance funding, to include people who will lose their housing in 14 \ndays; any family or individual fleeing or attempting to flee domestic \nviolence, or other dangerous or life threatening situations; and \nfamilies with children and unaccompanied youth who have experienced a \nlong term period without living independently, have experienced \npersistent housing instability, and can be expected to continue in such \nstatus for an extended period due to a number of enumerated factors, \nsuch as a disability. It also allows grantees to use up to an \nadditional 10 percent of competitive funds to serve families defined as \nhomeless under the Education Department homeless definition, but not so \ndefined under the HUD definition. For areas with low levels of \nhomelessness, up to 100 percent of funds may be used for such purposes.\n  The HEARTH Act also provides communities with greater flexibility in \nusing funds to prevent and end homelessness. Rural communities can \nparticipate in a new Rural Housing Stability Assistance Program that \nwould grant rural communities greater discretion in addressing the \nneeds of homeless people or those in the worst housing situations in \ntheir communities.\n  The HEARTH Act would also increase the focus on practices and \nprograms that have demonstrated results. For example, the bill would \nrequire that HUD provide incentives for rapid rehousing programs for \nhomeless families. Rapid rehousing programs have been successfully used \nin numerous communities to significantly reduce family homelessness. By \ndramatically reducing the length of time families are homeless, rapid \nrehousing programs ensure a quicker return to stability and self \nsufficiency.\n  The HEARTH Act would continue HUD's existing initiative to house \npeople who experience chronic homelessness, but would add families with \nchildren to the initiative. It also would designate 30 percent of total \nfunds for new permanent housing for families and individuals with a \ndisability.\n  Finally, the HEARTH Act would increase the emphasis on performance by \nmeasuring applicants' progress at reducing homelessness. It would also \nallow communities with low levels of homelessness or that are reducing \nhomelessness to focus more on prevention and serving people who are at \nrisk of homelessness.\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\n  There is a growing consensus on ways to help communities break the \ncycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness. If we combine federal \ndollars with the right incentives to local communities, we can prevent \nand end long-term homelessness.\n  The bipartisan HEARTH Act will set us on the path to meeting this \nimportant national goal. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this bill and other homelessness prevention efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 808\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a lack of affordable housing and limited scale of \n     housing assistance programs are the primary causes of \n     homelessness; and\n       (2) homelessness affects all types of communities in the \n     United States, including rural, urban, and suburban areas.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the separate homeless assistance \n     programs carried out under title IV of the McKinney-Vento \n     Homeless Assistance Act (consisting of the supportive housing \n     program and related innovative programs, the safe havens \n     program, the section 8 assistance program for single-room \n     occupancy dwellings, and the shelter plus care program) into \n     a single program with specific eligible activities;\n       (2) to codify in Federal law the continuum of care planning \n     process as a required and integral local function necessary \n     to generate the local strategies for ending homelessness; and\n       (3) to establish a Federal goal of ensuring that \n     individuals and families who become homeless return to \n     permanent housing within 30 days.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the special rule for contributions of qualified conservation \ncontributions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHeritage Conservation Extension Act of 2009, along with my good friend, \nSenator Grassley from Iowa.\n  As we all know, the country, including my home State of Montana, is \nlosing precious agricultural and ranch lands at a record pace. While \nproviding Montana and the Nation with the highest quality food and \nfiber, these farms and ranches also provide habitat for wildlife and \nthe open spaces, land that many of us take for granted and assume will \nalways be there. Conservation easements have been tremendously \nsuccessful in preserving open space and wildlife habitat. Montana has \nbegun to recognize the importance of using conservation easements to \npreserve these lands. We currently have more than 1.5 million acres \ncovered by conservation easements. To some, that may seem like a large \namount, but this is Montana, a State that covers 93,583,532 acres.\n  To assure that open space and habitat will be there for future \ngenerations, we must help our hardworking farmers and ranchers preserve \nthis precious heritage and their way-of-life. The Congress recognized \nthis by providing targeted income tax relief to small farmers and \nranchers who wish to make a charitable contribution of a qualified \nconservation easement. The provision allows eligible farmers and \nranchers to increase the amounts of deduction that may be taken \ncurrently for charitable contributions of qualified conservation \neasements by raising the Adjusted Gross Income, AGI, limitations to 100 \npercent and extending the carryover period from 5 years to 15 years. In \nthe case of all landowners, the AGI limitation was raised from 30 \npercent to 50 percent. This provision will expire at the end of this \nyear.\n  The number of acres protected and easements held by state and local \nland trusts has grown as a result of this incentive. According to the \nLand Trust Alliance, America's Land Trusts protected 535,000 more acres \nwith conservation easements in the first two years with the new tax \nincentive than in the previous two years, a 36 percent increase. In \n2006 and 2007, land trusts added over 6,000 easements, about 2,000 more \nthan the 2 years before the incentive.\n  The Rural Heritage Conservation Extension Act of 2009 would make this \nallowable deduction permanent, building on the success of conservation \neasements. Our farmers and ranchers will be able to preserve their \nimportant agricultural and ranching lands for future generations, while \ncontinuing to operate their businesses. Landowners, conservationists, \nthe Federal Government, and local communities are working together to \npreserve our precious natural resources.\n  This legislation is vitally important to Montana, and to every other \nState in the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 812\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Heritage Conservation \n     Extension Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIAL RULE FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF QUALIFIED \n                   CONSERVATION CONTRIBUTIONS MADE PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Individuals.--Subparagraph (E) of section 170(b)(1) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to contributions \n     of qualified conservation contributions) is amended by \n     striking clause (vi).\n       (2) Corporations.--Subparagraph (B) of section 170(b)(2) of \n     such Code (relating to qualified conservation contributions) \n     is amended by striking clause (iii).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to contributions made in taxable years beginning \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 815. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt \nsurviving spouses of United States citizens from the numerical \nlimitations described in section 201 of such Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, INA, imposes what has become known as the ``widow penalty,'' \nrequiring the deportation of individuals whose pending applications for \ngreen cards are rejected because their citizen spouse died within the \nfirst two years of marriage. Today, joined by Senators Durbin, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, Kerry and Menendez, I am introducing the Fairness \nto Surviving Spouses Act of 2009. My bill will amend the INA to remedy \nthis unintended and unjustified administrative procedure.\n  This legislation is needed because, under current law, when a US \ncitizen marries a non-citizen, the non-citizen is eligible to become a \nlegal permanent resident and receive a green card. During the first two \nyears of marriage, the only way this can be accomplished is through a \npetition that the citizen files on the non-citizen spouse's behalf. The \nnon-citizen cannot self-petition for legal permanent resident status \nduring this time.\n  If, however, the citizen spouse dies while the petition, through no \nfault of the couple, remains pending--and delays in the process are \noften caused due to bureaucratic delay--the petition automatically is \ndenied, and the non-citizen is immediately deemed ineligible for legal \npermanent residence and therefore becomes deportable. This is the case \neven if ample evidence of a bona fide marriage, such as cohabitation, \nand shared finances, exists. It is even the case if a couple had a U.S. \nborn child.\n  Because of the widow penalty, law-abiding and well-intentioned widows \nwho have played by the rules face immediate deportation. During the \n110th Congress, efforts to persuade the US Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, CIS, to address the issue administratively were unsuccessful. \nIn the current administration, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet \nNapolitano has directed that the Department of Homeland Security review \na number of immigration issues, including the widow penalty. Although \nthis review is welcome, there is some question regarding the \nSecretary's authority to end the penalty administratively. That is why \na clean legislative fix is needed, as scores of women and children face \nimmediate deportation today.\n  There have been more than 200 widow penalty victims throughout the \ncountry, including a woman whose husband died while serving overseas as \na contractor in Iraq; a woman whose husband died trying to rescue \npeople who were drowning in the San Francisco Bay; a woman whose \nhusband was killed while on duty with the U.S. Border Patrol; and a \nwoman who was apprehended by Federal agents when she went to meet with \nimmigration authorities to plead her case, placed in shackles, and sent \nto a detention facility.\n  The widow penalty has received national extensive national media \nattention, including from 60 Minutes, which profiled Raquel Williams, a \nwidow who lives with her in-laws in Orlando, in a segment entitled, \n``For Better or For Worse--A Loss of Love and Country.'' After she was \ndeemed deportable following the sudden death of her husband from sleep \napnea and heart problems, Ms. Williams and her in-laws have been \ntelling their story to raise awareness about this issue.\n  The harsh and unfair widow penalty can be eliminated by allowing the \npetition to be adjudicated even though the citizen spouse has died. The \nproposed legislation affects only a small group of individuals who \nstill would be required to demonstrate that they had a bona fide \nmarriage before receiving a green card. Thus, USCIS would retain the \ndiscretion to deny petitions, but they would no longer deny them \nautomatically in response to the death of the citizen spouse.\n  Today, Rep. Jim McGovern is introducing identical legislation in the \nHouse. His bill passed out of the House Judiciary Committee during the \n110th Congress with bipartisan support, including from Republicans who \nled the charge against comprehensive immigration reform. The widows who \nface deportation today should not be forced\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\nto wait for the Congress to take up comprehensive immigration reform. \nThis legislation is needed now because it simply corrects an arbitrary \nand unjust sanction, one which would never have occurred but for the \nGovernment's failure to act more in a more timely manner and the \nunfortunate fact that the citizen spouse died before the couple's \nsecond anniversary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RELIEF FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The second sentence of section \n     201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)) is amended by inserting ``(or, if \n     married to such citizen for less than 2 years at the time of \n     the citizen's death, an alien who proves by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that the marriage was entered into in good \n     faith and not solely for the purpose of obtaining an \n     immigration benefit)'' after ``for at least 2 years at the \n     time of the citizen's death''.\n       (b) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall \n     apply to all applications and petitions relating to immediate \n     relative status under section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)) \n     pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Transition cases.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, an alien described in subparagraph (B) who seeks \n     immediate relative status pursuant to the amendment made by \n     subsection (a) shall file a petition under section \n     204(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(A)(ii)) not later than the date that is 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Aliens described.--An alien is described in this \n     subparagraph if--\n       (i) the alien's United States citizen spouse died before \n     the date of the enactment of this Act;\n       (ii) the alien and the citizen spouse were married for less \n     than 2 years at the time of the citizen spouse's death; and\n       (iii) the alien has not remarried.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 817. A bill to establish a Salmon Stronghold Partnership program \nto conserve wild Pacific salmon and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pacific \nSalmon Stronghold Conservation Act of 2009, together with my colleague \nfrom Alaska Senator Murkowski. I am grateful for all the input and \ncollaboration from key stakeholders in Washington State that I have \nreceived on this legislation. I am especially grateful for the input \nfrom the Quileute Tribe, the Wild Salmon Center, and Bill Ruckelshaus.\n  Wild Pacific salmon are central to the culture, economy, and \nenvironment of western North America. While current Federal, State, and \nlocal salmon recovery efforts are focused on recovering salmon listed \nunder the Endangered Species Act, ESA, seeking to restore what we've \nlost--the Salmon Stronghold Act seeks to protect what we have. Current \nefforts to recover threatened or endangered salmon stocks are vital. \nThis is why I have consistently fought for increased funding for the \nPacific Coast Salmon Recovery Fund, PCSRF, and will continue to proudly \ndo so.\n  The PCSRF, since its inception in 2000, has allowed my home State of \nWashington to focus the efforts of counties and conservation districts, \non average, to remove 300 barriers to fish passage and to open 300 \nmiles of habitat each year. That's 2,400 barriers removed and 2,400 \nmiles of habitat restored. In 2008, for every Federal dollar spent on \nthis program it leveraged about $2 local and State dollars.\n  I will continue the fight to protect this salmon recovery funding. \nBut more must be done. A key purpose of this act is to complement \nexisting Federal, State and local salmon recovery efforts by directing \nnew Federal resources to conserve healthy salmon populations. This \nlegislation will utilize sound science to identify and sustain core \ncenters of salmon abundance, productivity, and diversity in the \nhealthiest remaining salmon ecosystems throughout the Pacific States.\n  This bill establishes a new regional Salmon Stronghold Partnership \nprogram that provides federal support and resources to protect a \nnetwork of the healthiest remaining wild Pacific salmon ecosystems in \nNorth America. The bill promotes enhanced coordination and cooperation \nof Federal, tribal, State and local governments, public and private \nland managers, fisheries managers, power authorities, and non-\ngovernmental organizations in efforts to protect salmon strongholds.\n  It is time to increase funding for recovery efforts, but also focus \non prevention. It is time to adopt the kind of comprehensive solution \nthat can solidify the place wild Pacific salmon hold in American \nculture for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 817\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Several species of salmon native to the rivers of the \n     United States are highly migratory, interacting with salmon \n     originating from Canada, Japan, Russia, and South Korea and \n     spending portions of their life history outside of the \n     territorial waters of the United States. Recognition of the \n     migratory and transboundary nature of salmon species has led \n     countries of the North Pacific to seek enhanced coordination \n     and cooperation through multilateral and bi-lateral \n     agreements.\n       (2) Salmon are a keystone species, sustaining more than 180 \n     other species in freshwater and marine ecosystems. They are \n     also an indicator of ecosystem health and potential impacts \n     of climate change.\n       (3) Salmon are a central part of the culture, economy, and \n     environment of Western North America.\n       (4) Economic activities relating to salmon generate \n     billions of dollars of economic activity and provide \n     thousands of jobs.\n       (5) During the anticipated rapid environmental change \n     during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, maintaining key ecosystem processes and functions, \n     population abundance, and genetic integrity will be vital to \n     ensuring the health of salmon populations.\n       (6) Salmon strongholds provide critical production zones \n     for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.\n       (7) Taking into consideration the frequency with which \n     fisheries have collapsed during the period preceding the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, using scientific research to \n     correctly identify and conserve core centers of abundance, \n     productivity, and diversity is vital to sustain salmon \n     populations and fisheries in the future.\n       (8) Measures being undertaken as of the date of the \n     enactment of this Act to recover threatened or endangered \n     salmon stocks, including Federal, State, and local programs \n     to restore salmon habitat, are vital. These measures will be \n     complemented and enhanced by identifying and sustaining core \n     centers of abundance, productivity, and diversity in the \n     healthiest remaining salmon ecosystems throughout the range \n     of salmon species.\n       (9) The effects of climate change are affecting salmon \n     habitat at all life history stages and future habitat \n     conservation must consider climate change projections to \n     safeguard natural systems under future climate conditions.\n       (10) Greater coordination between public and private \n     entities can assist salmon strongholds by marshaling and \n     focusing resources on scientifically-supported, high priority \n     conservation actions.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to expand Federal support and resources for the \n     protection and restoration of the healthiest remaining salmon \n     strongholds in\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\n     North America to sustain core centers of salmon abundance, \n     productivity, and diversity in order to ensure the long-term \n     viability of salmon populations--\n       (A) in the States of California, Idaho, Oregon, and \n     Washington, by focusing resources on cooperative, incentive-\n     based efforts to conserve the roughly 20 percent of salmon \n     habitat that supports approximately two-thirds of salmon \n     abundance; and\n       (B) in the State of Alaska, a regional stronghold that \n     produces more than one-third of all salmon, by increasing \n     resources available to public and private organizations \n     working cooperatively to conserve regional core centers of \n     salmon abundance and diversity;\n       (2) to maintain and enhance economic benefits related to \n     fishing or associated with healthy salmon stronghold \n     habitats, including flood protection, recreation, water \n     quantity and quality, carbon sequestration, climate change \n     mitigation and adaptation, and other ecosystem services; and\n       (3) to complement and add to existing Federal, State, and \n     local salmon recovery efforts by using sound science to \n     identify and sustain core centers of salmon abundance, \n     productivity, and diversity in the healthiest remaining \n     salmon ecosystems throughout their range.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize the Enhancing Education Through \nTechnology Act of 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nBurr, Kennedy, Hatch and Murray to introduce the Achievement Through \nTechnology and Innovation, ATTAIN, Act of 2009.\n  This bill would amend title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to rename part D, Achievement through Technology \nand Innovation, and reauthorize it through FY2014. I am very pleased \nthat ATTAIN is supported by the Consortium for School Networking, \nInternational Society for Technology and Education, Software and \nInformation Industry Association, State Educational Technology \nDirectors Association, and many other education groups.\n  In 2002, Congress enacted the No Child Left Behind Act to close the \nachievement gap between low-income, underperforming students and their \nmore affluent peers. Without a renewed dedication to the quality of \nprograms used in our schools, this goal, as well as providing an \nexcellent education for students, will be difficult to achieve. While \nthere is no question that we have made progress in recent years in \nadvancing educational opportunity, I remain concerned about the number \nof schools that are failing to meet the performance criteria set out in \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The bill I am introducing represents a critical step forward in \nadvancing learning technologies for millions of students across the \ncountry. Many schools lack the resources necessary for the 21st century \nclassroom and to meet the needs and expectations of today's students. \nFurthermore, technology and e-learning in our schools are a must if we \nare to meet our Nation's science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics education needs and to provide students with the skills \nnecessary to succeed in the 21st century knowledge-based, global \neconomy.\n  By authorizing the Enhancing Education Through Technology Act, EETT, \nas part of NCLB, Congress recognized that Federal leadership and \ninvestment is needed to serve as a catalyst for State and local \neducation initiatives aimed at school innovation and improved student \nachievement. EETT has shown to be effective, particularly in my home \nState of New Mexico. As you know, many schools often do not have access \nto learning resources that enable their students to gain an academic \nbackground with the technological skills and knowledge necessary to \nsucceed in college or the modern workplace. Through EETT, programs such \nas the Online Teaching and Learning Opportunities Year 2, have become \nbright spots of opportunity in some of our Nation's most isolated \ncommunities and have brought technical training, professional \ndevelopment and advanced technology resources to teachers and students. \nNotwithstanding this record of success, it is critical that states such \nas New Mexico have the opportunity to further advance the use of \nlearning technologies to deliver innovative instruction and curriculum.\n  To this end, the ATTAIN Act has three main objectives. First, to \nensure that through technology every student has access to \nindividualized, rigorous, and relevant learning to meet the goals of \nNCLB and to prepare all students for the 21st century. Second, to build \nupon and increase the use of evidence-based and innovative systemic \nschool redesign that centers around technology. And finally, to provide \nmeaningful professional development around technology that leads to \nchanges in teaching and curriculum and improves student technology \nliteracy.\n  The future of our students' success depends on the quality of their \neducational experience. I want to thank Senators Burr, Kennedy, Hatch, \nand Murray for their leadership and commitment to improving education \nin this country. They remain tireless advocates for our Nation's \nstudents, and I am pleased to be working with them on this legislation \nas we begin reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  This legislation is an integral step in advancing State and local \nlearning technologies for millions of students across the country, and \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n                                 S. 818\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION.\n\n       Part D of title II of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6751 et seq.) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n        ``PART D--ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION\n\n     ``SEC. 2401.

FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND GOALS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Learning technologies in our Nation's schools are \n     critical--\n       ``(A) to meet the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001 of raising student achievement, closing the achievement \n     gap, and ensuring high-quality teaching; and\n       ``(B) to ensure that our Nation's students are prepared to \n     compete in the 21st century knowledge-based global economy.\n       ``(2) Increased professional development opportunities are \n     needed if teachers are to be highly qualified and effective \n     in a 21st century classroom with today's digital native \n     students, including professional development opportunities--\n       ``(A) in the use of learning technologies to deliver \n     innovative instruction and curriculum; and\n       ``(B) to use data to inform instruction.\n       ``(3) Scientifically based research, conducted with Federal \n     funding, demonstrates that systemic redesign initiatives \n     centered around technology have shown great promise in \n     improving teaching and learning, including the following:\n       ``(A) In Utah, Missouri, and Maine, the eMINTS program \n     provides schools and teachers with educational technology \n     tools, curriculum, and more than 200 hours of professional \n     development to change how teachers teach and students learn. \n     In classrooms in the same school (1 with eMINTS and 1 \n     without), the student achievement of students in the eMINTS \n     classroom was repeatedly over 10 percent higher than the \n     control classroom.\n       ``(B) In West Virginia, students receiving access to online \n     foreign language courses performed at least as well as \n     students in face-to-face versions of the classes, providing \n     comparable high-quality instruction for students in rural \n     areas who otherwise would not have access to such courses.\n       ``(C) In Michigan's Freedom to Learn technology program, \n     proficiency on Michigan Education Assessment Program (MEAP) \n     tests of 8th grade mathematics increased from 31 percent in \n     2004 to 63 percent in 2005 in 1 middle school, and science \n     achievement increased from 68 percent of students proficient \n     in 2003 to 80 percent in 2004.\n       ``(D) In Texas, the Technology Immersion Pilot (TIP), \n     implemented in middle schools, demonstrated that discipline \n     referrals went down by more than \\1/2\\ with the changes in \n     teaching and learning; while in 1 school, the percentage of \n     6th graders who passed the reading portion of the 2006 State \n     assessment (TAKS) test was up 17 points from 2004, and the \n     percentage of 7th graders who passed the mathematics portion \n     of the TAKS rose 13 points. The students participating in the \n     Technology Immersion Pilot have become more responsible for \n     their learning, more engaged in the classroom, and much more \n     knowledgeable about the role of technology in problem solving \n     and learning.\n       ``(E) In Iowa, after connecting teachers with sustainable \n     professional development and technology-based curriculum \n     interventions, students taught by such teachers had scores \n     that increased by 14 points in 8th grade mathematics, 16 \n     points in 4th grade mathematics, and 13 points in 4th grade \n     reading compared with control groups.\n       ``(4) Technology and e-learning in our Nation's schools are \n     necessary to meet our Nation's science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education needs and to \n     provide students with 21st century skills, including \n     technology literacy, information literacy, communication \n     skills, problem solving skills, and the ability for self-\n     directed life-long learning.\n       ``(5) A 2003 Department of Commerce report credits United \n     States industry's investments in information technology \n     between 1989 and 2001 with `producing positive and probably \n     lasting changes in the Nation's economic potential', but \n     finds United States education last in intensity of \n     information technology in 55 industry sectors.\n       ``(6) Many of our Nation's schools lack the resources \n     necessary for the 21st century classroom and to meet the \n     needs and expectations of today's digital native students, \n     including--\n       ``(A) software, digital content, and broadband resources; \n     and\n       ``(B) other technologies.\n       ``(7) According to the Department of Education's National \n     Educational Technology Trends Study (NETTS 2007), \n     insufficient or outdated technology presented a substantial \n     barrier to technology use for teaching and learning for more \n     than 40 percent of students, while the lack of support \n     specialists was a barrier to technology use for more than 50 \n     percent of students.\n       ``(8) Federal leadership and investment is needed to serve \n     as a catalyst for State and local education initiatives aimed \n     at school innovation and improved student achievement through \n     leveraging educational technologies. According to the \n     Department of Education's National Educational Technology \n     Trends Study (NETTS 2007), `Because funds generated locally \n     through bonds or taxes frequently have legal restrictions \n     requiring them to be spent on hardware and connectivity \n     purchases only, Federal and State funds supporting the use of \n     technology resources fill a critical gap.'.\n       ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are the \n     following:\n       ``(1) To ensure that through technology every student has \n     access to individualized, rigorous, and relevant learning to \n     meet the goals of this part, and to prepare all students and \n     the United States for the 21st century.\n       ``(2) To evaluate, build upon, and increase the use of \n     evidence-based and innovative systemic school redesigns that \n     center on the use of technology that leads to school \n     improvement and increased student achievement.\n       ``(3) To increase ongoing, meaningful professional \n     development around technology that--\n       ``(A) leads to changes in teaching and curriculum;\n       ``(B) improves student achievement, including in core \n     academic subjects;\n       ``(C) improves student technology literacy; and\n       ``(D) is aligned with professional development activities \n     supported under section 2123.\n       ``(c) Goals.--The goals of this part are the following:\n       ``(1) To improve student academic achievement with respect \n     to State academic standards through the use of professional \n     development and systemic school redesigns that center on the \n     use of technology and the applications of technology.\n       ``(2) To improve professional development to ensure every \n     school administrator--\n       ``(A) possesses the leadership skills necessary for \n     effective technology integration and every teacher possesses \n     the knowledge and skills to use technology across the \n     curriculum;\n       ``(B) uses technology and curriculum redesign as key \n     components of changing teaching and learning and improving \n     student achievement;\n       ``(C) uses technology for data analysis to enable \n     individualized instruction; and\n       ``(D) uses technology to improve student technology \n     literacy.\n       ``(3) To ensure that every student is technologically \n     literate by the end of 8th grade, regardless of the student's \n     race, ethnicity, gender, family income, geographic location, \n     or disability.\n       ``(4) To improve student engagement, opportunity, \n     attendance, graduation rates, and technology access through \n     enhanced or redesigned curriculum or instruction.\n       ``(5) To more effectively use data to inform instruction, \n     address individualized student needs, and support school \n     decisionmaking.\n\n     ``SEC. 2403.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Autism (sometimes called ``classical autism'') is the \n     most common condition in a group of developmental disorders \n     known as autism spectrum disorders.\n       (2) Autism spectrum disorders include autism as well as \n     Asperger syndrome, Retts syndrome, childhood disintegrative \n     disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise \n     specified (usually referred to as PDD-NOS), as well as other \n     related developmental disorders.\n       (3) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have the \n     same rights as other individuals to exert control and choice \n     over their own lives, to live independently, and to \n     participate fully in, and contribute to, their communities \n     and society through full integration and inclusion in the \n     economic, political, social, cultural, and educational \n     mainstream of society. Individuals with autism spectrum \n     disorders have the right to a life with dignity and purpose.\n       (4) While there is no uniform prevalence or severity of \n     symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders, the \n     National Institutes of Health has determined that autism \n     spectrum disorders are characterized by 3 distinctive \n     behaviors: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal \n     and nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive, or \n     severely limited activities and interests.\n       (5) Both children and adults with autism spectrum disorders \n     can show difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication, \n     social interactions, and sensory processing. Individuals with \n     autism spectrum disorders exhibit different symptoms or \n     behaviors, which may range from mild to significant, and \n     require varying degrees of support from friends, families, \n     service providers, and communities.\n       (6) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often need \n     assistance in the areas of comprehensive early intervention, \n     health, recreation, job training, employment, housing, \n     transportation, and early, primary, and secondary education. \n     With access to, and assistance with, these types of services \n     and supports, individuals with autism spectrum disorders can \n     live rich, full, and productive lives. Greater coordination \n     and streamlining within the service delivery system will \n     enable individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \n     families to access assistance from all sectors throughout an \n     individual's lifespan.\n       (7) A 2007 report from the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention found that the prevalence of autism spectrum \n     disorders is estimated to be 1 in 150 people in the United \n     States.\n       (8) The Harvard School of Public Health reported that the \n     cost of caring for and treating individuals with autism \n     spectrum disorders in the United States is more than \n     $35,000,000,000 annually (an estimated $3,200,000 over an \n     individual's lifetime).\n       (9) Although the overall incidence of autism is consistent \n     around the globe, researchers with the Journal of Paediatrics \n     and Child Health have found that males are 4 times more \n     likely to develop an autism spectrum disorder than females. \n     Autism spectrum disorders know no racial, ethnic, or social \n     boundaries, nor differences in family income, lifestyle, or \n     educational levels, and can affect any child.\n       (10) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders from low-\n     income, rural, and minority communities often face \n     significant obstacles to accurate diagnosis and necessary \n     specialized services, supports, and education.\n       (11) There is strong consensus within the research \n     community that intensive treatment as soon as possible \n     following diagnosis not only can reduce the cost of lifelong \n     care by two-thirds, but also yields the most positive life \n     outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorders.\n       (12) Individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their \n     families experience a wide range of medical issues. Few \n     common standards exist for the diagnosis and management of \n     many aspects of clinical care. Behavioral difficulties may be \n     attributed to the overarching disorder rather than to the \n     pain and discomfort of a medical condition, which may go \n     undetected and untreated. The health care and other \n     treatments available in different communities can vary \n     widely. Many families, lacking access to comprehensive and \n     coordinated health care, must fend for themselves to find the \n     best health care, treatments, and services in a complex \n     clinical world.\n       (13) Effective health care, treatment, and services for \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorders depends upon a \n     continuous exchange among researchers and caregivers. \n     Evidence-based and promising autism practices should move \n     quickly into communities, allowing individuals with autism \n     spectrum disorders and their families to benefit from the \n     newest research and enabling researchers to learn from the \n     life experiences of the people whom their work most directly \n     affects.\n       (14) There is a critical shortage of appropriately trained \n     personnel across numerous important disciplines who can \n     assess, diagnose, treat, and support children and adults with \n     autism spectrum disorders and their families. Practicing \n     professionals, as well as those in training to become \n     professionals, need the most up-to-date practices informed by \n     the most current research findings.\n       (15) The appropriate goals of the Nation regarding \n     individuals with autism spectrum disorder are the same as the \n     appropriate goals of the Nation regarding individuals with \n     disabilities in general, as established in the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\n     (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.): to assure equality of opportunity, \n     full participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency for such individuals.\n       (16) Finally, individuals with autism spectrum disorders \n     are often denied health care benefits solely because of their \n     diagnosis, even though proven, effective treatments for \n     autism spectrum disorders do exist.\n\n     SEC. 3. PARENTAL RIGHTS RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the legal \n     rights of parents or legal guardians under Federal, State, or \n     local law regarding the care of their children.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \n5-year carryback of operating losses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, America's economy is continuing in \nrecession. Companies that have been profitable for years are finding \ntheir balance sheets awash in red ink. The economic stimulus bill, the \nAmerican Recover and Reinvestment Act or ``ARRA,'' helped some small \ncompanies with a provision that allows them to take losses from 2008 \nand carry them back for up to five years rather than carry them forward \nfor up to 20 or back only two. This net operating loss, NOL, carryback \nprovision gives formerly profitable companies the ability to get a \nquick infusion of cash by recouping taxes paid when they were \nprofitable in the recent past.\n  The cash from a 5 year carryback of NOLs allows companies to keep \nemployees on payroll, and stabilize operations during the most trying \ntime businesses have faced in at least a generation. The House and \nSenate and the Obama Administration all acknowledged the importance of \npermitting NOL carrybacks during the debate on the economic stimulus \nwith provisions that generally allowed any company to carryback losses \nincurred in 2008 and 2009. Unfortunately, the final agreement on that \nlaw did not contain the sweeping provision that is necessary to help as \nmany companies as are in need of this tax relief.\n  Companies are permitted to take these losses against future income, \nfor up to 20 years from now. However, that carryforward of losses does \nnothing to help companies weather the current recession in fact some of \nthese companies might never be able to take these losses because \nthey'll go out of business as a result of this recession. Permitting \ncarryback of losses will help to prevent employees from being laid off \ntoday as a result of the credit crunch that continues to exacerbate the \ndownward spiral of our economy. We can help lessen the credit crunch \nand increase cash flow in companies by permitting companies to \ncarryback losses for 5 years.\n  Today I am honored to introduce the NOL Carryback Act with the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Max Baucus, and a \ndistinguished group of colleagues from the Finance Committee. This bill \nmirrors the Senate-passed NOL carryback provision that was passed in \nARRA. The Senate-passed bill allowed carrybacks for losses incurred in \n2008 and 2009, for any sized business, but it prevented companies that \nreceive cash from the Troubled Asset Relief Program from also receiving \nthis cash infusion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 824. A bill to establish a Jobs Creation Coordinator in the \nDepartment of Commerce to ensure that agencies in the Department use \nresources in a manner that maximizes the maintenance and creation of \njobs in the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in response to the devastating \njob losses resulting from the current economic crisis. Figures released \nthis week show that U.S. companies shed more than 740,000 jobs in \nMarch, a 5 percent increase over the 706,000 jobs lost in February. Our \ncountry has now lost nearly 4.5 million jobs since the onset of the \nrecession--the most since 1945. Tomorrow's release of government-\ncompiled employment figures is certain to confirm the dismal state of \nthe U.S. job market--a tragic reality that millions of hardworking \nAmericans and the families they support know all too well.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, I believe it is essential for the Department of \nCommerce to respond to this dire situation by focusing its efforts on \nexpanding employment opportunities for Americans. With its statutory \nmission ``to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic \ncommerce,'' the Department of Commerce has a clear mandate to defend \nand grow the U.S. economy through job preservation and creation.\n  Yet the disparate agencies that comprise the department have little \nor no occasion to coordinate their efforts toward maximizing its job \nmaintaining and creating potential. While divisions such as the \nEconomic Development Agency and the Minority Business Development \nAgency each have their own programs to increase employment in their \nrespective target communities, there is the potential for even greater \njob creation through the coordination\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\nof their efforts with the core functions of other department \ncomponents, such as the export-promotion activities of the \nInternational Trade Administration, the economic analysis of the \nEconomics and Statistics Administration, and the stewardship of \ntechnological innovation by the National Telecommunications & \nInformation Administration.\n  That is why I am today introducing bipartisan legislation with my \nCommerce Committee colleague Senator Begich to establish a Job Creation \nCoordinator at the department. Answering directly to the Secretary of \nCommerce, the Coordinator would not only ensure that each agency is \ncarrying out its primary mission in a way that maximizes U.S. \nemployment, but also would identify and implement opportunities to link \nseparate programs being carried out by the agencies in a way that \nensures that department resources are being spent in a manner which \nguarantees the utmost job creation per dollar appropriated.\n  Specifically, the Jobs Coordinator would be responsible for making an \ninitial assessment of the private sector jobs currently being \nmaintained or created by Commerce Department programs; formulating an \naction plan for improving these figures under existing statutory \nauthority; liaising with Congress about additional authority which \nwould enhance the job maintaining and creating abilities of Commerce \nDepartment programs; and, overseeing the implementation of new \ndepartment policies or statutory authorities intended to enhance the \ndepartment's job maintenance and creation potential.\n  The millions of Americans who have lost their livelihoods to the \neconomic downturn, or whose jobs are at risk amidst the turmoil, \ndeserve the utmost effort by their government to put an end to the lay-\noffs and get people back to work. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthis vital effort by supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4386-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 98--DESIGNATING EACH OF APRIL 15, 2009, AND APRIL 15, \n                  2010, AS ``NATIONAL TEA PARTY DAY''\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Res. 99\n\n       Whereas the United States has a growing strategic \n     involvement in Central Asia;\n       Whereas the interests of the United States in Central Asia, \n     including the operations in Afghanistan, can only be secured \n     by the presence in the region of viable, vigorous democracies \n     that fully guarantee the economic and social rights of all \n     people, including children;\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan continues to commit \n     serious human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, torture in custody, and the severe restriction of \n     freedom of speech, the press, religion, independent political \n     activity, and nongovernmental organizations;\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan detains thousands of \n     people for political or religious reasons;\n       Whereas Uzbekistan is the third largest exporter of cotton \n     in the world, and cotton is 1 of the largest sources of \n     export revenue for Uzbekistan;\n       Whereas Uzbekistan has signed and properly deposited with \n     the International Labour Organization (ILO) the Minimum Age \n     Convention, convened at Geneva June 6, 1973 (International \n     Labour Organization Convention Number 138) and the Worst \n     Forms of Child Labour Convention, convened at Geneva June 1, \n     1999 (International Labour Organization Convention Number \n     182);\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan issued a decree in \n     September 2008 that ostensibly prohibited the practice of \n     forced and child labor, but the Government of Uzbekistan sent \n     schoolchildren to harvest cotton within weeks after issuing \n     the decree;\n       Whereas the 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \n     by the Department of State stated that large-scale compulsory \n     mobilization of youth and students to harvest cotton \n     continued in most rural areas of Uzbekistan and that the \n     students and youths were poorly paid, living conditions were \n     poor, and children were exposed to harmful chemicals and \n     pesticides applied in the cotton fields;\n       Whereas research by the Environmental Justice Foundation \n     indicates that each year hundreds of thousands of \n     schoolchildren from Uzbekistan, some as young as 7 years old, \n     are forced by the Government of Uzbekistan to work in the \n     national cotton harvest for up to 3 months;\n       Whereas a policy briefing published by the School of \n     Oriental and African Studies, University of London, in 2008, \n     entitled ``Invisible to the World'', used extrapolations \n     based on surveys in 6 areas that took place in 2006 and 2007 \n     to conclude that approximately 2,400,000 schoolchildren from \n     Uzbekistan between the ages of 10 and 15 are forcibly \n     recruited into the annual cotton harvest;\n       Whereas the British Broadcasting Company undertook an \n     investigation in late 2007 and found that the Government of \n     Uzbekistan continues to rely on the state-orchestrated mass \n     mobilization of children to bring in the cotton harvest;\n       Whereas, in 2008, reports of child labor in the cotton \n     fields were received by multiple media outlets and local \n     human rights activists from the major cotton-growing regions \n     in Uzbekistan, including Djizzak, Namangan, Samarkand, and \n     Ferghana, among others;\n       Whereas a report by the Rapid Reaction Group indicates that \n     schoolchildren who cannot fulfill their daily picking quotas \n     are forced to make up the difference in cash from the pockets \n     of their own families;\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan detained and harassed \n     an independent journalist who accompanied a diplomat from the \n     United States on a research trip to Syr Daria province, where \n     the diplomat photographed children working in the cotton \n     fields;\n       Whereas the children working in the cotton fields are \n     stressed by the pressure to fulfill cotton quotas, physically \n     abused by arduous work in the cotton fields, and subjected to \n     poor and hazardous living conditions during the harvest \n     period;\n       Whereas international brands such as Gap, H, Levi \n     Strauss, Limited Brands, Target, Tesco, and Wal-Mart have \n     banned cotton from Uzbekistan from their products and \n     instructed their suppliers to comply with the ban;\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan allowed a survey to be \n     conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), \n     under the strict supervision of the Government of Uzbekistan, \n     yet the survey was not conducted during the fall harvest \n     season (a time when the likelihood of children working in the \n     fields is significantly greater);\n       Whereas the Government of Uzbekistan refused to fully \n     cooperate with the ILO and the International Cotton Advisory \n     Committee to undertake an independent technical assessment of \n     forced child labor during the fall 2008 harvest season; and\n       Whereas the ILO has conducted independent investigations \n     into forced and child labor in more than 60 countries around \n     the world, including developing and developed countries: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Government of Uzbekistan should--\n       (1) immediately enforce its existing domestic legislation \n     and fulfill its international commitments aimed at ending \n     state-sponsored forced and child labor;\n       (2) allow a comprehensive independent investigation into \n     forced and child labor in the cotton sector during the fall \n     2009 harvest season by the International Labour Organization;\n       (3) in consultation and cooperation with the International \n     Labour Organization, develop a credible and comprehensive \n     action plan based on the findings of the International Labour \n     Organization and commit the resources necessary to end forced \n     and child labor in the cotton sector; and\n       (4) take concrete steps towards systemic reform that will--\n       (A) ensure greater freedom and better returns from their \n     labor for cotton-producing farmers; and\n       (B) enable such farmers to employ adults in the cotton \n     sector.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url":

Res. 100\n\n       Whereas participation in sports and organized physical \n     education is essential to fostering healthy attitudes and \n     lifestyles in children;\n       Whereas the National Association for Sport and Physical \n     Education reports that participation among American students \n     in physical education has declined dramatically;\n       Whereas American children are experiencing obesity in \n     growing numbers, and data continues to highlight the link \n     between obesity and diabetes, heart disease, and other life-\n     threatening medical conditions;\n       Whereas youth physical fitness through sport improves \n     overall health, aids child development, improves self-esteem, \n     and increases academic success in the classroom;\n       Whereas participation in adaptive sports improves self-\n     worth, health, independence, and self-esteem for youth with \n     physical and cognitive disabilities;\n       Whereas the rate of participation by urban youth in \n     organized athletics is approximately one-third of the rate of \n     suburban youth, and this is particularly true for young girls \n     in urban areas;\n       Whereas both the world and United States populations are \n     becoming increasingly urban, and if the trend of urbanization \n     continues, by 2030 it is estimated that two-thirds of the \n     global population will reside in urban areas;\n       Whereas establishing sports in urban settings remains a \n     particular challenge because cities often lack the physical \n     space needed for sports and efforts are often fragmented due \n     to communication and coordination challenges;\n       Whereas the selection of the city of Chicago to represent \n     the United States in its bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympic \n     and Paralympic Games would leave a legacy of youth engagement \n     in sports in cities across our Nation;\n       Whereas the city of Chicago and Chicago 2016 are committed \n     to an initiative establishing sustainable urban sport venues \n     and connecting sport venues with programs that address \n     coaching challenges, resource issues, and the difficulties of \n     parental support to run programs;\n       Whereas the United States Olympic Committee and its 45 \n     member organizations are currently investing in Olympic and \n     Paralympic sport and physical activity programs for Americans \n     in communities throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas the creation of an Urban Youth Sport Initiative \n     would increase involvement of urban youth in sport, increase \n     the training and availability of coaches in urban areas for \n     youth sports, and enhance the ability of urban cities to \n     administer youth sports programs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the expansion of quality urban youth sports \n     programs to increase urban youth involvement in sport; and\n       (2) supports the establishment of an Urban Youth Sport \n     Initiative in partnership with the United States Olympic \n     Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4387-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 101--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE TRAGIC \n   EVENTS AT THE PINELAKE HEALTH AND REHAB CENTER IN CARTHAGE, NORTH \n                   CAROLINA ON SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 2009\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself and Mrs. Hagan) submitted the following \nresolution; which was\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for \ntestimony in a whistle-blower protection case against the Department of \nthe Navy in which a civilian Navy employee is appealing an adverse \nemployment action before the Merit Systems Protection Board. The \nemployee is alleging that the Navy retaliated against him for protected \nwhistle-blowing activities about alleged waste in Navy programs.\n  Among the whistle-blowing activities that the employee relies on is a \nbrief meeting that representatives of a Navy contracting firm had with \nstaff of the Virginia Senate delegation in February 2008 about their \nfirm's work on an energy management contract that the employee managed \nfor the Navy.\n  The Navy has requested that the Senate make available through written \ndeclaration staff who can testify about whether the employee's \nallegations were raised at the meeting in order to establish whether \nthat meeting constituted protected whistle-blowing activities.\n  Senator Webb would like to cooperate with this request. Accordingly, \nthis resolution would authorize Jamie Lynch, a former fellow with \nSenator Webb's office, to testify. The resolution would also authorize \nproduction of relevant documents, except where a privilege should be \nasserted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 103) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 103\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Richard Bowen v.

Annex VI sets forth rules and \nprocedures relating to liability arising from the failure of operators \nin the Antarctic to respond to environmental emergencies.\n  I believe Annex VI to be fully in the U.S. interest. Its provisions \nadvance the U.S. goals of protecting the environment of Antarctica, \nestablishing incentives for Antarctic operators to act responsibly, and \nproviding for the reimbursement of costs incurred by the United States \nGovernment when it responds to environmental emergencies caused by \nothers.\n  As the report of the Department of State explains, Annex VI will \nrequire implementing legislation, which will be submitted separately to \nthe Congress for its consideration.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nAnnex VI and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                         Barack Obama  \nThe White House, April 2, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/02/senate-section/article/S4399-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. REID.
