Mr. President, on this Saturday, the Senate, in one of its \nunusual sessions, it is very good to see one of the more senior Members \nof the Senate presiding over the Senate. A lot of presiding is left to \nthe more junior Members. It is indicative of the teamwork of the \nSenator from Vermont, one of the most senior Members of the Senate, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and someone who is always there \nwhen there is a need for something to be done, as it is today to open \nthe Senate.\n  I have such fond memories of my friend from Vermont. I can remember \nthe first time we met. We were in Florida. I was running for the \nSenate. It was 1986 and the Senator from Vermont was running for \nreelection, even then a senior Member of the Senate.\n  Even though the two of us are almost twins as far as our age goes, \nthe Senator from Vermont has a significant amount of seniority, \nalthough he never uses that in any way other than to work for the \nbetterment of the people of Vermont--and I say that seriously. We had a \nconversation in the cloakroom today, and we were not talking about ball \ngames last night, we were talking about problems of the people of \nVermont, things the distinguished presider today indicated he thought \ncould help a little for the State of Vermont. I am very grateful the \nSenator is here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11905-7", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11905-S11906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as we move toward tonight's all-\nimportant vote, we will have 10 more hours of discussion of this 2,074-\npage bill, which represents the top part of this stack. The other \n2,000-page bill is the House-passed bill. Senators will have an \nopportunity to express themselves on the merits of this proposal.\n  What do we know for sure as we move toward this debate? We know \nAmericans oppose this bill. They are not buying the claim that this \nlegislation would do anything whatsoever to lower our staggering \ndeficits.\n  In tomorrow's Washington Post, David Broder, their distinguished \nsenior columnist, certainly not a political conservative, expresses his \nreservations as a citizen about the steps we could be about to take. \nBroder says, in part, in his column:\n\n       The day after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) gave \n     its qualified blessing to the version of health care reform \n     produced by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Quinnipiac \n     University poll of a national cross section of voters \n     reported its latest results.\n\n  The reason Broder picks Quinnipiac, he said, is he is familiar with \nthe pollsters and the process, knows they are thoroughly nonpartisan \nand credible. Of course, the Quinnipiac Poll is echoed by every other \npoll we have seen, no matter who has taken it. We know the American \npeople are opposed to this 2,074-page proposal.\n  Broder points out that in the Quinnipiac survey, less than one-fifth \nof voters, 19 percent--a near 19 percent of the sample--support this \nbill.\n\n       Nine of 10 Republicans and eight of 10 independents said \n     that whatever passes will add to the torrent [a literal \n     torrent] of red ink. By a margin of four to three--\n\n  This is extremely significant--\n\n       By a margin of four to three, even Democrats agree this is \n     likely [that this will produce a torrent of red ink].\n       That fear contributed directly to the fact that, by a 16-\n     point margin, the majority in this poll said they oppose this \n     legislation moving through Congress.\n\n  It is not just the American people who are saying that, the experts \nare saying it as well. Broder points out that every expert--this is \nBroder:\n\n       [E]very expert I have talked to says that the public has it \n     right.\n\n  In other words, the experts agree with the public opinion polls that \nthis 2,074-page bill is a budget buster. He quotes the executive \ndirector of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group. He says--this \nexpert says:\n\n       . . . there's not much reform in this bill. As of now, it's \n     basically a big entitlement expansion, plus tax increases.\n\n  He also decries the gimmickry involved in putting this bill together. \nBroder points out the majority leader's:\n\n       . . . decision to postpone the start of the subsidies to \n     help the uninsured buy policies from mid-2013 to January \n     2014--long after taxes and fees levied by the bill would have \n     begun.\n\n  That is the only way they can make the CBO declare it budget neutral, \ndeficit neutral.\n  In fact, we know that over a 10-year period, once it is fully \nimplemented, the cost of this will be $2.5 trillion. Americans do not \nthink higher premiums, higher taxes, and massive cuts to Medicare is \nreform. They certainly do not think it is what we need at a time when 1 \nout of 10 working Americans is looking for a job and the Chinese are \nlecturing us about debt.\n\n  Do we want to pass this staggering spending program at a time when \nmany would argue our international bankers, the Chinese, are lecturing \nus about debt? At this time of economic crisis, we need to make things \neasier for people struggling out there, not harder.\n  Make no mistake, the Democrats' plan we will vote on tonight would \nmake life harder for the vast majority of Americans. It raises their \ntaxes, it raises their health care premiums, it cuts their Medicare, \nand drives millions off the private insurance they currently have. When \nfully implemented, this plan would cost, as I indicated earlier, $2.5 \ntrillion. That is the equivalent of three failed stimulus bills.\n  Perhaps most shocking of all to most people is the conclusion of the \nCongressional Budget Office that this bill would actually drive up \nhealth care costs, not down. This massive bill, at a time when \nAmericans are asking us to control health care costs, according to the \nindependent Congressional Budget Office, actually drives up costs.\n  The American people are scratching their heads. They thought the idea \nbehind all this was to try to lower costs. Perversely, what we are \ndoing is the opposite.\n  Americans will have an opportunity to hear their elected \nrepresentatives in the Senate express their views on this legislation \nall day today. Senators who support this bill have a lot of explaining \nto do--a lot of explaining to do. Americans know a vote to proceed on \nthis bill, to get on this bill, is a vote for higher premiums, higher \ntaxes, and massive cuts to Medicare. That is a pretty hard thing to \njustify supporting. Every Senator who goes on record saying we need to \nproceed to this monstrosity of a bill will, in effect, be voting for \nhigher taxes, higher premiums, and cuts in Medicare.\n  It is a pretty hard position to justify. It is a pretty hard position \nto explain to your constituents. Frankly, I don't think it can be \nexplained, and I don't think the American people do either.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11906-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11906-S11907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my friend, the Republican leader, is \nliving in a different world than most everyone else. For him to lecture \nthe Senate on debt is beyond the pale. He, one of the Republican \nleaders during the last years, voted at every opportunity to spend more \nmoney in Iraq, without a penny of it being paid for--$1 trillion it is \nnow said to be--on a war of choice and not a penny of it paid for. To \nlecture us now on debt, when not only the war but the other actions of \nthe Bush administration drove this country into deep debt? If one read \nthe papers today or listened to Newsday, you will find economists all \nover America said the stimulus is working. Only 25 percent of the money \nhas now been spent, and they recognize that but for the stimulus, we \nwould be in a worldwide depression. That is all over the news today.\n  To focus on an editorial by a man who has been retired for many years \nand writes a column once in a while is not where we should be. Where we \nshould be is recognizing America deserves a debate on health care \nreform. Last year, 750,000 Americans filed bankruptcy. Over half of \nthose bankruptcies were because of medical expenses. Over half of the \npeople who filed for bankruptcy because of medical expenses had health \ninsurance. Do we need to do something on health insurance reform? Of \ncourse, we do.\n  It speaks volumes to recognize that insurance rates over America \nduring the last few months are skyrocketing. Why? Because the insurance \nindustry has an insatiable appetite for more profit. How are they able \nto do this when other businesses can't do it? They can do it because \nthey are exempt from the antitrust laws of this country. The only \nbusiness, other than Major League Baseball, that has that is the \ninsurance industry. We are going to take a look at that in this \nlegislation. Shouldn't we at least talk about it?\n\n  My friend the distinguished Republican leader is saying he doesn't \nthink we should even have a debate on this issue, even though last year \n750,000 Americans filed bankruptcy, most of them because of health \nexpenses.\n  In addition to that, the morning news indicates that longtime \nconservative Republican Tommy Thompson, longtime Governor of the State \nof Wisconsin, Cabinet officer in the Bush administration, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services, endorsed the legislation we will vote on \nthis afternoon. To show it is bipartisan, Richard Gephardt, former \nDemocratic leader of the House of Representatives, endorsed this, and \nmany others.\n  Anyone who says this legislation contains an entitlement expansion is\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nobviously someone who has not read the bill. One of the things we have \nin this legislation is a provision called the CLASS Act. What does it \ndo? It allows someone to voluntarily pay $120 a month into a fund. They \ndo it for 5 consecutive years. If they become disabled, there is money \nthere for them. Ever since I have been in the Congress, we have been \nlooking for a way to take care of the aged, infirm, and disabled. It is \nnot an entitlement; it is voluntary and fully paid for, as is the rest \nof the bill.\n  To talk about all this debt--I don't know what world, what sphere \nthey are living in. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan \norganization--not always good--I wish they would have come up with some \nother numbers because we got no credit for all the wellness things we \ndo in this bill that will save lots of money. We received no credit for \nthat. But in spite of that, everything in the bill is fully paid for. \nIt reduces short- and long-term debt. It expands coverage. This chart \nsays ``94 percent,'' but it is actually 98 percent because CBO does not \ngive us credit for people in Medicare. So 98 percent of Americans are \ncovered. It contains insurance market reforms, and lots of them. It \ncontains delivery system reforms.\n  The key elements of this health care reform bill, I repeat: It \nreduces short- and long-term deficits, expands coverage, promotes \nchoice and competition, reforms the insurance market, and improves \nquality of care. All we are asking today is to have a debate on it. Why \nwould anyone be afraid, in the greatest debating society, supposedly, \nin the world, to debate health care? What are they afraid of?\n  He said anyone who votes for this is going to have a lot of \nexplaining to do. That is really Orwellian. Have a lot of explaining to \ndo if they vote to allow the debate to continue? I think quite the \nopposite. I think any reasonable human being would feel the same way. \nShouldn't we debate health care reform in America today, with 50 \nmillion people uninsured, and this legislation is going to take care of \n98 percent of Americans?\n  This legislation looks out for small businesspeople. Right now, most \nsmall businesses don't have health insurance for their employees. Do \nthey not have health insurance because they are mean or cheap? No. They \ncan't afford it. The insurance industry has made it impossible to pay \nfor because of their huge profits.\n  Someone not voting to allow the debate to continue is going to have a \nlot of explaining to do. Even though my friend is Orwellian and said \nthat if you vote to allow debate to continue, you will have a lot of \nexplaining to do, how could you be a Senator and be afraid to debate \nhealth care reform?\n  Simply, this legislation, on which we will vote on a motion to \nproceed to this evening at 8, saves lives, it saves money, and it saves \nMedicare--a pretty good deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11907-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be debate \nuntil 6 p.m., with the time controlled in alternating 1-hour blocks, \nwith the majority controlling the first hour.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad to see my colleague and \nneighbor from New York in the chair, an extraordinarily hard-working \nMember of the Senate. I am not surprised, on a Saturday morning, that \nshe is here.\n  Before I begin, I wish to state my appreciation for the kind words \nfrom the majority leader for the Senator from Vermont. He and I have \nbeen friends for decades. I am glad to see the work he has done in \nbringing this bill to the floor. I intend to work closely with him.\n  Decision time is near on health insurance reform. I will vote today \nto end the filibuster so the Senate can begin this important, historic \ndebate to improve and reform our Nation's health insurance system. \nLet's not duck the debate. Let the debate begin. Let's not hide from \nvotes. Let's have the courage to vote. Stand up and vote on the \namendments. Let the American people know where we stand and not say: \nWell, it never came up because of the filibuster. We can end the \nfilibuster today. We can get going. We can let every American know \nwhere we stand.\n  The sentries of the status quo again have spared no effort to kick \nthe can down the road, as they have done before. The country suffers \nwhen there is a failure to act on serious challenges that millions of \nordinary Americans face in their daily lives. This is a defining moment \nfor the Senate and for the country. I rank this along with other major \ndecisions such as the creation of Social Security and Medicare and the \nCivil Rights Act. We have been talking about health insurance reform \nfor more than 70 years, before I was born. The Senate should not now \nprevent a real debate on health reform by hiding behind the figleaf of \na procedural filibuster.\n  A bill worthy of this debate has been produced, after months of \narduous work. Opponents of reform, unfortunately, have wasted much of \nthe public's time by provoking arguments over their distortions about \nwhat health reform means. Spurious rumors were spread about death \npanels. One mailing opposing this bill claimed that reform would mean \ndenying care to people based on their voting records. How desperate can \nthese entrenched powers get, those who want to stop health care reform? \nThese are the tactics of obstruction in the service of the status quo.\n  Meanwhile, what the American people yearn for are constructive \nsolutions. They want an honest debate, not a filibuster. That is what \nthey deserve, and that is what we owe them.\n  A Vermonter came by my office to talk about health reform, as so many \nhave over the last several months. I hear this every time when I am \nhome in Vermont. If I am in the gas station putting gas in my car, if I \nam in the grocery store, if I am coming out of church on Sunday, I hear \nthis. This Vermonter is a physician. He has a special perspective from \ninside the system. He recalled stories about his father, also a very \nrespected doctor, who practiced in the days before Medicare. He \nremembered the devastation his father felt when he was forced to turn \naway elderly Vermonters because they did not have health insurance.\n  It may be difficult today to even imagine this, but before Medicare, \nolder Americans were routinely driven into poverty during their \nretirement years by health expenses. Before Medicare was launched in \n1964, nearly half of seniors over 65 had no health coverage and more \nthan one in three lived in poverty. Today, because of Medicare, \nvirtually everyone 65 and older has health insurance. The poverty rate \namong seniors has plummeted. More than 100,000 Vermonters have Medicare \ninsurance.\n\n  The arguments that were made against creating Medicare may sound \nfamiliar. Opponents of Medicare, when it first came up, tried to \ndemonize the plan. They claimed it would never work. How could \ngovernment run a program like this? They ignored those older Americans \nliving in poverty. But eventually Members from both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, worked together. They passed a bill that is \none of the most successful and popular programs in America today. \nVermont's entire congressional delegation, which at that time was \nRepublican, supported passage of that landmark legislation.\n  Today, we have a health system with contradictions. Federal \ninvestments in research and private investments in development have \nproduced modern medical marvels in the equipment, training, techniques, \nand drugs that are available to many Americans. Yet in the prices we \npay, in the lack of access to basic medical care, in the loopholes and \nthe redtape that plague ordinary Americans in our health insurance \nsystem and in overall results in so many categories, we get far less \nfor our enormous health care spending than do the\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\ncitizens of countries whose health care costs are only a fraction of \nwhat ours are. Tens of millions of Americans have no health insurance \nat all. Employers who want to offer health insurance to their workers \nare being priced out of even having that option anymore. Self-employed \nAmericans must pay dearly to afford any insurance, and they can lose \ntheir coverage at the whim of an insurance company's bureaucracy. In no \nmodern nation except ours are families actually driven into bankruptcy \nby illness. In fact, medical expenses are one of the top reasons for \nbankruptcy in America today.\n  In the absence of a fair and sensible health insurance system, \nfamilies, businesses, and taxpayers have been dragged along by an \ninflationary curve that only worsens with time. Next year, small \nbusinesses, already suffering from skyrocketing medical costs, will see \ntheir premiums rise by an average of 15 percent. That is twice the rate \nof last year's increases. Drug companies have boosted prices of brand-\nname drugs by about 9 percent over the last year--the steepest increase \nin years. All you have to do is look at the huge salaries paid to their \nexecutives, and you know where that money is going. It is not going to \nhelp the health care of the average American.\n  Can't we fashion an American-made solution so our citizens can have \nhigh-quality, affordable care and access to basic health insurance? Of \ncourse we can. We are Americans. We can develop that.\n  The bill introduced this week by the majority leader and by Senators \nBaucus, Dodd, and Harkin will give millions more Americans access to \nquality, affordable health care. It would end discriminatory treatment \nof those who change jobs or have preexisting conditions.\n  I have pushed and will continue to push to accomplish the three c's \nof choice, competition, and cost control, as we reform our health \ninsurance system.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate bill includes a public option that I \nhave strongly supported. I might say, the majority of Americans \nstrongly support it. I will stand with others as we make our case for \nkeeping it in the reform plan as part of this process.\n\n  I was proud to join Senator Brown and a core group of more than 20 \nother Senators who introduced a resolution affirming our support of a \npublic option. A public option would give consumers more choices to \nselect affordable and quality health insurance plans, while helping to \ndrive down overall medical costs through real competition in the health \ninsurance market.\n  To further enhance the advantages of a competitive market, I have \nintroduced the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of \n2009. This would repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance \nand medical malpractice insurance providers. Closing this loophole in \nour antitrust laws is long overdue, and I will offer my legislation as \nan amendment to the bill to do that. Antitrust enforcement promotes \ncompetition. It helps to lower prices and expand consumer choice.\n  Another factor that contributes to the rising medical costs all \nAmericans face is fraud within the health insurance system. The scale \nof health care fraud in our system today is staggering. Studies \nestimate that between 3 percent and 10 percent of all our health care \nspending, both public and private, is wasted through health care fraud. \nThat is somewhere between $60 billion and $220 billion each year--money \nwe should have for health care, not going in the pockets of crooks.\n  To help wring this waste out of our system, Senator Kaufman and I and \nothers have proposed the Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act. Our bill \nwould toughen sentences for those who commit health care fraud, \nstrengthen support for prevention, investigation, and prosecution of \nhealth care fraud, and sharpen the legal tools we need to go after this \nfraud. It would prevent waste in spending. It would hold accountable \nthose who do the stealing. Experience shows antifraud efforts give \ntaxpayers a superb return on investment, with a payback of between $6 \nand $14 for every dollar we spend on enforcement.\n  I am pleased the majority leader included provisions in this bill to \naddress the issue of health care fraud. I will work with Senator \nKaufman and others to strengthen that bill.\n  Vermont has helped pave the way for some of the reforms included in \nthis bill, and now, for the third year in a row, Vermont has been \nranked as the healthiest State in the Nation. Vermont is one of the \nearliest leaders in expanding the State Medicaid Program, under reforms \nled by former Gov. Howard Dean and others. Yet under the current form \nof this bill, Vermont would not share the enhanced Federal match to be \noffered to other States. That would amount to a regressive policy with \nadverse practical ramifications for Vermont, a State that is a leader \nin expanding access to health care. I was heartened in my conversation \nthis morning with the majority leader when he told me he will try to \ncorrect that problem. But we cannot correct any of these problems until \nwe debate the bill. Let's not hide under our desks because we are \nafraid to stand up and vote and debate.\n  The people of Vermont have given me the honor of representing them in \nthe Senate for 35 years. I have joined in many debates that were \ncontentious yet ultimately productive. I have been on the winning side. \nI have been on the losing side. But as we leaf through the pages of \nhistory, we can read of many times when the Senate has shown its \nremarkable ability to rise up to reflect the conscience of the Nation. \nThose moments were forged in the crucible of national need, against the \nanvil of the tempered will of the Senate's membership.\n  This Senate can do that again. Our dear friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, \nsaid it so well in the letter about the health reform imperative that \nPresident Obama read to a joint meeting of Congress. This is what \nSenator Kennedy reminded us:\n\n       What we face is above all a moral issue; that at stake are \n     not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of \n     social justice and the character of our country.\n\n  This is such a time. It is my hope and belief the Senate I love will \nonce again rise to the occasion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I would like to first thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont for his excellent remarks in support of what is, after \nall, just a vote to get us started on the debate on health care, a \nprocedural vote to allow us to be able to amend and improve the bill in \nthe coming weeks.\n  Madam President, virtually every single Member of this body in the \nSenate is a Member of the baby boom generation. In my view, it is a \ngeneration of Americans--I was born in the last year of that \ngeneration--given more opportunity than any generation of people in the \nhistory of this planet because our grandparents and our parents were \nwilling to make hard choices, understanding that part of our national \ncreed, part of our legacy is assuring that we are expanding opportunity \nfor those who come after us.\n  We are having this health care debate at a moment in our country's \nhistory beset by incredible economic difficulties. This is the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. But we now know even during the \nperiod of economic growth before our economy fell into this terrible \nrecession that working families were struggling.\n  During the last period of economic growth, median family income in \nthe United States actually declined. As far as I know, it was the first \nperiod of recovery in the history of the United States when median \nfamily income actually went down. It was at the same time the cost of \nhealth insurance was soaring--in my State by 97 percent--with the cost \nof higher education in my State going up by 50 percent.\n  We were saying to working families: You are living in an economy with \nincredible weakness, where the growth is surging ahead of a mountain of \ndebt, but you are not getting ahead.\n  Just this week, we learned that in the great State of California they \nare increasing the tuition for their universities by 30 percent. The \nUniversity of California, the California system has been the envy of \nthe world for decades, and now it is being put out of the reach of \nworking families.\n  So we have much to do--much to do--to make sure we honor the legacy \nof our parents and our grandparents. We honor the legacy of the \n``greatest\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\ngeneration'' and this generation, the baby boom generation, to ensure \nthat we leave behind us not diminished opportunity but more opportunity \nfor our kids and our grandkids.\n  There is much we need to do to make sure we have a health care system \nthat works not just for a few people but for everyone, an education \nsystem that works not just for a few kids but for everyone, and that we \nhave an economy in the United States that values the contribution that \neverybody can make.\n  My sense in this health care debate is that the people of my State--\nand I know people around the country--are deeply dissatisfied with \nbusiness as usual. They hate the current system. They know it is not \nworking for them and their families. They know they are not able to \nmake the choices they need to make to have stability for their families \nso they can get ahead economically.\n  But, on the other hand, they are deeply worried about our capacity to \nmake it worse. It is hard to blame people when you hear the special \ninterests' rhetoric coming out of Washington, DC, or when you turn on \nyour cable television set at night and watch what people have to say. \nYou can understand why people are concerned that we have the capacity \nto make it worse.\n\n  But that is why I am so pleased about the piece of legislation the \nmajority leader has brought before us. We have never been closer to \nreforming our health care system, so we can address runaway health care \ncosts, enact insurance reform, construct stability and predictability \nin health care for families and small businesses.\n  The Senate legislation before us is that promising new way forward. \nColoradans, as I said, have not been shy at all about letting me know \nabout their views of the current system and what their concerns are \nabout what we might do.\n  Like people across the country, they know the current system does not \nwork for them. But they are worried, as I said a minute ago, that we \nare going to make it even worse.\n  This bill represents a substantial improvement over business as \nusual. I congratulate the majority leader for listening to not just a \nsmall group of people but to people across the aisle, to people all \nacross the country in crafting this piece of legislation.\n  First of all, the most important principle of the bill is that it is \npaid for. We already had about $5 trillion of debt when the last \nPresident became President. We are now at $12 trillion. There has been \nan unbelievable spike between 2000 and today. We have put an enormous \nburden--as the father of three young girls, I feel this very personally \nand very keenly--an enormous burden on our kids and our grandkids.\n  Our debt is now $12 trillion. Our entire gross domestic product--our \nentire economy--is $14 trillion. Our deficit is $1.4 trillion, 12 \npercent of our gross domestic product. That is utterly unsustainable. \nWe know the biggest driver of our medium-term deficits is rising \nMedicare and Medicaid costs, and the biggest driver of those is rising \nhealth care costs.\n  This bill, unlike Medicare Part D--a very worthy program passed \nduring the last administration--this bill is paid for. That drug \nprogram for seniors was not paid for. Instead of paying for it, instead \nof making hard choices, what we said to our kids and our grandkids was: \nYou pay the bill. By the way, that is what we have said about tax cuts. \nThat is what we have said about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We \nhave to put an end to this. This bill at least starts to head us in the \nright direction. It does not fix our fiscal crisis, but it is an \nimportant step forward.\n  As I mentioned a few minutes ago, for working families, the current \nsystem has been a complete disaster, as their income has remained flat \nor gone down, as their health care premiums have gone up by 97 percent. \nEven though there is a lot of conflict out there about what the way \nforward should be, about a specific policy choice here versus a \nspecific policy choice there, I can tell you, one thing everyone in my \nState agrees with is that their health care has not improved by 97 \npercent over the last 10 years. They are paying more and getting less. \nCoverage is getting weaker, as it gets more expensive.\n  Small businesses are getting crippled by the system we have today. \nThey pay 18 percent more than large businesses to cover their \nemployees, just because they are small. Sometimes people say to me: \nWell, Michael, don't you know that is because the pool of employees is \nsmaller? It is harder to spread the risk. I say: I understand that. But \nas a businessperson, from a business perspective, that is ridiculous--\nthe idea that a small businessperson, trying to execute their business \nplan, trying to execute their vision to grow their business, is going \nto spend 18 percent more for something and not get 18 percent more \nproductivity out of it, or not get 18 percent, in this case, better \nhealth care coverage out of it. In fact, the reverse is true. It is \nridiculous.\n  By the way, one of the things that is interesting to me about this \ndebate over a public option is that people do not seem to understand \nwhat is actually happening before our eyes. As the costs of insurance \nare going up every year, few and fewer people are able to get insurance \nthrough their employer, fewer and fewer employers are able to offer \ninsurance to their employees, which is heartbreaking for many of our \nsmall business owners because these are family businesses that for \nyears have provided health insurance to their employees. They view it \nas part of their pact with their employees to help them get ahead. But \nthey cannot do it. So they are dropping them from the rolls.\n  Where are these folks ending up, those who are now uninsured? Well, \ntwo places: Medicaid, if they are poor enough, or in the emergency \nroom, getting covered with uncompensated care that we, the taxpayers, \nare paying for.\n  We have a public option. It is the least intentional and most \nexpensive public option you can imagine. When we are talking about the \nchanges we are making here, we need to understand what is going on in \nthe daily lives of people all across our country.\n  The figures we have from the Congressional Budget Office show that \nthis bill will reduce the deficit, not add to it, will cut our deficits \nover the first 10 years by $130 billion, over the next 10 years by $650 \nbillion. That is $780 billion.\n  One thing we know about those numbers is they are not going to turn \nout to be exactly accurate. But here is the goods news: The CBO is \nunable to score the benefit of prevention. They are unable to score the \nbenefit of wellness. They are unable to score or focus on primary care \ninstead of emergency room care. There is good reason for that because \nthat comes down to execution--how well is the program implemented. \nThose of us who are proponents of reform carry a very heavy burden to \nmake sure the execution is good and that we carry this through. But the \ngood news is, if we do a good job, we will save money.\n  I want to say a word about Medicare because there has been a lot of \ndiscussion from people who are opposed to reform who are saying we are \ncutting Medicare. They are saying we are hurting seniors. But what they \nwill not tell you is that the worst possible scenario is not taking \naction now on critical Medicare reform. As I said earlier, and said in \nmany speeches, our Medicare Program, on its current path, is headed for \nfiscal crisis.\n  Policy experts on both sides of the aisle have said we need to reform \nour Medicare delivery system. We need to stop basing payments on every \nprocedure and every test. Instead, we should look at successful models \nsuch as our own Denver Health, the Rocky Mountain Health System, and \nthe Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. We know they have better quality and \nbetter outcomes, not just for seniors but for everyone.\n  This bill builds on what works locally. That means protecting the \nguaranteed Medicare benefits for every senior, and for years to come. \nIt improves Medicare solvency. We make sure doctors will not see a 20-\npercent cut in their payments. It makes the entire Medicare system more \naffordable and will save taxpayer dollars.\n  Critics say no to reform. They are content with a system that pays by \nthe test, test after test, instead of outcomes and patient-centered \ncare. That approach will assure that Medicare is bankrupt by 2017. We \nneed to do better than that for seniors. We need to protect Medicare.\n  Included in this health care reform bill is a version of a bill I \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\nbased on great work being done in Colorado. It is called the Medicare \nCare Transitions Act. We looked at the $17 billion Medicare was \nspending on hospital readmissions. Currently, one out of every five \npatients leaves the hospital and returns within the same month. We \nlooked at places in Denver and Grand Junction where the readmission \nrates are 2 percent compared to the national rate at 20 percent. What \nwe saw was that they coordinate care. As people go from place to place, \nthese health care systems track where they go with a system of \nelectronic medical records, what medications they use, what doctors \nthey see. They focus on patients--on patients--when making decisions. \nSo when we talk about these delivery systems being unnecessary, tell \nthat to the 12 million Medicare seniors who got readmitted to the \nhospital within the very first month they were let out of the hospital. \nWe owe so much more to these seniors, and we owe a lot more to the \nAmerican people.\n  Health care reform must stop the rising costs that are bankrupting \nworking families, small businesses, and our economy. If you like your \ncoverage, you should be able to keep it. We need to put an end to \ndenials based on preexisting conditions. We need to give people more \naffordable options, including a public option. One thing is clear. \nBusiness as usual cannot be an option. The debate is bigger than \npolitically charged issues. We have to keep our eye on the ball and not \nget distracted by the same old, tired, special interest politics that \nhave kept us from reforming our health care system since Harry Truman \nwas President.\n  Health care reform should not be about changing our laws on abortion. \nI think the House went astray when it adopted new language with \nunintended consequences for women. The Senate bill already makes sure \nwe do not use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion. That is why I opposed \nthe House Stupak language.\n  I want to end this morning on what I am for. I am for insurance \nreform. I am for making our small businesses more competitive by \nreining in skyrocketing health care costs. I am for reducing premiums \nfor working families. I am for more consumer choice, including the \nability to voluntarily choose a public option. By the way, one thing I \nhave noticed is that as people start to understand they are going to be \nrequired to have health insurance as part of this plan, what they are \nsaying is, I want all the options. I want a private option, a public \noption, a nonprofit option. I want to be in a position to make the best \ndecision for my family.\n  I am for reform that squeezes our wasteful spending so we can reduce \nour deficits in the long term. Throughout this entire debate, my focus \nhas been on our working families and small businesses. There is plenty \nin this bill for you.\n  The time for talking is over. We should pass this bill. But tonight \nwhat we should do is make sure we allow the Senate to debate the bill, \nto improve the bill. There are things in this bill I want to change and \nthings I want to make better in the coming weeks. But I believe that if \nwe pass this reform, we will have taken a very important step forward \nto saying we are here to honor the legacy of our parents and our \ngrandparents. We are here to say as one generation to the next that we \nare going to carry that legacy forward and make sure we are making the \nhard decisions to provide more opportunity for you, not less. This is \nonly one step of that.\n  I mentioned education earlier. I mentioned our economy earlier. My \nhope is that in this debate, what we can do is begin to learn how to \nset the special interests aside for the benefit of the American people. \nIf we can do that, there is not a doubt in my mind that we will honor \nour grandparents' legacy.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, even though America has the best doctors \nand the best nurses, our Nation spends too much on health care for what \nit gets. Because the problem in American health care will not cure \nitself, I rise in support of this motion to proceed to beginning the \ndebate about how to fix American health care.\n  Before I lay out the many provisions in Majority Leader Reid's bill \nthat constitute real reform, I wish to talk for a couple of minutes \nabout how the Senate can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to \nfix American health care. I have had a chance to visit with almost \nevery Member of the Senate in their office on this issue, to listen to \nthem, and it is very clear to me that both Democrats and Republicans \nhave valid points. I believe my party is absolutely right in saying you \ncannot fix American health care unless all Americans get good quality, \naffordable coverage. If you don't cover everybody with that kind of \ncoverage, what happens is those who are uninsured shift their bills to \nthe insured folks who are already getting shellacked, and there is an \nunderemphasis on prevention. So my party is right that to fix this, we \nhave to offer all Americans secure, quality, affordable coverage.\n  I think colleagues on the other side of the aisle have valid points \nas well. They focus on the need for marketplace forces, for choice, for \ncompetition. I subscribe to each of these principles as well.\n  I think many believe it is an absurd fantasy that before the Senate \ncompletes its work on this legislation, the Senate could actually come \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans. I simply don't share that view. \nLet me be clear: It is my intent when this bill gets to the floor to \nwork very closely with Majority Leader Reid and with all of our \ncolleagues to finally break through, to get beyond some of the \npolarization, the near brawling we have seen in townhall meetings where \nfolks sit in opposite sections depending on their political points of \nview. That is not the American way to face big challenges. This \ncertainly is such a challenge.\n  I believe fixing the economy and fixing American health care are two \nsides of the same coin. We can't spend more than 16 percent of our \ngross product on health care, spot our foreign competition hundreds of \nmillions of dollars a year, and have enough money left over to focus on \neducation, transportation, and domestic needs. The reason so many \nAmericans don't see their take-home pay go up is because health care \ngobbles up all the costs in sight. So this is certainly a big enough \nchallenge that it demands that the Senate get beyond the fighting--near \nbrawling--about this subject across the land. On the basis of the \nconversations I have had with colleagues, I continue to believe the \nSenate can break through and produce a bipartisan bill, working with \nSenator Reid, working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  In terms of the real reforms that are in Senator Reid's bill, some of \nthe most important have to do with the delivery system--the way \nAmerican health care is essentially experienced across the land. The \nfact is that today's delivery system essentially rewards inefficiency. \nPayments are based on volume rather than quality. In my part of the \ncountry, we have plans like Kaiser and Group Health, and we have \nactually been in the forefront of trying to move away from a system \nthat rewards inefficiency, rewards volume. What we have shown is that \nchanging these incentives pays off. People can be healthier and America \ncan do it for less money.\n  Senator Reid's bill begins to move in the direction of what we have \nbeen doing in our part of the country for some time. His bill promotes \nwhat are called accountable care organizations. There are also changes \nin reimbursement. Probably folks on Main Street are not familiar with \nwhat is called ``bundling.'' In effect, instead of paying for each \nspecific service, under bundling there is essentially one payment to \nreward trying to deliver care in an integrated fashion.\n  We have been able to have included in the legislation incentives to \ncare for folks at home. The majority leader included a version of the \nbill I introduced called the Independence at Home Act that is backed by \nmany colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and many Democrats as \nwell. When we think about the challenges of American health care going \nforward, we certainly ought to agree it makes sense to deliver more \ngood quality, affordable care at home, rather than forcing the sickest \nAmericans to spend a big chunk of their day fighting through traffic \nsimply to get to a doctor's office, and we have the technologies, we \nhave the trained physicians and nurse practitioners to offer these \nkinds of services\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nat home. I highlight the fact that this is real reform, it is in \nSenator Reid's bill, and Republicans and Democrats alike are behind it.\n\n  The majority leader makes a number of long overdue changes in the \nprivate health insurance market. In many respects, today the private \nhealth insurance system is simply inhumane. What we have is a system \nthat rewards cherry picking; where the private insurance companies take \nonly the healthy people and send the sick people over to government \nprograms more fragile than they are. What we need is a very different \nsystem where the private insurance companies compete on the basis of \nprice, benefit, and quality, and not who is the best at selecting out \nthe good risks.\n  Senator Reid's bill does away with the unconscionable practice of \npre-existing condition exclusions and the practice of rescission where \nthe insurance companies abruptly drop coverage for the sick. The bill \nalso does away with charging a person more simply because they are \nsick, because they are a woman, or because they work in a high-risk \njob.\n  These are very constructive insurance reforms. We are going to try to \nbuild on those as we go forward in the legislation. Colleagues should \nmake no mistake about it: The insurance changes in Senator Reid's bill \nare very real reform.\n  I wish to focus for a few minutes, though, on what I think is the \ngreat promise of this legislation for health care in the future. Since \nWorld War II, there has essentially been no market for American health \ncare. Back in the days of wage and price controls, we didn't have a way \nto get good health care to Americans and we simply said we will put it \non the backs of employers. They were patriotic citizens then, like \nthere are patriotic citizens now, and they said, We will figure out how \nto do it. We are going to have to pass on the costs in the form of \nhigher prices for goods and services. That probably made sense back \nthen. We had people essentially work at a job for 20 or 25 years, and \nafter their last day at work they got a gold watch and a dignified \nretirement. Today, there is a very different economy. The typical \nworker changes their job 11 times by the time she is 40. She needs a \ndifferent set of health care choices. She needs the opportunity to be \nempowered to go into the marketplace to hold insurance companies \naccountable and to get more value for her health care dollar. The \nmajority leader in his bill lays the foundation for this kind of \nsystem.\n  He establishes a system of what are called health insurance \nexchanges. They are kind of like farmers markets for health insurance. \nSenator Reid has improved this so that these farmers markets, these \nexchanges, could only let in good-quality plans, and under Senator \nReid's bill, it will be possible to more easily compare the plans in \nthese exchanges. This is something I have been interested in for years, \nreally going back to the days when I was co-director of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers, because I think it is simply bizarre that it is possible in \nother parts of American life--in a Costco store or any other big \nstore--to compare products, look at alternatives, have a measure of \nuniformity, and not have that in American health care.\n  What Senator Reid's bill does is set the foundation for a marketplace \nso that health care in 2009 will be dramatically different than it was, \nsay, 60 years ago, in 1949, when I was born. I don't see anybody \noutside the Capitol driving a car from 1949, but much of American \nhealth care still resembles the middle of the last century. Senator \nReid, through his legislation, lays the foundation for modernizing \nthat.\n  I would like to see more people in these new marketplaces, the \nexchanges, more quickly. Under the estimates we have been given, only \nabout 10 percent of our population would be able to enjoy the fruits of \nreal choice and real competition. Real choice and real competition in \nthat marketplace is the path to holding premiums down. My goal in the \nyears ahead is to allow every consumer--every consumer, for example, in \nNew York and Oregon--to be able to deliver an ultimatum to their \ninsurance company. That ultimatum should be: Treat me right or I am \ntaking my business elsewhere. It is that simple. That is the way we do \nit in every other part of American life.\n  By the way, that is the way it works for all of us here in the \nSenate. We belong to a real marketplace. We belong to a real exchange \ncalled the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. If a Member of \nthe Senate doesn't like his health care coverage in November of 2009, \ncome January of 2010, that Member of the Senate can take his business \nelsewhere, to another insurer that does a better job. I think that kind \nof marketplace--the marketplace every Member of the Senate now enjoys--\nought to be available to everybody else in the country. I think there \nought to be public choices. I think there ought to be private choices. \nI think all Americans ought to be able to have access to all of those \nchoices. We are not going to be able to have real insurance company \naccountability, real choice, and real competition unless we make the \nexchanges robust and get more people in.\n  To illustrate the fact that the majority leader and other leaders, \nsuch as Chairman Baucus, are open to new ideas, just yesterday the \nmajority leader and Chairman Baucus and I agreed on an approach that \nwill allow more people to enjoy the marketplace, the fruits of a \ncompetitive system, more quickly, when they indicated yesterday they \nwould support my legislation to expand access to the exchanges for \nthose who otherwise would have forgone having health insurance under \nhealth reform. Let me emphasize that--letting folks get to the \nexchanges who otherwise would have no health insurance at all. We have \nbeen able to do it. According to the CBO, we will be able to add an \nadditional million people, middle-class folks walking on an economic \ntightrope, at 10 percent or less of what it would cost to have those \npeople get their coverage through Medicaid or through subsidies. It is \nmy intent to work with the majority leader and Chairman Baucus closely \nto allow others to have a chance to be part of this kind of competitive \nsystem. I commend the majority leader and Chairman Baucus for their \ncommitment to work with me, as this bill goes to the floor, to expand \naccess to the marketplace.\n  Let me close with one last point. I see my colleague from New Mexico \nin the Chamber, and he is a welcome addition to the Senate.\n  A lot of Americans listening may wonder why the Senate is turning its \nattention to health care when there is so much economic hurt in our \nland. The fact is, fixing the economy and fixing American health care \nare literally two sides of the same coin. We have to rein in these \ncosts. We have to rein in these costs for Americans to have more take-\nhome pay, to be in a position to pay for essentials, and to allow our \nworkers to compete in ferociously challenging markets around the world.\n  It is time to move beyond the townhall brawls of this past summer and \nfor the Senate to work with Senator Reid and all colleagues to break \nthrough and deal with this critical issue, the premier long-term \nchallenge of our time for our economy, and do it in a bipartisan way. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for the motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I appreciate very much \nlistening to Senator Wyden and his comments on health care reform. He \nhas been one of the leaders when it comes to working in the Finance \nCommittee and looking for significant reforms on health care. I look \nforward to working with him in that capacity.\n  The health care reform we are debating today will impact every person \nin this country. Whether you are searching for affordable insurance for \nyourself or watching helplessly as a loved one is denied coverage, \nevery American stands to gain something through this historic \nlegislation.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the people I represent don't just \nhave a lot to gain from this reform, they also have a lot to lose if \nthis reform is not enacted. For New Mexicans, the status quo isn't an \noption. That is because without this health care reform our State is \nexpected to experience the largest increase in insurance premiums of \nany State in the Union. In 2016, without this reform, a family of four \nin New Mexico can expect to pay an astounding $28,000 a year in health \ncare premiums. That will consume more\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\nthan 56 percent of that family's projected income for the year. \nAffordability is already one of the key barriers to obtaining coverage \nin my State. Since 2000, premiums for residents have risen 110 percent. \nAs a result, almost one in four people doesn't have insurance, giving \nus the second highest uninsured rate in the Nation.\n  Enactment of this reform legislation would make as many as 249,000 \nmiddle-class New Mexico residents eligible for premium credits to ease \nthe burden of these high costs. In addition, almost 238,000 New \nMexicans would be eligible for new private coverage through the \nexchange or through their employer and another 124,000 would be \neligible for the new expanded Medicaid coverage. For the families who \nalready have insurance, they win too. They will likely see lower \npremiums, thanks to the increased competition in the market. The bottom \nline is that with this reform the vast majority of New Mexicans would \nhave access to quality, affordable health care for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Reform will also benefit New Mexico's small businesses. In 2006, less \nthan 35 percent of small businesses in my State offered coverage for \ntheir employees. That figure means our State ranks dead last in \nemployer-sponsored insurance in the Nation--a dubious distinction, to \nsay the least. I have talked to a lot of these small business owners \nover the past month. They all tell me pretty much the same thing: I \nwould love to offer coverage to my employees, but it is just too \nexpensive. They say they are having a hard time affording insurance for \ntheir own families. To those small business owners, I say that help is \non the way. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will help \nyou provide insurance to your employees by providing Federal tax \ncredits of up to 50 percent of premiums should you choose to offer \ncoverage.\n  In addition to lowering costs for individuals and families and \nhelping small businesses, this reform would also give our rural \ncommunities additional tools to provide quality, affordable health care \nfor all of their residents.\n  Of the 2 million people who call New Mexico home, about 700,000 live \nin rural areas. They are more likely to be uninsured and often must \ntravel hundreds of miles for preventive or emergency care--if they are \nable to find any care at all.\n\n  In this bill, we have included pay incentives to recruit more \nphysicians to serve in these underserved rural areas. We will improve \ndental services in rural areas, we will extend Medicare payments for \nambulances in rural areas, and we will expand the Telehealth Program so \nthat rural residents may receive specialized treatment not available in \ntheir local areas.\n  Finally, we make sure this legislation won't result in an unfunded \nmandate for our State government, which is already experiencing the \npain of budget cuts, thanks to the economic downturn. This legislation \nwould require the Federal Government to cover 100 percent of the cost \nof the Medicaid expansion from 2014 to 2016 and 95 percent of that cost \nafter that.\n  When it comes to health care today, too many New Mexicans are living \non a cliff, teetering on the edge of financial ruin. All it would take \nis an illness or job loss, and they could fall into the abyss of \nmedical invoices, bill collectors, and bankruptcies. For these New \nMexicans, the status quo isn't an option. This bill offers a life rope \nto these New Mexicans to pull them back from the precipice. Passing it \nwould provide stability and security to those who have insurance, \naffordable coverage to those who don't, and lower costs for families, \nbusinesses, and government.\n  This is a historic moment. I urge my colleagues to join me in seizing \nit. Let's begin the debate on this long-overdue legislation to reform \nour broken health care system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak in a colloquy as it evolves on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are joined by a number of the distinguished members of \nour caucus. They have thoughts they want to express. We want to discuss \na couple of points.\n  Before I turn to the Senator from Missouri, I want to make a point, \nbecause I have been listening to a lot of the discussion on the floor, \nand I have participated and listened to a lot of it on television, from \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They continue to use this \nnumber. They claim this bill will cost $800-some-odd billion and that \nis the number that has been reached as the expenditure on this bill. \nThat is a totally dishonest number. That is the ultimate shell game. \nThat is Washington cynical politics.\n  Do you know how they get to that number of $800 billion as a cost of \nthe bill? It is a 10-year number, by the way. That is a lot of money, \n$800 billion. That would run the State of New Hampshire for probably \n100 years. Missouri is a little bigger, but it would run that State for \na while, and it would probably run Alabama for a little while. South \nDakota could probably run for 200 years on that. That is not the real \ncost of this bill, though. That is not the cost of the bill.\n  The way that number was arrived at--and I think the American people \nneed to understand this. If that number was so dishonestly arrived at \nfor the number of the bill, what is wrong with the rest of the bill \nthat they haven't been told about? That was a 10-year score for what \nthe bill cost was, but they don't start spending money under this bill \nuntil the fourth and fifth year. In fact, the cynicism exceeds that. \nThey couldn't get the score they wanted--they couldn't get the score \nthey wanted from CBO, so they moved back another year in the 10-year \ncycle. They went from 4 years to 5 years as to the starting point of \nmost of the spending in this bill.\n\n  What they claim to the American people is the 10-year bill is going \nto cost about $800-plus billion. But what they don't tell the American \npeople is they are not spending anything in the first 4 or 5 years of \nthe bill. No, they do raise your taxes throughout the 10-year period. \nThey do cut Medicare throughout the 10-year period. But they don't \nspend the money. They don't start the programs until the year 2014, \nwhen this bill is fully phased in.\n  When all these new programs, this massive expansion of entitlements \nis created, brand-new entitlements, when all this new spending occurs, \nthis bill will cost $2.5 trillion over that 10-year period--$2.5 \ntrillion. That is the real cost of this bill. That is how this \ngovernment is going to grow in a 10-year window as a result of this \nspending.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think most of us understand we already have \na huge debt problem in this Nation. We are passing on to our kids a \ncountry with so much debt they are not going to be able to afford it. \nEvery year for the next 10 years, without this health care bill, the \nPresident has proposed budgets which will run a $1 trillion deficit, \nevery year, on average, for the next 10 years. Sometime this month, we \nare going to have to raise the debt ceiling of this country because we \nreached $12 trillion in debt. Then it is going to have to be raised \nagain because we are running up these massive deficits.\n  The debt owed by this country will exceed 80 percent of our gross \nnational product--80 percent of our gross national product at the end \nof that 10-year period--and will exceed 60 percent of our gross \nnational product within 2 years. Those are unsustainable numbers. Yet a \nbill is being proposed that is going to expand the size of government \nby $2.5 trillion.\n  It is alleged it is paid for, and we are going to get into a \ndiscussion in some depth because I think that is an equally cynical \nnumber as a result of bait and switch.\n  I just wished to clear the air as to the real cost of this bill \nbecause I found it uniquely cynical that it would be represented that \nthis bill costs $890 billion, whatever the number is. It does call into \nissue the credibility of the rest of the numbers that are being thrown \nout by the other side of the aisle when they use that number, which is \na 5-year number that they claim covers the 10-year cost, when they \ndon't do anything in the first 5 years.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Missouri. I \nunderstand he wishes to speak and then we will go to the Senator from \nAlabama and then the Senator from South Dakota and\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\nthen have a discussion about some of the issues, such as costs, how it \naffects Medicare, how it affects small businesses, how it is going to \naffect your personal insurance.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. I \nwish to clarify some things he said because they are truly important. I \nwish to make sure everybody understands it because Senator Gregg, in \nhis position on the Budget Committee, as well as his other positions in \nwriting this bill, is intimately acquainted with the costs of this \nbill.\n  The cost for 2010 to 2019, how much was the cost for that 10-year \nperiod?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is $1.2 trillion because between the period 2010 and \n2014, there are no expenditures because they don't start the programs \nuntil 2014.\n  Mr. BOND. Is this the total expenditure or are these just the \nexpenditures that are not covered after 2014, that are not covered by \nthe so-called tax or revenue raisers? In other words, does this all go \nonto the debt?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, those are total expenditures which are represented to \nbe offset by cuts in Medicare, increased fees, and increased taxes.\n  Mr. BOND. Cuts in Medicare. How much are the cuts in Medicare?\n  Mr. GREGG. When fully phased in, in the 10-year period, 2014 to 2023, \nthe Medicare cuts are $1.1 trillion.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, $1.1 trillion cuts in Medicare. How much \nare the taxes and the other ``revenue raisers'' in that period?\n  Mr. GREGG. The taxes and fees during that period--this period, when \nit is fully phased in--are approximately $1.5 trillion.\n  Mr. BOND. So how much will go onto the debt? How much is uncovered?\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, if you accept these assumptions that we are \ngoing to cut Medicare by $1 trillion and take that to create a new \nentitlement instead of using it to help Medicare be more solvent and \nthen we are going to raise taxes and fees by $1 trillion--remember, \nmost of this is not going to come out of the wealthy. It is going to \ncome out of small businesses and higher premium costs to people on \ninsurance or it is going to come out of HI taxes. If you accept that \nlogic, which I find to be a bit of a reach, then it will not have any \nimpact on the deficit in that timeframe because they have cut Medicare \nto pay for it, and they have raised all these taxes to pay for it.\n  Mr. BOND. My friend has been very active in the Budget Committee. How \nmany times have we cut Medicare, have we allowed Medicare cuts to go \ninto effect? I think that is a rather rare occurrence, isn't it?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is a fascinating question because I was chairman of \nthe Budget Committee the last time we tried to do something in the area \nof the rate of Medicare costs because we received a directive from the \nMedicare trustees that Medicare had to be made more cost-effective or \nelse it was going to go broke. So we suggested, when I was chairman of \nthe Budget Committee--and everybody in this room voted for it, by the \nway--that we should reduce the rate of growth of Medicare by $10 \nbillion on a $1 million timeframe. In other words, Medicare was going \nto spend $1 trillion over a period, 5 years. We were going to suggest a \n$10 billion reduction in that rate of growth which was going to be paid \nfor by requiring people who were getting Part D premiums and had high \nincome to pay for part of their premiums--people such as Warren Buffett \nwould not be subsidized by people working down at the local restaurant.\n  We did not get one vote from the other side of the aisle. We passed \nit by having the Vice President sit in the chair and break the tie. \nThat was $10 billion over 5 years.\n  So I think this idea that you are going to do $1 trillion over 10 \nyears and pay for this--first off, if you are going to reduce spending \nor raise Medicare taxes, it should go to pay for Medicare solvency \nbecause Medicare is insolvent. It shouldn't go to create a new \nentitlement. Senior citizens, paying into Medicare all their lives, \nshould not have their money taken to start a brand-new entitlement for \nother people, and that is what this bill does.\n  As a practical matter, we are not going to do that. We know that. We \nknow this is all going on the debt. Ninety percent of this is going to \nend up on the debt.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire because he has been \na very solid, consistent, credible voice. What he is pointing out today \nis that the legislation we are debating has major implications for \nevery American family, every American taxpayer, every American small \nbusiness.\n  In the 1992 election, President Clinton's famous slogan was: ``It's \nthe economy, stupid.'' Seventeen years later, it is again the economy \nthat is a major issue facing the people. But this time the majority \nparty does not seem to be paying attention. Instead, the majority has \nused its supermajority position to spend trillions of dollars that we \ndon't have, including a misnamed stimulus that stimulated the growth of \nthe deficit and the Federal Government but not jobs. We had takeovers \nand bailouts of banks, insurance companies, and major auto \nmanufacturers. They have adopted a budget that would double the debt--\nthe debt our grandchildren owe--in 5 years and triple it in 10.\n  It is little wonder that the unemployment rate has skyrocketed, \nbecause employers are afraid to hire. Families are seeing their budgets \nstrapped such as never before. But the bill before us is a crowning \nachievement of the drive to destroy our economy and hope for the \nfuture.\n  Just 1 year after a narrowly averted financial collapse, with \nunemployment at its highest level since 1983, instead of how to create \njobs, we are debating a bill that will take over one-sixth of our \neconomy and likely kill jobs.\n\n  Don't get me wrong, our health care system is in need of reform. It \ncosts too much, too many people are uninsured, there are too many junk \nlawsuits and too much defensive medicine and not enough focus on \nprevention and wellness.\n  While we all agree reform is necessary, the American people expect us \nto answer the questions: How much will reform cost and can we afford \nit? Will it lower health care costs? Can you keep your current plan? \nWhat role will the government play?\n  The answer to two and three on this bill is: No, it will not lower \nour health care costs; no, you will not be able to keep your current \nplan.\n  Then the question is: Who will make health care decisions? We are \nseeing evidence that they have government committees that say when you \ncan get a mammogram, when you should get Pap screening.\n  Will Americans and Members of Congress have time to evaluate what is \nin the legislation? We hope today, as yesterday, that we will bring out \nfor the American people the cost of this bill because what we are \nseeing in this massive pot, 2,047 pages, is there is a lack of \ncommonsense reform. It is filled with costly budget gimmicks and asks \nthe people of America to spend over $2 trillion on proposals that will \nheap a mountain of debt on our children and grandchildren.\n  Two trillion dollars is an almost unfathomable amount of money. But \nin Washington, trillion is the new billion, and that is not the kind of \nhealth care reform Americans want. It is not reform at all. It spends \ntoo much, it taxes too much and it cuts Medicare too much and does not \nprovide reforms we need. Nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes will be added \non the backs of the American people, $28 billion in taxes on \nbusinesses, which will kill jobs at a time when we have over 10 percent \nunemployment and even higher if you include the number of people who \nare no longer working or underemployed. These higher costs will \nultimately be passed on to American workers and consumers.\n  Anybody who thinks you are going to tax health care insurers, device \nproviders and expect that those costs will not be passed on to the \nconsumers--that is you and me, Madam President. The head of the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have \nsaid these higher taxes are passed along, and they will land on \nfamilies, small businesses, and individuals.\n  It will also force Americans into a government-run health care plan. \nIt will ration care and limit access to lifesaving treatments and put a \nbureaucrat between you and your doctor. In life, two things you can \ncount on are said to be death and taxes. I didn't expect to see them \nboth in a health care reform proposal.\n\n[[Page S11914]]\n\n  We call this a pig in a poke. The only way to sell a pig in a poke is \nto hide from Americans what their tax dollars are buying. If I were to \noutline all the problems in this 2,000-page bill, we would be here \nuntil Thanksgiving. It is sort of like a mosquito in a nudist colony--\nthere are so many targets to attack in this bill we don't know which \none to hit.\n  Let me give you just a few. As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed \nout, the real cost of this bill to the American people is a whole lot \nmore than they admit. The majority is claiming that the bill only costs \n$850 billion, but the way the majority gets to say that is because they \nare pulling a great smoke-and-mirrors trick.\n  Even more incredible is the Democrats' claim their bill will cut the \ndeficit. It is a great scheme, but no one outside Washington actually \nbelieves this health care bill will do anything but increase costs and \npile more debt on our kids and grandkids, and they are right.\n  Right now, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee has pointed \nout, the national debt already exceeds $12 trillion. This bill will put \nmore on that. The true cost of the bill is not just a ``he said, she \nsaid.'' Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office acknowledges \nthat the majority's bill includes gimmicks that hide the true cost of \nthe bill.\n  Part of the majority's scheme to hide from Americans the true cost is \nthe great stunt, as the Senator from New Hampshire described, to push \nback implementation of parts of the reform to 2014 but start collecting \nmoney in taxes now. That means tax now and pay later. That sure makes \nyour numbers look good, doesn't it?\n  For example, Medicaid expansion does not begin until 2014. That is in \nsection 2001. Section 1311 says health insurance exchanges are not \nfully operational until January 2014. Section 1323 says a public health \ninsurance option is not available until 2014. Most of the major \ninsurance reforms, however, in section 1253 take effect in 2014.\n  The tax on health insurance starts in 2010. That is section 9010. \nSection 9009 says the tax on medical devices starts in 2010. Section \n9008 says the tax on pharmaceutical manufacturing starts in 2010. That \nis even worse than the Senate Finance Committee bill which initially \nhad it starting in 2013, but it is a great gimmick to allow them to \nhide the cost of the bill. Claiming savings of $122 billion by \nrecording taxes over 10 years and only scoring costs over 6 years would \nget an officer in a publicly traded corporation sent to jail. Move \nover, Bernie Madoff. Tip your hat to a trillion-dollar scam. This is \nmagnificent, and that is in this bill. I am glad all Americans can read \nit. They can check out the sections I cited.\n  Even the Congressional Budget Office has called ``bull'' on this \nstunt, saying it would be difficult to maintain the savings the \nmajority has been touting. No wonder. And the true cost, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire has pointed out, is $2.5 trillion. But it will also \nbe increasing taxes. In fact, everyone will be taxed one way or \nanother. Forget what the President promised about no taxes. Sections \n9004 and 9010 will tax Americans who have insurance. Section 1501 will \ntax Americans who do not have insurance--almost $8 billion. Taxes will \nbe placed on medical device manufacturers, section 9009; and as the CBO \nhas said, those taxes will be passed on in the form of higher prices \nand thus in the form of higher insurance premiums.\n  Because of the tax on health insurers, section 9010, the CBO and the \nJoint Committee have said these taxes will be passed on in the form of \nhigher health care premiums. Pricewater-houseCoopers says that is $487 \na year per family. That is how much these taxes on the health insurers \nand health payment plans will cost the average family.\n  Employers will be taxed. About $2 billion in new taxes will be placed \non employers who do not meet government approved health care plans. \nThat is section 1513. That is where American workers are going to pay \nfor it because that is where they lose their jobs. Headlines in the \nWall Street Journal and letters I have seen from leaders of businesses \nsay we are not expanding; we cannot afford to expand; we cannot afford \nto take on more employees.\n  Why are we having a jobless recovery? Because the threats of \nWashington's overspending, overcontrolling, overtaxing, and \noverregulating are telling prospective employers that they are about to \nhit the ditch with all the things the Government is putting on them.\n  For all of the taxes and mandates, according to CBO, about 5 million \nAmericans would lose their employer coverage. That is because the costs \nwould go up, the regulations would go up. Currently, 83 percent of \nAmericans have health insurance, and they are concerned that it costs \ntoo much. Americans want affordable health care, but this bill raises \nthe cost of health care. New taxes and mandates will be passed on to \nAmerican families, the American taxpayers, and American small \nbusinesses.\n  The bill still leaves 24 million Americans without insurance. \nAccording to the CBO, the government-run plan will have higher \npremiums, and the CBO said it will drive up the cost of health care. \nThis was supposed to lower the cost of health care. It will not do \nanything of the kind.\n  To sum up, $2 trillion in more spending gets the American taxpayer, \nin the 2,074 pages, a Federal bureaucracy that increases the cost of \nhealth care, raises premiums, slashes Medicare for seniors, and puts \nunfunded burdens on States.\n  Let me just make two last points: The States, according to CBO, will \nget coverage for these new Medicaid eligibles for the 2 years that they \nwill get covered and then they will dump it on the States--$25 billion. \nThere is a $25 billion cost.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I were both Governors of our \nStates. I can tell you, States do not need that kind of burden, \nparticularly in their difficult circumstances.\n  Slashing Medicare for seniors? In Missouri, Medicare already only \npays 80 percent of the costs. More and more hospitals and doctors have \nto limit the number of Medicare patients they can accept. If we \ncontinue, and if they push through this Medicare cut, then fewer and \nfewer Medicare patients are going to be able to get health care.\n  I hope my colleagues will listen to what the American people are \ntelling us and vote against the bill. That is certainly the message I \nam getting from Missouri.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Bond. He has certainly \ndelineated some of the fiscal impossibilities in this bill, as has our \nformer Budget chairman, now ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nJudd Gregg. He studied this very hard. The information he provided to \nthis Congress and to the American people is accurate.\n  I have tried to think what I should say about this bill this morning \nand be realistic and honest and boil it down to its essence. The 2,000 \npages that sit on that desk, how should we talk about it?\n  Let me just say the claim from our colleagues is that they have a \ngreat plan to reform health care and it will fix the problems in health \ncare. We do have problems in health care that need to be fixed. They \nare going to provide methods and additional funding and provide \nmillions of people with insurance who didn't have it before--although \n24 million will remain uninsured. At the same time, they will save $130 \nbillion over 10 years, and we are supposed to be grateful and say how \npleased we are that you have been able to pull off this event.\n  But the first reaction most American people have had, and it is a \nsound one, is, wait a minute, that is pretty dubious. How can you do \nthat? Do you remember that song from the ``Sound of Music''? ``Nothing \ncomes from nothing, nothing ever could,'' sang Julie Andrews.\n  The result is the phrase I came up with: ``Shell game.'' Senator \nGregg used that phrase. I think that is exactly what we are talking \nabout. When it became obvious to everybody who could add that this \ngreat vision, the wild chimera they had that they could do all these \nthings, would not work as they dreamed it, the mountebanks began their \nchicanery.\n  In my remarks I will not attempt to point out all the manipulations \nin this bill, just some of the more obvious that are inescapable.\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\n  First, you ask: Why do they do this? The answer is the numbers don't \nadd up. They cannot make the numbers do what they want them to do. So \nthey either have to be honest and talk about massive cuts openly or \nmassive tax increases. The American people are not sure about that. To \nadd a whole new monumental health care program at a time of colossal \nfinancial stress in our country, with debts the likes of which our \nNation has never ever seen before, are we now going to start off on a \nmonumental multitrillion-dollar bill that will not pay for itself?\n  We have this great promise, and it is not adding up. Do they slow \ndown? Do they begin to think if they can't do everything they promised \nin the campaign, and they would love to do, and they wanted to do, what \nprogress can they make step by step in a rational way that we can \nafford in this time of unemployment and unprecedented deficits? No, \nthat is not what they decided to do.\n  What they decided to do is go forward anyway and call anyone who had \nthe temerity to say their ``emperor has no clothes,'' that they are \n``Dr. No,'' they are against everything. They don't believe in any \nreform.\n  That is kind of the idea we are hearing, and that is not correct.\n  The bill is just too much, it goes too far, too fast, and costs too \nmuch. We don't have the money. The American people know this. That is \nwhy they oppose this bill. They are not opposed to reform and progress. \nThey are opposed to this legislation, this 2-foot tall, 3-foot tall, \n2,000-page piece of legislation.\n  They don't dislike President Obama, but they don't like this policy \nhe is trying to promote. You say: Let's have some facts about it. I \ncan't explain everything, but I want to share a few things.\n  Madam President, I ask to be notified after 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. A critical, essential part of fixing a broken health \ncare system is to end the growing problem of payments to our doctors. \nRepublicans and Democrats have not been good on this issue in the past, \nbut the problem grows worse each year. Essentially, in the balanced \nbudget amendment of 1997 we limited the amount of payments to doctors. \nAfter a while it became clear the cuts were too severe, and each year \nwe put money back in. But the law still mandates major cuts. In fact, \ntoday if we don't do what we call the doctor fix each year, they will \nhave a 23-percent reduction in reimbursements, they get paid less. This \nis for Medicare. And they get paid less for Medicare than other \ninsurance already, so doctors are going to quit doing it if we have a \n23-percent reduction in what they get paid for doing their work.\n  How much does it cost to permanently fix that as the medical \nprofession assumed we were going to do and as the President and his \nteam have indicated they plan to do? It costs $250 billion. That is a \nlot of money. That is not a new program, this is an obligation that we \nhave now. Does this plan fix that? It fixes it for 1 year. So it goes \nout 1 year and then the CBO score assumes the doctor payments will drop \n23 percent and be 23 percent lower for 9 years.\n  If we add that up, that is $250 billion. It allows the folks in the \nknow here to manipulate the numbers and hide a $250 billion debt we \nowe. We can't cut doctors that much, and we are not going to do it. We \nhave not been doing it, and we will fix it every year, in fact, and \nthat is--what I will say is, we will spend the $250 billion, and it \nshould be in this bill. They didn't do it.\n  Just a few weeks ago, they met in this secret room down the hall, and \nthey got to talking and said: What are we going to do about the \ndoctors? How are we going to fix the doctors?\n  We could raise taxes.\n  Well, we raised taxes $500 billion. We can't raise them any more. Can \nwe cut Medicare?\n  Gosh, we have cut it $500 billion. We can't do that.\n  What can we do? We promised the doctors fix to get them their pay.\n  So they offered--it would be hilarious if it weren't so serious--they \noffered legislation a few weeks ago to just pay the doctors all this \nmoney permanently, outside of the health care reform in a separate \nbill, every penny of it going to the debt, unpaid for.\n  Even 13 Democrats couldn't swallow that. They voted no, and it \nfailed. But the House did it. They passed it, did they not, I ask \nSenator Gregg, unpaid for? Horrible. Another $250 billion added to our \ndebt.\n  So that is a shell game. It is like you have a hole in your roof and \nyou don't want to spend the money to fix it, so you move across the \nhall into another room and pretend the hole isn't there. Somehow you \nare not going to fix it when you know you have to fix it.\n  They say: Don't worry. See, our plan is budget neutral. It is deficit \nneutral.\n  If you take the $250 billion, one thing right there, it is not \nneutral. It is in deficit already. It is in deficit already. You have \nto watch that pea and see how it moves around in the shell. But what we \nneed to have a sense of is that this is a program we have never had \nbefore. It not only adds to the debt by not fixing the doctor payments, \nit raids existing programs, Medicare and Medicaid, both of which are in \nserious trouble. It raids them in the first 10 years and, as Senator \nGregg said, much more later, $549 billion. And it raises taxes $493.6 \nbillion. So it is pretty easy to say I have a deficit-neutral program \nif I assume I am going to take $500 billion out of Medicare and raise \ntaxes $493 billion. It is budget neutral. Everybody should thank me. \nThat is what the paper said the other day: Budget neutral. We are so \nproud of ourselves.\n\n  The American public are not buying this. They are a little bit \nskeptical. Medicare is going broke. Everyone knows that. We have been \nworking on that for a number of years. All of us are concerned about \nthis iceberg in front of the Titanic which is Medicare's deficiency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  We need to save this program before we create a new one. It is so \nsimple. If we are going to raise taxes $500 billion, has anybody asked \nwhere that money should go? Should the $500 billion in new taxes go to \ncreate a new program or maybe should it be used to put Medicare on \nsound footing or maybe it should be used to pay for military \nexpenditures that have the highest budget in years, or maybe to reduce \nthe debt which, I point out to friends and colleagues, is the greatest \ndebt this Nation has ever seen. There has been nothing like it ever. In \n2008, our debt was $5.8 trillion. In 5 years, 2014, it will be $11.8 \ntrillion. In 2019, it will be $17.3 trillion, tripling in 10 years. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office score, it does not include \nmoney to fund the health care program.\n  How big are those numbers? I won't spend a lot of time on it. I will \npoint out that people can understand when you borrow money, this debt \ndoesn't come from thin air. You borrow it. China, other places loan us \nmoney. We owe them money. That is how we get the money. And look at the \ninterest rate. My goodness. Alabama's budget is about $8 billion a \nyear; $800 billion in this year is 100 years of our budget. The \ninterest the United States paid on our debt in 2009 was $170 billion. \nThat is a lot of money. The Federal highway bill is $40 billion. All of \nthe Federal highway spending is around that amount. But in 10 years, \naccording to the CBO, we are going to be paying in that 1 year interest \nof $799 billion. It is like nothing we have ever seen before. That is \nwhy people say our spending is on an unsustainable course.\n  The first thing we need to do to bring spending under control is to \nfix the critical problems that must be met. You don't start new \nprograms that are likely to spiral out of control and far exceed the \nprognostications we have seen today.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share my thoughts. I am glad \nour colleagues are here. I know others would like to talk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I appreciate the great job done by my \ncolleagues from Missouri, Alabama, and New Hampshire in pointing out \nmany of the concerns we have with regard to this bill and why we think \nthis is a bad direction to go.\n  You have heard my colleagues talk about a massive expansion of \ngovernment, tax increases, premium increases; obviously, the very \nserious problem we have with our national\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\ndebt and the deficits we are racking up every single year, to the tune \nof about $1 trillion or north of there, $1.4 trillion last year, on a \npathway to hit that target this year.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the other side talk repeatedly about \nRepublicans not having their own solution. I have to say, maybe the \nreason they haven't been seeing the Republican solution is because they \nhave been hiding behind this voluminous 2,100-page bill at a cost of \n$1.2 billion per page. Republicans--hundreds of times, if not \nthousands--have come to the floor and outlined a step-by-step solution \nto dealing with the health care crisis and the concerns most Americans \nhave which is the high cost of health care. Unfortunately, many of my \ncolleagues on the other side perhaps have not been able to see that \nbecause they can't see around this $2.5 trillion expansion of the \nFederal Government they seem intent on pushing through the Senate. \nRepublicans have talked about buying insurance across State lines, \nsmall business health plans, tort reform, incentives for wellness and \nchronic disease management. There is a whole range of things that could \nbe done to address the concerns of the American people about the high \ncost of health care that do not involve a $2.5 trillion expansion of \nthe government, a 2,100-page bill, at a cost of $1.2 billion per page.\n  The other thing I have heard my colleagues say is we have to do \nsomething. People in this country are dealing about the high cost of \nhealth care. They are. We all hear it. We hear it from small \nbusinesses, from families, and from individuals. Everybody is concerned \nabout the high cost of health care. In fact, a number of my colleagues \non the other side have said of all the bankruptcies that occur every \nyear, most occur because of the high cost of health care. Get this, \nAmerica: Under their proposal, you will go bankrupt sooner. Because \nthey drive the cost of health care up. They don't do anything to bend \nthe cost curve down.\n  I want to show a chart which points out what happens to the cost \ncurve under the Democratic plan we are talking about. The blue \nrepresents the current cost curve. That is the increase in health care \ncosts we would see if nothing is done, year-over-year increases into \nthe future. What we would expect, if we were going to reform health \ncare, is that line starting to bend down a little bit so that health \ncare increases go down over time instead of up.\n  What happens? Under this proposal--and this is the CBO; this isn't \nwhat I am saying or any of my Republican colleagues, this is what the \nCongressional Budget Office says--the Democratic plan we are talking \nabout increases the cost of health care. It bends the cost curve up; \n$160 billion more will be spent on health care if their plan gets \nenacted. All those people who are concerned about the high cost of \nhealth care today are not getting any relief under the Democratic plan. \nIn fact, their lives will get much worse--in particular, those who \nalready have health care.\n  There are some in this proposal who will get some subsidies to buy \ninsurance in a health care exchange. That affects about 19 million \nAmericans. But there are 182 million Americans who currently have \nhealth care who, if this bill passes, are going to be faced with higher \ntaxes and higher premiums. That is the way it works. They are \nineligible to get any subsidies to buy insurance. In fact, they don't \nhave any more options available to them. What they are facing is higher \ntaxes that they will be faced with under this bill, as well as higher \npremium costs.\n  If you are the average person who is worried about cost, which I \nthink most Americans are, and you are watching what is happening here \nin Washington, you have to be asking yourself: What is the whole \npurpose of going through a health care reform debate if, in fact, it \ndoesn't do anything to drive down the cost of health care?\n  My colleagues have pointed out that when you spend $2.5 trillion, \nwhen you expand the Federal Government by that amount, when you raise \ntaxes on medical device manufacturers, on prescription drugs, on health \nplans themselves, and when you cut Medicare providers and, if you \nbelieve this, this is something that seems hard to fathom, that any of \nthis would ever take effect, but this $2.5 trillion is paid for in the \nform of Medicare cuts and tax increases, tax increases when it is fully \nimplemented over a 10-year period, as the Senator from New Hampshire \npointed out, about $1.2 trillion, about $1.1 trillion in Medicare \ncuts--who in this Chamber believes that $1.1 trillion in Medicare cuts \nis going to occur? There was a discussion between the Senator from New \nHampshire and the Senator from Missouri about what happened a few years \nago when the Senator from New Hampshire was chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and proposed cutting $10 billion out of Medicare over a 5-\nyear period, which amounts to $2 billion a year. What we are talking \nabout here is $1.1 trillion over 10 when fully implemented or $100 \nbillion a year. When he proposed cutting $2 billion a year over 5 out \nof Medicare, there wasn't a single Democratic vote in support of that. \nIn fact, the Vice President had to come back from a trip to Pakistan to \nvote on it to try and reduce Medicare by $10 billion. They are talking \nabout, when it is fully implemented, $1 trillion in Medicare cuts. Do \nyou know who that hits?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is important to know where that cut is proposed to \nprimarily fall. Is Medicare Advantage used by a number of seniors in \nSouth Dakota?\n  Mr. THUNE. It is. I assume it is in New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Under this plan, it will be eliminated for all intents and \npurposes.\n  Mr. THUNE. That is where a big share of the savings is going to hit, \nsenior citizens, right squarely between the eyes, if they get benefits \nunder Medicare Advantage. In addition, $135 billion comes from \nhospitals; $15 billion from nursing homes; $40 billion from home health \nagencies; $8 billion from hospices. Does anybody believe all that will \nhappen? And if it doesn't happen, guess what, it all goes on the \nFederal debt.\n  I thought it was interesting that last week when the President was in \nAsia, the Chinese raised the issue with him about what happens if \nhealth care reform passes. They weren't worried about universal \ncoverage or a public option. They were worried about what impact it is \ngoing to have on the deficit.\n  According to the New York Times and their reporting on his trip:\n\n       The Chinese wanted to know in painstaking detail how the \n     health care plan would affect the deficit, said one \n     participant.\n\n  They are worried about their investment because they are the biggest \nbuyer of American debt. What happens to all these Medicare cuts that \nare proposed? We couldn't get 51 votes to cut $2 billion a year out of \nMedicare a few short years ago, and they are talking about cutting, \nwhen it is fully implemented, $100 billion a year. Does anybody believe \nwe will cut $15 billion out of nursing homes? I don't think so. Here we \nare. How do we pay for it?\n  If it isn't paid for in Medicare cuts or tax increases, it all goes \non the Federal debt which is growing at over a trillion dollars a year.\n  This is a bad deal for the American taxpayer. It is a bad deal for \nthe 182 million Americans who already have insurance. They don't get \nanything out of this. What do they get? Higher taxes and higher \npremiums.\n  Listen to what CBO says: $160 billion in additional health care costs \nover this time period. It bends the cost curve not down but up. That is \nwhat we get. That is why so many business organizations have come out \nopposed to this, because they know the impact it will have on small \nbusinesses. The best way to get health care coverage to more people in \nAmerica, as long as we continue to have an employer-based health care \nsystem, is to get people a job. People who are struggling with the \neconomy right now and losing jobs, the thing we ought to be doing is \nfiguring out how can we provide incentives for small businesses to put \npeople back to work, not how can we kill jobs by raising taxes on small \nbusinesses.\n  That is exactly what we are doing right here. That is why every \nbusiness organization--the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, to the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \nWholesaler-Distributors, right on down the list--is opposed to this \nbill. They know the impact it would have on small businesses and their \nability to create jobs. The best\n\n[[Page S11917]]\n\nway--best way--you can get health insurance today in America is to get \na job. This bill kills jobs.\n  I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to share the same sorts of \nconcerns as my colleague from South Dakota. I share the concerns, more \nimportantly, of citizens all across Louisiana who have echoed those \nsame thoughts to me over and over again as I have traveled the State. \nLike so many of my colleagues, I have spent a lot of time these last \nfew months reaching out to my constituents, my fellow citizens in \nLouisiana, in every part of the State.\n  During the August recess, obviously, there were lots of townhall \nmeetings around the Nation. I held 21 in Louisiana, in every corner of \nthe State. Since then, I have held six more townhall meetings. I \ncontinue to do other types of outreach. For instance, yesterday--since \nwe had a 1-day opportunity--I flew home specifically to do a few \nthings, including having a roundtable of doctors, including two past \npresidents of the AMA, other health care providers, small business \nrepresentatives, leaders in the pro-life community, and it was a \nroundtable discussion specifically to focus on the Reid bill.\n  In all that process, since the August recess and even before, I have \nheard certain themes over and over again, no matter where I was in \nLouisiana. One of those themes was great concern about what this \nCongress is thinking of doing on health care but not just because of \nthe significance of health care, which is vitally important, which is \npersonal to every American, but also because of how it fits into a \ntrend so many Louisianians and so many Americans are seeing over the \npast year--a trend of dramatically increasing Federal Government power \nand intervention and dramatically increasing Federal Government \nspending and debt.\n  People have been passionate about health care. Again, part of that is \nbecause that is a very personal issue, and a bill such as this affects \nliterally every single American. But, again, a big part of it has been \nthat Louisianians are also connecting the dots. They see a bigger \npicture, which concerns them. Louisianians have been connecting the \ndots to a government takeover of banks and insurance companies and car \ncompanies, with the CEO of GM literally being fired and hired in the \nOval Office, and now, potentially, one-sixth of the U.S. economy \nthrough health care.\n  So there is a broader concern and theme I have heard over and over, \nwhich is an explosion of Federal Government power and intervention and \nan explosion of Federal Government spending and debt. This bill, \nunfortunately, does nothing except to confirm my constituents' worst \nfears in that regard. It is more of the same. It is more of that theme. \nIt is another big dot they will be connecting in that trend, and I \nshare that concern.\n  One specific issue that goes to that concern is the so-called \ngovernment option or public option because that strikes a lot of \npeople, including me, as a big, open door to dramatically increasing \nthe Federal Government's role and dominance in health care in our \ncountry--one-sixth of our economy. Why do I say that? I truly believe \nthe government option--if this bill passed or anything similar to it \npassed--would be the dominant option overnight and, perhaps, the only \noption in a few years.\n  Let me explain why. I will just point to one provision, which is the \nso-called pay-or-play mandate on business. Under this Senator Reid \nbill, as under previous versions of this idea, such as the Senate HELP \nCommittee bill, a business--virtually any business in the country--\nwould, for the first time, have a legal mandate, and the mandate would \nbe to provide health insurance up to a certain minimum defined by \nFederal bureaucrats or the business would have a choice. The choice \nwould be, if you do not want to provide that health insurance, well, \nyou can write a penalty or fee check to the government instead.\n  What is wrong with that? Well, the penalty or fee check in this bill \nis pretty much set at $750 per employee per year. How does that equate \ninto a business's bottom line in the choice businesses would face? \nWell, businesses that do provide health insurance nationally pay an \naverage of not $750 per employee per year but $6,100 per employee per \nyear. So what sort of choice do you think that is going to present to \nbusiness? What sort of result would you expect?\n  In this brave new world, if the bill passes, everyone is guaranteed \ncoverage in some form or fashion, and business has a choice: $6,100 per \nemployee per year or $750 per employee per year. I think, for a lot of \nsmall businesses under extreme competitive pressure, that is not going \nto be a hard choice. It is going to be an easy choice. The result for \ntens of millions of Americans who have coverage now they are reasonably \nsatisfied with through their employer, the result is going to be \ngetting dumped off that coverage, with businesses saying: Well, there \nare other options now. There is the government option. Good luck. We \ncan't afford it. We have to be competitive. We have to go with our \nbottom-line decision--$6,100 per employee per year or $750 per employee \nper year. I think the clear result will be tens of millions of \nAmericans getting dumped off coverage they have now that they are \nreasonably satisfied with.\n  Do not take my word for it. Other outside experts, the Lewin Group \nand others, say dumping will occur and could, in fact, be massive; tens \nof millions of Americans--under their analysis of a previous bill that \nhad largely the same provisions--over 110 million Americans. So that is \na problem with regard to ballooning Federal Government intervention, \npower, domination of the marketplace.\n  Again, as I said a few minutes ago, another part of that theme and \nconcern I heard over and over was ballooning Federal Government \nspending and debt. Here again, this Reid bill does nothing to allay \nthose fears. In fact, it does a lot to increase those fears.\n  There has been a lot of talk and a lot of reports of the CBO score of \n$848 billion over 10 years. First of all, $848 billion is a lot of \nmoney. That is a lot of Federal Government spending and growth. It is \nhard to get your hands around that figure. What does that mean? If \nsomeone had started spending $1 million a day when Jesus Christ was \nborn and kept spending $1 million a day, we would not yet be up to that \nfigure. So that is a lot of money.\n  But what is worse, that figure is artificially low. The true cost of \nthe bill is much greater. There are a number of budget gimmicks the \nranking member on Budget, Senator Gregg, and others have talked about \nthat prove that $848 billion figure is truly low compared to the full \ncost of the bill.\n  What am I talking about? Well, the biggest budget gimmick is the fact \nthat the spending side of the bill does not kick in for the first 4 \nyears. The tax side, of course, as always, kicks in immediately. So the \ntax increases, the fee increases, et cetera, kick in immediately. But \nthe benefit spending side of the bill does not kick in for the first 4 \nyears. So that is what will occur in the first 10 years of the bill's \nlife, should it be passed. Therefore, in that CBO score of the first 10 \nyears, what the CBO is scoring is 10 years of tax increases and only 6 \nyears of spending. So that is a huge budget gimmick which helps produce \nthat artificially low $848 billion or so.\n  In fact, we should be looking at the first 10 years of full \nimplementation; in other words, the first 10 years when not only all \nthe tax provisions are kicked in but everything on the benefits \nspending side is kicked in. That is basically from 2014 to 2024. What \nare the numbers there when you look at the real first 10 years, the \nfirst 10 years of full implementation? The real numbers are not $848 \nbillion--as big a figure as that is, spending $1 million a day since \nJesus Christ was born and you still would not be up to it--but there \nthe analysis is $2.5 trillion over 10 years.\n  Again, Louisianians see this, Americans see this as another big dot \nto connect, part of a huge trend of exploding Federal Government power \nand exploding Federal Government spending and debt. What does that \nrepresent in terms of that explosion of spending and debt? It also \nrepresents enormous new taxes, and that goes to the cost issue my \ndistinguished colleague from South Dakota was talking about.\n  When I talk to Louisianians specifically about health care--not just \nthese\n\n[[Page S11918]]\n\nbroader trends and these broader concerns they are very focused on but \nspecifically health care; OK, we have to fix certain issues in health \ncare--what is the top issue? Virtually everyone in Louisiana says cost, \nballooning cost. Whether they have coverage now or they are struggling \nto get coverage, the issue is cost. What can we do about cost?\n\n  Again, this bill does nothing to fix that. It makes it worse. As was \nillustrated with Senator Thune's graph, it pushes the cost curve up and \nnot down. Part of the reason it does that is, in that $2.5 trillion of \nactivity there are enormous taxes, and those taxes become built into \nhealth insurance premiums. So premiums do not go down, they go up. They \ngo up in a major way.\n  What are some of these we are talking about--again, enormous tax \nincreases, enormous tax increases across the board, taxes on choice and \nwell-being. Flexible spending which allows individuals to have a tax-\nfree account for medical needs, that is limited. That is downgraded and \ncapped at $2,500 a year. Taxes on over-the-counter medicines that many \npatients' families and seniors depend on, that is a tax increase of $5 \nbillion; reduced deductions for health expenses, again, another tax \nincrease; higher Medicare payroll taxes; the rate on wages in excess of \n$200,000, a very large tax increase; over and over again, major tax \nincreases. The bill would impose $28 billion in new taxes on employers \nthat do not provide government-approved health care plans. There is a \ntax increase of $53.8 billion, over 10 years, in terms of the Medicare \npopulation.\n  So, again, there are huge tax increases that are part of that, and \nthat is the major reason that cost curve is not being pushed down. In \nfact, it is being pushed up.\n  As I approach this bill, after looking at it carefully over the last \nfew days, my first bottom-line question is: How does it respond to \nthose dominant concerns I have heard over and over again from Louisiana \ncitizens all across the State over the last several months? What does \nit do about ballooning Federal spending and debt? What does it do about \nthe growth of government power and intervention and the cost of health \ncare?\n  Sadly, it fails on all those accounts. It moves us in the wrong \ndirection on all those accounts. So I urge my colleagues to adopt a \ndifferent approach, to vote no tonight, to not move to this approach, \nto adopt a far more focused, positive approach that responds directly \nto those concerns of the American people.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Democrats control the next \nhour. The Republican time is expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nnext hour be under the control of the majority controlled as follows \nand in the order listed: Senator Gillibrand, 5 minutes; Senator \nWhitehouse, 20 minutes; Senator Landrieu, 17 minutes; and Senator \nCantwell, 18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, as I rise today to speak in support \nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I wish to say that \nthis is truly historic legislation which I am very proud to support \nwhich will ensure all Americans will have access to quality, affordable \nhealth care. It will at long last make the necessary changes to contain \ncosts that have truly spiraled out of control, and it will make \nenormous progress to address the many disparities in our health care \nsystem that are discriminatory toward women.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has determined this bill will provide \ncoverage for more than 94 percent of Americans--98 percent when \naccounting for the elderly population--while reducing the spiraling \ncosts of health care and trimming the deficit over the next 10 years \nand beyond.\n  Sixty years after Harry Truman first talked about the need to \nguarantee affordable, quality health care for all Americans, we are on \nthe brink of a historic vote to move one step closer to achieving this \ngoal.\n  In 1994, the last time we seriously considered health care reform, \nopponents argued that if we reformed our health care system, health \ncare spending would skyrocket and health care quality and access would \ndecrease. The opponents succeeded in 1994, and health reform was \ndefeated. But in the absence of reform, look at what has actually \noccurred. Since 1994, family premiums have risen by over 150 percent. \nIn 1993, the average annual premium for employer-sponsored family \ncoverage was $5,000. This year, the cost for coverage is over $13,000 \nper year. By 2016, family health insurance is expected to reach over \n$24,000. In my State of New York, that is simply unaffordable.\n  Today, we spend more than 16 percent of our gross domestic product on \nhealth care, nearly twice the average of other developed nations--an \nastounding $2.2 trillion every year. What do we get in return? More \nthan 47 million Americans are uninsured. In 2007 and 2008, 86.7 million \nAmericans--1 out of every 3 Americans under 65--went without health \ninsurance for a period of time. Every day, 14,000 Americans lose their \nhealth insurance.\n  Many of the same opponents who defeated reform in 1994 are trying to \ndo it again. I ask them to please consider what has actually occurred \nover the last 15 years. Think about the damage that has been caused to \nour economy, our families, our workers, and consider taking a stand \nthat is on the right side of history this time.\n  The bill before us lays a foundation for truly reforming our health \ncare system. I commend Majority Leader Reid for his work in merging the \ntwo Senate committee bills.\n  This bill includes a robust public plan for which I have strongly \nadvocated. I believe this will increase competition and lower costs \nacross the system. Through a public plan and the establishment of \nhealth insurance exchanges, the bill makes quality health care truly \naffordable and accessible to everyone--all Americans. The health \ninsurance exchanges will streamline the system and offer insurance at \naffordable premium rates, capped by income, for low- and middle-income \nAmericans. No longer will health care be out of the reach of millions \nbecause of cost.\n  This bill also ends discrimination against women, which we have faced \nin our health care system for far too long. Women shoulder the worst of \nthe health care crisis, including outrageous discriminatory practices \nin care and coverage. The National Women's Law Center reports that a \n25-year-old woman pays up to 45 percent more for the same health \ninsurance coverage than a man her age. Some of the most essential \nservices required by women are simply not covered by insurance plans, \nsuch as childbearing, Pap smears, and mammograms. A standard in-\nhospital delivery costs between $5,000 and $10,000, and much more if \nthere are complications. This bill ends the practice of denying health \ncare to those with preexisting conditions. In the current system, \npregnant women are often turned down for health care coverage because \ninsurance companies would rather evade this cost. Pregnancy should \nnever be the basis for losing coverage. In America, this sort of \ninstitutionalized discrimination is wrong. This reform bill ends the \npractice of charging women more than men and requires that these basic \nhealth care services are included.\n  The bill also lays the groundwork to reward health care providers for \nthe quality of care they provide, not necessarily the quantity. \nHospitals and clinics across the country will model the success at \nplaces such as Bassett Healthcare in Cooperstown in upstate New York. \nIt also uses new methods to reduce medical errors and prevent costly \nillnesses.\n  Some would prefer that we continue on the current path, leaving \nmillions without insurance and paying for it through a hidden tax that \nall insured Americans pay to cover the cost of emergency care. But the \nmajority of Americans think the time has now come to address this \nproblem and fix our broken system.\n  The vote today is an important step on the road to reform. In the \nnext few weeks, we will all have the opportunity to debate this bill \nand make important modifications. I am encouraged to see improvements \nfrom previous bills in the merged bill before us, including\n\n[[Page S11919]]\n\nbetter protections for middle-class families' benefits and increased \nfunding to States for Medicaid, both of which I look forward to \ncontinuing to improve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. May I have an additional 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the Chair.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues on this historic \nlegislation. For the next few weeks, I will work to strengthen the \nprovisions for States such as New York that have strong Medicaid \nPrograms, and I will also work to ensure that funding for our safety \nnet hospitals remains intact.\n  Now is the time to act. The bill before us provides quality \naffordable health insurance for every American, reins in the high \ncosts, makes our system more efficient, and addresses some of the grave \ndisparities in the system that discriminate against women. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in voting yes on the motion to proceed on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I had the occasion to listen to some \nof the remarks of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It \nforces the conclusion that the irony department of the Republican Party \nis working overtime these days.\n  The criticisms of this bill are over deficit and cost. We are hearing \nthese criticisms about deficit from the party that, when it had control \nin the Bush years, ran up over $8 trillion in our national debt--$8 \ntrillion, the biggest spendthrifts in history, an orgy of fair-weather \ndebt. They didn't have any hesitation about deficits then. On the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, we have never heard any interest in having \nthose paid for on a current basis. Borrowing for wars is completely \nsatisfactory to them, it appears. When they had the chance to amend \nMedicare, they added Part D, and they ran up the cost immensely by \nproviding a special protection for the pharmaceutical industry so that \nit can dictate prices to the Federal Government. The Federal Government \ncan't negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry for Part D \npharmaceuticals. That costs the Federal Government a fortune. Do they \nmind? No. They spend on deficits over and over. Now, when at last we \ntake on the insurance industry, suddenly they discover a concern about \ndeficits. Well, I would urge that based on that trajectory, these \nremarks have a lot less to do with the deficit than they do with \nprotecting the insurance industry.\n  There is another clue of this as well, and that is the concern about \ncost. We all, indeed, are concerned about cost. But I think the best \nthing we could do about cost in health care is to pass a public option. \nWhy do I say that? I say that because the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office has said that changes in government policy which we \nadhere to in this bill have the potential to yield large reductions in \nboth national health expenditures and Federal health care spending \nwithout harming health. It is not just a possibility. He goes on to \nsay: Many experts agree on the general direction in which the \ngovernment must go to get those cost savings. But they conclude they \ncan't put a specific score on them yet for the following reason: The \nspecific changes that might ultimately prove most important cannot be \nforeseen today and could be developed only over time through \nexperimentation and learning.\n  Now, who is going to develop those changes that will save costs while \nimproving the quality of our health care system over time through \nexperimentation and learning? The public options. There will be public \noptions, if the original health plan is followed, in all 50 States. \nEach would have to stay within its State on balance, solvent, could not \ngo to the Federal Treasury to make up losses. So they have to look for \nreform in order to continue to succeed. They would be 50 engines of \nreform, of experimentation, and of learning.\n  Who is against the public options? The insurance industry, because \nthey don't want the competition. They love an environment in which they \nare immune from the antitrust laws--almost uniquely in American \nbusiness--and in which they have incredible market share. In many \ncases, there are only two dominant insurers in the entire market around \nthis country. So they love having these huge market shares to be able \nto dictate price, to be immune from the antitrust laws, and they don't \nwant the competition.\n  Guess who else is against the public options. Our Republican friends. \nIt is very hard to find any daylight between the position of the \ninsurance industry and the position of our Republican friends.\n  The problem with this is that it is not just about numbers and it is \nnot just about statistics; it is about people. It is about people by \nthe hundreds of thousands, but it makes their stories better when you \nactually come down to cases. So let me mention a few cases.\n  I talked a few weeks ago about one of my very dearest family members \nwho fell victim to the system when his insurance company tried to deny \nhim the indicated treatment prescribed by a world-class physician from \nthe National Institutes of Health on the grounds that it was so-called \n``not the indicated treatment.'' This was an individual who had \nreceived a devastating diagnosis. He had gone to the top expert for \nthat diagnosis in the country at the National Institutes of Health. He \nhad been told what he should do. He had been told, indeed, that was \nvery standard. This was not anything exotic; this was essentially the \nautomatic way you should treat a particular condition. When he filed it \nwith his insurance company, some faceless bureaucrat said: No; we know \nbetter than the top expert at the National Institutes of Health. That \nis not the indicated treatment.\n  From that, and from thousands and thousands of Americans who have had \ntheir claims denied and have had insurers try to intrude between them \nand their doctor and interfere with the care their doctor thinks they \nneed, we can tell one thing: the insurance companies do this for a bad \nmotivation, which is to save costs. Of all of the stories I have heard, \nof all of the stories our colleagues have related here on the Senate \nfloor, never once has there been a story of an insurance company that \nstepped in and said: Oh, wait a minute, that is not the indicated \ntreatment; the indicated treatment is actually more expensive than what \nyour doctor has indicated. Always, it is less expensive. Go figure.\n  I wish to share another story today about a person who is close to \nme, a member of my staff. His name is Richard Pezzillo, and he has \nhemophilia. He has gotten the treatment he has needed so far, but he \nhas been lucky, and it illustrates how luck now enters into our \nequation in health care.\n  In 2003, after a very turbulent airplane flight, Rich unfastened his \nseatbelt from the airplane, collected his things, and suddenly realized \nthings were going badly wrong. He started to feel tremendous pain. He \nstarted vomiting blood. Simply wearing his seatbelt in that turbulent \naircraft had caused Rich to begin to bleed internally, inside of his \nstomach, eventually requiring that his gallbladder be removed.\n  Rich is a kind and thoughtful young man from North Providence, RI. He \nwas hospitalized in very serious condition. He spent nearly 3 weeks in \nthe hospital. Thankfully, he received excellent treatment, and today he \nworks here in my Washington office. The doctors, the nurses, and the \nhospital staff in Rhode Island gave Rich the best treatment. He now \nleads an energetic, vigorous life and does well at a challenging job.\n  But the stunning part about Rich's story is his treatment and his \ntreatment cost--$1.5 million. At least that is what they said. If you \nlook at a copy of the billing sheet, you will see that the insurance \ncompany said that his billing, here, for instance, was $366,240.\n  The insurance company allowed only $106,000. That is what was \nactually paid, which gives you a sense of how much funny business is \ngoing on in the private health insurance industry and in the health \ncare sector, when an insurance company can get away with paying about \none-third of the bill's cost.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about how burdensome it is for Members of \nCongress to make it through a 2,000-page long health care bill. If you \nactually reduce its size to the substantive\n\n[[Page S11920]]\n\nlanguage--and I am elaborating on what the House bill would do, which \nis about the same as ours--the substantive language is less than a \nHarry Potter novel. My daughter could read Harry Potter novels when she \nwas 13. I don't think it is asking too much of our colleagues to plow \nthrough a bill that represents one-sixth of our economy--when it is the \nsize of a Harry Potter novel. It would be a good idea.\n  Rather than fighting about the 2,000-page bill, how about Rich's $1.5 \nmillion health care bill? The hard truth is, Rich was able to get \nlifesaving treatment because he was lucky, since he hadn't graduated \nfrom college yet and was still covered by his parents' insurance \npolicy. Because he was covered, the hospital only charged his insurer \nless than half of that--$106,000. What if things had been different? \nWhat if he needed treatment a couple of years later when he wasn't on \nhis parents' policy and couldn't afford his own? What if he had applied \nfor his own coverage but was denied by an insurance company because his \nillness was deemed a preexisting condition? What if Rich's father lost \nhis job and his health insurance along with it or what if Rich's \nparents' policy had a limit on benefits, and they had to pay the rest \nof the $1.5 million out of pocket?\n  Rich would have been a victim not just of his illness but of the \nhealth care status quo. If he or his family had been uninsured, they \nalmost certainly would not have been able to afford the full care Rich \nneeded. Their financial future would have been irrevocably altered--\nprobably ruined.\n  Luck is no way to run a health care system. Unfortunately, Americans \nneed all the luck they can get when dealing with health insurance \ncompanies that use every bit of their bureaucratic guile and financial \nmight to delay and deny health insurance benefits they are obligated to \nprovide.\n  For example, in March 2006, the Arizona Department of Insurance \nordered health insurance giant United Healthcare to pay fines of more \nthan $364,000--the largest in the department's history. Regulators \nfound that the company illegally denied more than 63,000 claims by \ndoctors without examining all of the information needed to accept or \ndeny a claim. It looks as if they were just on automatic pilot to deny \nthem.\n  In January 2008, California insurance regulators found that a \nsubsidiary of United Healthcare had committed more than 130,000 \nviolations of law in handling claims. For example, the company \ninappropriately denied more than $750,000 in claims on the grounds that \ninsureds had a preexisting condition. The regulators found that the \ncompanies ``made large-scale and willful decisions to use broken \nsystems to process claims and respond to providers, while continually \nand effectively collecting premiums.'' The total potential liability of \nthe company for all violations is $1.3 billion.\n  Last year, United Healthcare's CEO, Stephen Helmsley, made $3.2 \nmillion and holds almost $120 million in stock options.\n  The health care reform bill we are talking about today would right \nthis massive power imbalance between the health insurance industry and \nordinary Americans who are getting rolled over by it. It would empower \naverage Americans to take control of their health and financial future. \nRather than taking their health insurance premium dollars to the health \ninsurance ``casino,'' they could take them to the bank.\n  Unfortunately, many on the other side of the aisle wildly \nmisrepresent both the status quo and how reform would empower \nconsumers. The opponents of reform depict our bill as an Orwellian \ntakeover of the system.\n  Madam President, let me close with a story that illustrates how \nironic and completely wrong these cries of ``death panels'' or \n``government interference'' really are.\n  In 2000, Christiane Hymel--insured by a subsidiary of Blue Cross Blue \nShield of Louisiana--scheduled an appointment for a routine physical. \nDuring the examination, she reported to her doctor her history of back \npain and weakness in her legs over the past year and a half. Her doctor \nordered x rays of her spine and referred her to a neurologist.\n  The neurologist, after detecting troubling symptoms, ordered an MRI. \nIn accordance with her insurance policy, the doctor sent Blue Cross a \nrequest to preauthorize the MRI. The day before the MRI was scheduled, \nBlue Cross denied that request on the basis that the service was for a \npreexisting condition--Mrs. Hymel's back pain.\n  Mrs. Hymel appealed the insurance company's decision in accordance \nwith the terms of her policy, but Blue Cross never processed the \nappeal.\n  After Blue Cross denied coverage for the MRI, Mr. and Mrs. Hymel were \ntold that the MRI would cost about $4,000. They started saving up for \nit. It took 3 months to save up the money necessary to pay cash for the \nprocedure, but they eventually did. The MRI showed that Mrs. Hymel had \nmassive tumors involving ``nearly the entire cervical and thoracic \n[spinal] cord.'' She was immediately scheduled for surgery. Helpfully, \nBlue Cross stepped in to deny coverage for that as well, stating it was \nfor a preexisting condition.\n  Mrs. Hymel's neurosurgeon later testified at trial:\n\n       Tumors inside the spinal cord are growing tumors, as they \n     grow, they cause damage to vital structures in the spinal \n     cord, which are important to walking, sensation, and \n     breathing.\n\n  The longer the wait in removing a tumor, the more damage the tumor \nwill cause to the spinal cord. The doctor testified:\n\n       Two-thirds of Mrs. Hymel's current condition and \n     disabilities were the direct result of the growth of the \n     tumor during the 3 to 4-month delay between the time Blue \n     Cross denied the MRI until the time Mrs. Hymel was able to \n     pay for it by herself. Additionally . . . this delay also \n     caused the tumor's quick recurrence, necessitating the second \n     surgery.\n\n  In ruling for Mrs. Hymel in her lawsuit against Blue Cross, the court \ndescribed the consequences for Mrs. Hymel of this 3-month delay the \ninsurance company caused by denying her MRI:\n\n       Mrs. Hymel testified that when she first woke up from \n     surgery, she could not move her arms or head and she thought \n     she was paralyzed. She felt painful burning sensations in her \n     body. . . . While she was in the surgical ward, she \n     contemplated committing suicide. During her hospital stay, \n     she suffered from bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, and had \n     to wear diapers. Mrs. Hymel didn't see her children in the \n     hospital until two weeks after the surgery, and when her \n     children finally saw her, they were scared of her and would \n     not touch her. Mrs. Hymel spent approximately eight months in \n     a wheelchair after her surgery.\n       Mrs. Hymel is house-bound, she cannot take a shower, work \n     in her garden, ride a bike, swim, or drive, as she had \n     frequently enjoyed prior to the surgery. . . . Mrs. Hymel \n     must also take large doses of medication to relieve the \n     burning and shocking sensations from which she suffers. She \n     cannot be touched on her back or leg, because the second \n     something touches her lower back, it's like fireworks that go \n     off.\n\n  Every day that insurance companies delay or deny payment is another \nday they earn interest on your premiums, adding to their profits and \nadding to the funds that support their massive executive pay packages. \nWhen Blue Cross of Louisiana failed to pay for Mrs. Hymel's MRI, it \nwasn't just making a mistake, it was making a calculated decision--a \nheartless, profit-maximizing decision. Christiane Hymel's story isn't \njust a sad tale, it is a symptom of a disease that is spreading through \nthe private health insurance system.\n  For many Americans like Christiane and Rich, our health care system \nis a casino, where a roll of the dice or spin of the roulette wheel \ndetermines one's fate. Such an irrational and random system doesn't \ncomport with the society that Franklin Roosevelt described in his 1944 \nState of the Union:\n\n       We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true \n     individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and \n     independence. Necessitous men are not free men.\n\n  These days I think it would be more proper to say necessitous men and \nwomen are not free men and women.\n  By passing health care reform, we will take health insurance off the \ncasino floor for the average American family and make it a reliable \npart of every family's economic foundation. No longer will happenstance \nor chance determine whether treatment will be paid for. No longer will \nthe casino wheel determine whether Rich Pezillo gets his treatment or \nthat Christiane Hymel does not. Parents of kids like Rich Pezillo would \nnot worry whether their son's illness could lead him to be\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\nturned down for that preexisting condition or whether a layoff or lack \nof insurance could deny their son the treatment he needs.\n  Necessitous men and women are not free men and women. Let's redeem \nFDR's promise by passing health care reform. Let's bear in mind, as we \ngo forward, the nature of the arguments that are made against health \ncare reform and the astonishing coincidence between the arguments made \nbetween health care reform by our Republican colleagues and by the \nbarons of the health insurance industry. There seems to be literally no \ndaylight between those arguments.\n  If we are going to turn around the extraordinary spiraling costs of \nhealth care, we are going to have to do it by reforming the delivery \nsystem. The best way to do that is the public option. Yet they oppose \nit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Landrieu, was \ngoing to be next, but I will switch times with her. She will join us on \nthe floor shortly.\n  I want to join my colleagues this morning and talk about this \nimportant issue of controlling health care costs. That is why we are \nhere. We know Americans are facing higher and higher health care costs \nand that we can do something to drive down the costs of our health care \nsystem. We know health care costs are not only strangling us, but they \nare impacting our constituents, our budget, and they are leaving 47 \nmillion Americans without insurance.\n  Our aim is to promote better quality care and get costs under \ncontrol. Whether those costs be to consumers struggling to pay \ninsurance premiums or to our government, we need to make sure we are \ndoing all we can. Doing nothing in this debate is allowing health care \ncosts to continue. I want to make sure my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle who talk a lot about this legislation understand that if \nwe do nothing, we are going to leave the American people and our budget \nin serious danger by not controlling health care costs.\n  As always, in this debate we must keep in mind Federal spending, and \nthe numbers on Federal spending are stark.\n  In terms of doing nothing, if the U.S. Government does nothing, \nhealth care spending will double in the next decade. That is, we spend \nabout $810 billion on health care. That is one-third of our total \nFederal budget. If we do nothing, Federal spending is going to go to \n$1.56 trillion. That is because we are not controlling health care \ncosts, baby boomers are reaching retirement, and Medicaid and Medicare \ncosts are ballooning. One-third of our Federal budget is a big enough \nbite. But if we do nothing, then our health care priorities are going \nto push out other priorities of our Federal Government.\n  The biggest area where we could control costs is in Medicare. \nMedicare is 57 percent of all Federal spending, and it is getting \nbigger. By 2020, Medicare spending alone will reach $1 trillion, \ndoubling the $466 billion we spend today. That is to say that Medicare \nspending has been doubling in the last 10 years, and if we do nothing \nas our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are suggesting by not \nmoving forward on this legislation, then it is going to double again. \nThis is unsustainable because if we do not address this, Medicare is \ngoing to bankrupt us.\n  The prospects are just as daunting when it comes to our Medicaid \nbudget because Medicaid spending over the next several years will also \ndouble, and it has doubled in the last 10 years. States are struggling, \nas many of us know, with what they can do to help sustain Medicaid \nsince they pay for part of that for individuals.\n  So we see we are in a situation where doing nothing is an \nirresponsible way to go. In fact, for our constituents, they are seeing \na 120-percent increase in insurance premiums. While we are worried \nabout the impact on the Federal Government, they are worried about the \nimpact on them, on their individual budgets. That means the average \nfamily today pays about $7,000 more per year for the same health care \nbenefits than they did a few years ago. If you think about that, that \nmeans that is less money for them, less money for their families, less \nmoney to meet the other bills in the family.\n  Why has this happened? If we look at what has happened in our \ncountry, we see that wages have not gone up. In fact, during that same \n10-year period of time, wages have only gone up 29 percent, health \ninsurance premiums have gone up 120 percent. And where has the \ninsurance industry been? The insurance industry has seen a 428-percent \nincrease in profits over the last 10 years.\n  That is why we need to do something about controlling health care \ncosts. We cannot let the American people continue to be subject to such \nhuge increases in premiums and then have the insurance industry walk \naway with huge profits and American consumers make less and less.\n  What is going to happen if we do nothing, if we do not advance this \nbill to control health care costs? Those same premium increases we have \nseen in the last 10 years are also going to go up again. In fact, they \nare projected to go up another 7.9 percent in annual growth. That is, \nevery year, they are going to go up another 8 percent. That is \nunsustainable. That means somebody is going to be paying $10,000 or \nmore than what they are paying for their health insurance today for the \nsame health care benefits. That is why doing nothing and not advancing \nthis bill is just acquiescing to the fact that everybody is going to \npay more for health care.\n  What makes this number so scary is that it is four times the rate of \ninflation over the same period. That means what we need to do is look \nat general inflation, which is usually about 2 percent. But health care \ninflation, as is shown on this chart, is more like 8 percent. If we do \nnothing to change this, Americans are going to continue to do with less \nbecause health care costs are demanding more and more of their budget.\n  What do we do about this? We certainly want to make sure that we \nchange the system, and that is one of the reasons I support driving \ndown costs by having a public option. We know that two factors are \ninvolved: We don't have enough competition and there are very \nconcentrated markets in health insurance across the country. Many times \nthere are only one or two insurance providers providing coverage in a \nmarket. They might have 94 percent of the market. It is too \nconcentrated. We know if we provide an alternative in the marketplace, \nwe can help drive down costs.\n  One provision in this bill of which I am very supportive is the basic \nhealth plan because it lets States negotiate with private insurers for \nlower costs. In my State, this program has been in place for 20 years. \nIt has been able to provide those who participate in the program--about \n70,000 people today--a 30- to 40-percent savings if they had to buy \nthat plan as an individual from a private insurer. That is incredible \nsuccess in driving down the cost.\n  Why? I call it the Costco model because like when you go to Costco \nand you buy in volume, the State of Washington, buying in volume on \nbehalf of those individuals, was able to drive down the cost of health \ncare for those individual citizens. They were able to choose between \nfour different plans, and they were able to get access to a very good \nproposal for health care for them.\n  The underlying bill includes language that says you could provide \nthis basic health plan if States opted into it and cover 70 percent of \nthe currently uninsured in America. I like this proposal because it \ngets us cheaper insurance for that population.\n  Why subsidize insurance companies by giving tax incentives to buy \nmore expensive insurance when what Americans want is to drive down the \ncost of health care by having the same negotiating clout that big \nbusinesses or other entities have?\n  I hope we can continue to work and maybe even expand this provision \nto make it even more robust and to drive down costs.\n  What is clear is that the cost of the uninsured is adding to our \nhealth care\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\ncosts. In fact, the fact there are people in America who are uninsured \nis adding about $1,000 to our health care premiums overall. That is \nabout $43 billion a year to our health care system.\n  If we can change our health care system and get more people into \nsomething such as the basic health plan, we would be able to drive down \ncosts, and that is why that plan is so valuable.\n  We should not forget that our current system, besides insurance \nreform, needs provider reform. The reason why provider reform is so \nimportant is because our current health care system is flawed. It is \ndriving up the cost of Medicare and health care in general because of \nthe payment system. Basically, the current payment system perpetuates \nmore spending. In fact, there is something like $700 billion in waste \nin our current system. If you think about it, it is this fee-for-\nservice loop that I call it where you order more and you end up having \nmore waste in the system, you have more spending, you have more use, \nand it keeps going. That is primarily because we pay doctors on volume. \nWe pay doctors for how many patients they see every day, and we pay \nthem for how many tests they order. Consequently, the cost continues to \nspin out of control.\n  As I was saying, we spend about $700 billion on health care that we \ndo not need to spend. That is in duplicated tests, unnecessary \nprocedures, excessive insurance overhead, uncoordinated speciality \ncare, and preventable hospitalization.\n  We heard from many people during the health care debate that we have \nto do something to change this system. In fact, one of the witnesses \nbefore the health care committee said:\n\n       We have to go after how we reimburse physicians. The \n     current system is the most broken part of Medicare.\n\n  What are we doing in this legislation to fix that? We are changing \nthe way we reimburse for health care. In fact, we are going to look at \nhow to get lower costs with better results. This is important because I \ndon't think there is a person in America who doesn't know what it is \nlike to go into a doctor's office and feel they are always in a hurry \nor feel as if the doctor didn't hear everything you had to say. This is \nabout changing and rewarding physicians on the outcome of your health \ncare so you can have shorter waiting times, better access to doctors, \nmore coordinated care, and better outcomes.\n\n  We think if you change the health care system, which this bill does, \nto drive down costs and get better outcomes, we are going to have \nbetter health care in America.\n  We can continue on the path which I think my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle want by not voting to move forward on this \nlegislation, we can have less coordinated care, going from specialist \nto specialist without having that care coordinated and have unnecessary \ntests, but then everybody in America is going to be paying for those \ncosts. Everybody is going to be paying higher health care premiums \nbecause of it.\n  What we need to do, which is what exactly this bill sets us on a \ncourse and path to do, is to pay for value not for volume, to pay \nphysicians on the value they deliver and the outcome of their patients \ninstead of volume.\n  If we did nothing else in health care reform but to change our \npayment structure to focus on this premise--paying for value and not \nfor volume--then we would be delivering great long-term savings to our \nhealth care system.\n  We have other things we need to do, and that is in the area of long-\nterm care and Medicaid because in our long-term care system, we are \nseeing a doubling in health care costs, primarily because of long-term \ncare. When you think about our Medicaid budget, everybody thinks \nMedicaid is this program to help the low-income population. Medicaid is \nturning into a long-term care program for the elderly in America. That \nis, they cannot get long-term care access so they are spending down so \nthey qualify under Medicaid to basically get on that system to cover \ntheir long-term care.\n  We can see that right now Medicaid is paying half of its funds, and \nthat is an expense that is going to continue to grow.\n  We have made some reforms in the State of Washington to make that \ncheaper. We have said let's invest in home care instead. Instead of \nhaving everybody go to nursing homes, whether they need to be there or \nnot, let's focus on the long-term care system reforms that keep people \nin their community and instead use the Medicaid budget to advance other \nthings while keeping patients at home.\n  I think every senior in this country would rather have their health \ncare delivered at home than in a nursing home, but our current Federal \nsystem continues to reward long-term care in nursing homes instead of \nin community-based care. This legislation starts us on a path to change \nthat direction, to move closer to long-term care community services.\n  We did this in the State of Washington, again, over 20 years ago and \nhave reaped huge benefits. If we took an individual in the system \ntoday, the cost is only about $22,000 per individual. If we had not \nreformed the system as we did 20 years ago, we would be paying $42,000 \nfor that same individual. So we have been able to drastically cut the \namount of money we are spending on long-term care.\n  This legislation includes the same kind of cost control reforms in \nlong-term care as some States have already implemented. That is why we \nhave to get at controlling health care costs. If we do not control \nhealth care costs in this area of long-term care, we are not going to \ncontrol health care costs overall in America.\n  What does reform mean? Why are we here today to talk about the cost \nof health care and what we need to do? Why are we here talking about \nadvancing this legislation so we can get this debate on the floor for \nthe American people?\n  It is clear we need to have more competition through a public option, \nwe need smarter reimbursement rates to incentivize value, and we need \nbetter use of Medicaid dollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Presiding Officer. I hope my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle will consider the important cost controls \nin this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I first want to commend my colleague, \nSenator Cantwell, the Senator from Washington State, who has worked so \nhard and so long and in such a professional way. She has been extremely \nhelpful to me through this process, and I want to acknowledge that and \nthank her.\n  Before I make a statement, I also want to comment about a few other \ncolleagues who have been extremely helpful and supportive, not just to \nme but I think to the entire Senate, beginning with Senator Harry Reid, \nour leader, who, with patience and persistence and care, has led us to \na bill that is before the Senate. The question today is whether we \nshould proceed. I would like to say that, in my view, no other Member \nof the Senate could have accomplished what he has today. I think many \nSenators share that sentiment.\n  No. 2, I want to recognize the extraordinary work of the Senator from \nOregon, Senator Ron Wyden, who, 2 years ago, before the Presidential \nelection had really gotten underway, before it was really ever clear as \nto who might win, Senator Wyden put down a bill called the Healthy \nAmericans Act, which I was very proud to support, and I still am so \nproud of that effort today. That bill has the support of seven \nRepublicans and seven Democrats. It is a truly bipartisan effort that \nwould accomplish, in my view, what many Americans are asking for: a \nmarketplace that is fixed and reformed, more affordable choices for \nindividuals and small businesses and families, and a real effort to \ncurb the rising and alarming cost to the Federal taxpayers, given that \nthe percentage now of our GDP spent on health care is almost exceeding \n16 percent, twice as high as any nation in the world. That is alarming. \nThe Healthy Americans Act went a long way to help frame my thoughts on \nthis debate. We are going to continue to work together through this \nprocess.\n  I also thank Senator Blanche Lincoln who, because of her persistent \nleadership, has pushed and prodded Members of this body to ensure that \nwe\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\nhad the time necessary to review this bill. In so doing, she helped to \nassure our constituents, whether they are for or against the direction \nwe are moving, knew that we had the time necessary to make an informed \ndecision. I think I have used that time very well these last 2\\1/2\\ \ndays. I have been in meetings with economists, on the phone with health \ncare experts, talking with people from my State as well as around the \nNation. I have used that time well and wisely. Senator Lincoln led the \ncharge to ensure that we had the time we needed, and I am glad to have \nsupported her in that effort. I know she will be speaking on the floor \nlater today, giving her final views on where we are. I commend her for \nher leadership.\n  Madam President, I come to the floor today to acknowledge to speak on \nthe business before the Senate today, and that is the question of \nwhether to proceed to debate on the Patient Protection and \nAffordability Act, a bill that is the best work of the Senate to date \non a subject of significant importance to the people of my State and \nthe country. I have decided to vote today to move forward on this \nimportant debate.\n  My vote should in no way be construed by the supporters of this \ncurrent framework as an indication of how I might vote on the final \nbill. My vote is a vote to move forward, to continue the good and \nessential and important and imperative work that is underway.\n  After a thorough review of the bill, as I said, over the last 2\\1/2\\ \ndays, which included many lengthy discussions, I have decided that \nthere are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to \nmove forward, but much more work needs to be done before I can support \nthis effort.\n  Over the past many years, and in particular the last 6 months, I have \nheard from people all across Louisiana that their insurance premium \ncosts are simply too high and continue to rise without warning, \nthreatening the financial stability of their families and their \nbusinesses. I have also heard the pleas and cries of many people who \nneed health coverage but they cannot find it anywhere within reach of \ntheir budgets.\n  Through months of public meetings in VFW halls, school gyms, and in \nhospitals and health clinics from New Orleans to Shreveport, and in \nlarge and small communities throughout my State, it is clear to me that \ndoing nothing is not an option, nor is postponing the debate.\n  Spirited debate and good-faith negotiations in this Senate have \nproduced a bill that contains some amazing and cutting-edge reforms \nthat will, I am hopeful, reduce costs for families and small businesses \nwhile reducing the debt burden of the Federal Government. But these \nreforms must be implemented properly and carefully, and they must be \nput in place in a timely fashion.\n  Small business owners across the country have told me time after time \nthat in order to grow their businesses and create jobs, they need \naffordable health insurance and they need stable and predictable costs. \nYes, they would like their costs to be lowered, and I am going to stay \nfocused like a laser on doing just that. But what they also need is \npredictability--they need to be able to plan for the future, something \nthey cannot do when the cost of healthcare spikes violently from year \nto year.\n  As we all know, today, under the status quo, small business owners \nare frequently confronted with impossible choices when an employee or \nemployee's family member gets seriously ill. They can expect exorbitant \ncost increases of up to 20 percent in their premiums when just one of \ntheir employees gets sick. Then they are confronted with the \nexcruciating choice of going to that employee and those family members \nand saying: I am sorry, to save my business and the other 10 employees, \nwe need to let you go. Here is $1,000 or $2,000 or $5,000. You are on \nyour own. Good luck.\n  That is a tragic story, painful, depressing, and it has to stop.\n  I appreciate the hard work of many business owners and organizations \nthat have helped to craft portions of this framework because they have \nremained at the negotiating table. They didn't run and hide, they \nremained at the table. I am asking them today to stay at this table.\n  Before I discuss the work that needs to be done to improve this bill, \nI would like to discuss some of the points in this bill that encourage \nme to move forward.\n  Small business owners, under the current framework of this bill, \nwould no longer be confronted with these kinds of volatile costs. This \nbill prevents insurance companies from escalating their rates or \ndropping their coverage after someone gets sick. That important change \ngoes a long way in stabilizing the amount small businesses will have to \npay for their health plans, and it allows business owners to do what \nthey do best--plan smart investments, grow their businesses, and then \nhelp us grow our economy.\n  In recent years, economists have found that workers' wages have \nremained largely stagnant. Why? Because employers are paying more and \nmore for health care that we are indirectly subsidizing through the \ncurrent Tax Code and so have less and less money to pay real wages that \nworkers in large and small businesses could actually take home, put in \ntheir pockets, and spend in much more productive ways. The bill we are \ndebating would encourage employers to move away from high-cost benefit \nplans, and instead increase the amount that working families can take \nhome. That is an important change from the status quo.\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that the majority of Louisiana \nfamilies would pay no more than 10 percent of their income for health \ncare. That is still high. But today families in Louisiana pay an \naverage of 30 percent of their income on healthcare costs. And \neconomists project that if we do nothing, that total will climb to 60 \npercent of an average family's income that will have to be spent trying \nto afford health care. This bill changes that trajectory. So while some \npeople still think that 10 percent or 12 percent may be too high, it is \na lot better than 60 percent, which is the direction we are heading \ntoday if we do nothing. That is real progress.\n  These reforms I have just mentioned are necessary and are too \nimportant a goal for the Senate to abandon its work. But, as I have \nsaid, there is a great deal more work that needs to be done.\n  I would like to mention briefly just a few of the significant changes \nI would like to see be made to this bill.\n  No. 1, in order to increase choices for small businesses, we must \nenhance and expand tax credits that are in this bill for small \nbusinesses, particularly for business with 25 fewer employees. If we \ncan expand tax credits for slightly larger small businesses with \nbetween 25 and 50 employees, that would be significant progress. \nCurrent projections are that 96 percent of all businesses that have \nmore than 50 employees have coverage. That is a good statistic, and \nthose larger businesses have some choices. But we need to give small \nbusinesses more choices. It is these small businesses that are leading \nthe country on its way out of this recession. And we need to help them \nin that effort.\n\n  In addition, I will continue to fight for more tax equity for the 27 \nmillion Americans who are currently self-employed. Every chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee--both Republican and Democrat, I \nunderstand, for the last 25 years--has asked for this to be addressed. \nIt is time to make progress on that effort now.\n  No. 2, in order to really deliver our promise to hold down costs for \nfamilies, we should think about focusing on ways to prevent premiums \nfrom being excessively raised between the time this bill is enacted, if \nit ever is, and the time it actually goes into effect. Many of the \nprovisions in this bill, because of cost considerations, which I \nunderstand, do not go into effect until 2014. Well, today is 2009. \nThat's a long time between now and then, and we need to make sure that \ncompanies do not jack up their premiums in anticipation of the market \nreforms this bill will make, as we have seen the credit card industry \ndo in anticipation of the important reforms we made earlier in the \nyear. Americans cannot afford to allow that kind of predatory behavior.\n  Finally, I remain concerned that the current version of the public \noption included in this bill could shift significant risks to taxpayers \nover time unnecessarily, and I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto find a better and bipartisan solution for this\n\n[[Page S11924]]\n\nissue. I have suggested that a freestanding, premium-supported, \ncompetitive community option that would trigger on a date certain, if \nour private market reforms fail to work, might be a possible \ncompromise. That would include language that Senator Snowe and other of \nmy colleagues have been working on for several months.\n  Because I am hopeful we can make progress on each of these concerns \nand others through an amendment and debate process that is open and \ntransparent, I believe that it is incumbent upon me to allow the bill \nto move to debate on the Senate floor.\n  I stand ready to work together with my colleagues to fashion a \nprincipled and hopefully bipartisan compromise in the end to achieve \nwhat the people in my State need, and what many Americans need, and \nwhich we really have to do our best to try to give them.\n  Finally, I know my time is up, but I would like to ask a personal \nprivilege for just 1 more minute to address an issue that has come up, \nunfortunately, in the last 24 hours, driven by some very partisan \nRepublican bloggers. So I think I need to respond and will do so now.\n  One of the provisions in the framework of this bill has to do with \nfixing a very difficult situation that Louisiana is facing. For reasons \nthat are simply beyond my comprehension, some partisans have decided to \nattack me for leading an effort to address a serious budget shortfall \nfacing my state.\n  The reason for this situation goes back to the disastrous hurricanes \nof 2005. I am not going to review the horrors of Katrina and Rita. The \nlevees broke, and by the way, the courts have just ruled that the Corps \nof Engineers was, as I have said from the beginning, responsible. But I \nwill comment more on that at another date.\n  But, nonetheless, in 2005 Louisiana experienced two of the worst \nnatural disasters in recent memory. In an effort to aid the recovery, \nCongress stepped in with a massive aid package for Louisianans--thank \nyou--that infused grant dollars and direct assistance.\n  Some of necessary one-time recovery dollars, in addition to the \nincreased economic activity, were calculated into our State's per \ncapita income. The result has been that Louisiana's per capita income--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask for 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The result is Louisiana's per capita income was \nabnormally inflated. You can understand that. There were billions of \ndollars that came in from insurance and road, home, and community \ndevelopment block grants.\n  In addition, labor and wage costs went up because there was a \nconstriction in the market, which any economist can tell us always \nhappens after a natural disaster. As a result, when we did the \ncalculation under the law, it made us seem as if we were a state with a \nhigh per capita income like Connecticut and not a state with a low per \ncapita income like Louisiana, almost as if we had become rich \novernight. That was not the case. Our State is still as poor as it was, \nif not poorer as a consequence of those devastating storms. I am not \ngoing to be defensive about asking for help in this situation. It is \nnot a $100 million fix, it is a nearly $300 million fix. It is the No. \n1 request of my Governor who is a Republican. He explicitly asked that \nI pursue these funds. It is unanimously supported by every Member of \nour delegation, Democratic and Republican. I am proud to have asked for \nit. I am proud to have fought for it. I will continue to. But that is \nnot the reason I am moving to debate.\n  The reason I am moving to the debate, as I expressed in this \nstatement, is that the cost of healthcare is bankrupting families and \nit is bankrupting our government. We cannot afford the status quo.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I know I have gone over \nmy time, but I wanted to get that on the record. I support moving \nforward with the debate and look forward to working with them to \nimprove it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to express my deep concerns about \nSenator Reid's bill on two very critical issues. These are not the only \nthings of which I am critical but I wish to focus on two issues: \ncoverage of abortion and conscience clause protections for medical \nproviders opposed to abortion.\n  As we can see, the Stupak compromise amendment, which was supported \nby 64 House Democrats and a majority of Republicans, reads:\n\n       No funds authorized or appropriated by this Act may be used \n     to pay for abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any \n     health plan that includes coverage of abortion.\n\n  That is all it says. It should be abundantly clear to each Member of \nthis body. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed pro-life \nlanguage exactly 2 weeks ago that is markedly different from that \ncontained in the Reid proposal. The House provisions, in contrast to \nthe terribly flawed provisions in the Reid bill, contain language that \nwould not only safeguard the rights of the unborn but would also \nprevent medical providers from being coerced into performing procedures \nthat violate their conscience. The Stupak-Pitts amendment was adopted \nby a significant margin, 240 to 194. That represents 55 percent of the \nHouse of Representatives, including 25 percent of the Democratic \ncaucus.\n  Even more telling happens to be two polls released this week by the \nWashington Post and ABC News and CNN. They confirmed that 61 percent of \nthe American population do not support Federal funding for abortion. \nThis vote should serve as a strong signal to each Member that these \nprotections cannot be ignored and must be contained in any measure we \nadopt. Unfortunately, the language in the Reid bill explicitly allows \nwhat the Stupak-Pitts language would prevent. The Reid language \nauthorizes abortion in the government-operated health plan or the \npublic option and Federal subsidies for insurance coverage that include \nabortion. It is not the Stupak-Pitts language.\n  The sanctity of life is not an issue that can be traded away for \npolitical expediency. During committee consideration of the health \nreform legislation, I offered two important pro-life amendments. The \nfirst amendment, which I offered in both the HELP Committee and the \nFinance Committee, strictly prohibited Federal dollars being used to \nfinance elective abortions. The second amendment provided conscience \nclause protections to medical providers opposed to abortion. In other \nwords, we should never force people who have a conscience against \nabortion to have to perform abortions or participate in abortions. This \nlanguage was based on the Hyde-Weldon provision contained in every \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill since 2004. It also was included in the \nHouse-passed bill. Both my amendments were defeated.\n  I notice my colleagues, Senators Brownback and Johanns, are in the \nChamber. I ask both of them: What is wrong with including the Stupak-\nPitts language in the Reid bill?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I, first, thank my colleague for \noffering these amendments in committee.\n  In both the HELP and Finance Committees, you said: Let's put in the \nHyde language, and both times the amendments were defeated in \ncommittee. I appreciate my colleague raising it. Proponents of the Reid \nbill will tell us the abortion funding language is essentially the Hyde \nlanguage included in the annual Labor-HHS appropriations bill. That is \nplain wrong. The Hyde amendment specifically removes abortion from \ngovernment programs. The Reid bill specifically allows abortion to be \noffered in two huge new government programs. The Reid bill tries to \nexplain this contradiction by calling for segregation of Federal \ndollars when Federal subsidies are used to purchase health plans. This \nsegregation of funds, though, actually violates the Hyde amendment, \nwhich prevents funding of abortion not only by Federal funds but also \nby State matching funds within the same plan. Simply put, today Federal \nand State Medicaid dollars are not segregated, and the Reid bill \nspecifically authorizes something the Hyde amendment specifically \nrejects.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. If I might join in, it is enormously important we lay a \ngood record as to what this is all about and why the Hyde amendment has \nbeen the\n\n[[Page S11925]]\n\nlaw of our Nation for so long. It is important. Therefore, I direct a \nquestion to Senator Hatch.\n  Please, if you would, describe how the Hyde amendment works today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Today's Hyde language, which has been in every annual \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill since 1976, specifically prohibits \nFederal dollars being used to pay for abortions except if the pregnancy \nwas the result of rape, incest, or the life of the mother is in danger. \nThe Hyde language applies to all five of the federally funded health \ncare programs: Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Services, TRICARE, and \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program or the FEHBP. However, it \nis important to note that today there is no segregation of Federal \nfunds in any Federal health care program--none. For example, the \nMedicaid Program receives both Federal and State dollars. There is no \nsegregation of either Federal Medicaid dollars or State Medicaid \ndollars. States that do provide elective abortions for Medicaid \nbeneficiaries must do so from a completely different account; that is, \nState-only dollars. No Federal or State dollars from the State Medicaid \nProgram may even be placed in that ``State only'' pot of money.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. That was an excellent explanation of what Hyde is about. \nIt underscores why we are so upset about the unbelievable expansion \nthat is going to occur if this Reid bill is passed. You mentioned the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program. Let me take a minute to talk \nabout how that works because, again, I think it underscores the point \nwe are making today. Let me give an example. The current Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program does this. It has 250 participating \nhealth plans that do not cover abortion. Federal employees pay a share \nof the cost.\n  The Federal Government, through tax dollars collected, pays the \nbalance. So it is a mixture of Federal employees' contributions through \ntheir paychecks and the Federal Government getting the money through \ntax dollars. Federal employees cannot opt for elective abortion \ncoverage because taxpayer dollars are subsidizing the cost of their \nemployee plan. You can see how we have tried to remain true to the \ndistinction you talked about. As many have said during the debate, if \nit is good enough for Federal employees, then why isn't it good for the \nrest of the citizens?\n  I ask Senator Brownback, what is in the Reid bill that does not \nreflect the current Hyde language? And if I could maybe direct that to \nboth of you or to Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Well, if I could follow up quickly on the last point, \nI think it is clear that if we are not going to put this in the Federal \nemployees benefit insurance system, then we should not put it in this \nsystem. Yet this is a billing expansion that is taking place. The \nDemocratic health bill would explicitly authorize abortion to be \ncovered in the government option. It also mandates that there must be \nabortion coverage in every insurance market in the country. This is an \nenormous expansion, a radical departure from the 30-year policy that \nrepresents the Hyde amendment. The abortion language that was included \nin the bill is a huge departure from 30 years of bipartisan Federal \npolicy prohibiting Federal tax dollars paying for elective abortions. \nThe language in the Senate bill explicitly authorizes the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to include abortion in the public option and \npermits government subsidies for plans that pay for abortion.\n  The Capps language, commonly referred to in the Senate bill, contains \na clever accounting gimmick that proponents say separates private and \npublic funds for abortion coverage. However, it has been proven over \nand over by outside reviewers that the Capps measure would include both \nabortion coverage and funding in the government-run public option as \nwell as for those plans in the insurance exchange. Representative Bart \nStupak, a Democrat from Michigan, explained the issue very clearly in \nan op-ed he wrote yesterday. He wrote:\n\n       The Capps amendment, which is the basis of the Senate \n     language, departed from Hyde in several important and \n     troubling ways: By mandating that at least one plan in the \n     health insurance exchange provide abortion coverage; by \n     requiring a minimum $1 monthly charge for all covered \n     individuals that would go towards paying for abortions; and \n     by allowing individuals receiving Federal affordability \n     credits to purchase health insurance plans that cover \n     abortion. Hyde currently prohibits direct Federal funding of \n     abortion. The Stupak amendment is a continuation of that \n     policy--nothing more, nothing less.\n\n  I would like to ask Senator Hatch about this provision, about what we \nneed to talk about on the exchanges and the types of plans that will be \nincluded in the exchanges and about how this is an expansion of the \nabortion language.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't it true that one health plan must be offered in the \nexchange that covers elective abortions? Isn't that a departure from \nFederal policy?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Reid health care reform bill would require at \nleast one health care plan to offer elective abortions in each State \nhealth insurance exchange. However, nothing in the Reid bill ensures \nthat the one plan that must cover elective abortions be the plan that \nis most affordable or least affordable. In other words, if I do not \nwish to have a plan that covers elective abortions but all I can afford \nis that plan, where does that leave me? Should my constituents have to \ncompromise their own moral code in order to receive health care; in \nother words, that they would have to buy a plan that covers abortion?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Today, no Federal health program requires the coverage \nof elective abortions. This is a clear departure from current law, and \nI cannot imagine us forcing people to pay for insurance that covers \nabortions when it is so unconscionable to so many of the American \npeople.\n  I also would like to make one other point perfectly clear. The \nStupak-Pitts compromise amendment would not prohibit the ability of \nwomen to obtain elective abortions as long as they use their own money \nto purchase these policies. I think it is important we get that piece \nof it clear as well.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad the Senator did clarify that.\n  I say to Senator Johanns, isn't it true that the Stupak amendment, \npassed in the House by a considerable margin, allows women to purchase, \nwith their own money, separate supplemental health coverage that may \ninclude the coverage of elective abortions--if they do it with their \nown money?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I say to Senator Hatch, I am glad you raised that issue. \nYes, that is correct. Your understanding is correct. Women would be \nallowed to purchase separate elective abortion coverage with their own \nmoney.\n  I ask Senator Brownback, do you have a comment on that, or a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Well, I think this is a key thing for us to keep in \nmind, that it is true that women can purchase separately, with their \nown money, use their own funds to be able to provide for their own \nabortion coverage. But what we are saying here today is that we should \nnot have this as part of the Federal Government. We should not have it \nas part of the Federal funding program. We should not be using taxpayer \ndollars to fund abortions, as we have not done for 30 years. That has \nbeen the longstanding bipartisan program. But it is not prohibited that \nan individual could go ahead and buy this service on their own.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I would add, too, it is absolutely correct that the \nStupak language allows women to purchase both a supplemental policy for \nthe coverage of elective abortions and a comprehensive health care plan \nthat includes coverage of elective abortions as long as they pay for \ntheir plan with their own money. It allows that.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me just interject something here because I think \nthis is a very important point to make, following up on what Senator \nHatch just said. Some say that a person would never want to purchase a \nseparate rider to cover abortion. It just would not happen, they say. \nBut they misunderstand what the Stupak language actually allows.\n  Let me be clear about this. If a woman wants her health insurance \nplan to provide elective abortion services, she does have the choice to \npurchase a health insurance plan that provides that on the exchange. \nShe just has to pay for it with her own money. Am I correct in that \ninterpretation or have I misunderstood that?\n\n[[Page S11926]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct. A woman may purchase with her own funds \neither a supplemental policy that covers elective abortions or an \nentire health plan that includes the coverage of elective abortions. \nLook, a woman has always been able to do that, and frankly, we do not \ndeny her the right to do that. What we say is, taxpayers should not be \npaying the cost of it. They should not be called upon to pay for \nelective abortions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I say to Senator Hatch, as someone who has been in \nthis body for some years and as someone who has followed this issue \ncourageously for many years, what we are asking for, again, is just \nwhat has been established since 1977 in this body and in the House.\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. That is current law, that Federal funds may not pay \nfor abortion or plans that cover abortion. Now that is the fundamental \ncomponent of the Hyde language. And to be clear, the Stupak language \ndoes not prevent people from purchasing their own private plans that \ninclude elective abortion coverage.\n  Let me just change for a second here. I would like to now talk about \nthe conscience clause. To me, this is extremely important: the \nconscience clause protections for medical providers. The conscience \nclause protections in the final House bill for pro-life providers are \nnot included in the Reid bill. They are in the House bill but not in \nthe Reid bill. The House adopted language that codified the essence of \nthe Weldon-Hyde conscience protections, including in the annual HHS \nappropriations bills since 2004.\n  This summer, the House Energy and Commerce Committee accepted these \nprotections unanimously during consideration of their bill. Let me \nemphasize that point: unanimously, there was not one objection to it. \nThat means all members of the committee--with ideologies ranging from \nthe chairman, Henry Waxman, who represents Hollywood, CA, to the \nranking Republican, Joe Barton, who represents a conservative \ncongressional district in Texas--they all recognized the importance of \nadopting this language.\n  In contrast, the Reid bill has stronger protections for abortion \nproviders than for providers who have conscience objections to \nabortion. On one hand, abortion providers may not be ``discriminated'' \nagainst for performing any abortion anywhere. On the other hand, pro-\nlife providers must cite a particular ``moral or religious belief'' to \nprevent discrimination. This is narrower than current law under Hyde-\nWeldon.\n  Moreover, it does not extend the protections to pro-life health \nplans. In other words, a Catholic health system that requires a local \nhospital to stop providing abortions in order to become part of its \nhealth system could be accused of discrimination.\n  What is wrong with this picture?\n  Let me ask Senator Johanns, don't you think it makes sense to protect \nhealth care providers who have objections of conscience to abortion so \nthey are not forced to provide abortions?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Absolutely. As the Senator offers this explanation about \na Catholic health care provider, it hits right to the heart of this \nissue. I most certainly agree with the Senator and I want him to know \nthat many Nebraskans agree with him and agree with me on this issue.\n  I got a letter recently from a gentleman out in western Nebraska, \nfrom a little community called Ainsworth--a great area of our State. He \nwrote to me and said this:\n\n       I urge you to support freedom of conscience which protects \n     professionals from being forced to participate in abortion \n     and other anti-life practices, which include end-of-life \n     issues.\n\n  I had another constituent from Gretna, NE, more on the eastern side \nof our State, and this constituent wrote to me and said this:\n\n       I am also very disturbed to learn that health care workers \n     may be forced to act and speak contrary to their own \n     consciences. I find it shocking to believe that this is being \n     considered within a serious conversation/debate.\n\n  We are going to put up a chart. President Obama has weighed in on \nsome of these issues. President Obama gave a speech to a joint session \nof Congress. We all remember that was on September 9 of this year. He \nsaid this:\n\n       And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up--under our \n     plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and \n     federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\n  The President has gone on to state on multiple occasions that he \nwould not support abortion in a health care bill. The President has \nstated that over and over. The President has also stated on multiple \noccasions--both as a candidate and as President--that it is his goal to \nlower the incidence of abortion. That is what he says, not what the \nDemocrat-led Senate has done, though, relative to this bill, which he \nhas embraced. And it is not what the leadership has done in this bill.\n  You see, my colleagues, I see this as a radical abortion approach, a \nradical piece of language. And you can go right to the bill itself, to \npages 116 to 124 of this 2,074-page bill, and you can read it yourself.\n  I have to tell you, there is so much about this bill that is bad \npolicy, but this is especially damaging. The President promised us he \nwould not let it happen. Do the President and the Members of his party, \nwho control the Senate, who wrote the bill behind closed doors, do they \nreally believe abortion is health care? Why didn't they just strip this \nlanguage out? Why didn't they adopt the Stupak language, which was \nvoted upon in the House, the Stupak compromise? Why didn't they adopt \nthat, knowing that 64 Democrats had signed on to that language?\n  What do you think about the President's commitment and his promise to \nus not to use Federal dollars to fund abortions? I say to Senator \nBrownback, I would like to hear his thoughts on that.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was there that evening, along with the Senator and \nSenator Hatch and almost all of the Senators, when the President was \naddressing us on health care. I remember vividly sitting there and \nlistening to these words, the ones you just mentioned. He was very \nclear, very concise; there was no fudging around on it:\n\n       And one more misunderstanding I want to clear up--under our \n     plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and \n     federal conscience laws will remain in place.\n\n  Yes, that is specifically violated in the bill, and they had a very \nsimple route to change it. They could have just put the Stupak language \nin that has already passed the House. That is the Hyde language that \nhas been agreed to by this body and others for 30 years here. Instead, \nthey put in this abortion-expansion language.\n  I will show another chart here a little bit later on. The last time \nwe funded abortions here was between 1974 and 1977, right after Roe v. \nWade and before the Hyde language in 1977. Do you know how many \nabortions were funded annually by the Federal Government at that period \nof time? If we are going back to that policy, if we are looking to go \nback to that era where the Federal Government was funding it, Medicaid \nfunded as many as 300,000--300,000 annually. Now, I would ask \neverybody, pro-choice or pro-life, do you want your taxpayer dollars to \npay for 300,000 abortions a year? I do not think anybody wants to see \nus do that.\n  President Clinton we all remember very clearly saying often that he \nwanted to make abortion safe, legal, and rare. Adding 300,000 does not \ndo that.\n  So the President took the time, in a carefully tailored and vetted \nspeech that all of us were there to hear--the Presiding Officer, as \nwell; it was nationally televised in prime time--to tell Congress the \nwords we have quoted here today and to make that specific promise. And \nthat promise is broken in the Reid legislation before us today. We sat \nthere in the House Chamber and heard him say those words. Our \nconstituents watching the speech at home heard those words. I have to \nbelieve these are the kinds of broken promises that are making our \nconstituents lose their trust in government.\n  But the fact is, as so many people have pointed out, abortion is very \nmuch in this health care bill. Many Democrats and Republicans \nacknowledge this. Mr. Stupak, whom I have quoted several times, is just \none of them.\n  If we want to do more than just pay lipservice to lowering the \nincidence of abortion, we need to oppose the motion to proceed, and we \nshould have had the Stupak compromise language included in the bill in \nthe first place since the President clearly stated he did not want \nFederal dollars to be used for the funding of abortion.\n\n[[Page S11927]]\n\n  Consider the fact that when Federal funding is not available for \nabortion, fewer abortions occur. When Federal funding is available, as \nwe have seen in the past, thousands more will occur.\n  As shown on this chart, here is why the Hyde amendment is so \nimportant. The administrators running the Medicaid Program funded, as I \nnoted, over 300,000 per year. That is almost 1 million abortions paid \nfor by the country's taxpayers out of their pockets when the Hyde \nlanguage was not the law of the land. That was until the Hyde amendment \nwas enacted in 1976 because the American people disagreed with being \nforced to pay for abortions. Whether they are pro-choice or pro-life, \nthey did not want taxpayer dollars to go for this.\n  One other example of government ushering abortion policy through \nhealth care legislation is when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts \nrecently passed its State-mandated insurance, Commonwealth Care. They \nfailed to include an explicit exclusion of abortion, like Senator Hatch \ntried to get in committee or like they had in the House language, the \nStupak language, so abortions there were funded immediately in \nMassachusetts. In fact, according to the Commonwealth Care Web site, \nabortion is considered covered under ``outpatient medical care.''\n  The Federal Government should not go down this road. The President \nmade a commitment to the American people, and the Democrat-led Senate \nhas failed to include that commitment in this bill. They included \nradical language that will increase the incidence of abortion.\n  I say to Senator Johanns, don't you think it makes sense to protect \nhealth care providers, when we look at that issue here, who have \nobjections of conscience to abortions so they are not forced to provide \nabortions?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Absolutely. It absolutely makes sense. I say to Senator \nHatch and Senator Brownback, one of the things that has been very \nremarkable to me--this bill just came out, as you know. It was behind \nclosed doors for weeks and weeks and came out in the middle of the \nnight, actually.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, pro-life groups weighed in on this bill \nimmediately. For all of the complexity, for all of the definitions, for \nall of the buried language, they saw immediately what this bill was all \nabout. Pro-life groups across the board have opposed the provisions of \nthis legislation. No pro-life group has taken the bait. They represent \nmillions of Americans across this great country.\n  Let me, if I might, take a moment and quote from what they have said. \nThe National Right to Life Committee--and again I am quoting--says \nthis:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has rejected the \n     bipartisan Stupak-Pitts amendment and has substituted \n     completely unacceptable language that would result in \n     coverage of abortion on demand in two big, new Federal \n     Government programs.\n\n  The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has weighed in. They \nsaid this one is the worst bill so far--the worst one so far on this \nissue. Again, I am quoting:\n\n       The conference believes the bill violates the long-standing \n     Federal policy against the use of Federal funds for elective \n     abortions in health plans that include such abortions, a \n     policy upheld in all health programs covered by the Hyde \n     amendment: the Children's Health Insurance Program, the \n     Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, and now in the \n     House-passed Affordable Health Care for America Act. We \n     believe legislation that violates this moral principle is not \n     true health care reform and must be amended to reflect it. If \n     that fails, the current legislation should be opposed.\n\n  The Family Research Council says this, describing the legislation as \na:\n\n       . . . direct attack on the principles set forth in the Hyde \n     amendment over 30 years ago. This bill is one only an \n     abortionist could love.\n\n  Concerned Women for America said the following:\n\n       In a dramatic departure from current policy, the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act will provide government \n     funding for elective abortions. Over all, this bill raises \n     serious pro-life concerns.\n\n  Senator Hatch referred to polls. The polls indicate the majority of \nAmericans do not want their tax dollars paying for elective abortions. \nAccording to that CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey, 6 in 10 \nAmericans favor a ban on the use of Federal funds for abortion. It also \nindicates that the public may also favor--literally favor--legislation \nthat would prevent many women from getting their health insurance plan \nto cover the cost of abortion even if no Federal funds were involved. \nThis poll indicates that 61 percent of the public oppose the use of \npublic money for abortions for women who cannot afford the procedure.\n  I have to ask the question of Senator Hatch: When will we listen to \nthe American people on this important issue?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask Senator Johanns, have you seen similar polls \nindicating that a majority of Americans do not want their taxpayer \nfunds used for paying for elective abortions? Have the Senator seen \nthose national polls?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I have. We have seen the polls. We have gotten letters \nfrom our constituents. Consistently, in poll after poll, we can see \nwhat the American people are saying. They do not want their tax dollars \nto fund abortions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me ask a question to both Senator \nBrownback and Senator Johanns. I know my constituents are very upset \nabout the possibility of their tax dollars being used to pay for \nelective abortions. I even brought a few of their letters down to the \nfloor so I could read them. If you don't mind, I wish to read them. Can \nI take a few minutes to do that?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Please do.\n  Mr. HATCH. These are just a few. We have all kinds of letters. I \nthought I would mention a few of these since they are on point here, as \nfar as I am concerned.\n  Here is one from a woman, a Ph.D., the President of AUL Action, \nCharmaine Yoest:\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Americans United for Life, AUL \n     Action, I write to express our strong opposition to the \n     Senate proceeding to Majority Leader Reid's health care \n     reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     Majority Leader Reid's bill does not include the Stupak-Pitts \n     language added to H.R. 3962, which is necessary to prevent \n     Federal funding of abortion. AUL Action will score against \n     all votes to proceed to this bill because it does not contain \n     the Stupak-Pitts language. Majority Leader Reid's bill \n     explicitly allows the Secretary of the Department of Health \n     to include abortion coverage in the ``community health \n     insurance option'' and allows Federal subsidies to go to \n     private insurance plans that include abortion coverage. In \n     addition, the bill also requires that at least one private \n     plan in each exchange provide coverage for all abortions. The \n     passage of a health care reform bill without language \n     explicitly excluding abortion coverage and funding is \n     unacceptable to pro-life Americans. We strongly encourage you \n     to vote against all procedural motions to move to the \n     majority leader's bill, including cloture on the motion to \n     proceed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Charmaine Yoest, Ph.D.,\n                                  President and CEO of AUL Action.\n\n  Here is another one. It is from one of my personal constituents.\n\n       Dear Senator: As an American with a growing disdain for the \n     heavy handedness and disregard for the wishes of the American \n     people, I adamantly oppose any plan brought to the table that \n     would require me to pay for abortions with my tax dollars. \n     Any government-run health care system with this provision is \n     bad for America and violates the deep convictions of many \n     Americans. Furthermore, I am infuriated by Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid's deceptive course of action in secretively \n     creating his own version of a health care reform plan. Reid's \n     underhanded tactic diminishes the opportunity for public \n     debate and scrutiny which flies in the face of our \n     legislative process. I strongly oppose Harry Reid's health \n     care overhaul plan to nationalize our system. I urge you to \n     oppose any nationalized health care bill and any plan \n     containing an abortion mandate.\n\n  Here is another one. This is an e-mail to me. It says this:\n\n       Hello, Mr. Hatch. I am writing for 4 registered voters in \n     my family which include my husband, my parents, and myself. \n     We are very concerned about the Federal health care \n     legislation. We believe that it must support several of our \n     beliefs. We believe that life must be respected and cared for \n     from conception to natural death. As such, we do not want any \n     of our tax dollars going to abortions or euthanasia. We have \n     a desire for the continued support of the Hyde amendment of \n     1976. Our family supports charities which provide counseling \n     and material goods needed by families who have an unplanned \n     pregnancy. We want to support them in having the baby and \n     caring for themselves and the child. We do this by donating \n     things that are needed by the mom-to-be during her pregnancy. \n     We also have donated furniture and other things needed by the \n     baby. These have been given to Birthright--a program \n     supported by donations. We want access to health care for \n     all. This includes fair treatment of our immigrants. We do \n     not want any of their health care that they may be receiving \n     right now to be taken from them. In the\n\n[[Page S11928]]\n\n     Bible, God tells the Jews to be kind to the aliens, as they \n     themselves were aliens at one time in their promised land. \n     Our family also wants a freedom of conscience clause that \n     allows for health care workers to refuse to take part in \n     procedures involved in an activity that goes against their \n     choice. Please consider our beliefs.\n\n  Whether you agree with every word of these, they are interesting.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       During the floor debate on the health care reform bill, \n     please support an amendment to incorporate long-standing \n     policies against abortion funding and in favor of conscience \n     rights. If these serious concerns are not addressed, the \n     final bill should be opposed. Life should be respected from \n     conception to natural death. I am a retired teacher and am \n     hoping to be able to receive the care I choose to have until \n     my natural death. My care should not be based on my \n     productivity in society years from now. Thank you for your \n     stand on abortion in the past.\n\n  Then she has a PS:\n\n       My parents don't have and do not know how to use a computer \n     to contact you. They feel the same as my husband and I feel \n     about the above issues.\n\n  Then she lists the names of her parents.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am a registered Democrat strongly in \n     favor of health care reform. I am also committed to \n     protecting the unborn and to safeguarding the conscience of \n     each health care provider who is uncomfortable with providing \n     abortion services. During floor debate on the health care \n     reform bill, please support an amendment to incorporate long-\n     standing policies against abortion funding and in favor of \n     conscience rights. If these serious concerns are not \n     addressed, the final bill should be opposed. Genuine health \n     care reform should protect the life and dignity of all people \n     from the moment of conception until natural death.\n\n  Another one.\n\n       Senator Hatch: During floor debate on the health care \n     reform bill, please support an amendment to incorporate long-\n     standing policies against abortion funding and in favor of \n     conscience rights. If these serious concerns are not \n     addressed, the final bill should be opposed. Genuine health \n     care reform should protect the life and dignity of all people \n     from the moment of conception until natural death.\n\n  I also have a petition to Senator Orrin G. Hatch opposing using \ntaxpayer dollars to fund abortion. This petition says:\n\n       One out of every three babies conceived is a victim of \n     abortion, a tragedy that has claimed more millions of \n     innocent lives since the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision \n     legalizing abortion on demand. Every abortion is a gruesome \n     act that ends an innocent human life and cannot be tolerated \n     in a civil society. The pro-abortion lobby is seeking to hide \n     abortion funding into virtually every piece of ``must-pass'' \n     legislation, including continuing resolutions, budget and \n     authorization bills, so-called ``economic'' bills, and even \n     the Defense authorization bill. I urge you to actively oppose \n     and, if necessary, filibuster all attempts to use the budget \n     to force Federal funding of abortion and abortionists and to \n     pack the courts with activist, pro-abortion judges.\n\n  I thought I would read a few of those interesting letters to set a \ntone here. I have received all kinds of letters, but I chose a few, at \nrandom, to read on the Senate floor this afternoon.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I was recently at a Veterans Day parade in \nLeavenworth, KS, and I had a number of people coming up to me opposed \nto the health care bill. I had one come up to me and say they were in \nfavor of it and all the rest were opposed. It starts on the basis that \nit is fiscally insane what we are considering doing with $12 billion in \ndebt, and then we are going to add a multitrillion-dollar entitlement \nprogram on top of this. The Federal Government is hemorrhaging money. \nWhy on Earth would we do that? Then they are scared about what else is \nin the bill, and then this feature comes up as well.\n  Finally, Senator Johanns was putting in statements from various \ngroups, and I ask unanimous consent that this statement from the United \nStates Conference of Catholic Bishops be included at the end of our \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Catholic Bishops issued this yesterday and said \nthis:\n\n       The legislative proposal recently unveiled in the Senate \n     does not meet these moral criteria. Specifically, it violates \n     the longstanding Federal policy against the use of Federal \n     funds for elective abortions and health plans that include \n     such abortions--a policy upheld in all health programs \n     covered by the Hyde Amendment, the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program--\n\n  SCHIP, which Senator Hatch helped to get started--\n\n     the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program--\n\nthat Senator Johanns spoke about--\n\n     and now in the House-passed ``Affordable Health Care for \n     America Act.'' We believe legislation that violates this \n     moral principle is not true health care reform and must be \n     amended to reflect it. If that fails, the current legislation \n     should be opposed.\n\n  This is the Catholic Bishops, generally in favor of health care \nreform, and they are saying this fails on this account and must not be \nin this legislation and can't be considered as part of health care \nreform.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask Senator Johanns, where do we go from here? We are \ngoing to have a cloture vote at 8 o'clock tonight on the motion to \nproceed. What would be the advice on that?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Senator. Let me, if I might, before I \naddress that, tell my colleagues how proud I am to stand here with \nthese two champions of this issue, Senator Brownback and Senator Hatch. \nThey have a remarkable history of every time they had an opportunity \nstanding strong on an issue that I must admit is not the most popular \nissue in Washington, DC, to promote, and I admire their courage.\n  To address the relevant question of the day, the Stupak protections, \nthat compromise that was reached in the House, it is not in this bill.\n  Of course, since it is not in this underlying bill, this Reid bill, \nit is very unlikely to be in the final bill. I wish somebody could \ndisprove this. But, very simply, there aren't enough pro-life Senators \nto break this provision and get the Stupak amendment passed on the \nSenate floor if we propose it as an amendment--and I am sure it will \nbe--there just aren't enough.\n  That is why I have been making the case over the last 48 hours that \nthe motion to proceed is the key vote on abortion in the health care \ndebate. The most important pro-life vote that a pro-life Senator will \ncast, I believe, in the entire time they are here is on this motion to \nproceed. I have seen all the arguments from many, saying this is a \nprocedural vote; that there is nothing to worry about; that it just \nbegins debate, and we might potentially vote this bill down, and we can \ndo some amendments and some tweaking.\n  But the facts suggest otherwise. The Congressional Research Service \nhas looked into this. Between the 106th and 110th Congresses, there \nwere 41 cases, according to the Congressional Research Service, in \nwhich the Senate approved a motion to proceed and then proceeded to a \nvote on the final bill. Do you know what the end result of those 41 \ncases were, when the motion to proceed was approved? It was 40 times \nout of 41--about 97 percent--went on to receive final approval. In \nother words, all but one passed into law.\n  This suggests to me this vote tonight at 8 o'clock on the life issue \nis very well determinative. Some of my colleagues also argue if we \ndon't like the bill, we should not block the opportunity to amend it, \nand they say let us proceed.\n  I don't believe, if you are truly pro-life as a Senator, you can make \nthat argument. Here is why: Everybody in the Senate knows what it will \ntake to amend the Reid bill on something like this. It will take 60 \nvotes. It is the way the Senate operates. It will take 60 votes. Again, \nI say to Senator Hatch and Senator Brownback, I wish I could count 60 \npro-life Senators. I wish I could do that. But by anybody's count, I \nbelieve--mine included--there aren't 60 here.\n  I believe if you are pro-life, every opportunity you get to stand for \nthe life issue, you must stand for that issue. These truly are our most \nvulnerable citizens. I feel very strongly that at 8 o'clock, when we \nare gaveled to a vote, we need to stand up on this issue--this life \nissue--or there is a 97-percent chance it is lost.\n  I will conclude my thoughts on this by saying this: There were many \nstrong and courageous pro-life Democrats in the House. I watched that. \nThat was remarkable. Can you imagine the pressure they were put under? \nThis evening, we just need one--not many, just one Democrat--who will \ncome here and say I am pro-life. If we don't stand together tonight, \nthis bill will radically expand abortion, and I cannot live with that.\n\n[[Page S11929]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his remarks. I thank both Senators \nBrownback and Johanns.\n  Before coming here, the Senator was the Secretary of Agriculture. He \nis from Nebraska. By any measure, he is a very sincere, dedicated, and \nprincipled person. We all know that, and I think the world of the \nSenator.\n  I appreciate standing on the Senate floor with the Senator to chat \nabout this matter. Senator Brownback, without question is a leader in \nthis body in protecting the rights of the unborn. It is one of the \nthings I most love about him. There are many things that cause all of \nus to hold the Senator from Kansas in very high regard and esteem. He \nis principled and dignified about it. He is friendly to everybody. But \nthe Senator doesn't mince words when it comes to standing up on these \nvery important issues.\n  Look, all we are saying is, let's protect the Hyde language. You do \nthat with the Stupak-Pitts language. What is wrong with including that \nlanguage? All we want to do is not have federal funds pay for abortion. \nThe vast majority of people in this country feel that way too.\n  Second, why should people of conscience, who really and sincerely \nbelieve that abortions are wrong, be forced to participate in abortions \nin any way, shape, or form? Unfortunately, this bill could lead to that \nforced participation. I just do not understand what is so difficult \nabout including the same language included in the bill passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. What is so problematic about our body doing \nthe same?\n  If you are a nurse, doctor, health care practitioner, Catholic \nhospital, or an LDS hospital out of Utah, if we have the Stupak-Pitts \nconscience protection language passed by the House, you cannot be \nforced to participate in abortions. These are highly religious people \nwith highly religious motivations who have made this the greatest \ncountry in the world. If we do not change this language in the Reid \nbill, there will be Federal funding of abortion, and there will be \npeople who could be pushed toward participation in abortion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It has been my pleasure to join Senators Hatch and \nJohanns on this effort. I have worked with both of them in many \ndifferent capacities and jobs.\n  This is as serious a pro-life vote as I have seen. If this gets \npassed, the Federal Government will be funding somewhere north of \n300,000 abortions a year. If it was 300,000 back in the 1974-to-1976 \ntimeframe, with the growth in U.S. population, you are probably looking \nat north of that number of Federal taxpayer dollars funding abortions. \nI cannot imagine many people in this country being satisfied about that \nkind of number taking place. I can't imagine that. But that is our past \nexperience when the government funds abortion.\n  Those are the numbers we are talking about. I note, too, the country \nhas a longstanding ethic and moral code. We are a moral people, and we \nhave been from the outset. Some people say this or that, but a big part \nof that has been that basic moral code, that basic thought within the \nJudeo-Christian ethic that we respect life. This goes back to when \nMoses talks to the people about going into the Promised Land. He is \ngiving his last lecture to the Jewish people before going into the \nPromised Land. In that last lecture--Moses doesn't get to go in \nhimself, but he gets the people together. They march for 40 years in \nthe wilderness. He knows he is not going in, but they are, and he gives \na lecture.\n  Deuteronomy 30:19 says something that is applicable here:\n\n       This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you \n     that I have set before you life and death, blessings and \n     curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may \n     live.\n\n  This is in the fundamental ethic and background of our country. That \nis what we have to choose today. Do we choose life or death? Choose \nlife, so that you and your children might live.\n  As Senator Johanns notes, we just need one vote on the other side to \nchange this, and this language gets pulled out and Stupak gets put in. \nJust one vote. If we cannot get to 60--and you have to get there--and \nthat one person says: I am not going to do it, unless you put Stupak in \nthis, it changes. We need just one to choose life, and it will change. \nIt has been a pleasure to join with both Senators today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                          United States Conference\n\n\n                                          of Catholic Bishops,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 20, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the United States Conference of \n     Catholic Bishops (USCCB), we strongly urge the Senate to \n     incorporate essential changes to the Senate's health care \n     reform bill to ensure that needed health care reform \n     legislation truly protects the life, dignity, consciences and \n     health of all. We especially urge the Senate to act as the \n     House has in the following respects:\n       Keep in place current federal law on abortion funding and \n     conscience protections on abortion;\n       Protect the access to health care that immigrants currently \n     have and remove current barriers to access; and\n       Include strong provisions for adequate affordability and \n     coverage standards.\n       The Catholic Bishops of the United States have long \n     supported adequate and affordable health care for all. As \n     pastors and teachers, we believe genuine health care reform \n     must protect human life and dignity, not threaten them, \n     especially for the most voiceless and vulnerable. We believe \n     health care legislation must respect the consciences of \n     providers, taxpayers, and others, not violate them. We \n     believe universal coverage should be truly universal, not \n     deny health care to those in need because of their condition, \n     age, where they come from or when they arrive here. Providing \n     affordable and accessible health care that clearly reflects \n     these fundamental principles is a public good, moral \n     imperative and urgent national priority.\n       Sadly, the legislative proposal recently unveiled in the \n     Senate does not meet these moral criteria. Specifically, it \n     violates the longstanding federal policy against the use of \n     federal funds for elective abortions and health plans that \n     include such abortions--a policy upheld in all health \n     programs covered by the Hyde Amendment, the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program, the Federal Employee Health Benefits \n     Program--and now in the House-passed ``Affordable Health Care \n     for America Act.'' We believe legislation that violates this \n     moral principle is not true health care reform and must be \n     amended to reflect it. If that fails, the current legislation \n     should be opposed.\n\n\n                  Protecting Human Life and Conscience\n\n       Specifically, we urge you to include the House-passed \n     provision that keeps in place the longstanding and widely \n     supported federal policy against government funding of \n     elective abortions or plans that include elective abortions.\n       In the aftermath of the overwhelming and bipartisan House \n     vote for the Stupak-Smith-Ellsworth-Kaptur-Dahlkemper-Pitts \n     Amendment, there has been much misunderstanding of what it \n     does and does not do. This amendment does not change the \n     current situation in our country: Abortion is legal and \n     available, but no federal dollars can be used to pay for \n     elective abortions or plans that include elective abortions. \n     This provision simply keeps in place existing policy and \n     allows Congress to honor the President's commitment that ``no \n     federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.'' The \n     amendment does not restrict abortion, or prevent people from \n     buying insurance covering abortion with their own funds. It \n     simply ensures that where federal funds are involved, people \n     are not required to pay for other people's abortions.\n       Thus far, the pending Senate bill does not live up to \n     President Obama's commitment of barring the use of federal \n     dollars for abortion and maintaining current conscience laws. \n     The bill provides federal funding for plans that cover \n     abortion, and creates an unprecedented mandatory ``abortion \n     surcharge'' in such plans that will require pro-life \n     purchasers to pay directly and explicitly for other people's \n     abortions. Its version of a public health plan (the \n     ``community health insurance plan'') allows the Secretary of \n     HHS to mandate coverage of unlimited abortions nationwide, \n     and also allows each state to mandate such abortion coverage \n     for all state residents taking part in this federal program \n     even if the Secretary does not do so. The bill seriously \n     weakens the current nondiscrimination policy protecting \n     providers who decline involvement in abortion, providing \n     stronger protection for facilities that perform and promote \n     abortion than for those which do not. The legislation \n     requires each region of the insurance exchange to include at \n     least one health plan with unlimited abortion, contrary to \n     the policy of all other federal health programs. Finally, \n     critically important conscience protections on issues beyond \n     abortion have yet to be included in the bill. To take just \n     one example, the bill fails to ensure that even religious \n     institutions would retain the freedom to offer their own \n     employees health insurance coverage that conforms to the \n     institution's teaching. On these various issues the new \n     Senate bill is an enormous disappointment, creating new and \n     completely unacceptable federal policy that endangers human \n     life and rights of conscience.\n\n\n                  Immigrants and Health Care Coverage\n\n       We support the inclusion of all immigrants, regardless of \n     status, in the insurance exchange. The Senate legislation \n     forbids undocumented immigrants from purchasing health-care \n     coverage in the exchange. Undocumented immigrants should not \n     be\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\n     barred from purchasing a health insurance plan with their own \n     money. Without such access, many immigrant families would be \n     unable to receive primary care and be compelled to rely on \n     emergency room care. This would harm not only immigrants and \n     their families, but also the general public health. Moreover, \n     the financial burden on the American public would be higher, \n     as Americans would pay for uncompensated medical care through \n     the federal budget or higher insurance rates.\n       We also support the removal of the five-year ban on legal \n     immigrants accessing federal health benefit programs, such as \n     Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and \n     Medicare. Legal immigrants, who work and pay taxes, should \n     have access to such programs if needed. Removing the ban \n     would help ensure that legal immigrants, who were widely \n     praised in past immigration debates for their many \n     contributions and for playing by the rules, will still have \n     access to health care.\n\n\n                 Accessible and Affordable Health Care\n\n       The Catholic bishops have advocated for decades for \n     affordable and accessible health care for all, especially the \n     poor and marginalized. The Senate bill makes great progress \n     in covering people in our nation. However, the Senate bill \n     would still leave over 24 million people in our nation \n     without health insurance. This is not acceptable.\n       The bishops support the expansion of Medicaid eligibility \n     for people living at 133 percent or lower of the federal \n     poverty level. The bill does not burden states with excessive \n     Medicaid matching rates. The affordability credits will help \n     lower-income families purchase insurance coverage through the \n     Health Insurance Exchange. However, the Senate bill would \n     still leave low-income families earning between 133 and 250 \n     percent of the federal poverty level financially vulnerable \n     to health care costs. Overall, the average subsidy provided \n     for in the Senate bill is $1,300 less than the average \n     subsidy in the House bill. Improvements to the bill should be \n     made so that low-income families have reasonable out of \n     pocket expense for health care.\n       Immediate reforms are included in the bill that should be \n     helpful in providing relief to the uninsured and \n     underinsured. Additionally, reforms that will strengthen \n     families and protect low-income and vulnerable people such as \n     eliminating denial of coverage based on pre-existing \n     conditions including pregnancy; eliminating life time caps; \n     offering long-term disability services; and extending \n     dependent coverage to uninsured young adults--are significant \n     steps toward genuine health care reform. We urge the Senate \n     to maintain these provisions.\n       These moral criteria and policy objectives are not marginal \n     issues or special interest concerns. They are the questions \n     at the heart of the health care debate: Whose lives and \n     health are to be protected and whose are not? Will the \n     federal government, for the first time in decades, require \n     people to pay for other peoples' abortions? Will immigrants \n     be worse off as a result of health care reform? At their \n     core, these health care choices are not just political, \n     technical, or economic, but also moral decisions. This \n     legislation is about life and death, who can take their \n     children to the doctor and who cannot, who can afford decent \n     health care coverage and who are left to fend for themselves.\n       Our appeal for health care legislation that truly protects \n     the life, dignity, health and consciences of all reflects the \n     unique perspectives and experience of the Catholic community. \n     Our hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities provide \n     quality health care to millions. Our dioceses, institutions, \n     and ministries purchase health care for many thousands of \n     employees and their families. Our emergency rooms, shelters, \n     clinics, and charities pick up the pieces of a failing health \n     care system. Our Catholic moral tradition teaches that health \n     care is a basic human right, essential to protecting human \n     life and dignity.\n       For many months, our Bishops' conference has been working \n     with members of Congress, the Administration and others to \n     fashion health care reform legislation that truly protects \n     the life, dignity, health and consciences of all. Our message \n     has been clear and consistent throughout. We hope and pray \n     that the Congress and the country will come together around \n     genuine reform.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bishop William F. Murphy,\n       Diocese of Rockville Centre, Chairman, Committee on \n     Domestic Justice and Human Development.\n     Cardinal Daniel DiNardo,\n       Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston Chairman, Committee on \n     Pro-life Activities.\n     Bishop John Wester,\n       Diocese of Salt Lake City, Chairman, Committee on \n     Migration.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nhour be equally divided between the following three Senators: Franken, \nLincoln, and Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  I commend Leader Reid, Chairman Harkin, Chairman Baucus, and Senator \nDodd for their leadership that has brought us to this critical point. \nWe are on the verge of passing legislation that will do more than any \nbill in recent history to make our country healthier, our economy more \nstable, and our working families more secure.\n  Make no mistake, this bill will change. There will be amendments to \nit that will make it an even better bill. There may be amendments that \nmake it less to my liking and, therefore, a less good bill, to my point \nof view. But the final bill will make health care available to more \ntens of millions of Americans. It will make health insurance more \nsecure for all Americans who have it and will put an end to the \nunsustainable trajectory that we are now on with the cost of health \ncare, and will avert an otherwise inevitable catastrophe to our health \ncare system and our economy.\n  The reality right now is that we are denying millions of Americans \ntheir shot at the American dream because of our irrational health \ninsurance system.\n  Right now, if you have been sick, insurance companies can refuse to \ncover you or charge you ridiculous premiums. If you get sick, your \ninsurance benefits can run out when you need them the most.\n  Right now, people without insurance do not get preventive care. \nInstead, they go to the emergency room when they cannot hold out any \nlonger. This is the least-efficient and most expensive way to deliver \ncare, and those of us who do have insurance pay for it. It costs every \ninsured family more than $1,100 a year in additional premiums to pay \nfor those who don't have health insurance.\n  Right now, if you are a woman who has had a C-section or if you have \nbeen a survivor of domestic violence, health insurance companies can \narbitrarily decide not to cover you. That is because having had a C-\nsection or being a survivor of domestic violence is considered by many \ninsurance companies to be a preexisting condition. That is wrong.\n  What is even more egregious is that while millions of Americans \nstruggle to pay for health care, insurance executives continue to make \nobscene salaries. From 2000 to 2007, a period of 8 years, Americans saw \ntheir premiums almost double. During that same time, we saw more than 6 \nmillion more Americans become uninsured. During that same time, \ninsurance company profits rose 428 percent--428 percent. That is all \nyou need to know to understand why we have to pass this bill--428 \npercent in 8 years. No wonder the insurance companies are fighting this \nbill. Of course they don't want to be subject to antitrust laws. They \nare making outrageous profits by gouging American families. Make no \nmistake, that is what this is about.\n  This bill will change all that. It will fundamentally transform how \nhealth insurance works in this country. This bill guarantees secure \ncoverage that will be there for Americans and stay there when they need \nit the most. This is not going to help just individual Americans; it is \ngoing to help small businesses too.\n  There are urgently needed changes that will go into effect the day \nthe President signs this bill into law. Effective immediately, \npreventive services, such as colonoscopies and cholesterol tests, will \nbe covered by all insurance plans at no cost. This will make prevention \na priority, not an afterthought. We will detect cancers earlier and \nstop chronic diseases, such as diabetes, in their tracks. Not only will \nthis save innumerable lives, it will lower the long-term cost of health \ncare for all of us. This is one of the key\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nways health care reform transforms our system of sick care into a true \nhealth care system.\n  Effective immediately, any new health insurance plan will let your \nchildren remain on the family policy until they are 26. That is big. \nSay you are a parent whose kid has been ill in the past, maybe she had \nasthma and she just graduated, say, from the University of Minnesota. \nYour daughter is just out of school, and she wants to find a job. We \nall know this is a big enough challenge in this economy. While she \nplans for her future, the last thing she should have to worry about is \nhow she is going to get health insurance.\n  The good news is, after health care reform, she will have secure \ncoverage until she gets on her feet. She can either stay on your plan \nuntil she is 26 or once the exchange is up and running, she can \npurchase an affordable plan through the exchange.\n  Also, effective immediately, we will hold health insurance companies \naccountable by making them give rebates if they spend more than 20 \npercent of premiums toward profits, marketing, or administration. I am \nproud to have championed this safeguard with my colleagues, Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Whitehouse.\n  The current reality is, most of us do not know where our health \ninsurance premiums go. It is challenging enough to understand a billing \nstatement from your health insurer, much less track where your money is \nbeing spent. We are going to change that.\n  Thanks to Senator Jack Reed, the Senate bill also requires \ntransparent reporting of how health insurance companies are spending \nyour money. This transparency is especially important as we cover an \nadditional 3l million Americans under this bill. We know from their \nprofit margins that right now insurance companies are price gouging. \nBut clear reporting will help us hold them accountable for every dollar \nwe invest in health insurance.\n  Based on our experience in Minnesota, I know we can do even more to \nrein in marketing, wasteful administrative costs, and profits in health \ninsurance. In the coming weeks, we will debate this bill, amend it, and \nmake it even better. I will be pushing to require an even higher \npercentage of your premiums go toward actual health care.\n  The reason I believe we can provide higher quality care without \nexcessive profits is because Minnesota already does it. We are \ndistinguished by the fact that 90 percent of Minnesotans are served by \na nonprofit health plan. These plans outperform their national peers \nand are able to put an average of 91 cents of every premium dollar \ntoward actual health care services--91 cents out of every dollar.\n  In other plans throughout the Nation, you may find less than 60 \npercent of your premium is put toward health care. The rest is for \noverhead, marketing, and profits. By taking the profits out of the \nhealth insurance industry--not taking them out but lowering them to a \nreasonable level--Minnesota health plans do a better job of helping our \nresidents live healthier, longer lives. As we begin debating this bill \non the Senate floor, it is essential that health insurance companies \nget the message loudly and clearly that their top priority must be \nserving patients, not creating more and more profits, not a 428-percent \nincrease in profits in 8 years.\n  Under the Senate bill, we will stop insurance companies from denying \nyou coverage or charging you more because of preexisting conditions. \nThis will end the egregious industry practice of discriminating against \nsurvivors of domestic violence. Insurance companies also will no longer \nbe able to charge women more for their health coverage just because \nthey happen to be a woman.\n  We will ban lifetime caps and end unreasonable annual limits on your \nbenefits. These insurance market reforms will help Americans, but they \nwill be particularly life changing for families such as the Battersons \nwho live in Bloomington, MN. Linda Batterson has three daughters. She \nowns her own business, and her husband Bud is a realtor.\n  The Battersons have some relatively minor health problems--asthma, \nallergies, and back problems. But because health insurance companies \ncan charge them more based on their health history, their only health \ncare option in Minnesota is a high-risk pool. This year they are paying \nnearly $21,000 for health care--$21,000 for their insurance. This is \nnot a Cadillac plan. Neither the Battersons' businesses nor their \nfamily can sustain these costs.\n  But the good news is, the Battersons will get relief under our bill. \nThey will be able to go to the exchange and find an affordable plan. \nHealth insurance companies will not be able to charge the family more \nbecause of their health history. If companies are going to raise rates, \nthey will have to publicly disclose and justify any increase.\n  I think we can all agree that one group of Americans who suffer under \nour current system is small businesses. Across Minnesota--from Bemidji \nto Spring Valley--I have talked to small business owners who want to do \nthe right thing. They want their workers to be healthy, but they cannot \nafford the current unpredictable and skyrocketing rates.\n  In Minnesota, we have 92 percent of our State covered, and we have \ninvested resources to create the MinnesotaCare Program to make sure \nlow-income residents are covered. But even with all this success, the \nuncontrolled cost of health insurance is forcing us to tighten our \nbelts and make sacrifices that no American should have to make, such as \nsmall businesses having to choose between laying off workers or \ndropping health insurance for everyone.\n  I am pleased to tell you this bill will bring real relief to small \nbusinesses across our country. We will even the playing field so small \nbusinesses can do the right thing for workers without sacrificing their \nbottom line. This will make them competitive with large employers and \nwith companies from overseas so they can attract the best and brightest \nworkers.\n  Right now, small businesses are often priced out of the markets. They \nmay be lucky to find just one or two carriers willing to cover their \nworkers. So the first important change that health care reform can \nbring is choice of plans for small businesses. They will be able to \nparticipate in the exchange which will offer them a choice of reliable \nplans. This coverage will be less expensive and provide better coverage \nthan what is available today.\n  Right now, if you are a business with, say, 15 employees and 1 of \nthem gets sick or has a baby, your premiums are going to go up \ndramatically. That is because your risk pool is 15. But when you choose \nfrom policies on the exchange, your risk can be pooled with hundreds or \neven thousands of other businesses. That is the whole point of \ninsurance, to spread the risk over the greatest number of people.\n  The second key benefit for small businesses is tax credits to help \nbusiness owners purchase coverage. Effective immediately, these credits \nwill ease the burden on small business owners who offer coverage but \nare being squeezed in the current market. For business owners who have \nnot been able to offer insurance, the tax credits will provide a new \nincentive to begin covering their workers, keeping the workforce \nhealthy and productive.\n  Today I have touched on just a few elements of the health care reform \nbill. I will be back. I have touched on insurance market reforms and \nprovisions tailored to the needs of small businesses. But this just \nscratches the surface. The public option will bring much needed \ncompetition, and the incentives for high-quality care will make us all \nhealthier. Taken together, these elements will bring our country into a \nnew era in which high-quality and affordable health care is a reality \nin this country.\n  Passing national health care reform this year is my top priority \nbecause I have listened to Minnesotans across my State. They have told \nme loudly and clearly that the current health insurance system is not \nworking for them, and they have told me they want access to care. I \nhave heard them.\n  They want to know they can start a small business without worrying \nabout the cost of health insurance because one of their kids has a \npreexisting condition. They want to know they will have health care \nwhen they need it the most. They want insurance companies to prioritize \nhealth services over profits. They are looking for us to fulfill our \npromise to pass comprehensive health care reform this year.\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\n  I look forward to working with all of you to make this a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I have asked for this time today not \nonly to address my colleagues in this body but to speak directly to my \nconstituents at home in Arkansas. After many months of debate on health \ncare, we are nearing yet another important step in a very deliberative \nprocess. Today we are voting on whether to continue to discuss how to \nimprove health care in America or to stop the debate.\n  I personally have carried the mantle to improve health care for \nArkansas throughout my public service, like many of my colleagues and \nso many others as well who have worked hard on this issue. Over the \nlast several decades the advance of medical technology and our Nation's \nchanging demographics have placed new demands on our health care system \nthat it is not designed to meet.\n  Our vote later this evening is not the first step toward making the \nnecessary adjustments in health care, nor will it be the last, without \na doubt. The Finance Committee on which I serve and which is led so \nably by my good friend from Montana, Chairman Baucus, has produced what \nI still describe as the most responsible approach to health insurance \nreform. We deliberated for more than 22 months, incorporating \nrecommendations from experts all across our great Nation and proved, \nthrough our bill, that America can achieve unprecedented health \ninsurance reforms that expand coverage, reduce cost, and provide \nstability for those with existing coverage.\n  We accomplished these goals without posing long-term risk for \ntaxpayers. It was not a perfect bill. We never see perfect bills around \nhere, quite frankly, but I can honestly say I will fight hard so our \nfinal product will more closely resemble the commonsense, deficit-\nreducing plan we produced in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  At times like this I think it is very important for each of us to \nremember the very reasons we began this debate. Small businesses and \nworking families are reaching the breaking point financially because of \nthe relentless rise in health care costs. Nationally, our economic \nrecovery will only be slowed by the inflationary cost of health care. \nTaxpayers and the insured are already bearing the cost of medical \ntreatment for the uninsured at the most expensive point of delivery, in \nour emergency rooms. Health care in America today is a model that waits \nuntil people get sick rather than focusing on the wellness, prevention, \nand good management of illness that keeps people out of the hospital \nand from having the most costly care needs.\n  Our current health care system wastes money and is so inefficient \nthat the United States spends more than twice as much per person while \ninsuring a smaller portion of our population than the average spending \nin 29 other industrialized nations. There simply are not enough health \ninsurance options available to most Americans today when in at least 17 \nStates, including my home State of Arkansas, only one insurance company \ncontrols more than half the insurance market, and in at least 22 States \nstill only two carriers control half or more of the market.\n  Patients and doctors are routinely making treatment decisions with \nlittle or no objective information about which treatments are more \neffective. American capitalism is based on choice and competition \nbecause when these elements are present, consumers can most always find \nthe best value for their money. That is not true in health care. So by \ncreating health insurance exchanges through which small businesses and \nindividuals can choose from a menu of private plans, we can enhance \ncost transparency, create head-to-head competition, and allow market \nforces to reduce prices.\n  These are facts. These are facts, and whether we are Republicans or \nDemocrats or independent, I believe we can agree on most all of them. I \nknow the great majority of Arkansans believe these facts and want to \nsee us accomplish these reasonable goals.\n  For months now, groups from outside my State have assigned various \nmotives to my deliberations on health care and tried to define the \nmeaning of my vote. According to the last tally, there has been more \nthan $3.3 million worth of media ads that have been purchased in my \nhome State of Arkansas by groups from outside of our State--certainly \nnone by me--and most with my name in the ad. Still, I have continued to \napproach this issue as I always do. These outside groups seem to think \nthis is all about my reelection. I simply don't think they know me very \nwell.\n  I am focused on my opportunity to influence the final version of \nhealth care legislation in a way that most helps my State. That is why \nthe people of Arkansas sent me here. They sent me here because they \nknow I am going to work hard to do the best job possible and to do the \nright thing; to stand my ground on my principles.\n  I have avoided the extremist claims from the left and from the right \nand tried to pull the commonsense solutions from among all the policy \noptions so that we get health care reform that benefits Arkansans and \nall Americans. That is our job in this body, to represent our States in \nthis unbelievably historic body, the Senate.\n  The truth is, this issue is very complex. There is no easy fix, and \nit is imperative that we build on what is already working for health \ncare in America and not turn away from the problems we face. We keep \nbuilding until we can truly say one day that all American citizens will \nhave access to quality and affordable health care. In order to improve \nupon and build upon what we already have, I do not support the creation \nof a so-called robust, government-administered public plan.\n  I believe we should work to make sure we do not expose American \ntaxpayers and the Treasury to long-term risks that could occur over \nfuture government bailouts of a public plan. Rather than create an \nentirely new government-run health plan to compete with private \ninsurers, I support health insurance reform that focuses on changing \nthe rules of our existing employer-based private health insurance \nsystem. I believe we should change the current rules that permit \ninsurance companies to bully their customers and cherry-pick healthy \npatients, so we can force them to compete with each other.\n  My first loyalties are with the people of Arkansas--not insurance \ncompanies, the health care industry, or my political party. In fact, I \nauthored an amendment during consideration of legislation in the Senate \nFinance Committee which limits taxpayers' subsidies for health \ninsurance companies that pay their top executives millions in salaries. \nResponsible health insurance reform should ensure that insurance \nexecutives are not receiving a personal windfall, and that companies \nthey work for are not receiving excessive tax breaks while at the same \ntime profiting from government requirements on consumers to buy \ninsurance.\n  The reason we are having this vote is because our Republican \ncolleagues object to beginning debate and consideration of amendments \non health care legislation. Although I do not agree with everything in \nthis bill, I have concluded that I believe it is more important that we \nbegin this debate to improve our Nation's health care system for all \nAmericans rather than simply dropping the issue and walk away. That is \nnot what people sent us here to do.\n  Attempts by the National Republican Party and other conservative \ngroups to portray this as a vote for or against this particular health \ncare reform bill are untrue and deliberately misleading. The vote \ntonight will mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the \nfull Senate, not the end. Republicans have sought to revive their \npolitical party by opposing any real solution to our Nation's health \ncare crisis. In fact, this vote for or against a procedure that allows \nus to begin debate on health care reform is nothing more and nothing \nless. Put simply, those who vote yes on this vote believe our Nation's \nhealth care system needs reforming, and they are ready to have an \nhonest and open debate in the Senate about how to best achieve that \nreform.\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\nI am not afraid of that debate, nor am I afraid of coming before this \nbody to say what I believe is the most important thing we can do to \nreform health care. I hope none of us are. Our country needs us too \ndesperately now to be making good decisions and moving forward.\n  I will not allow my decision on this vote to be dictated by pressure \nfrom my political opponents, nor the liberal interest groups from \noutside Arkansas that threaten me with their money and their political \nopposition; the multitudes of e-mails and ads we have received, \nunbelievable types of threats about what they are going to do and how \nthey are going to behave. The fact is, I am serious about changing our \nhealth care system, as most Arkansans and most Americans are. I am not \nwith those who seek to avoid the debate, nor with those who use \npolitical attacks to achieve their narrow goals. I will vote in support \nof cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill.\n  But let me be perfectly clear. I am opposed to a new government-\nadministered health care plan as a part of comprehensive health \ninsurance reform, and I will not vote in favor of the proposal that has \nbeen introduced by Leader Reid as written. I, along with others, expect \nto have legitimate opportunities to influence the health care reform \nlegislation that is voted on by the Senate later this year or early \nnext year. I am also aware there will be additional procedural votes to \nmove this process forward that will require 60 votes prior to \nconclusion of the floor debate. I have already alerted the leader and \nmy colleagues that I am prepared to vote against moving to the next \nstage of consideration as long as a government-run public option is \nincluded. The public option, as a part of health insurance reform, has \nattracted far more attention than it deserves. While cost projections \nshow that it may reduce costs somewhat, those projections don't take \ninto account who pays if it fails to live up to expectations. If, in \nfact, premiums don't cover the cost of the public plan, it is taxpayers \nin this country who are faced with the burden of bailing it out.\n  Our colleagues cannot ignore the growth in the Federal Government \nsince the year 2000. I can assure you that the American people have not \nignored it. According to the American Institute for Economic Research, \ngovernment spending grew by 55 percent under President Bush. As he was \nleaving office, government launched a massive bailout of Wall Street. \nThen it was the domestic auto manufacturing industry that needed \ntaxpayer funds to survive. And finally, in order to revive a dying \neconomy, it took a government economic recovery package to save or \ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs. We can argue about the necessity \nof these unprecedented steps, but we need not argue about the \nimpression they have made on the American people. We should be stopping \nthe growth of government, not expanding it more. Without the public \noption, we could still force private insurance plans that participate \nin the exchanges to provide standard benefit packages that are easy to \ncompare and more fairly priced. We will be bringing millions of new \ncustomers to the exchanges so insurers should be motivated to lower \nprices and be competitive.\n  I have pledged to dialog with Leader Reid regarding my concerns that \nremain about this bill. I look forward to continuing that dialog on \nimprovements that I believe are necessary in order to meet the \nchallenge. I will be asking my colleagues to consider these additional \nimportant changes I believe will improve our chances for real health \ninsurance reform and that can also enjoy the support of most Arkansans \nand most Americans.\n  Some of these include that the legislation remain deficit neutral, \nnow and in the future, and curbs future cost, that it protects Medicare \nbeneficiaries for seniors and extends solvency of the Medicare Program, \nthat it improves accessibility and affordability of health insurance \nfor employees and owners of small businesses and the self-employed \nthrough access to health insurance exchanges and tax credits, that it \nenhance choice and competition of health insurance plans for small \nbusinesses and individuals without the inclusion of a government-run \npublic option, and that it build our Nation's health care workforce and \nensure continued access to quality health care providers, especially in \nrural America.\n  Today I know I will ultimately be held accountable by my constituents \nin Arkansas for all of my votes on health care, not the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee, not by other groups from outside my \nState that continue to engage in a conversation they have begun. I know \nmy decision to support the upcoming cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed is not my last nor only chance to have an impact on health care \nreform.\n  I am optimistic and encouraged about the step we are preparing to \ntake in the Senate, to amend and craft a bill that will improve access \nto quality, affordable coverage options for the residents and \nbusinesses of my State who desperately need relief, a bill that \nimproves the quality and efficiency with which we deliver health care, \nall without adding to our Nation's deficit and while lowering the cost \nof health care over the long term. I am committed to using every power \nof my office to achieve success on this issue by enacting meaningful \nreforms that will benefit the people of Arkansas and our Nation.\n  I have spent the last several months in a passionate dialog with my \nconstituents about health care reform. It was not only in townhall \nmeetings where I heard from Arkansans. I had hundreds of conversations \nwith many of them in groups and one-on-one conversations. They may not \nbe in agreement about solutions, but I can assure my colleagues that \neach Arkansan I speak to expects us to roll up our sleeves and get this \nright. We can. Following the vote tonight, the bill that will be laid \nbefore us will not be the only possible solution. I know my decision to \nsupport cloture on the motion to proceed is not my last or only chance \nto have an impact on overall health care reform. My strongest hope is \nthat each of us can lay political fortunes aside and make the tough, \ncommonsense choices our constituents expect of us, whether you are a \nDemocrat or Republican, and look at what we face and the challenges of \nour Nation. Make sure that as we are working toward an end result, that \neach of us is working as hard as we can to come up with a pragmatic \nsolution that our constituents expect of us. We may not get this \nopportunity again in our lifetime.\n  Today I am thinking about the Arkansas working family who can't pay \ntheir mortgage because of their sick child's medical bills. I am \nthinking of the Arkansas small business owner who told me that more \nthan 20 percent of the cost of running his business now goes to health \ninsurance for him and his workers. I am thinking about the 450,000 \nArkansans who have no health insurance. I am not thinking about my \nreelection, the legacy of a President, or whether Democrats or \nRepublicans are going to claim victory in winning the debate. I hope \nall of my colleagues join me in looking forward to working with the \nleader and all of our colleagues in the days and weeks ahead as we \nstrive to solve a problem whose solution is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, in a few hours we will take an important \nstep on the road to health care reform. Our vote will come after months \nof analysis and debate and years of growing concern on the part of our \nconstituents that the American health care system is in need of \nfundamental reform. Two Senate committees have approved reform \nlegislation. We will vote later today on whether to open debate on a \nthird one which merges the two produced by the Senate Finance and HELP \nCommittees. Much time and attention has been focused on the provisions \nin this legislation which will expand the number of Americans who are \ncovered by health insurance, a goal I wholeheartedly share. But a \ncompelling reason for reform and a major reason to vote in favor of \nallowing the Senate to debate health care reform is the serious and \nworsening signs that for those Americans who have health insurance, our \nhealth care system is no longer working as it should.\n  Increasingly, Americans with health insurance are at catastrophic \nfinancial risk, if they get sick. Increasingly, working families with \ninsurance are unable to afford the escalating premiums they face to \nmaintain their\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\noften inadequate coverage. Increasingly, businesses large and small \nthat offer health insurance to their employees are buckling under the \ncrushing weight of spiraling costs for their employees. Increasingly, \nfamilies find that caps on their coverage leave them exposed to \ndevastating medical bills. And increasingly, arbitrary insurance \ncompany practices that boost their own profits are shortchanging \nAmericans, denying coverage because of preexisting conditions, and \nsearching for ways to deny patients the treatments they need and have \npaid for through their premiums.\n  Democrats are not alone in pointing out these problems. The \nRepublican leader himself has said:\n\n       Every Republican in Congress supports reform.\n\n  That is the Republican leader who said that every Republican in \nCongress supports reform. He did not say many Republicans. He did not \nsay most Republicans. Every single Republican in both Chambers of \nCongress, the Republican leader tells us, wants to reform the health \ncare system.\n  How will any reform happen, reform proposed by Democrats or by \nRepublicans or by anybody? Only when this body can bring a bill to the \nfloor of the Senate for debate and amendment, only when we work with \nour colleagues in the other Chamber to resolve differences between \nlegislation approved by the Senate and that approved by the House, only \nwhen Congress sends the President a bill he is prepared to sign into \nlaw. Speeches will not reform health care. Polls and cable television \nshout fests, none of that will reform health care. We, the Members of \nthe U.S. Congress, and we alone, can reform health care.\n  We must listen to constituents, advocacy groups, physicians, \ninsurers, health care experts, economists and anyone else with \nconstructive ideas. Ultimately, it is we who must act. To do that, we \nmust begin to debate here on the floor of the Senate the many complex \nissues that must be resolved. That is all today's vote will do, give \nthe Members of the Senate the chance to come together in a sincere \neffort to work together, resolve our differences, and address an issue \non which there is, we are told, even by the Republican leader, general \nagreement on the need for reform.\n  Two Senate committees have already spent months seeking the proper \nways to reform the health care system. The Senate Finance Committee has \nheld over 50 meetings on health care reform legislation in the last \nyear. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee spent 13 days \nmarking up its legislation. So we have made progress. We are at least \nin position to do what this body was designed to do and is supposed to \ndo: deliberate and decide.\n\n  The minority opposes the legislation we are trying to bring to the \nfloor for debate and amendment. They say they do not like the bill. But \nwhy deny the Senate the opportunity to debate the subject of health \ncare reform? Why prevent us from considering it? Why not offer \namendments to the bill if you do not like it or offer a substitute \nmeasure for it?\n  There are parts of the bill in which I would like to see changes. I \nwould like to make health insurance even more affordable for working \nfamilies, and I am willing to require that those earning more than \n$250,000 a year, for instance, pay a higher and, in my view, more fair \nand more appropriate tax rate to make that greater affordability for \nworking families possible.\n  Income data shows that in recent years only the wealthiest 10 percent \nof Americans have seen any real increases in income and that those \nincreases are concentrated in the wealthiest 1 percent of the country, \nwhile the vast majority of Americans have lost ground. At the same \ntime, most Americans are coping with falling income, they have been hit \nwith massive increases in health insurance premiums. So I am willing to \nsupport an increase in upper income tax brackets to end that \nunfairness.\n  Other sources of revenue, such as ending the abuse of offshore tax \nhavens, can and should go toward doing other things we should be doing \nin this bill. For instance, I am concerned that the annual fee on \ninsurance providers contained in the merged bill would treat nonprofit \nand for-profit insurers the same way. Millions of Michigan residents \nreceive their insurance from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, a \nnonprofit company, which is the insurer of last resort in our State, \nproviding coverage to residents who cannot find it elsewhere. We need \nto find ways to reform the insurance market without negatively \nimpacting the not-for-profit insurance companies that are the insurers \nof last resort and that provide high levels of coverage in return for \nthe premiums they collect.\n  On these and other issues, I will continue to study the details of \nthe legislation, discuss them with colleagues and constituents, and I \nwill support improvements where needed. What I will not do is vote to \nblock efforts to reform a system that simply is not working well for \nthose who have health insurance, as well as for those who do not.\n  The need for reform is generally acknowledged. How can we then not \nopen debate? How can we not discuss, offer amendments, consider \nalternatives, make changes, and vote on reform legislation? That is the \nonly path to health care reform. There is no other way. And for those \nwho proclaim their belief in the need for reform to stand in the way of \nthat debate is, at best, starkly inconsistent.\n  A vote against even opening debate is a vote in favor of the status \nquo, which my constituents and the vast majority of Americans can no \nlonger afford. They can no longer afford it because it is bankrupting \nthem, in many cases literally bankrupting them. A study this year, \npublished in the American Journal of Medicine, found that in 2002, 62 \npercent of all individual bankruptcies in the United States involved \nmedical costs.\n  That is a tragedy. You should not be forced into bankruptcy because \nyou get sick. But it gets worse. Three-quarters of those bankruptcies \ninvolved people who had health insurance when they got sick. Let me \nrepeat that. In the United States, almost two-thirds of all \nbankruptcies are linked to medical costs, and three-quarters of those \nbankruptcies occurred even though the debtor had health insurance. That \nis adding absurdity to tragedy and demonstrates the inadequacy of \nhealth insurance for those who are covered.\n  We must act to reform a health care system so broken that it crushes \nAmericans under a mountain of debt. One of my constituents, a Kalamazoo \nman, had what he thought was adequate health care coverage when 3 years \nago he needed surgery to replace two sections of his aorta. But his \ncoverage left him an out-of-pocket cost of nearly $40,000. That is the \nsum that stood between this man and lifesaving surgery. Financially \ndevastated by the costs, he declared personal bankruptcy. He wrote to \nme:\n\n       No one should die because they cannot afford health care, \n     and no one should go broke because they get sick.\n\n  He is right.\n  We must act to reform a health care system so broken that it leaves \nthe mother of a young Michigan State University student worried that \nher daughter will not get the care she needs. This 24-year-old student \nhas insurance. Yet when she began to have unexplained seizures, her \ncoverage would not pay for all the tests needed to determine their \ncause. Even after declining some prescribed tests because she could not \nafford them, the young woman's doctors eventually discovered the cause \nof her seizures: a brain tumor. This mother worries that her daughter \nwill lose her insurance, will be forced to declare bankruptcy, and that \nthe family will have to find some other way to cover the massive \nexpense of her lifesaving care--all while coping with the other \nfinancial strains hitting her family and so many others. The mother \nwrites:\n\n       We will lose too many bright young people if something is \n     not done.\n\n  She is right.\n  We must reform a health care system so broken that it sent a minister \nfrom Jackson, MI, on a weeks-long odyssey to keep her insurance because \nshe became pregnant--a joyous event for most families but apparently \njust another preexisting condition to insurance companies. When this \nexpectant mother moved from a church in Massachusetts to one in \nsouthern Michigan, her new church immediately sought, for their new \nminister, to find her health insurance. But company after\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\ncompany declined to cover her because of her pregnancy. She and her \nchurch spent weeks researching the issue, changing insurance agents, \nproviding document after document, pleading with insurance companies. \nShe wrote me:\n\n       I had two volunteers, myself, and two insurance agents \n     working on the situation constantly for over a month.\n\n  And she said:\n\n       If you have the time and energy, and some good help, and \n     are willing to spend a month hassling with the system pretty \n     much continuously . . . then you can sometimes, with a great \n     deal of luck, work the system.\n\n  Reflecting on her experience, this minister writes:\n\n       It is clear to me that we are desperately in need of health \n     care reform.\n\n  She is right.\n  The legislation the majority leader has brought forward will do much \nto ease the hardship on millions of Americans. It has benefits for \nthose who already have insurance through their employer, with steps to \nrein in skyrocketing premiums and to reduce the risk of financial ruin \nfor those who have health insurance.\n  In addition to helping those with private insurance, this legislation \nprovides important benefits for seniors covered by Medicare. Medicare \nbeneficiaries will receive free preventive care benefits, and the bill \nwill reduce the enormous costs many seniors face when they fall into \nthat doughnut hole, so-called, in the Medicare Part D prescription drug \nprogram. Because of these important improvements in care for seniors, \nAARP has recommended that Senators vote in favor of beginning debate on \nthis bill tonight.\n  The legislation also contains important provisions to improve \ninformation technology in the health care sector, pushing for uniform \nbilling practices and developing standards that will lead to the \ncomputer systems of health care providers being able to talk to the \ncomputer systems of insurance companies, reducing mountains of \npaperwork and other inefficiencies that drive up health insurance \npremiums.\n  Americans who move from one employer to another will no longer face \nthe risk of being denied coverage at their new job because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  We must allow debate to begin. If we act, millions of those who \nalready have insurance at work will benefit. If we act, millions \nwithout insurance will get it, along with help to pay for it, so we can \nend the current wasteful situation in which emergency room care--vastly \nmore expensive than primary care through a family doctor--is used for \nnonemergency purposes by those without health insurance.\n\n  We can only accomplish these things if we vote today to begin debate \non this legislation. We can only accomplish these things if we are \nwilling to honestly and vigorously debate the best ways to achieve it. \nSo I urge our colleagues not to close the doors of this Chamber to \ndebate on one of the most urgent problems Americans face. I ask our \ncolleagues to allow the Senate to begin deliberations on health care \nreform and not to turn away from the opportunity and the responsibility \nbefore us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I know the time is slightly before the \nhour. I do not know if there are any Democrats who want to speak beyond \nthe Senator from Michigan during this hour. With that, I think we are \nanxious to get going.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Republican speakers \nbe permitted to enter into a colloquy during the time controlled by the \nminority, which I understand ends at 4 o'clock today. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, just to make sure people who may be \nwatching the Senate floor understand what is happening, Republican \nSenators took all day yesterday and today to read the bill and to \nactually go through sections of the bill to discuss it and make sure \nall of us are very familiar with the various pieces of it.\n  I think all of us are united in concern about the way this bill is \npaid for. It is hard for me to believe that anybody could suggest that \ntaking $464 billion out of Medicare, which is insolvent, would be a way \nto fund a new entitlement; or that pushing down an unfunded mandate to \nStates, which we are going to talk about in just one moment, makes any \nsense at all--$25 billion worth; or increasing the Medicare tax, which \nwould not be a tax to make Medicare more solvent, but instead go to a \nnew entitlement program--we all know Medicare is going to be insolvent \nby the year 2017; and to have a bill that pays for itself over 10 years \nby having 6 years' worth of costs against 10 years worth of revenue; \nand then to have something such as the CLASS Act, which I know the \nchairman of the Budget Committee has called a Ponzi scheme, where, in \nessence, you create a program that takes in premiums over a 10-year \nperiod on a new entitlement for long-term care--another new \nentitlement, I might add, in addition to the one we are talking about \ntoday--it takes in those premiums but bars any money from going out for \n5 years. So what you have is, in essence, a collection system that \ncreates $72 billion. So I think all of us are very concerned about how \nthis is funded.\n  But today we want to talk about our tremendous concerns with the \nMedicaid expansion that is taking place. I am joined by a number of \nSenators who have had vast experience in State government and vast \nexperience in health care.\n  I think the American people have now realized this bill insures, per \nthe CBO, 31 million additional people. But the expansion that causes \nthat to occur is that 15 million people now will be on Medicaid who are \nnot on Medicaid. It is the largest expansion of Medicaid in U.S. \nhistory.\n  What we are doing to make sure this works budgetarily is we are \nforcing States to pick up the tab. I got an e-mail last night from my \nState--and I know other States are going to be talking about that, or \npeople from other States. But last night, the State sent me an e-mail \nand said this was going to cost our State almost $800 million.\n  Our State has been well governed for years. The senior Senator from \nTennessee was Governor in the middle-eighties. We have had both \nRepublicans and Democrats who have governed our State very well. In our \nState, we do not expect our revenues to be back to 2008 levels until \n2013. So you can imagine that our Governor, who is on the other side of \nthe aisle, is very concerned about us here in Washington saying he has \nto expand his Medicaid Program. We are going to expand it around the \ncountry by 15 million people, and he has to pay for it. He is more than \nupset about that particular issue.\n  I know people here in Washington--the Washington establishment--\ngenerally speaking, are upset about the fact that States actually \nbalance their budgets. We don't do that here, but in order to show \nalmost disrespect for the way our States, in most cases, have to \nbalance their budgets, what we are saying is we are going to make it \nmore difficult on them by making sure that in order to reach a goal, we \nforce our States, through an unfunded mandate, to cover an additional \n15 million people under their Medicaid programs.\n\n  Let me just mention that I thought we were actually going to do \nhealth care reform. I know there is probably a lot of laughter taking \nplace in the halls of this building today because I thought when we \ntalked about health care reform, that is what we were going to do.\n  We know Medicaid is one of the worst programs that ever existed as it \nrelates to health care. Let me just mention a couple stats. The Cancer \nJournal published that Medicaid recipients were two to three times more \nlikely to die from the disease than people who were not on Medicaid. \nThe American College of Cardiology in 2005 said Medicaid patients were \nalmost 50 percent more likely to die after coronary artery bypass \nsurgery than patients on Medicare or private pay. Forty percent of \nphysicians in our country don't even take Medicaid. In urban areas, 50 \npercent of specialists have blocked patients from entering their \nprogram.\n  So I wish to say just this and then I will stop because I want to \nhear from other colleagues who have been around here for awhile. But \nwhen I was back home during August, citizen after citizen said to me: I \nknow we are going to have health care reform. What I would like is just \nto have what you, Senator,\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\nhave. That is what I would like to have. I know Senator Burr worked on \na bill that would do that. It would create the ability for people to \nparticipate, as we do, in choice. I know Senator Alexander worked with \nSenator Wyden and others, and I worked with Senator Burr in the first \nCongress to create legislation that did that. As a matter of fact, \nSenator Wyden, from the other side of the aisle, created a bill that \ndid away with Medicaid. It gave Medicaid recipients the same kind of \nchoice that we in the Senate have. But it seems to me, Senator Reid's \nbill goes in exactly the opposite direction.\n  What it does, in order to add 31 million people to the rolls, 15 \nmillion people are being forced into Medicaid. So I would think, then, \nthat in order to make sure we are treated just like our citizens, one \nof the first votes we might take is that we agree, as Senators, to be \ntreated the way the majority of people in this program are being \ntreated, and I assume that going on Medicaid with those same results \nfor our families would be something we would embrace. I think all of us \nheard from citizens across this country that they want the same choices \nwe have. But in the name of reform, we are going in the opposite way \nand, again, locking them into nonchoices, nonphysicians, bad outcomes, \nand going in exactly the wrong way we should be going and, to boot, \nmaking States pay for it.\n  There is one class of people, though, who are not treated that way in \nthis bill. I have tremendous respect for those immigrants who have come \ninto our country in a legal way. Let me make sure people understand \nthat. Sometimes my southern drawl confuses people. I have tremendous \nrespect for people who have come into this country in a legal way. The \nReid bill does this. He respects them too. What the Reid bill says is, \nif you are born in America and you are from 100 to 133 percent of \npoverty, then you are barred from receiving a subsidy and are forced to \nbe on Medicaid, but if you come into this country as a legal immigrant, \nyou actually can receive a subsidy to purchase a private insurance \npolicy. I find that most interesting. I don't know if some of my other \ncolleagues--I know Senator Burr has spent a lot of time on this.\n  I find this reform very troubling. I know the Senator has worked hard \nto give Medicaid recipients the same choice as we have. I don't know \nhow you feel about the reform that is before us.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I think it is \nimportant, throughout this education of the American people of what is \nin 2,074 pages, to remind them that for every word in here, it costs \nthe American taxpayer $6.8 million; for every page, $1.2 billion.\n  I think one has to look a little further at this reform aspect. Does \nthis bill truly reform health care? I think as you read through the \nbill what you find are the words ``require,'' ``must,'' or ``shall'' \n4,677 times. You find the words ``tax,'' ``fee,'' or ``revenue'' 899 \ntimes. You find the word ``agency,'' ``department,'' ``bureau,'' \n``commission,'' or ``panel'' 470 times. But we are told this bill does \nreform health care. We are told it increases competition, it provides \nmore choice, it stimulates innovation. Yet we find the word ``choice'' \n40 times. We find the word ``innovation'' 25 times. We find the word \n``competition'' 13 times.\n  I suspect their intent is to fix what they haven't reformed by \nallowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in 1,677 spots, to \ndefine or determine what congressional intent was. Think about that. \nThis bill basically turns over a lot of the decisionmaking to the \ncurrent or future Secretaries of Health and Human Services to decide \nwhat we meant in the Congress.\n  Well, my good friend from Tennessee raised a lot of things on \nMedicaid, and I wish to talk about Medicaid, but I also wish to mention \nthat, once again, we are paying for this by cutting $464 billion from \nour Nation's seniors. That is a trust fund. They have paid in premiums. \nSimilar to the CLASS Act--it shouldn't be a surprise to us that they \nare going to steal money out of the CLASS Act that hasn't even been \ncreated yet because in the bill it is taking $464 billion from seniors \nwho have paid into it for a lifetime, and within that group of seniors, \n11 million seniors are going to have their benefits cut because they \nchose Medicare Advantage as their preferred insurance product. It is \nnot a question of whether they can keep what they have; they can't keep \nit because their benefits are going to be cut, and that affects \nAmerica's low-income seniors the most.\n  As a matter of fact, in this bill, we fix doctor payments for 1 year. \nSo, in 2011, doctors' reimbursements are going to be cut 23 percent. I \nsee Dr. Barrasso on the floor. So we know more doctors are going to \nstop covering Medicare beneficiaries. The pool is going to get smaller. \nWe are going to affect every senior's health.\n  Mr. CORKER. In essence, Medicare will become more similar to Medicaid \nbecause of this bill. Less physicians will be covering Medicare \nrecipients because this bill, instead of using the $464 billion to make \nsure physicians are paid, will leverage a new entitlement. So my \nassumption is, this program, unless something else happens, will become \nmore similar to Medicaid. Medicare will become similar to Medicaid.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator from Tennessee is 100 percent correct. Today, \n40 percent of our Nation's physicians under Medicaid will not see \npatients because the reimbursements are so low.\n  Reform in health care means you have to eliminate cost shifting. As \nDr. Barrasso knows, cost shifting means when somebody goes in for a \nservice, gets health care delivered, and doesn't pay or somebody goes \nin who is underinsured, gets delivered a service, and their \nreimbursement doesn't sufficiently meet the needs of the cost of that \nservice delivered. But it doesn't stop there. Medicaid reimburses at 72 \ncents of every dollar of service provided. Today, for every Medicaid \nbeneficiary in America, every time they receive a service from a \ndoctor, a hospital, or wherever, 28 cents is shifted over to the \nprivate side to those who pay out of pocket, to those who have private \ninsurance.\n  If you are reforming health care, you can't reform health care \nwithout eliminating cost shifting. Yet in this plan, we increase the \nrolls of Medicaid by 15 million individuals. In essence, what that \nmeans is we are going to have cost shifting on steroids now. We are \ngoing to have more cost shifting than we had before, which means a \nhigher inflation rate on private health care, that which we pay out of \npocket or that which employers, in fact, provide for their employees.\n  As a matter of fact, incorporated in this bill is a disincentive for \nsmall business success. I am not sure everybody has read to that point \nin the bill yet, but for a company that today can't afford, because of \ntheir competition to offer health care--the day they hire their 51st \nemployee, the Federal Government will send them a tax bill of $38,250. \nAt a time when we have 10.2 percent unemployment, 11 percent in North \nCarolina, small business is going to be the engine of job creation in \nthis country, and we are saying as soon as you are successful enough \nthat you hire the 51st person, if you don't offer the health care we \ntell you you have to offer, we are going to send you a tax bill of \n$38,250.\n  Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there. For the Medicaid beneficiaries, \nfor the Medicare beneficiaries, for everybody in America where we have \nsaid drugs are too high, devices are expensive, innovation costs money, \nwhat are we going to do? We are going to tax drug companies. We are \ngoing to tax medical device companies. We are going to actually raise \nthe cost of our ability to detect something earlier, where our options \nare greater and, hopefully, through having those options earlier, in \nfact, we are going to be able to treat a disease or cure it much \ncheaper.\n  I might add it is somewhat ironic that we are going to tax vaccines \nat a time when the industry is trying to meet the needs for vaccines \nfor H1N1 across this country. This bill puts a new tax on the vaccine \nindustry we have tried to revitalize in America.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues, this is not a health care bill. This \nis a layaway plan. In fact, what we have been presented is a plan where \nthey are asking Americans to pay for it for a number of years--4, to be \nexact--before they get their product. We are going to pay in, in taxes; \nwe are going to pay in, in Medicare shift; we are going to begin to \nincrease the rolls in Medicaid, to wait 4 years down the road before we \nget the product, before we get any benefit out of it. What we are going \nto find\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\n4 years down the road is that costs change. You see, it sold as a $849 \nbillion plan today, an $849 billion health care reform package. Well, \nthat is not what it is. If you look at it truly over 10 years, it is a \n$1.2 trillion plan. If you wait to start until the benefits are paid \nand look at it for a real 10 years of revenue and benefits, it is a \n$2.5 trillion plan.\n  We can't even be honest enough with the American people that we tell \nthem exactly what it is going to cost. But you would expect that out of \na layaway plan, and, in fact, that is what we have in front of us.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues that if you reform health care, you \ncan have coverage expansion without additional taxpayer investment. You \ncan't take the things that are broken in our system and actually \nincrease their use, such as Medicaid, and expect at the end of the day \nyou are going to be able to save money, provide a better level of care; \nmore importantly, that you are going to have a population that gets the \nbenefits everybody else does: a medical home, preventive care, chronic \ndisease management. It doesn't happen in Medicaid today. It will not \nhappen when you increase the rolls of Medicaid. It will only happen \nwhen you reform health care, and this bill does not do it.\n  I thank my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Our colleague from North Carolina has worked extensively \non this issue. I think we have a couple Senators who have some business \noff the floor that is very important. I think Senator Barrasso may be \none of those, and I think Senator Johanns is in the same boat. I know \nas a physician, the Senator actually knows something about health care.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Twenty-five years taking care of families and the \npeople of Wyoming. I have taken care of people on Medicaid and \nMedicare. We heard from Senator Burr about North Carolina and Medicaid \nas well as Medicare and I have concerns about both. I take care of all \npatients, regardless of their ability to pay. So what we know right now \nis that the Mayo Clinic--and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, has been \nheld up in the Senate by our colleagues. It has been held up by the \nPresident of the United States as the model for what we should try to \nget to do in America for health care. The Mayo Clinic has now told \nMedicare and Medicaid patients they are not welcome. It has put out the \nsign: No vacancies for you. It is astonishing. It is hard to believe \nthe Mayo Clinic would say: No thank you, we don't want you, but they \nhave done that.\n  Mr. CORKER. So I guess if you had Medicaid, it is kind of like, in \nmany cases, you have something that is not usable; is that correct? I \nknow Senator Alexander has spoken to an analogy in the past in that \nregard, but it makes it pretty difficult if you are a Medicaid \nrecipient.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. As the senior Senator from Tennessee said, it is like \nhaving a bus ticket when no bus is coming. Others commented in the \npaper that it is like putting more people into a sinking ship.\n  Why would the renowned Mayo Clinic not want to see these patients? \nThey are sending out letters saying if you are from these surrounding \nStates--Wyoming and others in the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain West \nsend many patients there--you cannot do it. The Mayo Clinic is able to \nprovide the kind of care they do because they take very few Medicaid \npatients, they take very few Medicare patients, and they take people \nwho have insurance. That is why we know premiums go up when more people \nare on Medicaid. There are actually two hospitals in Rochester, MN--\nMayo Clinic, where 5 percent of their patients are on Medicaid. At the \nneighbor hospital in the same community, it is 29 percent of their \npatients.\n  The hospitals in Tennessee cannot take everybody out of town. We have \nto take care of those people. When reimbursement is so low by the \nFederal Government, which is the biggest deadbeat payer in the world \nwhen it comes to health care--the deadbeat Federal Government pays so \nlittle, the Mayo Clinic wants nothing to do with them. That is why they \ncame out against these proposals.\n  Harvard Medical School gave these proposals a failing grade and said \npeople who support these are collectively in denial, because they know \nwe are looking at a health care bill that will raise the cost of care, \nto be paid for by raising taxes and cutting Medicare for seniors. Our \nseniors on Medicare cannot even get into the Mayo Clinic. It is \nfascinating. Mayo set up a branch in Arizona. They say they will no \nlonger accept Medicare for patients seeking primary care at its \nfacility in Arizona: We don't want them. No vacancies for you. If you \nwant to come in, you have to pay additional fees--a $250 annual fee \nplus anywhere from $174 to $400 a visit if you are on Medicare.\n  Mr. CORKER. I assume that by the Reid plan taking $464 billion out of \nMedicare savings and not using that money to deal with this huge doc \nfix issue--the fact that physicians are going to have a 23-percent cut \nin a year, they are not dealing with that. I know it costs about $247 \nbillion to keep them whole. I assume that would keep many physicians, \nsuch as the Senator's former colleagues from--it would cause them to \ndrop Medicare recipients, is that correct?\n  (Mr. LEVIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It will absolutely prevent new Medicare and Medicaid \npatients from getting in. The Medicare cuts will prevent doctors from \ntaking new patients and may cause them to drop others. The concerns are \nso large, and the concerns aren't just for the doctors. I am concerned \nfor the people in Wyoming, who depend upon Medicare for health care. I \nknow the Senator is concerned for them in Tennessee. How will they get \nthe care they need? More people are coming of Medicare age every day.\n  This big bill, this monstrosity, will cut close to $500 billion from \npeople who depend on Medicare for their care. The American people--\nthose watching--need this care. But this takes it away to start a whole \nnew government program. It is not fixing the program that is going \nbroke already.\n  So the hard reality is--and I think the spokesperson for the Mayo \nClinic said it well. She said that ``it simply is the reality of the \nhealth care business and how we are going to be able to continue our \nmission when these payments are so far below what it costs to provide \nthe care.''\n  You are not even talking about staying open, keeping the doors open, \nbreaking even. The reimbursements are so far below what it even costs \nthe Mayo Clinic--the model being held up by Senators on the other side \nof the aisle--so far below what it costs them to provide care. So as we \nlook at this and say how can we take care of and help the people of \nAmerica get health care, quality care, what we need to do is be aimed \nat driving down the cost of care. This means an increase of the cost of \ncare and premiums. They are going to do it by raising taxes, and \neverybody will be affected. The Senator from North Carolina, a State \nwith an incredible background in technology and advances in medical \ndevices--anything that taxes them will be passed on to everybody, \nregardless of income level. Every patient in America will suffer. The \nMayo Clinic--the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, where anybody in America \nwould like to go for their care--I heard the Senator from Tennessee \nsay, in addition to what the Senator from North Carolina said, that \npeople in his State want to have the same level of care you would have. \nWe would all want that. The Mayo Clinic says if you are on Medicare or \nMedicaid, like many of the other States, don't come here, because we \ncannot afford to have you, because Washington--the biggest deadbeat \npayer of all time--isn't paying enough to keep our doors open.\n  Mr. CORKER. I know to the people in Tennessee this doesn't pass the \ncommonsense test--a whole new entitlement when we cannot take care of \nthe ones we have. I know the people in Wyoming are also that way. The \npeople in Tennessee know this bill will cause the private insurance \nthey now have to go up, which is exactly the opposite effect Americans \nwant. We have a former Governor here, who has important business off \nthe floor in a minute. He has run their Medicaid Program. He wants to \nspeak to this issue. I thank the doctor, Senator Barrasso, somebody who \nactually knows about health care, for being here to talk about this \nissue.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank Senator Corker on behalf of not only myself\n\n[[Page S11938]]\n\nbut the folks back home in Nebraska for giving me a few minutes today, \nand I also thank Dr. Barrasso. When he talks, I want to listen. I am so \ntempted to yield my time to him because he is so knowledgeable in this \narea. I do have a few things I want to say.\n  It occurs to me that after the vote tonight, what we should do is \ndeclare a recess for 2 weeks. We should take this bill out across our \nStates and listen to the people. We should listen to the doctors, like \nDr. Barrasso, who are on the front lines every day. We should listen to \nthe nurses and hospital administrators and say: What do you think? I \nthink we would get an earful.\n  I did four townhall meetings during the short recess around Veterans \nDay on health care issues. I have been all over the State of Nebraska. \nLet me tell you a story--and every single Senator can tell this same \nstory. I visited a small hospital in our State, the critical access \nhospital--and Dr. Barrasso is familiar with these. Under Federal law, \nthese hospitals are 25 beds or under. They are in our small \ncommunities, not only in Nebraska but all across America. They have no \nmargin for error, because all they do is hospital services. They don't \nhave an exercise program or whatever. It is hospital care they provide. \nI asked the same questions to those doctors and administrators. I would \nsay: Let me ask you, first, could you run this hospital and keep it \nopen on Medicaid reimbursements? It was 100 percent unanimous: We would \ngo broke.\n  I asked a second question: Could you keep this hospital open on \nMedicaid and Medicare reimbursements? It was 100 percent unanimous. \nThey say: No, we would go broke.\n  What does this bill do? It expands Medicaid. Fifteen million people \nwill be added to Medicaid--the largest single expansion in Medicaid in \nthe program's history. Nearly half of the reduction of the uninsured in \nthis bill is due to moving people onto Medicaid, a program that if you \nhad to live on those reimbursements, and you were a critical access \nhospital, you would close your doors. That is shocking to me. Who were \nthey listening to when they wrote this bill? Why can't we take these \nstaff people, who have been holed up in the majority leader's office \nfor 6 weeks, to Nebraska or Wyoming or Oklahoma or Tennessee or Texas? \nIt makes no sense to me.\n  I came here saying I was going to work to solve real problems for \nreal people. We say that a lot out there. Let me give you a real people \nperspective about my State. Again, every Senator can tell this story. I \nwas in a beautiful little community hospital--a critical access \nhospital, with 25 beds or less--in Valentine, NE, in a beautiful part \nof our State along the northern tier. It is a beautiful area, the \nNiobrara River Valley. There are great people there. It is off the \ninterstate. It is a beautiful part of our country. Pick up a Nebraska \nmap, because when I say this--if you look at the map, it will bring \nhome what I am talking about. Between Chadron, NE, in the northwest \npart of the State, and O'Neill, NE, closer to the north central part of \nthe State, lies Valentine. That little hospital in Valentine is the \nonly hospital in that northern area that is providing deliveries for \nbabies.\n  When you pass this bill and you expand Medicaid that they can't live \non, and the reimbursement rates are disastrous for them--if you mess \naround with that hospital's ability to deliver babies, you have a \ncrisis in the northern part of my State. You can tell that story over \nand over.\n  I wanted to talk about this last thing, and I will do it quickly, \nbecause other colleagues want to speak. As a former Governor, I dealt \nwith Medicaid to try to balance the budget. I was the Governor in \nNebraska post-9/11, when our economy and the Nation's economy tanked. \nWe had to cut budgets over and over. My State of Nebraska just finished \na special session. They cut about $300 million from the State budget. \nFour hundred people, the Associated Press reported, will lose their \njobs because of these very difficult budget decisions.\n  Here is the point I want to make: When this is fully in effect, we \nwill drop into the States--my State included--billions of dollars worth \nof unfunded mandates for Medicaid--billions of dollars in a program \nwhere already 35 to 40 percent of our doctors cannot afford to take \nMedicaid patients, and they are saying: We would go broke if we had to. \nWe are adding insult to injury by telling our Governors they have to \nfigure out that in addition to the historic problems they are having \nwith their budgets, they have to deal with an unfunded mandate. In a \nmoment of candor, one of my colleagues who worked on this for years \nsaid something when I asked: Why Medicaid? It is so problematic. Why \nall these millions on Medicaid? In a moment of candor he said to me: \nBecause it makes the score look better.\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes, it is the cheapest route for us and the most \nexpensive way for the States. This has been mostly about moving money \naround. I have not seen a lot in here that has a lot to do with reform. \nI appreciate the comments about Medicaid and what it will do to your \nState. After having been a Governor, I know that Dr. Coburn, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, is here, and we have the Senator from Texas, who \nhas been highly involved in every health care meeting we have had. \nSenator Hatch helped create SCHIP years ago. I think he knows that in \nthis bill not only is there an unfunded mandate for Medicaid, not only \nare there taxes and Ponzi schemes, such as the CLASS Act, that have \nbeen put together, it doesn't fund an existing program such as SCHIP. \nThat is another huge burden of $40 billion or $50 billion. I don't know \nif Senator Alexander wants to speak to that. I thank Senator Johanns \nfor being here. I know he has a meeting off the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I express my gratitude to the Senator from Tennessee for \nleading this important discussion on Medicaid. If I can pull back for a \nmoment, I think it is important because this is such a complex subject, \nas we can see from this 2,074-page bill. We need to define our terms. \nMedicaid, obviously, is a program for low-income people, shared by our \nState and Federal Governments. Medicare is for seniors, paid for \nentirely by the Federal trust fund, $38 trillion in unfunded federal \nliabilities to two entitlement programs, both of which are in terrible \nfinancial shape. Rather than make this better, this bill makes it \nworse. I will describe very quickly how in my State of Texas. I have \nwatched on C-SPAN and on the floor Senators come here and say tonight \nwe are having merely a procedural vote on whether to proceed to the \ndebate.\n  I thought we had been having a debate about health care reform for \nthe last year or so. I point out that under the Senate rules, we will \nnot be able to change one period, one comma, one sentence, one part of \nthis bill unless we can get 60 votes to do so. So the increase in \npremiums, the taxes on small businesses and the middle class, the cuts \nin Medicare, this expansion of Medicaid--all of these are a fait \naccompli unless 60 Senators vote to change it. That is under the rules \nof the Senate.\n  It is not true, in my humble opinion, that people can come in here \nand say: We are going to vote yes to proceed tonight at 8 o'clock, but \nit doesn't make any difference, the debate is just beginning. Not so.\n  I again thank the Senator from Tennessee for raising this concern. \nBoth of our Tennessee colleagues have been in the forefront of \ndiscussing this issue.\n  I think this is shameful. The expansion of Medicaid in this bill to \ncover 60 million Americans is shameful. It consigns people to a health \ncare gulag which they cannot get out of, where they get bad outcomes in \nterms of their health care, where they cannot find doctors who will \ntreat them at the low rates paid for by Medicaid, and it bankrupts our \nStates.\n  The Medicaid officials in Texas have told me, after their preliminary \nreview of this 2,074-page bill, it will cost Texas taxpayers, in \naddition to their Federal liability, $20 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Our friends who have been Governors have told us, as Governors and as \nState legislators, they have to make terribly hard choices. But when \nthe Federal Government imposes an unfunded mandate on the States to \npick up $20 billion over the next 10 years, what does that do to our \nability to do other things, such as law enforcement, higher education, \nand the like? It shoves those to the side because the Federal\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\nGovernment is going to jam this down the States' throats--another \nunfunded mandate--and it disrupts those States, as the Senator says, \nthat are operating on balanced budgets. They do not have the luxury of \nprinting money like the Federal Government.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, did the Senator from Texas see this \nweekend where college students in California were having public \nprotests about the huge increase in tuition out there? Yet here we are \ngetting ready to pass something that is going to drive that up even \nmore because the State of California will have to cover more Medicaid \nrecipients without the money being provided. So this is going to \nexacerbate that situation. I don't know if the Senator saw it this \nweekend.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator is correct. It is a 32-percent increase in \nfees and tuition, and that is in California alone, which is bankrupt \nalready. This is the direct result of the irresponsibility coming out \nof Washington, DC, forcing more costs on them.\n  I know there are other colleagues who want to talk about this topic, \nand I want to have this continued conversation. I think this is a good \nformat for parsing what is in this bill.\n  Let me mention one anecdote in Dallas, TX. If you are a Medicaid \nrecipient, or a low-income child or beneficiary in Dallas, TX, only \n38.6 percent of the doctors will see a new Medicaid patient--38.6 \npercent. In other words, 61 percent will have restricted access to \nMedicaid because, as the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nWyoming pointed out, it only pays about 72 percent of what a private \ninsurance policy would cover.\n  Mr. President, 85 percent of Americans have private insurance, and \nthey pretty much like what they have. They think it costs too much, and \nwe agree. We want to help them bring down that cost. But we have these \nsafety net programs which, frankly, do a lousy job. They promise \ncoverage, but they deny access because of low reimbursement rates.\n  Let me give an anecdote of what this means to 6-year-old Ruth Guerra \nin Dallas, TX. I took this article from the Dallas Morning News, dated \nJune 3. It says:\n\n       When Ruth Guerra, 6, tries to write, holding the pencil \n     puts just enough pressure on her left pinky to make it bleed. \n     With her condition, if she falls down while playing or a \n     classmate accidentally brushes against her, she bleeds.\n       Last week [her mother] Sandra Ramirez . . . took time off \n     from her hourly job at the Dollar General after another one \n     of Ruth's bleeding episodes.\n\n  Unfortunately, because she qualifies for Medicaid--and while people \nin Washington say: Isn't it great; we are going to give 60 million \npeople Medicaid--what it means for Ruth Guerra is that she has to wait \n6 months to get an appointment with a doctor who will actually see her. \nThat is what I mean when I say this bill consigns 60 million people to \na health care gulag they cannot get out of.\n  I agree with the Senator from Tennessee. We need to provide the \nAmerican people with choices that Members of Congress have, among an \narray of choices. What this does with the mandates, with the force-\nfeeding Medicaid on people such as Ruth Guerra and on the States, along \nwith the huge budget deficits that are going to come from it is \nshameful.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator for his contributions, being down \nhere on a Saturday on a very important issue. I know Senator Coburn is \nhere. Senator Alexander is here. I don't know what order they may want \nto speak. It looks like it is Dr. Coburn.\n  Again, each Monday, typically in his State, he is actually seeing \npatients. He knows something about Medicaid. He knows something about \nhealth care. Many of the reforms he put forth would give people a \nchoice, low-income citizens a choice like we have. But, instead, this \nbill confines them to Medicaid. I know he is going to talk about that.\n  I thank the doctor very much for being here.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker.\n  I have had the distinct pleasure of delivering over 2,500 babies for \nMedicaid insurance and taking care of their children. These are \nwonderful folks. I didn't do any differential between Medicaid and \nprivate insurance in my practice, but most of my colleagues did.\n  The heartbreaking part about Medicaid is that when you have a sick \nchild who needs a specialist, you cannot get one. You just cannot get \none. You say: Why can't you? Do they not care? Yes, they care. But you \nknow what. Because of the Medicaid reimbursement for pediatric \nsubspecialities--pediatric cardiologists, pediatric oncologists, \npediatric hematologists--there are not any.\n  We only have two pediatric cardiologists in the city of Tulsa serving \n1.9 million people. Try to get an appointment for a Medicaid patient \nthere. I can hardly get a regular one. How did that happen? The reason \nwe have a shortage of pediatric subspecialities is directly related to \nthe Medicaid system in this country because the reimbursement is so low \nthat you cannot afford to have a high percentage of Medicaid patients \nin your practice and still pay your bills.\n  So what consequently has happened is doctors do not go into \npediatrics, and then they do not go into the subspecialities of \npediatrics. So I end up having 8-month-old children seen by adult \ncardiologists or adult hematologists because there is no available \ndoctor to see them because we have created a system through the \nsubstandard reimbursement of Medicaid that has directed people coming \nout of medical school away from that speciality.\n  As a matter of fact, last year, if you take all the medical students \nwho graduated from medical college, whether it is osteopaths or \nallopaths, M.D.s or D.O.s, 1 in 50 went into primary care. That is \ngeneral internal medicine, family practice, or pediatrics, only 1 in \n50.\n\n  We have 50 million baby boomers going to hit Medicare in the next \n7\\1/2\\ years, and we are not going to have the primary care doctors \nthere to take care of them. The reason is because through government \nprograms, we have incentivized doctors not to do primary care. \nConsequently, we don't get there.\n  The other point I will tell you is that if you look at perinatal \nmortality rates in our population across the country, it is, No. 1, \ndirectly related more to poverty than it is to anything else. But the \nsecond most important factor is that if you are in Medicaid, you are \ntwice as likely to have a perinatal mortality event--in other words, \nyour child dies after childbirth--than if you are in private insurance. \nIt doesn't matter what your culture is. If you are poor, but you have \nprivate insurance, the likelihood your baby is going to do better is \ngreater.\n  Think about that: a promise we are going to give you care, but the \nresult of the care is going to be less good. We are going to give you \ncare, but it is not as good care, and it is not available care. We are \ngoing to make you wait in line, but we are going to call it care.\n  Care delayed is care denied. Let me say that again. Care delayed is \ncare denied. If, in fact, you have a problem that needs attention, and \nyou cannot get what you need, it does not matter what Medicaid does if \nyou cannot get treatment.\n  If you look at the subspecialities in Medicaid, 65 percent of them do \nnot see Medicaid patients. We have about 40 percent in primary care who \nwill not see a Medicaid patient. We have about 65 percent of the \nspecialities, because there is such a shortage in the specialities, \nthat what we are saying is we are going to have 60 million people in a \nsystem that says: You get care, but guess what. It is not available; \nyou are on Medicaid.\n  Senator Wyden did offer a plan, I say to Senator Corker, that would \nput every Medicaid patient in this country, except dual eligibles, into \nprivate insurance. So did we with the Patients' Choice Act, the first \nbill introduced on our side of the aisle. We take the stigma off saying \nyou have a low-paying plan, and we give them the same kind of insurance \nwe have right here in this body. By doing it, we save the States $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. Think about that.\n  But that isn't nearly as important as we have a major increase in the \npositive outcomes for Medicaid patients. You cannot talk about Medicaid \nwithout talking about Indian health care because as you add up Medicaid \nto Medicare to TRICARE to VA to Indian health care, when you add all \nthat up, the government is running 61 percent of our health care right \nnow. No wonder we are in trouble.\n  I do not deny there are big problems with the insurance industry. I \ndo not\n\n[[Page S11940]]\n\ndeny we need a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects people's rights \nand their interests. I do not deny we need transparency in the \ninsurance industry both on price and quality. I do not deny anything.\n  The question we ought to ask is, if we are going to truly reform \nhealth care, are we going to allow everybody, when they say they have \nhealth care, no matter where they get it, to have an equal shot at \ngetting equal care?\n  You see, this bill does not do that. This bill puts Medicaid patients \nin jail and says: If you happen to be lucky enough, the lucky 60 \npercent to get into the line, you will be OK. And if you need a \nsubspecialty, if you happen to be part of the lucky 35 percent, you \nwill be OK. But everybody else is in jail. You are in monopoly jail. We \nare promising--the government--to do that.\n  A final point--and then I will yield so others can talk--is the idea \nthat my State--Texas is a big State. It is our southern neighbor. They \nsometimes have a better football team than we do. They certainly did \nthis year. We are about one-eighth the size of Texas in terms of \npopulation. We cannot afford $2.8 billion over the next 10 years, I say \nto Senator Cornyn. We are going to say we are going to cover 15 million \npeople and some of those will be in Oklahoma. We cannot afford it.\n  What we can afford is to insure them if we make true changes in care, \nif we truly change and incentivize preventive care, management of \nchronic disease--if we truly reform health care. These bills do not \nreform health care. What they do is grow government.\n  They are not going to change outcomes, other than except they are \ngoing to limit what you can and cannot do through cost-effective \ncomparativeness.\n  As we look at this bill, what we need to do is think about those we \nare going to promise something we are not going to deliver. We are \ngoing to call it a system, but they are not going to have it available.\n  I thank Senator Corker for leading this discussion, and I yield.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank Dr. Coburn. As I listen to him, I realize we have \na health care reform bill before us where half the money, $460 billion, \nis taken from a program that is insolvent. Instead of making it more \nsolvent--a program that would take $38.6 trillion in the bank today, \nearning Treasury rates to make it solvent--it is a pretty big number--\nwe are taking $\\1/2\\ trillion out of that program to leverage a new \nentitlement. The reform we are getting out of that is we are moving \nhalf the folks into a program that not a person in this body would want \nto be a part of; is that correct?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. That is not the kind of health care reform I thought we \nwere going to be doing. I am shocked. As a matter of fact, as I said \nmany times, I don't think there is a person on the other side of the \naisle who would vote for this bill if you and I offered it; do you \nthink that?\n  Mr. COBURN. Probably not. But the Senator sparks one question. Think \nabout this, and I have experienced this as a physician.\n  I care for patients and they lose their job, they have a financial \ncatastrophe, and all of a sudden they become dependent on Medicaid. We \ncontinue to see those patients. But do you know what normally happens? \nYou lose your insurance, you loss your job, you come on hard times and \ngo on Medicaid. You can't go back to the doctor you had before because \nthey are not taking new Medicaid patients. So somebody you have been \nwith for 15 years, all of a sudden you can't get back in because they \nare not going to pay enough for them to care for you. It is a \ndiscriminatory system that says we will send you down the line.\n  That doesn't mean there are not truly caring physicians in this \ncountry, but it has to be said, outside of pediatrics, if you want to \nlook at quality parameters, the Medicaid population ends up going to \nthe less-qualified, the less-experienced, the less-good-outcome \nphysicians in this country.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the doctor. It is so good to hear from somebody \nwho has dealt, year after year, with Medicaid recipients with his \ncompassion.\n  Senator Hatch from Utah, I don't think there is a person in this body \non this side of the aisle who has spent more time trying to make sure \nthe poor children of our country have health care. No one has done \nthat. I know he is here to speak today about this huge Medicaid \nexpansion. I thank the Senator for the leadership he has shown in this \nbody for years, ensuring that young children in this country have \nappropriate health care.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for leading out here, talking about \nthis very important issue. You and your senior colleague from Tennessee \nare great Senators and mean a lot to all of us.\n  It is funny to me that the people in this body don't listen to the \nonly two doctors in the body, and both of them are excellent \nphysicians. Both of them are concerned about people. Both of them make \nsuch cogent arguments in the field of health care. I think we have had \na very good argument by Senator Coburn, from Oklahoma--one of our two \ndoctors in the Senate.\n  Senator Barrasso is an orthopedist, a specialist. He has come here to \nfight for the causes he believes to be right. He knows what is trying \nto be put off on America today is not right.\n  Our States are facing a historic deficit of more than $200 billion \nright now. Yes; that is what our States are facing right now without \nthis bill. One of the biggest drivers behind this is the Medicaid \nProgram, which takes up an increasing share of our States' budgets \nacross the country.\n  The Senate bill, which is nothing more than a 2,074-page takeover by \nWashington of our health care system, calls for the biggest Medicaid \nexpansion ever--133 percent of the Federal poverty level. That is 150 \npercent in the House bill, if we pass that monstrosity.\n  My home State of Utah only allows Medicaid coverage of up to 133 \npercent of the Federal poverty level for infants, children under the \nage of 5, and pregnant women. Other categories of citizens are, \nhowever, covered at different levels. For example, nonworking parents \nare only covered up to 48 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  This bill will now massively expand the level of Medicaid coverage to \n133 percent for everyone. Who is going to pay for that? Our colleagues \nsay the Federal Government will. What are they going to pay for it \nwith? We are running the Federal Government right into bankruptcy. It \nis ultimately going to be the responsibility of the States and the \nStates can't do it. Think of New York, New Jersey, California, just to \nmention three. Let's not forget that the House has already passed a \nMedicaid expansion of 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates this massive entitlement \nexpansion will cost States an additional $25 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  You heard me right, $25 billion more. That is over the next 10 years.\n  However, if history has taught us anything about the way things work \nin Washington, I believe this number is actually a huge underestimation \nand the real impact on our States will be much higher. I would like to \nread the following excerpt from a letter sent to me by Governor \nHerbert, our Governor in the great State of Utah, and what this \nMedicaid expansion would mean for my State. It is a quote. This is what \nmy Governor has to say:\n\n       As I am sure you know, Utah, like most other states, is \n     suffering from the negative impacts of nationwide recession. \n     As we prepare the state's fiscal year 2011 budget, we face \n     continued cuts to agency budgets and reduced government \n     services on top of painful reductions made last year. The \n     unfunded mandate of a forced Medicaid expansion will only \n     exacerbate an already dire situation. If required to increase \n     our Medicaid program as envisioned in Washington, Utah, and \n     most every other state, will be forced to find the money to \n     do so through other means. This will require states to either \n     raise taxes or continue to cut budgets in areas currently \n     suffering from a lack of funding, such as public and higher \n     education.\n\n  We are seeing a real life example of this in California right now. \nFaced with a mounting State budget crises, we recently saw that the \nState-run University of California system had to hike its tuition rates \nby 32 percent--32 percent!\n  I don't know about anyone else, but I will not allow this to happen \nin my home State of Utah just because Washington thinks it is a good \nidea to keep expanding government programs on the back of our States.\n  Here is the reality that our States are facing:\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\n  Unemployment rates rose in 29 States in October. A significant number \nof States are facing unemployment rates much, much higher than our \nnational rate of 10.2 percent--the highest in 26 years: Michigan, 15.2 \npercent; Nevada, 13 percent; Rhode Island, 12.9 percent; California, \n12.5 percent. In fact, California, Florida, Delaware and Washington, \nDC, posted their highest unemployment rates since 1976.\n  The last thing we need right now is for Washington to impose more \nliability on the states.\n  This alone should be a reason enough for every Senator to stop and \nrethink their decision about letting this ``tax and spend'' bill move \nforward.\n  But I have to tell you, I know what is behind all this. Ever since I \nhave been here, there has been a push to have more and more people \nmoved into Medicaid. Why is that? Because if they can push more and \nmore people into Medicaid, then ultimately we will have a single-payer \nsystem--in other words, socialized medicine in this country, where the \ngovernment will control everything. That is what is behind a lot of \nthis bill.\n  I have to tell you, what bothered me an awful lot about this bill is \nthat even the CBO Director, whom I find to be an honorable, honest man, \nDr. Elmendorf, he said that if we go to a government plan--which is a \nhallmark of what our friends on the other side want to do--then you \ncould have almost 10 million people going into that plan. However, if \nyou look at the Lewin Group study, they say if you go to a government \nplan, we could have 119.1 million people going into the new plan.\n  What is it going to be, the 10 million or the 119.1 million? I \nguarantee it is going to be a lot closer to the 119.1 million than it \nwill be to the 10 million.\n  Our friends on the other side started criticizing the Lewin Group \nafter this report. They have quoted them for years before this report. \nNow that they don't agree with our colleagues on the other side, they \nthink it will only be 10 million. Don't kid yourselves. If you had to \nchoose between the 10 and the 119 million, you know doggone well it \nwill be closer to the 119.\n  If we move millions of more people over from private insurance into \ngovernment health care, I can't tell you the pressure that will be on \nAmerica, the pressure that will be on the health care professionals.\n  We heard from one of the great doctors in this body, whom we ought to \nlisten to, that we can't get the primary care people to take care of \npeople now on Medicaid, let alone adding millions more under this \nexpansion.\n  I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his leadership on this. I am \nhappy to be here to say a few things about it because I have spent a \nlifetime working on health care issues. Before I ever got here, I \nactually tried medical liability and defense cases, defending doctors, \nnurses, hospitals, health care providers. I know what these costs are. \nThey are just beginning to explode.\n  If this bill passes, it is going to be an explosion of health care \ncosts such as we never dreamed possible.\n  I am very concerned about this. It is all driven by a desire to get, \nright here in Washington, control over all of our health care. If we do \nthat, we deserve the problems we are going to have.\n  I thank my colleagues for the great work they are doing.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator very much for coming. No one in this \nbody knows more about what is happening in public programs than he. We \nheard for the last 55 minutes from the Senators from Texas, Oklahoma, \nWyoming, Utah, North Carolina, Nebraska. I can't think of a better \nperson to close us out this afternoon than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I am fortunate to serve with this Senator. He was a \nGovernor, an education Secretary. He knows what he is talking about. I \nam proud the senior Senator from Tennessee is going to close us out on \nwhat I think has been an outstanding hour on the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for those who are watching, Republican \nSenators are reading through the bill, reading the bill in its \nentirety. It is kind of like reading the entire New Testament in Greek. \nIt is better to have somebody help interpret it. We have been talking \nabout page 396, title II, subtitle A, section 2001, which expands \nMedicaid. We have heard eloquent statements about how moving 15 million \nlow-income Americans into a program called Medicaid, which is a medical \nghetto, is not health care reform. We have also heard Senator after \nSenator say what right do we have to expand Medicaid and tell the \nStates that you are going to pay for it. What kind of arrogance do we \nhave to say that to States that are in their worst fiscal condition \nsince the Depression?\n\n  The Reid bill requires states to expand Medicaid eligibility to cover \nall persons under 133 percent of poverty, which means those earning \nabout $14,000 per year for an individual and about $29,000 per year for \na family. Individuals who are not otherwise covered by an employer-\nsponsored insurance would not be eligible for tax credits. In effect, \nevery American below 133 percent of poverty would be locked into \nMedicaid which is like confining them to a medical ghetto. With this \nbill we are on path to expand the largest ``public option'' we already \nhave, Medicaid, and it could bankrupt the States, because they will be \npaying for it. As the former Governor of Tennessee, I do not see how \nTennessee can pay for their part of the Medicaid expansion included in \nSenator Reid's health care bill without a new income tax, or seriously \ndamaging higher education by raising tuition like California just did, \nor both.\n  I am opposed to this expansion of Medicaid, which, according to the \nCBO, would cost States an additional $25 billion, and add 15 million \npeople to the Medicaid Program. This would be the largest single \nexpansion of Medicaid in the program's history. Why? Because nearly \nhalf of the reduction of the uninsured in the Reid health care bill is \ndue to people moving into the government-run program that is Medicaid.\n  Expanding Medicaid to cover uninsured individuals is a terrible \nvehicle for health care reform, because dumping this many more people \ninto that program will increase problems for beneficiaries getting \naccess to care and for maintaining quality. Plus the program is already \nriddled with fraud and abuse; this would just invite more of that. Most \nGovernors are struggling with Medicaid in its current form, and they \nagree that expansion is a bad idea. This includes Democratic Governors.\n  Tennessee's Medicaid Program is called TennCare. The Tennessean from \nThursday printed an article that reports how ``People covered by \nTennCare may face new limits on their coverage and reductions in their \nbenefits next year, under a plan unveiled Wednesday to help slice state \nspending.'' The article continues, ``The limits are meant to help \nTennCare, the State's Medicaid program for the poor, pregnant women and \nchildren, meet Govenor Phil Bredesen's goal of reducing spending by \nmost State agencies by as much as 9 percent as the State deals with a \nshortfall in tax receipts that could reach as much as $1.5 billion over \nthe next two fiscal years.''\n  If the Reid health care bill is passed, TennCare might introduce a \n$10,000 annual cap on hospital coverage for the 1.2 million enrollees. \nAdditionally, they might also eliminate coverage for occupational, \nspeech and physical therapy, and limit enrollees to no more than 15 \noutpatient procedures and 15 lab procedures in a year. This past \nSunday, the Tennessean ran another story titled, ``Bredesen faces \npainful choices as TN begins budget triage'' which states ``there is no \nquarrel with the general position that Tennessee State Government faces \na grim situation'' and the Governor anticipates that roughly $750 \nmillion in cuts will be needed for the next fiscal year. To make \nmatters worse ``state tax collections are already $101.3 million less \nthan assumed when this year's budget was enacted.''\n  Another article from the Tennessean reported that the State ``might \nrelease as many as 4,000 non-violent felons, possibly even including \npeople convicted of drug dealing or robbery, under a plan outlined \nMonday by the Department of Corrections to deal with the state's budget \ncrisis,'' and Tennessee is not alone in its budget crisis. Even though \nmany States are going through budget crises much like Tennessee, \nSenator Reid has proposed to as even more costs onto these States. \nEarlier this month, the National Governors Association released a \nfiscal survey of the States and an accompanying release, ``The State \nFiscal Situation: The Lost Decade.''\n  That report said:\n\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\n\n       The recent economic downturn started in December 2007 and \n     likely ended in August or September 2009, making it one of \n     the deepest and longest since the Great Depression.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       Medicaid spending, which is about 22 percent of state \n     budgets, averaged 7.9 percent growth in FY 2009, its highest \n     rate since the end of the last downturn six years ago. \n     Medicaid enrollment is also spiking, with projected growth of \n     6.6 percent in FY 2010 compared with 5.4 percent in 2009.\n\n  We don't yet have an estimate from Tennessee of how much Senator \nReid's bill will cost the state, but we expect it to be in the ballpark \nof what the Senate Finance bill would have cost, which according to \nGovernor Bredesen would have cost an additional $735 million over 5 \nyears. Tennessee can't afford to get a $735 million bill from \nWashington. Not only is it wrong to ask states to pay for expanding \nthis program, but I think it is wrong to dump low-income Americans into \na government-run program that is failing.\n  Medicaid is a program that, if given the choice, none of us would \njoin. A 2002 Medicare Payment Advisory Committee survey found that \n``approximately 40 percent of physicians restricted access for Medicaid \npatients,'' meaning they won't take new Medicaid patients, because \nreimbursement rates are so low. Only about half of U.S. physicians \naccept new Medicaid patients, and yet this is how the majority leader \nproposes we cover the uninsured.\n  Why is there such an access problem for people on Medicaid? It is \nbecause Medicaid reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals are so \nlow. Medicare pays 80 percent of what the private insurers pay and \nMedicaid pays about 72 percent of what Medicare pays. Which means if \nyou are a doctor or a clinic, or a hospital, you get paid about 60 \npercent for serving a Medicaid patient versus one of us who has his or \nher private health care. You can see why this spells trouble, and the \nSenate bill does nothing to fix this problem. In fact, by dumping 15 \nmillion more people into the program it will only make things worse. \nWho would want to be one of those 15 million people?\n  In addition to access problems, the quality of care for Medicaid \npatients is significantly lower than those with private insurance, and \neven those with no insurance. According to a survey by the National \nHospital Ambulatory Medical Care, Medicaid patients visit the emergency \nroom at nearly twice the rate of uninsured patients, and a 2007 study \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that \npatients enrolled in Medicaid were less likely to achieve good blood \npressure control, receive breast cancer screening, or have timely \nprenatal care than similar patients enrolled in private plans. Another \nstudy of cancer patient outcomes found that even after adjusting for \npatients who became eligible as a result of their cancer diagnosis, \nMedicaid patients have significantly lower survival rates than non-\nMedicaid patients.\n  The final example I will give today of why dumping 15 million more \npeople into Medicaid is such a bad idea comes from the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO. The GAO has determined that the program is \nplagued by fraud and abuse. In 2009, the GAO labeled Medicaid as a \n``high-risk'' program, finding $32.7 billion in improper payments in \n2007 alone. That is 10 percent of the program's total spending.\n  As a former Governor, I am particularly concerned about the impact \nand expansion of Medicaid would have on the State budgets and the \nresulting squeeze on higher education spending. When a governor looks \nat his budget and sees the things he has to pay for like elementary and \nsecondary education, prisons, roads, and Medicaid. Then a Governor \nlooks at the things they want to spend money on like higher education \nand a Governor, knowing they have to balance their budgets every year, \ncan't spend money he or she doesn't have, so something has to give, and \nit's usually higher education. As I noted earlier, the New York Times \nreported Friday that the University of California Board of Regents will \nraise undergraduate fees 32 percent by next fall to make up for steep \ncuts in state funding. The article goes on to report that ``The \nUniversity of California now receives only half as much support from \nthe state, per student, as it did in 1990. Even with the higher student \nfees, the system needs a $913 million increase in state financing next \nyear to avoid further [budget] cuts.''\n  From 2000 to 2006, spending by State governments on Medicaid has \nrisen 62.6 percent, because of that higher Medicaid spending; higher \neducation has only seen an increase of 17.1 percent over the same time \nperiod. As a result, tuition at a public 4 year university has risen an \naverage of 63.4 percent. So Congress passes a generous Medicaid \nbenefit, and the governors have to pay the bills. Then the governor has \nto say to our college students: your turn, pay up. Expanding Medicaid \nis exactly the opposite of real health care reform.\n  Senator Corker, you were the chief financial officer of the State of \nTennessee. You were the mayor of Chattanooga. How would you like it if \nsomeone in Washington passes a program and sends you the bill?\n  Mr. CORKER. I would be losing a lot of sleep right now. I know people \nall across the country who have to act responsibly, unlike us, are \nlosing sleep over what we are getting ready to do to States across the \ncountry.\n  Is the Senator finished? Is that the point?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think we are out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Governor of Tennessee, who is a Democratic \nGovernor, has estimated that the cost to our State of this bill, of \nmoving 15 million Americans into this medical ghetto, is about $800 \nmillion over 5 years. In my view, finding that much money would \nseriously damage higher education, raise tuition in Tennessee like \nCalifornia's, which just went up, or require us to enact a new State \nincome tax, or all of those things at once.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent the next hour of Democratic time \nbe controlled as follows: 10 minutes under the control of Schumer, with \nthe remaining 50 minutes of time available for various Democratic \nMembers to engage in colloquies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today we stand at a crossroad. We can \ncontinue to turn a blind eye to the very real, very dangerous threat \nburgeoning health care costs pose to our economic future or we can \nchoose the path to restoring economic opportunity in this country by \ntackling what my dear friend, Ted Kennedy, called the ``great \nunfinished business of our society.''\n  As so often is the case at any major crossroads in our history, \nembarking on what we all know is the right path is difficult. Indeed, \nthis is the single most difficult undertaking I have ever seen in my \n30-year career as a legislator. But my colleagues and I know what has \nto be done. Tonight is only one step down the road. There will be more \nprocedural hurdles, more disagreements, more pressure from our \nopponents, more television ads, and many amendments. But I have no \ndoubt we will pass this bill.\n  There have been many attempts over many decades in many Congresses to \nreform health care. This time, moral and economic necessity will guide \nus over the finish line. It is unacceptable that in this country--the \nwealthiest, greatest country in the world--there are Americans who are \nforced to choose between their health care and rent, between their \nhealth care and food, between their health care and an education. But \nthere are. And there are too many of them, and that must change.\n  Consider these facts: Health care costs are out of control. Premiums \nfor New York families have doubled in the last decade. Premiums have \nrisen far in excess of inflation while median income has remained \nstagnant. Costs have risen so much that more than 20 million Americans \nhave skipped a doctor's visit for no reason other than cost and 23 \nmillion Americans have premiums so high they consume $1 out of every $8 \nearned. Health care costs now account for a staggering 16 percent of \nour GDP, far more than any other industrialized country in the world. \nFor every dollar a small business in the United States spends on health \ncare, its foreign competitors spend a mere 63 cents. Yet the health \ncare of the U.S. workforce lags behind all other industrialized \ncountries. Plain and simple,\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\nour small businesses will no longer be able to compete unless we act to \nreform health care.\n  Even among those Americans fortunate enough to have coverage, nearly \n88 million don't have health care they can rely on. That is half of all \nAmericans age 18 to 64 and their families. And 46 million of these \nAmericans have a serious preexisting condition that has made it harder \nor more expensive for them to get coverage. In addition, 37 million of \nthese Americans had a gap in their coverage during the last year.\n  Our health care system is holding our economy hostage. The \nentrepreneur in Binghamton who does not take a chance, who does not \nleave a job to start his own firm because he is afraid of losing his \nfamily's health care; the college graduate in Oswego, days away from \nlosing her parents' coverage, takes a job because it provides health \ncare, even though that health care eats up a quarter of her paycheck--\neach of these individuals who limit their potential because they are \nconcerned about their health care should inspire action among all of \nus.\n  Passing this bill is an economic imperative. The broken system we \nhave is not only a burden on the present, it is a tax on the future. \nEvery day we do not act to fix the health care system is a day that \nhandcuffs our economy. It drains it of productive workers who do not \ntreat illness. It drains businesses of money they could otherwise use \nto innovate and outperform their foreign competitors, and it drains it \nof savings and wealth that every American should have in retirement as \na reward for a lifetime of hard work.\n  Inaction is not an option. The consequences of failure are simply too \nhigh. Premiums will climb higher, benefits will erode further, \nbusinesses will buckle under the cost of insurance, and Medicare will \ngo bankrupt. Yet our Republican colleagues would rather see us fail. At \nevery turn, they have obstructed our path with procedural delays, with \ncalculated misinformation, and sometimes with outright falsehood. I am \namazed they are against a government health care plan, but they want to \nprotect Medicare. Medicare is a government health care plan. You can't \nhave it both ways.\n  Yet when Democrats move to protect consumers from insurance company \nabuses, Republicans fight to allow these companies to drop, deny, or \nlimit coverage for the people who need it most. When Democrats tackle \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in our health care system, Republicans cry foul \nto preserve the status quo. When Democrats fight to protect and \nstrengthen Medicare for future generations, Republicans try to weaken \nit.\n  Tonight, there is no question what path our Republicans will take. \nThey will follow the map handed to them by the big insurance \ncompanies--protecting industry profits, defending unfair practices, and \nignoring the threat rising health care costs pose to America's economic \nfuture. They will continue to speak with two tongues against government \nhealth care and for Medicare. You can't have it both ways.\n  Our Republican colleagues will not stand in our way. The road ahead \nis not a smooth one, but the wind is now at our backs. The American \npeople want reform, and we will have the votes to finally deliver it to \nthem. Sure, changes will be made to improve the bill as we move \nforward, but we will pass this bill. We will finish this great, \nunfinished business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senators from Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and others who \nwill be joining us later in the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as the Senator from New York has so \neloquently stated, the time for health care reform is now. We cannot \nafford to wait any longer. We can't afford to wait, for the middle \nclass.\n  There are a lot of numbers that get thrown out in the debate, but I \nthink we can say it pretty simply by just using three numbers. Those \nnumbers are 6, 12, and 24. What do those numbers mean? Ten years ago, \nthe average family in this country paid $6,000 for their health \ninsurance. Now they are paying $12,000. That is an average. I know of \none small business in northern Minnesota, a backpack company, paying \n$24,000 for a family of four. One guy started a company with five \nemployees. He now has 15--a growing business. He is paying $24,000. The \naverage right now is $12,000 for a family of four. Where is it headed \nif we don't bend the cost curve for middle-class families--$24,000 \naverage, little towns all over America, $24,000, 10 years from now. \nThat is not the kind of stability the middle class needs.\n  The middle class needs to know, people I know all over my State need \nto know that if their kid gets sick, they still can have health care \ncoverage; that if their kid goes to college and they want to keep them \non their policy, they can still do that. That is what we are talking \nabout when we talk about stability.\n  The other piece of this reform effort that is so important, coming \nfrom Minnesota, a State with high-quality, highly efficient care, is \nthe cost issue, that we begin the long journey of reforming our \nMedicare cost so that we actually promote the kind of high-quality care \nwe see in my State at places such as the Mayo Clinic and we promote \nthe kind of efficient care we need to see.\n\n  My favorite example is in Pennsylvania, the Geisinger Clinic. They \nhad diabetic patients. They decided it was not going that well. The \npatients didn't feel that good about their treatment, and the quality \nthey wanted was costing too much. They tried something else. For \nroutine cases, they said they will see nurses and see them more often. \nThe more difficult cases went to endocrinologists, and they reviewed \nthe routine patients' records. Higher quality care, happier patients, \nbetter care, lower costs--$200 per patient per month--that is what \nhappened. They got less money for that higher quality care, less money. \nThat is what we are talking about. We want to use those kinds of models \nso we get higher quality care for America at a more efficient rate.\n  Some of my colleagues across the aisle have been using the name of \nthe Mayo Clinic in vain. This matters to me because I come from \nMinnesota. It is the home of the Mayo Clinic. The minority has \nsuggested that the Mayo Clinic doesn't want any part of this bill. They \nhave said the Mayo Clinic wants nothing to do with this bill. They have \nsaid the Mayo Clinic--and this is an exact quote from the Senator from \nWyoming--``is no longer taking Medicare or Medicaid patients.''\n  Let me set the record straight. Like anyone in this country, the Mayo \nClinic is looking at this bill. They like some provisions, and they \ndon't like others. They have specifically said they support the \ncreation of accountable care organizations, bundling of payments, the \ncreation of an independent commission to evaluate Medicare solvency, \nwhich is in the Senate bill, the MedPAC idea. They are supportive of \nthese issues because right now it is becoming harder and harder for \nthem to cope with the current Medicare payment system.\n  This allegation that they are no longer taking these patients is \ncompletely incorrect. They made a decision not to take about 80 \npatients a year from the State of Nebraska because they weren't getting \npaid. They are still taking all Medicare-Medicaid patients from \nMinnesota and the contiguous States. This is not a small amount. Forty \npercent of Mayo patients are on Medicare. Six percent--I wrote this on \nthe back of an envelope driving in with one of their chief doctors, so \nyou know it is accurate, unlike the ``facts'' we are hearing over \nthere. Forty percent of their patients are on Medicare, 6 percent on \nMedicaid, 46 percent are on Medicare or Medicaid. Sixty percent of \ntheir business is from Medicare or Medicaid.\n  It is just false. But what is true is that they want to see reform. \nThey want to see reform of the Medicare and Medicaid system. They want \nto have it based on quality, not on quantity. That is why they support \nthe quality index I sponsored, along with Senator Cantwell of \nWashington.\n  Just putting your head in the sand and hiding behind the stacking of \nthat bill--by the way, we had a three-page bill with the Bush TARP \nplan, that didn't work out that well when there were no accountability \nmeasures in that. That is not going to bring us the\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\nkind of health care reform the Mayo Clinic wants to see for the rest of \nthis country.\n  I heard a lot in Minnesota from small businesses. Small businesses \nare paying 20 percent more than big businesses for their health care \nright now. Why should employees of little businesses, which are really \nthe entrepreneurial engine of our States and the Nation, why should \nthey have to pay 20 percent more than people who work for big \nbusinesses? This reform effort allows them to pool their numbers, \nallows them to join together so they can buy private insurance off an \nexchange with the same kind of numbers you have at a major corporation.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland has been very devoted to the idea of \nhelping small businesses.\n  I ask Senator Cardin about this specific issue. How does the Senator \nsee this as helping small businesses in Maryland and helping the middle \nclass in his State?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me thank Senator Klobuchar for setting the record \nstraight as it relates to the Mayo Clinic. It is interesting, I have \nhad conversations with people at Johns Hopkins University, the \nUniversity of Maryland Medical Center. I hear the same thing. They \ndesperately want to see health care reform. The cost issues are beyond \ntheir ability to maintain the excellence of our health care system. We \nhave to get health care costs under control.\n  If I might point out, I was listening to my colleagues on the other \nside give every reason why we should not move forward with the debate, \nsaying: Don't worry, things will be OK. Those were the same arguments \nthey made 15 years ago, which was the last opportunity we had to debate \ncomprehensive health care reform. They blocked it from being on the \nfloor of the Senate 15 years ago.\n  What has happened in the last 15 years, after they said: Don't worry \nabout it. Everything will be OK. Just keep on with our current system \nof protecting the private insurance companies. They will do a great \njob.\n  In the last 15 years, we have seen health care costs go up, $912 \nbillion, almost a three-time increase. We have seen the per capita cost \nof health care go from $3,400 to $8,100. We have seen that share of our \neconomy in the last 15 years go from 13 percent of our economy to over \n17 percent of our economy. We need to act.\n\n  One more number I want to give because it affects Mayo Clinic and \naffects Johns Hopkins because in many cases they are the provider of \nlast resort, where no one else will give care. Also, the number of the \nuninsured has increased since 1993 from 39 million to 46 million.\n  The legislation that is being brought forward by our vote later today \nwill reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million. Mr. President, 98 \npercent of Americans will be covered by health insurance with this \nbill. It reduces the growth rate of health care costs in America. It \nprovides an affordable option for every American. This is a critically \nimportant bill.\n  The Senator mentioned small companies. I am glad the Senator did \nbecause small companies are the ones that are most discriminated \nagainst today in our health care system. They pay 20 percent more for \nthe same coverage as a larger company. They do not have options. They \ndo not have a lot of choices about who they can get to insure them. Not \nonly is the cost so high, the annual increases are unpredictable. How \ndo you run a business, if you are a small business owner, not knowing \nwhether your health care cost is going to go up by 10 percent, 20 \npercent, or 40 percent in the following year? You cannot.\n  As the Senator knows, we have had small businesses come before us and \ntell us they are going to have to decide to eliminate their health \ncare. In one case, we had a small business owner who said: Look, I am \ngoing to have to give up my business and start to work for a larger \ncompany because I can't afford the health care.\n  We are at a crisis. I do not understand my colleagues on the other \nside saying they do not even want to have a debate on this issue, they \ndo not even want to vote so we can take up this issue. Instead, they \nwant to protect the private insurance companies and let them continue \nto make these profits, continue to cause real problems for our \nconsumers.\n  I have letter after letter from people who are confronting the \nproblems of private insurance today, where they are denying coverage \nbased on preexisting conditions or not covering a specific drug under \ntheir policies. There is no effective way to challenge private \ninsurance companies today. This bill will give the consumers of America \na chance against our private insurance companies.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I see the \nSenator from Delaware is in the Chamber. Both the Senator from Maryland \nand the Senator from Delaware serve on the Judiciary Committee, and we \nhave had several hearings in that committee about an issue people do \nnot always think about that hurts the middle class, and that is the \nmoney that is being sucked down the fraud tube. Medicare fraud is $60 \nbillion a year, I think.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. It is up to $220 billion.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, $220 billion. This bill will give us \nthe tools. I know I wish to add even more to it on this subject, to go \nafter that money, so that money can go back to help the middle class \nafford health care.\n  I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. That is absolutely right. What we are going to do is \nincrease the number of whistleblowers, people who will see health care \nfraud and report it. We are going to get more prosecutors. We are going \nto get more FBI people. We are going to get more people to make sure we \nbring this health care fraud down. That is part of this bill.\n  But I do not understand--to follow up on what the Senator from \nMaryland said--how can you say you do not want to debate the bill, when \nyou look at the fact that the alternative is our present health care \nsystem, which is totally, completely broke? How can you say you do not \nwant to do it? You say you are fiscally responsible. How can you say \nyou are fiscally responsible when you are not going to do anything \nabout Medicare and Medicaid health costs and the cost of health \nbenefits in this country?\n  As we have said many times before on the floor, my State is one of \nthe worst cases; that is, in 2016, a family of four making $50,000 a \nyear would be paying $29,000 in health care premiums. They cannot \nafford $29,000 in health care premiums. So what is going to happen? \nThey are going to have the equivalent of half what they have today. If \nthey can afford $12,000 or $13,000, they are going to have half the \nprogram.\n  I heard my colleagues on the other side talking about rationing. What \nis going to happen to these people when they are getting half as much \nhealth care from these health care companies? And the health care \ncompanies are the ones that decide what procedures you can have, when \nyou can have them, and those kinds of decisions. When people have their \nhealth care insurance cut by this amount, you have to worry about \nwhether they are going to be able to get the things they need.\n  Of course, Medicare and Medicaid prices are going through the roof. \nIt is going to bankrupt the country. In 6 or 7 years, Medicare and \nMedicaid costs will cost more than everything else in the Federal \nGovernment. So how you can talk about----\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CARDIN. On the Medicare issue, during the last hour we heard all \nthese people, who for a long time have been trying to privatize \nMedicare and reduce the program, now saying that Medicare is going to \nbe in jeopardy if this bill moves forward. It is very interesting. The \nAARP gets it right when it says:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     free preventive benefits, and--most notably for AARP \n     members--reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the \n     dreaded Medicare doughnut hole, a costly gap in prescription \n     drug coverage.\n\n  This bill strengthens our health care system, strengthens Medicare \nfor the future, and that is what is going to be critically important to \nour seniors.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I think that is absolutely right. Right now, medical \nbankruptcies are 60 percent of U.S. personal\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\nbankruptcies--a rate 1\\1/2\\ times what it was 6 years ago--because of \nmedical bills. The thing that is striking about this is, 75 percent of \nthe families entering bankruptcy because of medical bills actually have \nhealth insurance. Two-thirds of all Americans filing for bankruptcy \nbecause of medical bills already have health insurance. We cannot stop \nthat unless we change the system and give people more insurance and \ngive them better insurance and make sure you cannot be denied for \npreexisting conditions and make sure--the killer--once you get sick--it \nis bizarre. You get sick, and then the health insurance company comes \nin and cuts off your health insurance. No wonder so many people are \ngoing into bankruptcy.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator would yield, I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts is in the Chamber, who I think has firsthand knowledge of \nthe importance of this bill, having taken the seat once held by our \ndear friend Senator Kennedy, who worked so hard to get this bill done, \nto get health care to the people of his State.\n  I say to the Senator, maybe he would want to talk about what this \nwould mean to the people of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator.\n  I thank Senator Klobuchar for her leadership, as we approach the \nimportant moment on voting on a motion to proceed with this debate.\n  I was appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth basically in \nconformity with Senator Kennedy's wishes. He knew how divided this body \nwas over the important health care legislation and the importance of 60 \nvotes so we could proceed to debate the merits of this bill. I am \nhonored and humbled to be standing at his desk, to be one voice and one \nvote from Massachusetts.\n  It is a historic moment, and it is a poignant moment. As I reflect on \nmy experience on his staff, as Senator Kaufman was on Senator Biden's \nstaff at that time, my experience began 40 years ago under the \nleadership of Senator Kennedy. That was the time he first spoke about \nthe need for national health insurance that would be affordable and \naccessible to every single American--in hearing after hearing, in \nspeeches on the Senate floor, and in field hearings throughout America, \nprodding, listening, leading.\n\n  I can only reflect on how proud he would be of his colleagues and the \nleadership of Senator Reid and Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator \nBaucus, all his colleagues who are now uniting in this moment of \nhistory to do for the American people what they have waited for for \nseveral decades, even since the first utterance of this important \nhealth insurance coverage by former President Harry Truman.\n  Having read through this bill and knowing how proud Senator Kennedy \nwould be of this legislation, I will tell you why he would be. If you \nlook through the bill, what does it do? It saves money. It controls \ncosts. It reduces the Nation's deficit. It stimulates competition. It \nexpands coverage. It strengthens Medicare. It attacks fraud, waste, and \nabuse. It increases transparency. It eliminates patient discrimination. \nIt promotes flexibility and innovation. It rewards quality and value--\nnot quantity and volume--of health care. It provides affordable, \nquality health care choices for individuals, families, and small \nbusinesses across America.\n  It introduces, through Senator Kennedy's leadership, a provision \nwhich provides long-term services for the elderly and the disabled.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. KIRK. Before I do, I say to the Senator from Maryland, there is \none large, major question. If this bill promises to do all these \nthings, for the life of me, I cannot understand how 1 of the 100 of us \ncould go home for Thanksgiving and be able to explain to middle-class \nfamilies, who are stretched and looking for health security and \nfinancial stability, that he or she would not vote even to debate the \nmerits of this legislation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I was going to comment, listening to the Senator, at the \ndesk that was Senator Kennedy's desk, how proud he would be of the \nstatements the Senator is making here this evening. Senator Kennedy was \nour champion for middle-income families in America. He understood they \nneeded a voice in the Senate, and he was their strong, passionate \nvoice.\n  This bill speaks to middle-income families. It is what Senator \nKennedy fought his whole career for here in the Senate, to do something \nthat would help middle-income families.\n  As the Senator points out, we need to bring down the cost of health \ncare. Health care costs are rising three times faster than wages. \nSenator Kennedy understood better than any of us that Americans are \nfalling farther and farther behind because of the health care issues, \nbecause of health care costs. Private insurance companies can make lots \nof money if health care costs go up. They are not losing. It is the \nmiddle-income families who are getting hurt by the system.\n  He understood that small businesses could not survive unless we \nfigured out a way to deal with the health care issues. And as to people \non Medicare--most people on Medicare are from middle-income families. \nWe need to protect Medicare for the future. That is why, again, I get \nvery concerned when I hear what we have heard over the last hour in the \ndiscussions, because one of the principal reasons we need to bring this \nbill forward on the floor of the Senate tonight is to strengthen \nMedicare, to make sure it is there for the future, to make sure it \nstays strong, and to make sure we expand benefits, as we do under this \nbill.\n  I thank the Senator because those of us who have heard Senator \nKennedy speak on the floor of the Senate know how sorely missed he is \nhere, and we are proud you are representing that vote here on the floor \nof the Senate tonight.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland very much.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I also see \nthe Senator from Rhode Island in the Chamber. Rhode Island is a State \nthat has one of the highest unemployment rates right now in the \ncountry, and it certainly is a State that would welcome this kind of \nreform. And also on the issue we have been talking about, Medicare, the \nSenator from Rhode Island has long fought for seniors.\n  As to Medicare, as has been pointed out, if we do nothing, it is \ngoing to go in the red by 2017. The seniors I know who are 65 want to \nlive to be 95 and still have Medicare. People who are in their fifties \nwant to make sure Medicare is there for them when they are 65. That is \nwhy it is so important we make these smart reforms, to raise the \nquality of the care, and to make sure we preserve and save Medicare. \nAnd that is what this bill is about.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I want \nto add my comments to that of the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom Delaware to commend the new Senator from Massachusetts. He not \nonly carries on the great work of Ted Kennedy, but he does it with the \nsame passion and eloquence.\n  What struck me in this legislation--and reminiscent of Senator \nKennedy--is that this legislation will provide real help to real \npeople. It is about solutions, not slogans.\n  Let me illuminate, if I may. Premium relief. What is troubling so \nmany middle-class families? They are too wealthy to qualify for direct \npublic assistance in terms of the Medicaid Program, but they are not \nwealthy enough to pay for insurance.\n  This legislation will cap family outlays on medical insurance \npremiums. Families making under $88,000 will pay no more than 10 \npercent of their income on premiums. They will be given direct \nassistance through the tax system. There will be a rebate. So people \nnow, rather than staring at 20 percent, 15 percent, 18 percent \nincreases, will at least know there is a cap. And perhaps if we do our \nwork well enough, the whole system will begin to reduce below the 10-\npercent mark, and everyone will benefit.\n  It is also notable that real families worry about many things. They \nworry about educating their children. They want them to be educated, \nbut they also recognize as full-time students in higher education, they \ncan stay on the family health care plan. It is interesting to note that \ndecisions made about education are tied into health care, and also, in \nfact, as to where you work, if you should keep your job you do not like \nbecause you have health\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\ncare or go on, whether you strike out to start a new business because \nyou have this brilliant idea or stay in your current position because \nthere is health care there. But what this bill does, again, is provide \nreal help for real people and allows families to keep their children on \ntheir health care plan until they are 26 years old.\n\n  It also reforms dramatically the insurance system. Again, we listen \nto many of the complaints: Oh, we don't want a government-run health \ncare system; we don't want bureaucrats telling us what to do. The \nirony, of course, as you mentioned, and Senator Schumer did, too, is \nthat one of the most popular health care programs in this country is \nMedicare, which is government run. One of the other most popular health \ncare programs in this country is run through the Veterans' \nAdministration, which is a government agency. The least popular \nprograms are private health insurance, where everyone has complaints--\ndoctors, patients, providers. This legislation will prevent lifetime \nlimits that insurance companies dictate. It will also do many other \nthings.\n  So let me conclude because I appreciate very much--and if the time \nallows, I have a question for the Senator from Massachusetts. But this \nis a bill that when you move past all of the rhetorical smokescreens--\nbecause, frankly, most of our colleagues on the other side don't want \nto do anything. They didn't want to do it in 1993 and 1994; they didn't \nwant to do it in 1933 and 1935; and they still don't want to do it--\nthis legislation helps real people with solutions not slogans about \nnationalization and bureaucrats.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I was presiding yesterday for I don't know how many \nhours. When you listen to what is said on the Senate floor by the other \nside, they are talking about a model where there is no competition. Any \ntax on an insurance company is going to be passed on to the consumer. \nWhat kind of a business--I don't know anybody in business who, if they \nget an increase in cost, they just pass it on to the consumer. Right? I \nmean, we have a law of supply and demand the last time I checked. But \nevery single one got up and talked about the cost and said this is \ngoing to hurt the consumer. It is not going to hurt the insurance \ncompanies because they are just going to pass it on to us. The reason \nthey are going to pass it on to us is kind of obvious.\n  Here is a list, a small list, that lists all the States in America \nand how much of their insurance is tied up in two or less companies. Do \nyou know what you have to do? You have to get down to No. 40, Oregon, \nbecause the first 39 States on this list, two insurance companies make \nup over 50 percent of the market in their State. How can you have \ncompetition when you have so much of the business tied up in just one \nentity?\n  The way you can tell there is not competition? You don't have to have \nan advanced degree in economics to figure out there is no competition. \nHow do you know there is no competition? Every January, my premiums go \nup. The only other thing I know that I get that goes up every January \nis my cable bill, right? There is no competition in cable. You either \ntake cable or you don't. They say there is competition. So every year, \nwhether it is January, February, or March my cable bill goes up. And \nevery year, just like clockwork, my health insurance premiums go up. So \nclearly, there is not competition.\n  That is why a public option is so important. We have to have a public \noption so there is competition not only in the top 39 States where one \nfirm has over 50 percent--two firms have over 50 percent of the \nbusiness--but in all 50 States.\n  That is what this bill does. It is amazing to think on the other \nside, the support they have for competition, and I believe they do and \nI know them and I respect them and they all are concerned about \ncompetition--except every once in a while they kind of turn a blind eye \nto the fact of how powerful competition is. Competition is valuable and \npowerful in keeping costs down and increasing benefits and quality of \ncare--only when there is actually competition. So we are going to have \nto have competition. This bill will actually do it.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator will yield, I think we have been joined \nby the Senator from North Carolina, who is a member of the HELP \nCommittee and I know has a background in business and understands a \nlittle bit about competition.\n  So how does she see this as being a problem? I know in the State of \nthe Senator from Maryland there is limited competition, and in a number \nof our States one or two providers--Minnesota is an exception, but one \nor two providers dominate the market, jacking up the prices.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I think one of the key points is the fact that this bill \nis going to eliminate discrimination based on gender and preexisting \nconditions. I have two children right now who are in their midtwenties. \nMy daughter is paying more per month for health insurance than her \nbrother. Yet it is the exact same policy. The same with preexisting \nconditions. How many people do we know who have a condition such as \ndiabetes or asthma, or a woman who has had a C-section who is, \ntherefore, denied from getting health insurance? We have to be sure we \ncorrect this, and that is what this bill does.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. So many people in North Carolina I \nhave heard from have some of these situations. Recently, I got an e-\nmail from a family in Greensboro. It is a working family. The husband \nhas Graves disease, which is a treatable condition, but he can't obtain \nhealth insurance because of this condition. Without health insurance, \nhis life is gravely in danger. He repeatedly uses the emergency room \nfor care.\n  To make matters worse, he has a 2-year-old son who has hemophilia and \nhas to be taken to the emergency room every time he bumps his head, \nwhich sometimes can cost, for a 2-day supply of medicine, $4,600. The \nfamily makes too much money to qualify for Medicaid and, obviously, \nwith these preexisting conditions, health insurance is way out of reach \nfor them. It is heartbreaking for this family. What the father has \ndecided to do is to purchase life insurance instead of trying to get \nhealth insurance, and he is 29 years old.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator will yield, I think what the people \nwill be shocked to find out is that I think in eight States domestic \nabuse is actually a preexisting condition. You talk about gender \ndiscrimination. If a woman is a victim of domestic abuse, she will \nbasically not be able to get certain insurance policies. Is that right?\n  Mrs. HAGAN. That is right. In all but 12 States, insurance companies \nare currently permitted to charge women more than men for the exact \nsame policies.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator will yield for a moment, as Senator \nKlobuchar pointed out, if you don't have competition--and Senator \nKaufman said the same thing--if you don't have competition, what is \nyour choice? You are going to have to pay the premium.\n  There was a Washington Post article written about a street in \nGaithersburg. Gaithersburg is a growing suburban community not far from \nhere, certainly middle-class families. They think they are doing fairly \nwell. It talked about one street in Gaithersburg, and they gave half a \ndozen stories about people--real stories--about people having problems \nwith our current system. They talk about Patty, who has private \ninsurance and thought she was in good shape. She talks about having to \nsearch a book in order to find out what doctor she could go to to stay \nin the network because it is too expensive to go out of network, and \nthen she hits her deductible and finds that her fees and copayments \ncome in fast and strange, making it unaffordable for her with her \ncurrent insurance coverage. She has no other choice. That is the only \ninsurance she can get.\n  Two doors down the road is Chuck who needs oxygen, needs certain \nmedicines. He had to fight with his insurance company to get the \nprescription drug covered. He got the prescription drug covered, only \nto find out the nurse who administered the drug was not covered, and it \ncost $400--another problem with a private insurance company.\n  Across the courtyard, Will and Sarah, they have insurance today. They \nare going to lose it because he\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\njust lost his job, and he has no prospect for being able to afford \ninsurance.\n\n  The last one is Martha. This is a very interesting one. Martha went \nto the emergency room for delivery of her child. She needed an \nepidural. She made sure she went to a hospital that was in-network \nbecause she wanted to make sure it was covered. Guess what. That \nanesthesiologist she had no control over was not in-network and she had \nto pay all that extra money. Again, no choice. She had no choice in the \nsystem. There is no competition.\n  I know we have Senator Kirk here who is our newest Member. Perhaps \nthe Senator could tell us what he is hearing from Massachusetts. He is \na new Member here. I don't know whether he is getting the same stories \nof what is happening in his State.\n  Mr. KIRK. Well, it is exactly the same story, with one exception, I \nwould say to the Senator from Maryland, which is that 3 years ago, \nMassachusetts adopted its own health reform. Now, 97 percent of the \npeople in Massachusetts are covered with health insurance.\n  As you have said and as the Senator from Rhode Island has said, the \nbest illustrations of the need for health reform are the individuals, \nthe real people. So I will tell my colleagues a story about a young \nlady. She is a waitress, a 24-year-old girl. Her name is Jessica \nWheeler from Somerville, MA. She is a waitress and works part time as \nan intern. She had dreams of graduate school, but she was concerned \nabout health insurance. We have an exchange in Massachusetts not \ndissimilar to what is being offered in this legislation where there is \nincreased competition from private insurers and others. She applied to \nthe exchange and was found eligible and enrolled and took out an \ninsurance plan.\n  Shortly after, she was stricken gravely ill with organ failure and \nwas hospitalized for an extended period of time. She was made well. She \nhas to take a pill every day in order to keep up with her condition, \nbut her coverage was complete. She has applied now to graduate school, \nand although she probably has her tuition issues stretching her means \nand so forth, she is free of the concern and need of expensive health \ncare bills; otherwise, she would have been without. So it is just \nanother illustration.\n  Just one other point on competition that keeps coming back and back, \nI ask myself: Why do middle-class families save their hard-earned money \nto buy health insurance? Obviously, the answer is so that they will \nhave coverage if they get sick. Without competition, I will tell you \nwhat is going on. Insurance companies--now get this--are denying \ncoverage because people are sick or they say: Well, you reached a \ncertain limit, and we didn't realize you were going to get that sick, \nso we dropped the coverage.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator could yield, I have exactly the same \nkind of example where someone wants to buy coverage, they are willing \nto pay for some coverage, but they can't. They basically are cut out \nbecause they are sick.\n  This is one of the saddest letters. We just got this from Cheryl from \nBemidji, MN. She says:\n\n       I am writing to you because I just got off the phone with \n     my daughter Mickey. At first I couldn't understand her \n     because she was sobbing so hard. Her husband had just been \n     told by his boss that they wouldn't be carrying health \n     insurance on their employees any longer. They are a small \n     company in northern Minnesota and it was costing them $13,000 \n     a month. For her, for my daughter, this is a matter of life \n     and death. She has cystic fibrosis. Because it is a \n     preexisting condition, the insurance companies won't touch \n     her unless it is under a group plan such as the one her \n     husband just lost.\n\n  She says:\n\n       You need to stand and be my voice, be Mickey's voice. \n     Mickey is a fighter, but she can't keep fighting a system \n     that is so against her. Mickey has already lived longer than \n     any of the doctors expected. I want her to live to see her 5-\n     year-old son become President one day.\n\n  That is from a mom in Bemidji, MN.\n  So I will just ask my colleagues, how can we continue to go down this \npath where hardworking families--a man who has a job, who is working \nfor a small business, gets cut off from his insurance, and because his \nwife has cystic fibrosis, they aren't going to be able to afford \ninsurance.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I think the reason we use these examples so much is \nbecause certain words kind of roll off your lips; words such as \n``preexisting condition.''\n  Here is an example involving Angela in Dover, and she is a bartender, \nnot a waitress. Her income is from tips. She has no health insurance \nthrough her employer. She became pregnant. She tried to find private \nhealth insurance, but she was declined coverage because pregnancy was \nconsidered a preexisting condition.\n  Now, just do a visual for a minute. This woman has been living off of \ntips. She is about to have a baby, and there is nowhere she can go to \nget health insurance. She applied for Medicaid to find prenatal care \nfor herself and her baby, was denied coverage because she earned $200 \nmore than the monthly income limit. I mean, just picture this now, if \nyou were in this situation. She called organizations and clinics and \nwas unable to find a payment plan she could afford.\n  Midway through her pregnancy, Angela decided to cut back her work \nhours so she could qualify for Medicaid. She worked all 9 months of her \npregnancy and delivered the baby on May 27. The Medicaid coverage she \ngot was especially crucial because she had complications with \nhyperthyroidism and was able to get the necessary prescriptions to \ncontrol her condition.\n  OK. Do we have the picture? How would we like to see ourselves with \nour spouses or our kids with this kind of a decision? The sad part of \nthe story, as if it is not sad enough, is that Angela was so anxious to \nensure that everything possible was done for a healthy baby and the \nsystem threw up roadblocks. Pregnancy should not be considered a \npreexisting condition.\n  People in this country who are pregnant should not have to worry, in \naddition to going through the trauma of being pregnant for 9 months and \nthe baby being healthy and all the fears you have and on top of that \nfear they may go into bankruptcy because they cannot afford to pay for \nthe doctor bills for their baby. This is real stark to me.\n  We are going to vote tonight on cloture so we can move to a bill that \nwill, once and for all, make sure Angela Austin and all the women \nsimilar to her who have the ``preexisting condition'' of pregnancy will \nonly have to worry about their baby and what is going to happen to her \nand not worry about what she is going to do when the child is 2 and she \nis in bankruptcy, because so many people are going into bankruptcy.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Maybe the Senators can answer this. In these thousands \nof letters and calls we get from these people, they are asking us to be \ntheir voice. They don't want to say we are not going to debate this \nbill at all, that we are going to put it in a drawer and pretend it \ndidn't exist.\n  Mr. CARDIN. That is the interesting point. These are all real \nstories, people who are being denied health care today because of \narbitrary practices from private insurance companies or the way our \nsystem is currently organized.\n  The vote tonight is a pretty simple vote. If you think the current \nsystem is what you want, OK, I understand why you are voting against \ncloture. I understand that you say the status quo is fine; we don't \neven want to debate the issue; we don't care about the people who have \nbeen affected by the arbitrary actions of private insurance companies \nand saying that pregnancy and childbirth is a ``preexisting condition'' \nor when you are using over-the-counter drugs to keep your cholesterol \nunder control and the insurance company says that was a preexisting \ncondition.\n  All we are saying tonight is: Is this worthy of debate on the floor \nof the Senate--a clear vote? Those who vote for cloture say this is \nworthy. The people who have written us these letters are entitled to \nhave the Senate take up this issue. That is why we point out that there \nare numerous groups, including the American Medical Association, that \nsay vote for cloture, let's have this debate before the American \npeople.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Along those lines, before I yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I started out talking about the cost issue. I wanted to \nput in the Record the statement of November 5, 2009, from the Mayo \nClinic. There have been things said about their position.\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nMy friends on the other side have said they ``don't want any part of \nthis bill'' and they ``want nothing to do with it.'' Those are exact \nquotes. They said they ``are not taking Medicare and Medicaid patients \nanymore.''\n  Those are exact quotes. They are all incorrect. I will put this in \nthe Record. It is dated November 5, 2009. ``Points of Agreement and \nDivergence.'' They say:\n\n       We are encouraged by much--including provisions to pay for \n     value in health care, an insurance exchange, individual \n     mandate, subsidies for people to achieve coverage, and pilot \n     projects on accountable care organizations and bundling of \n     payments.\n\n  To be fair, they also say they are ``concerned about other areas \nincluding a public option that is based on Medicare rates. . . .''\n  As you know, the options in the House and Senate bills are not based \non Medicare rates but negotiated rates. They are concerned about the \nlong timeline for implementation of value provisions, as I am. They are \nconcerned about across-the-board cuts for providers. They neither \nendorse nor support the bill. To say they don't want any part of the \nbill is false.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     A Perspective on Current Health Reform Issues From Mayo Clinic\n\n\n            Reform Bills: Points of Agreement and Divergence\n\n       As the House and Senate prepare to bring their final bills \n     to their respective floors, Mayo Clinic would like to \n     highlight the areas of agreement and divergence in the bills \n     and our positions on health care reform. We are encouraged by \n     much--including provisions to pay for value in health care, \n     an insurance exchange, individual mandate, subsidies for \n     people to achieve coverage, and pilot projects on accountable \n     care organizations and bundling of payments.\n       At this juncture, Mayo Clinic will neither endorse nor \n     oppose entire bills in the House or Senate, but will continue \n     to point out provisions that we think move the country toward \n     patient-centered health care and areas where we have \n     concerns.\n       While many provisions in the bill are aligned with our \n     recommendations, Mayo Clinic remains concerned about other \n     areas including a public option that is based on Medicare \n     rates, the long timeline for implementation of pay for value \n     provisions and across the board cuts to providers.\n       It is critically important that we accelerate the timeline \n     to adjust the Medicare payment system to pay for value in \n     order to truly bend the cost curve--especially in light of \n     the growing number of baby boomers reaching retirement age.\n       These payment reform provisions should not lag behind \n     expanding coverage to more Americans. In any event, we must \n     focus on ensuring the financial viability of health care for \n     the long term to ensure that patients have access to quality \n     care across the country.\n\n\n  Support House IOM Study of High Value Care and Geographic Variation\n\n       Mayo Clinic supports the provision that was added to the \n     House bill that will charge the Institute of Medicine to \n     study and design new payment methodologies to build value and \n     address geographic variation into the Medicare payment \n     system. The proposal is consistent with Mayo Clinic's focus \n     on creating a mechanism to better define value, measure it, \n     and create new payment methodologies that reward it.\n       Most of us, as patients or family members, don't stop to \n     think that our doctors and hospitals are generally paid more \n     for doing more tests and procedures--whether or not we need \n     it. Take for example, the story of a patient eventually seen \n     here at Mayo Clinic:\n       An older gentleman went to an emergency room because he \n     fainted. A CT scan of the heart was done and showed \n     calcification. Urgent heart catheterization was recommended \n     and then bypass surgery was performed. Later, when a stress \n     test was done, an abnormality was found and a second heart \n     catheterization showed a complication--one bypass was \n     blocked. Stents were placed in the heart artery where \n     the bypass was blocked. However, the fainting spells \n     continued. With his issue unresolved, the patient came to \n     Mayo Clinic, where we conducted a lengthy assessment by a \n     team of physicians. It was determined that all he needed \n     was an adjustment of his medications. In the end, the \n     tests, stents, and surgery performed at the other facility \n     were not needed, did nothing to help the patient, but were \n     paid for by Medicare. On the other side, the additional \n     office time spent at Mayo to fully assess patient's \n     situation and ensure proper diagnosis and treatment was \n     not covered by Medicare.\n       Doctors and hospitals are usually paid more for doing more \n     tests, visits, hospital admissions, and surgeries rather than \n     spending time with the patient and assessing their individual \n     needs. What if instead, the system rewarded doctors and \n     hospitals for spending time with patients, for doing a \n     procedure successfully, for the fact that you leave the \n     hospital without a fall or infection, and for providing \n     excellent service to you while you were under their care.\n\n\n      Support Cantwell Amendment to Incentivize Value in Medicare\n\n       We support a similar provision in the Senate Finance \n     Committee bill introduced by Sen. Cantwell that will help \n     move Medicare in the direction of paying for value by \n     creating a value modifier for physician payments that will \n     create incentives around value in the Medicare physician \n     payment formula.\n\n\n               Insurance Reform that Gives Access to All\n\n       We believe coverage can be achieved without creating or \n     expanding a government-run, price-controlled, Medicare-like \n     insurance model. A public option that employs a true \n     negotiated rate process is better than a system based on \n     Medicare rates. However, we are concerned that the exchange \n     could be opened to large employers, which could result in a \n     large shift from private to public insurance plans.\n       We support reforms to the current insurance system that \n     eliminate pre-existing condition exclusions, and create an \n     individual mandate where individuals can purchase private \n     insurance in various ways:\n       Through employers,\n       On the individual market,\n       Through co-operatives, or\n       Through an exchange model like the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefit Plan (FEHBP).\n       We also believe that the government should help people \n     afford the insurance through sliding scale subsidies as \n     needed.\n\n\n       Encouraged by Accountable Care Organization Pilot Project\n\n       Mayo Clinic is encouraged by provisions in the House and \n     Senate bills that allow groups of providers who voluntarily \n     meet certain statutory criteria, including quality \n     measurements, to be recognized as Accountable Care \n     Organizations (ACOs) and to be eligible to share in the cost-\n     savings they achieve for the Medicare program. Both houses \n     propose to start an ACO pilot program January 1, 2012.\n       Mayo Clinic believes that under this approach, a group of \n     physicians would be responsible for quality and overall \n     annual Medicare spending for their patients. \n     Different payment models could be tested. For example, \n     physicians would be paid FFS rates, less a withhold, and \n     then receive bonuses for meeting resources use and quality \n     targets over the course of a year. Options should include \n     creating virtual accountable care organizations based on \n     physician-hospital referral relationships. Such an \n     approach would create incentives for physicians and \n     hospitals to work together to provide better value care.\n\n\n                Bundling Payments Can Help Contain Costs\n\n       Both the House and Senate bills have provisions to test a \n     system of bundling payments for Medicare Parts A and B. We \n     are pleased with the pilot projects on Medicare payment \n     bundling. However, we would like to see a more aggressive \n     implementation timetable--not one that starts in 2014 or \n     later, but finishes by 2014--so that we can see more \n     immediate financial results for the Medicare system.\n       To realize cost savings quickly, Mayo Clinic believes \n     Medicare should start bundled payments for high-cost hospital \n     episodes such as total knee replacement, heart attack, and \n     lumbar disc herniation. Over time, bundled payments could be \n     considered for some chronic conditions as well. The bundled \n     payment should include hospitalization (Part A), physician \n     (Part B) and post-acute care (nursing home, home health care, \n     etc.) services. The outcome would be defined as reasonably \n     attainable improvement in health status in the safest, most \n     cost-effective way and would cover the entire episode of care \n     through the patient's return to function.\n       The goal is to reduce practice variation and focus on an \n     outcome-based goal. Such a reformed payment model would \n     encourage improved coordination of care among physicians, \n     hospitals and nursing homes, and it would encourage \n     utilization of nursing and other non-physician caregivers.\n\n\n    CMS Innovation Center to Enhance Quality, Improve Patient Safety\n\n       Mayo Clinic also supports the proposal in the Senate \n     Finance Committee bill that calls for the HHS Secretary to \n     create an Innovation Center within the CMS. The Innovation \n     Center will be authorized to test, evaluate, and expand \n     different payment structures and methodologies which aim to \n     foster patient-centered care, improve quality, and slow the \n     rate of Medicare cost growth. The provision calls for \n     promoting improved quality and reduced cost by developing a \n     collaborative of high-quality, low-cost health care \n     institutions. The collaborative would develop best practices \n     and proven care methods in improved quality and efficiency, \n     as well as assist other health care institutions on how best \n     to employ such best practices and proven care methods.\n\n\n           Independent Commission to Extend Medicare Solvency\n\n       The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes a provision \n     to establish a 15-member Independent Medicare Commission to \n     develop and submit proposals to Congress aimed at extending \n     the Medicare program's solvency and improving its quality. \n     Each year, beginning in 2013, the Medicare Actuary's Office \n     would make projections about\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\n     whether Medicare's per-capita spending growth rate in two \n     years will exceed a targeted rate. In years when Medicare \n     costs are projected to be unsustainable, the Commission's \n     proposals will take effect unless Congress passes an \n     alternative measure.\n       Mayo Clinic believes that this commission can insulate many \n     health care decisions from direct political influence in \n     Congress while still being accountable to Congress. We also \n     believe that the commission should have the authority to \n     change the health care payment system with the goal to move \n     away from fee-for-service medicine and toward paying for \n     team-based, coordinated care.\n       In addition to payment reform, the commission could serve \n     as a trusted national data aggregator, making performance and \n     pricing information publically available so that stakeholders \n     can identify best practices and high performers.\n       This perspective is written by Jeffrey O. Korsmo, Executive \n     Director, Mayo Clinic Health Policy Center; and Bruce Kelly, \n     Director of Government Relations, Mayo Clinic.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. I know time is running short. I want to say one thing about \nthis. We have heard talk about the status quo. Make no mistake, this is \na situation with respect to--we assume when we hear the words ``status \nquo'' that things will remain as they are.\n  In the area of health care and health insurance, things are not going \nto remain where they are. The status quo is not the status quo. We \neither move forward or we fall back. If we don't address or at least \ndebate the merits of the bill and don't move it forward, we all know \nwhat is going to happen. The figures are there. The average family \npremium, which is now over $13,000, in 2016 will double to $24,000. \nThat is not the status quo. That is falling back. Similarly, the number \nof uninsured will rise from 47 million today to 54 million in 2014. \nThat is not the status quo. That is falling back. Fourteen-thousand \npeople will continue to be dropped from coverage each day. That is not \nthe status quo. That is falling back. I could go on.\n  There is a reason this bill needs to be debated. It is because the \naverage middle-class working family deserves and needs health care \nsecurity and financial stability. This bill will bring them that. At \nleast I hope that the Members of the Senate--all 100--would say that, \non the merits, this bill and this need should be debated.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator \nfrom North Carolina is here. I know the people of North Carolina and \nthe people in the South have concerns about the current state of \naffairs in health care as well.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Yes. A lot of what we have been talking about are people \nwho don't have health insurance and who want it enhanced because of \npreexisting conditions. We have people who are sick and stuck with \nhealth insurance.\n  I received an e-mail from a young North Carolinian who works for \nAmeriCorps. She was the valedictorian of her high school class. She \nsuffers from a brain abscess. Her illness has put her into debt for the \nrest of her life. She has health insurance, but it ran out when she hit \na $50,000 cap. Her bills far exceed the cap. It is sinking her entire \nfamily into debt. She is sick and stuck.\n  How many people do we know who have a spouse or themselves who have \nhealth insurance, and they are working, but they cannot switch jobs \nbecause they would lose their health insurance? I have a good friend \nwhose husband has cancer. She wants to change jobs, but she cannot do \nit because of the condition of her husband. Once again, people are sick \nand they are stuck. We have to be sure we can have a debate, that we \ncan move forward on health care reform so we can help people.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. We are all concerned about the economy. Even with health \ncare reform, I think for every Senator I talk to on both sides of the \naisle, their biggest problem is getting people back to work again and \ngetting the economy moving. It is truly tragic when you think so many \npeople are losing their jobs. Under our present system, the way it is \nstructured, when you lose your job, you not only lose the money coming \nin to you, you lose your health insurance. You lose your self-respect \nbecause we are all judged on where we work. That is how people judge \nus.\n  As has been said, the longest walk is the walk home to tell your \nspouse and your kids that you lost your job. The irony of ironies and \nthe thing that makes this so incredible is that you don't just lose \nyour job and self-respect, you lose your health care insurance.\n  We have a system, and we have to change the system so these people \nout their right now can maintain their health care insurance and care \nfor their children and their families, as they and everybody in their \nfamilies go through this very traumatic experience.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We are running out of time, with only a few more minutes \nleft. I want the people in Maryland and of the Nation to understand \nwhat this vote means. We are going to bring an amendment to the floor \nof the Senate for debate. Any Senator will be able to offer an \namendment to how we should advance health care. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is absolutely correct. We are either going to continue to \nsee our health care system with more people being denied coverage, with \nthe costs escalating much faster than our economic growth, with \nbusinesses having to decide to terminate plans--that is what is going \nto happen--or we can take up health care reform and try to rein in the \npractices of private insurance companies and provide a way where every \nAmerican can get access to affordable health care. That is why the \nAmerican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network says:\n\n       The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network urges all \n     Senators to vote in favor of allowing critical health care \n     legislation introduced by Senator Harry Reid this week to be \n     debated on the Senate floor. With thousands of cancer \n     patients being denied coverage, charged excessive premiums, \n     and facing exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, it is urgent that \n     the Senate take action now, not later, to protect and extend \n     health coverage to millions of Americans in need.\n\n  Last week, Cynthia and Eric Cathcart were here in the Senate. They \nare two people who are self-employed. They cannot even get an insurance \npolicy to cover their family. They have to have two separate policies, \nwith two deductibles and two premiums, and they cannot afford it. We \nmust take up this issue for the Cathcarts and the millions of Americans \nwho cannot make it under this current system. Middle-income families \nare depending upon us tonight.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. There is a lot of talk about Medicare and our seniors \nand what this bill does. Think of the woman I talked about who is a \nfighter, as her mom says, but she cannot keep fighting a system that is \nso against her. As you pointed out, the advantage of this bill is, it \ngives our seniors a better playing field with the drug companies paying \nfor their drugs in the doughnut hole. Also, it is my understanding that \nAARP wants to advance the bill. Certainly, AARP has stood up for \nseniors for years and years and years. They know we need to preserve \nMedicare and keep it safe.\n  Can the Senator comment on AARP?\n  Mr. CARDIN. AARP not only wants us to advance the bill; they support \nthe bill. They believe this bill will improve the Medicare system, make \nit stronger, and provide additional benefits, particularly in reducing \nthe dread Medicare doughnut hole. They want the Members of the Senate \nto vote to allow this bill to come to the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Maybe we should end with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the home State of Ted Kennedy, having the last word of \nthis very interesting colloquy, in which we heard from the Senators \nfrom North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Maryland.\n  Mr. KIRK. I thank the Senator. I am honored to be a Senator in this \nbody. Back home, they think I am the 60th vote. I would like to believe \nwe would have a more enlightened full body and that 60 would be a \nnumber we would pass through.\n  The American people are looking forward to debate on this issue. I \nthink they believe they deserve many of the aspects that are contained \nin the bill. On behalf of my constituents in Massachusetts and those \nwho, for so many years, revered and loved and elected and reelected \nSenator Kennedy--I think they all, as we do, have him in our minds and \nhearts tonight, and we hope we can advance this bill to the American \npeople, knowing his spirit and years of work are a reminder of our \nobligation.\n  I hope we will have a successful vote this evening. That will provide \nan opportunity for the American people to\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\nhear a debate and perhaps allow corrections by whatever amendments may \nbe needed, so we proceed, keeping in mind, as is true in all \nlegislation, we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. The \ngood is something our people have been waiting for, for decades. The \ntime is now. Let the debate begin.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator. I believe our hour has ended. We \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that during the next hour, those \nSenators who come to the floor may be allowed to proceed in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I came to the floor early so I could listen to what my \nDemocratic friends have had to say. I found it quite enlightening, and \nI have a few comments with respect to it.\n  They have been debating vigorously against the status quo. They have \nbeen giving us examples, heart-tugging, real-life examples of people \nwho are finding difficult problems in the situation as it now exists--\nas if the debate were between the status quo and doing something.\n  The debate is between the solution that has been offered by the \nmajority leader and other solutions, which people on this side of the \naisle have been trying to bring forward through the entire time and \nhave not been allowed to come forward.\n  We recognize that things need to be done to fix problems with respect \nto the health care situation. We realize the legislation we have been \nliving with for all these years needs to be amended. We have been \nunable to get any of our ideas to come forward. Now we are told there \nis such urgency to deal with the status quo that we must pass this \nbill, and we must pass it virtually without amendment.\n  I would like to point out, as I have done before, if there is such \nurgency with respect to the challenges we have in health care, why do \nwe wait until 2014 to have those changes come? We have heard all these \nexamples coming on the Democratic side of the aisle of people who have \nterrible problems under their health care plan. We must act, we must \nact immediately, and the act will be to say to all of these people: We \nwill solve your problem in 2014. We will delay all of these reforms we \nare talking about until 2014.\n  I made that point the other day, and the Senator from Maryland said, \nno, some parts of this bill will begin immediately. And he is exactly \nright. The parts of the bill that would begin immediately are the \ntaxes. We will start taking in money in 2010 if this bill passes. The \nannual pharmaceutical manufacturers fee would drive up the price of \neverybody's drugs, an annual nondeductible $2.3 billion fee. That will \nbegin in 2010. The medical device manufacturers fee, another $2 \nbillion, will begin in 2010. The medical insurance provider fee, that \nwill begin in 2010. The cosmetic surgery fee, that will begin in 2010. \nIn 2011, there will be a limit on contributions and in 2013 a high-cost \ninsurance excise tax. All the taxes are front-loaded, but all of the \nreforms they promise this bill will bring to all of the people whose \nstories they told us will not take place until 2014. The status for \nthem will remain quo. For all of these attacks on the status quo, the \none change we will get is they will start charging the taxes but they \nwill not start delivering any kind of health care reform until 2014.\n  Why are we delaying until 2014? Not because they do not think people \nneed it but because they realize that if they start spending at the \nsame time they start taxing, the score they will get out of the \nCongressional Budget Office will point out the true cost of this bill. \nAnd it is the true cost of this bill that is the kind of thing we need \nto be debating and talking about rather than listing story after story. \nMy State is full of them, and I am just as sympathetic as anybody of \npeople who have problems with the present health care system. That is a \nfalse debate.\n  We all realize, all 100 of us realize that something has to be done \nto make the health care system better. This is not, should we do \nnothing; this is a debate about what should be done. The proposal we \nhave from the majority leader is not the answer to the problems we \nface.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if I may interrupt to ask, when the \nSenator said this is not the approach, the approach taken by the \nDemocratic leader, among other things, because of the cost of it--my \ncolleague from Arizona is here, and I think no one takes second place \nin this body to him in carefully looking at the cost of every bill we \nhave on this floor. He frequently proposes amendments to reduce the \ncost of the bills.\n  I wonder if my colleague from Arizona agrees with my colleague from \nUtah and is aware of the respected columnist David Broder who wrote in \ntoday's Washington Post--actually, it is for publication tomorrow--a \ncolumn, the title of which is ``A Budget Buster in the Making.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, not only is David \nBroder's column this morning important, but he is probably the most \nrespected columnist in America. He talks about it in far more eloquent \nterms than I can.\n  I ask my friend from Arizona--a very unusual event happened today. \nThe majority leader, I guess proceeding on the concept, the age-old \ntried tactic of ``shoot the messenger,'' came to the floor of the \nSenate and excoriated David Broder, of all people, probably the most \nrespected columnist. I might say, Mr. Broder from time to time has \nwritten an article or two or more that has been critical of me, but he \nalways had my respect. For the majority leader, who cannot rebut the \nfacts in David Broder's column, to come to the floor and excoriate one \nof the most respected columnists in America is remarkable.\n  One of the things, I say to my friend from Utah, is that I do not \nthink Americans really understand the scam that is going on here of \nbeginning to collect taxes. Tax increases and Medicare cuts of \napproximately $1 trillion begin 40 days from now. In other words, on \nthe first of January, according to this plan, Americans will begin \nexperiencing cuts in Medicare and increases in taxes, 40 days from now. \nBut then it will be 208 weeks and 1,460 days before any benefits from \nthe legislation come about.\n  Tell me, isn't that like a couple goes to buy a house and they say: \nOK, you can have the house for X amount. And by the way, you have to \nstart making the payments now and for the next 4 years before you can \nmove into the house. Is there anybody who would agree that is nothing \nbut a scam on the American people? I do not think the American people \ntruly understand the reason why--and why would they do that? To \ndisguise the real cost of this $2.5 trillion bill. That is why they do \nit. I think Bernie Madoff went to jail for this kind of behavior.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to my friend from Arizona, he reminds me of a \nreal-life experience of a husband who at Christmastime came back to his \nwife and presented her with a brilliant Christmas present that she had \nnot been expecting. She said to her husband: How could we afford this \nbecause the only amount we had in our Christmas budget was--pick a \nnumber--$200, and this is obviously worth more than $200.\n  He said: Oh, don't worry about it. I paid $200 for it.\n  She said: How in the world did you get $200?\n  He said: The department store agreed to take the other $1,000 in \npayments later on.\n  That is exactly what is happening here. We are making a downpayment \nand telling ourselves that the total cost is covered as outlined by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, it is so important that we read this hernia-\ninducing bill, that we understand the details of it. Specifically in \nthese cuts, which are going to take place in 40 days--40 days from now; \nHappy New Year, America--in 40 days, it will cut $135 billion from \nhospitals, it will cut $120 billion from 11 million seniors on Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  I would like to pause there for a moment. Senator Kyl and I represent \nthe State of Arizona. We have thousands and thousands--and I am going \nto get the number before this debate is over--of seniors who are on \nMedicare Advantage. They are going to cut out the Medicare Advantage \nProgram and tell the American people that if you like your insurance \npolicy you have, you can keep it? How does that work? Then\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\nthere is $15 billion going to be cut from nursing homes, $40 billion \nfrom home health agencies, and $8 billion is going to be cut from \nhospice care--my God, hospice care, $8 billion.\n  Here we are telling the American people that we are going to fix \nhealth care in America, and the way we are going to pay for the massive \ngovernment takeover of health care is through cuts. It is terrible on \nits face, but does anybody really believe these cuts are going to take \nplace? Does anybody really believe the doctors are going to be cut $247 \nbillion in the next 10 years? Does anybody believe we are going to cut \n$247 billion--or whatever it is--from Medicare? We are not. Why are we \nnot? Because we are a loving, caring nation. We are not going to tell \nour seniors that they are not going to receive a high quality of \nMedicare.\n  Of course, this latest mammogram incident where a board, not unlike \nthe one that is envisioned in this bill, said that women over 40 should \nnot have mammograms--by the way, I have a close friend, Carly Fiorina, \nwho has just recovered from chemotherapy. What would her situation be \ntoday if she had not had a mammogram? Women all over America are rising \nup about it. If you think that is bad, wait until you get this \nlegislation.\n  By the way, while my friends are standing, I would like to say please \nsit down, I have shocking news. The three Senators we were worried \nabout--the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from Arkansas, and the \nSenator from Nebraska--shocking news. They are going to vote for this \nbill to move forward. That was an issue of tremendous speculation with \nthe media. I certainly did not know that with all the protestations we \nhad from those three Senators that, by golly, they were thinking long \nand hard. Guess what. So, OK.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to my friend from Arizona, and then I will yield \nto my friend from Tennessee, Senator McCain just asked a question: Does \nanybody really believe these cuts will take place?\n\n  I share with him an experience I had driving home from the Senate \njust this week. I was listening to the radio, and the first story on \nthe radio was this vote coming up. The Senate is going to vote at 8 \no'clock on Saturday. The second story was that the House of \nRepresentatives just passed a doc fix of $200 billion. So we already \nhave action by the House of Representatives proving that the comment by \nSenator McCain is exactly right. Before this bill even gets passed, \nthey are reversing the cuts over in the House of Representatives. \nSenator Reid tried to do it here before we got to this bill, and we \nvoted him down. So the House is going to take care of it, and they will \nping-pong the bill over here.\n  There is no question that these cuts will not take place.\n  My friend from Tennessee wishes to comment.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Republican leadership in the \nChamber. It seems as if every other word we hear coming from the other \nside is that this vote tonight is historic. I agree, it is historic. \nBut I think my view of why it is historic is a little different from \ntheir view.\n  I wonder if my colleagues would not agree with me that this bill is \nhistoric in its arrogance? It is historic in its arrogance to think \nthat we in Congress are wise enough to take this entire complex health \ncare system, that serves 300 million Americans and is 16 percent of our \neconomy, and think we can write a 2,074-page bill and be wise enough to \nchange it all at once. It is historic in its arrogance by dumping 15 \nmillion low-income Americans into a medical ghetto called Medicaid, \nwhich none of us or any of our families would ever want to be a part of \nfor our health care. It is historic in its arrogance by sending the \nStates, that are going broke, a big chunk of the bill for what we have \njust done. It is historic in its arrogance because it tells Americans \nthat the bill costs $849 billion and then thinks we are not smart \nenough to read the print and figure out that the real cost is $2.5 \ntrillion when it actually is implemented. It is historic in its \narrogance by telling us that paying for reimbursement for physicians is \nnot an important part of a health care bill. It is historic in its \narrogance because it cuts and taxes grandma's Medicare, which according \nto the trustees will be broke by 2015 to 2017, and then spends it on \nsomebody else other than grandma. The bill is arrogant because its \ntelling us it will reduce premiums for most Americans, when, in fact, \nit increases premiums for most Americans.\n  So People say: Where is the Republican health care bill? My answer to \nthat is, don't expect Senator McConnell to come rolling in here with a \nwheelbarrow with a 2,074-page budget-busting, debt-ridden, arrogant \npiece of legislation because that is not what we believe in.\n  What we need to do as a Congress is re-earn the trust of the American \npeople by setting a clear goal of reducing health care costs, showing \nsome humility, and starting to move step by step in that direction. I \nhope during this hour that we have a chance to talk about the specific \nsteps to reduce health care costs that we Republicans have offered day \nafter day to no avail.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I can interrupt my colleague and \ncompliment him on the phrase ``arrogance.'' Maybe ``hubris'' is another \nword. To think we are smart enough in Washington to figure out what is \nbest for 300 million Americans is truly arrogant.\n  A question posed by my colleague from Arizona a moment ago: Do they \nreally think they can whiz this by the American people with regard to \nit not adding to the deficit, for example? Good question.\n  I want to get back to that Broder piece my colleague from Arizona \nquoted. There is actually a survey that answers that question. It turns \nout the American people are pretty smart about this. The question in \nthis Quinnipiac poll read:\n\n       President Obama has pledged that health insurance reform \n     will not add to our Federal budget deficit over the next \n     decade. Do you think that President Obama will be able to \n     keep his promise? Or do you think that any health care plan \n     that Congress passes and President Obama signs will add to \n     the Federal budget deficit?\n       Answer: Less than one-fifth of the voters, 19 percent to be \n     exact, think he will keep his word. Nine out of 10 \n     Republicans, 8 out of 10 independents said that whatever \n     passes will add to the torrent of red ink and by a margin of \n     4 to 3 even Democrats agreed that this is likely.\n\n  That is why, Broder says at the end:\n\n       By a 16 point margin the majority of this poll said that \n     they oppose the legislation moving through Congress.\n\n  So while it is true they are rather arrogantly trying to contend \nthere will not be any big budget deficit from this, the reality is the \nAmerican people have broken the code they will. One of two things will \nhappen. My colleague from Arizona put his finger right on it. Either we \nwill make cuts in Medicare, for example, that we have never had the \npolitical ability to make in the past, in which case our seniors will \nbe hurt, or else, as David Broder said, this bill will truly be a \nbudget buster.\n  Neither of those results are very sanguine outcomes to an attempt to \ntransform or reform our health care.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for an \nobservation?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly share the views of Senator McCain that \nletting these cuts stand is not likely. On the other hand, the \nPresident of the United States said he would veto any measure seeking \nto reverse these cuts. So we have a Hobson's choice: Either the cuts \nwill occur in which case seniors will be devastated or they will not \noccur, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, and the deficit \nwill balloon further.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Did the majority leader happen to notice that the AARP \nhas now endorsed this bill? It has endorsed a bill that will cut \npeople, 300,000 of them in my State, from their Medicare Advantage \nProgram, that would cut $15 billion from nursing homes, that would cut \n$8 billion from hospices, and that AARP, which, by the way, I \nunderstand gets some $60-some million out of this deal--I say to the \nsenior citizens in my State: Take your AARP membership card, cut it in \nhalf, and send it back to AARP because they have betrayed you.\n  Mr. BENNETT. If I could make the comment, Mr. President, among the \npeople who do not believe these changes would not occur is CBO itself. \nCBO itself agrees this is smoke and mirrors. They do it in very polite \nlanguage, but let me share with you the language. They say:\n\n       These longer-term calculations assume that the provisions \n     are enacted and remain unchanged throughout the next 2 \n     decades, which is often not the case for major legislation.\n\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\n\n  That is about as gentle a way as CBO can put it. They don't believe \nthis thing is going to stand without these kinds of changes. Yes, they \nhave come forward because their computers say: You put the numbers in \nthis way, this is the result you get. But human beings are saying that \nis not what is going to happen over the next two decades.\n  Mr. KYL. If my colleague will yield, Broder, in his column as to this \nestimate of budget deficit, he says it depends upon two big gambles.\n\n       Will future Congresses actually impose the assumed $420 \n     billion cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal health \n     care programs? They never have.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, I would like to follow up on what the Senator from \nTennessee has said because, particularly from some quarters on the \nother side of the aisle, we have been attacked: Where is the Republican \nplan?\n  A very important article was written by Robert Samuelson in the \nWashington Post on November 16--again, one of the most respected \neconomists in America.\n  I don't lay off these opinions of my own on them, but the fact is, \nwhen you have highly respected people like Robert Samuelson, one of the \nmost respected economists in America, I quote from his column--the \ntitle is ``Obama Care, Buy Now, Pay Later.'' That is the title of it. \nHe says--which I think is directly in consonance with what the Senator \nfrom Tennessee said:\n\n       [A] prudent society would embark on long-term policies to \n     control health costs, reduce government spending and curb \n     massive future deficits.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       So what do they do? Just the opposite. Their far-reaching \n     overhaul of the health care system--which Congress is halfway \n     toward enacting--would almost certainly make matters worse. \n     It would create new, open-ended medical entitlements that \n     threaten higher deficits and do little to suppress surging \n     health costs. The disconnect between what President Obama \n     says and what he's doing is so glaring that most people could \n     not abide it.\n\n  That is strong language from an economist. I think what the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is saying, and what we are trying to say is, let's go \nforward. Let's have malpractice reform. That is nowhere in this \nmonstrosity. Why don't we encourage health savings accounts and expand \nthem? Why don't we let people go across State lines to get health \ninsurance policies of their choice? Why don't we reward wellness and \nfitness? There is a long list of amendments, of fixes to the long-term \ncosts of health care that we could control, that we could enact \ntomorrow on a bipartisan basis. They do not add to the deficit. In \nfact, what they do is control health care costs, which is what is wrong \nwith health care in America.\n  The quality of health care in America is outstanding. It is the cost. \nWe could be working together step by step, as the Senator from \nTennessee says, with a long list. I am sure he will add to them the \nones I just gave out to control health care costs in America. We stand \nwilling to do it.\n  After this bill fails, because the American people overwhelmingly are \nbeginning--it may pass the Senate. It may pass the House. It will not \npass.\n  Then why don't we sit down together for a change, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and move step by step to fix the health care problems in \nAmerica?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Arizona is exactly right.\n  There is no Senator in the Chamber who has a better record of working \nacross party lines on bipartisan steps in the right direction than the \nSenator from Arizona. But going to Mr. Samuelson's comment--I was \ntalking to a businessman this morning.\n  I said: If you had a problem in your company, would the first thing \nyou would do is to tear the whole company down and start over again? Or \nif the football team had lost two or three games, would you blow up the \nstadium and run everybody off? No, that is not the way you do it.\n  The person I was talking to said: What I would do, I would identify \nthe problem, I would test the solution, I would phase it in, and I \nwould make sure we can afford it.\n  The American people know that. I think they are sitting up there \nlooking at us saying: What are these guys doing? Two-hundred-fifty \nmillion of us have health care policies, 85 percent. We would like for \nthe rest of America to have that opportunity too. But we know we can't \nafford that until we get the costs down.\n  Why don't we do as the Senator from Arizona suggested, let's move \nstep by step in the right direction to re-earn the trust of the \nAmerican people by reducing costs?\n  He said: Why haven't we done that? One of those steps is to allow \nsmall businesses to pool their resources and purchase a health plan, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office has said would allow nearly 1 \nmillion more employees of small businesses to be covered. Their rates \nwould be lower than they are paying today. It would save $1.4 million \nof Medicaid. This is what the Congressional Budget Office said. So it \nwould reduce costs, increase insurance coverage, and lower premiums. \nThe reason we are not considering it is because when we brought it up, \nthe Democrats said no. They filibustered it. They didn't come across \nthe aisle and say that is a pretty good idea; let's put that together \nwith two or three of ours, and we will reduce costs.\n  I say to Senator Bennett of Utah, you have founded a company. You \nhave run a company. If you were having a problem with the cost of a \nproduct or some other fundamental problem, is the first thing you would \ndo, is to think you were wise enough to tear the whole thing down and \nstart over again? Or if you called in a consultant and he recommended \nthat to you, what would you say to him?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Obviously, I would not respond in the way the folks \nacross the aisle have responded to this health care crisis. The example \nthe Senator has given is a valid one. That is not how you deal with it.\n  The other point I would make is that if I had a serious problem that \nwas causing difficulty for the survival of the company, I would not put \nthe solution off for 4 years while I raised prices on the existing \nproducts to try to pay for it. I would try to do what I could to get \nthe fix upfront as soon as possible.\n\n  As both Senators have pointed out, we Republicans have fixes that \ncould start now and don't have to wait until 2014 in order to get a \ngood CBO score.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Along those lines, again, about this Madoff-type \nbudgetary procedure, I am not that good at math. I am sure the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is. Help me out.\n  We have $1 trillion that they want to make in offsets, right, in this \n10-year plan. If you started the program at the same time that you \nenacted the savings, that would be $1 trillion, right? That would be \n$2.5 trillion. So the deficit, if you used correct accounting \nprocedures--in other words, you bring in the benefits at the same time \nyou start paying for it--you would end up with a $1.5 trillion deficit \nto the budget? Does that make sense?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It sounds right to me. It is another part of the \narrogance of this bill, which is to say we are not smart enough to \nfigure it out. The majority is saying the 10-year cost of the bill is \n$849 billion, but it doesn't start counting until the fifth year, and \nSenator Reid thinks the American people are not smart enough to figure \nthat out. That is part of the arrogance of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the benefits kicked in at the same time the taxes did, \nyou would be talking about a $2.5 trillion cost.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is $2.5 trillion, right?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I point out the CBO makes the same point at these 10 \nyears. Again, quoting the CBO letter, talking about the 10 years \nfollowing, when you have the full 10 years of expenditures instead of \njust 5 or 6 years of expenditure, it says:\n\n       Under the legislation federal outlays for health care would \n     increase during the 2010-2019 period, as would the federal \n     budgetary commitment to health care.\n\n  So those who are saying this is going to be a saving to the \ngovernment and you are going to turn the cost of health care--turn the \ncost curve with respect to health care down, the CBO has said: No, that \nis not the case. The Federal commitment would go up in those years.\n  Again, by delaying the implementation of the expenditure while \nimplementing immediately the implementation of the revenue, they are \ncreating the kind of financial chicanery that, as Senator McCain has \nsaid, put Bernie Madoff in jail.\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I bring up another issue to the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Arizona and Utah. A New York Times \narticle this week stated: ``Drug Makers Raise Prices in Face of Health \nCare Reform.''\n\n       Even as drugmakers promise to support Washington's health \n     care overhaul by shaving $8 billion a year off the Nation's \n     drug costs after the legislation takes effect, the industry \n     has been raising its prices at the fastest rate in years.\n       In the last year, the industry has raised the wholesale \n     price of brand-name prescription drugs by about 9 percent, \n     according to industry analysts. That would add more than $10 \n     billion to the nation's drug bill, which is on track to \n     exceed $300 billion this year. By at least one analysis, it \n     is the highest annual rate of inflation for drug prices since \n     1992.\n\n  So the moral of the story is, you lie down with dogs and you get \nfleas. So they cut a deal with the administration to cut drug costs, \nand guess what. With inflation zero, no inflation, they have decided to \nraise costs by more than 8 percent. Oh, the Consumer Price Index has \nfallen by 1.3 percent. The Consumer Price Index has fallen by 1.3 \npercent, and the prescription drugs have increased in cost by 9 \npercent.\n  What does this do to seniors? Seniors are not going to get a COLA in \nSocial Security this year because the consumer price index has fallen--\nwhich is the indicator as to whether cost of living adjustments are \ngiven to Social Security recipients. So what does the drug industry do? \nWithout inflation, they raise the cost of prescription drugs by some 9 \npercent at a time when Americans are hurting more than ever. Shame on \nthe drug industry. Shame on those people, and shame on the \nadministration for cutting a deal with them.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I see our other colleague from Utah here. I \nknow that during Finance Committee deliberations, he was directly \ninvolved in one of the conversations about the drug costs and also has \nbeen working on his own ideas for alternative approaches to some of \nthese problems. I will ask a question and then if my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, may like to comment further, we would invite that.\n  Is it the case that the Joint Committee on Taxation, which reported \nto the Finance Committee, and the Congressional Budget Office both said \nthat not only would the increased taxes on the pharmaceutical industry, \nthe medical device industry, and the insurance industry be passed on to \nconsumers in the form of higher premiums but that overall under the \nlegislation that is before us, for the average family as compared to \nwhat prices are today, insurance premiums would actually go up and this \nwas one of the two major reasons, the other being mandated benefits?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is absolutely right. They even said the \npremiums of the so-called government plan would be higher than private \nsector insurance premiums. It is incredible.\n  I have enjoyed the comments by the distinguished Senators from \nArizona, Utah, and Tennessee. If you look at what they are trying to \ndo, they are going to throw out a system that 85 percent of the \nAmerican people feel is basically OK, because they have not taken care \nof the 15 percent who don't have insurance. But when you deduct the 6 \nmillion people who work for companies that provide insurance but they \ndon't take it--they would rather have the money--and you take out the \n11 million people who basically qualify for Medicaid or SCHIP but are \nnot enrolled, and you deduct those who earn over $75,000 a year and can \nafford their own insurance, and then you take the illegal aliens, the \ndocumented workers and undocumented workers, you basically come down to \n17 million people who need and deserve our help. We are going to throw \nthe whole system out for 85 percent of the people when we could, \nthrough subsidization, help those who deserve help.\n  It doesn't make sense. What are they thinking over there? I hope it \nis not that they want to take us to socialism or to Europeanize us, \nwhen Europe is trying to get away from Europeanization.\n  We are rapidly approaching one of the most important votes for all of \nus in the Senate. This is bigger than any of us, our parties or our \nideologies. This is about the future of the greatest Nation in the \nhistory of the world. It is about your children and my children. It is \nabout your grandchildren, my grandchildren. Elaine and I have three \ngreat-grandchildren and two more on the way. It is about giving the \nfuture generation the same opportunities and same sense of pride. It is \nabout every American's way of life.\n  Every American business will be subject to this. Look at that thing, \na 2,074-page edict from Washington. I am going to spend my time before \nthis historic vote to highlight some very important numbers. Every \nMember of this Chamber should understand what they are voting to \nadvance. Make no mistake, our actions today will not be without \nconsequences. History and future generations will judge us by what we \ndo here today.\n  Zero is the number of provisions prohibiting the rationing of health \ncare, not one word prohibiting the rationing of health care. All you \nhave to do is look at some of the things that happened this week and \nyou start to worry about it. How about this? Zero is the number of \ngovernment-run entitlement programs that are financially sound over the \nlong term. Consider these important numbers: 10.2 percent national \nunemployment rate, the highest in 26 years; 70, the total number of \ngovernment programs authorized by this bill, 70 new programs at a time \nwhen we are going into fiscal insolvency; 1,697 times the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services is given authority to determine or define \nprovisions in this bill. We are turning the whole thing over to the \nbureaucrats here in Washington. More numbers: 2,074 total pages of this \nbill--look at that--2010, the year Americans start paying higher taxes \nto support this bill. My colleague from Utah and my colleagues from \nArizona and Tennessee have brought that out in no uncertain terms. The \nyear when this bill actually starts is 2014, most of the major \nprovisions of this bill. Some of them don't even begin until 2015. The \nnumber $6.8 million is the cost to taxpayers per word in this bill; $8 \nbillion is the total amount of new taxes on Americans who do not buy \nWashington-defined health care; $465 billion in cuts in Medicare at a \ntime when Medicare faces a $38 trillion unfunded liability to finance \nmore government spending; $494 billion is the total amount of new taxes \nin this bill.\n  If you think that is all, I think you have something coming here. \nAccording to the Budget Committee, using CBO figures, $2.5 trillion is \nthe real cost of this bill over a 10-year period. Our total national \ndebt will be $12 trillion. These numbers are facts and they are \nindisputable.\n  Let me finish by reading an excerpt from a fellow Utahn from Provo \nwho is worried about what this bill will do to our country.\n\n       I am writing out of deep concern over the increasing \n     expansion of government. I moved here from Germany 20 years \n     ago. I love America because it is free--free-er than Germany \n     in that I have the freedom to choose among other things how I \n     want to insure my family (we have six children). I'm all for \n     affordable health insurance which requires affordable health \n     care. I am self employed and have been hit hard by the \n     economy. There is a good chance that we would actually \n     benefit from [this bill]. Business has been so bad that we \n     would qualify for free school lunches if we asked for it. But \n     I don't want more government handouts. I don't want the \n     government telling me what kind of insurance I need to have. \n     I don't want the government telling me what services I can \n     receive when I need them. I don't want them taking an ever \n     greater part of my income to help finance government programs \n     such as the ``public option'' and the army of government \n     employees it will take to administer such a program. I do not \n     want more government. I want less. A lot less.\n\n  These people from Germany have been living in our country as citizens \nfor 20 years. They know what it was like to have their type of a \nsystem. I think we ought to pay attention to that humble person who, in \nspite of the travails they have, don't want this big, massive \ngovernment program to become law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both Senators from Utah for their \nthoughtful comments and significant involvement. I wish to return to \nthe issue of what we need to do. I say that because criticism has been \nleveled at this side of the aisle that we have no plan; therefore, \nsince we have no plan, we should embrace this. The fact is, we have had \nplans. We have had proposals. We have tried to get them listened to. \nThey range from medical malpractice reform to other free market cost \nreduction measures that add competition\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\nand quality to the health care system. Our objective is affordability \nand availability.\n  I want to talk with the Senator from Tennessee about the issue of \nmedical malpractice reform. Here is a huge piece of legislation. Yet I \nask my friend from Tennessee, is there any measure in this bill we have \nbeen able to detect so far--we have been able to detect $100 million in \nadditional Medicaid benefits for the State of Louisiana, but we haven't \nbeen able to determine all of the aspects of this bill. On the issue of \nmedical malpractice reform, physician after physician in America says \nthey have to practice defensive medicine for fear of finding themselves \nin court. Why is it that we have literally no addressing of an issue \nthat could significantly reduce cost?\n  As I recall, the CBO said that medical malpractice reform could \nreduce direct medical costs by some $54 billion over 10 years. There \nare other estimates that say if we added in the cost of the practice of \ndefensive medicine over prescription medicines and drugs because of \nfear of finding themselves in court, this could be as much as $200 \nbillion. Yet there is not one significant addressing of the issue of \nmedical malpractice in this legislation. I think that is a testimony to \nthe influence of the American trial lawyers association.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nArizona, that is a part of the problem. But I think of it a little \ndifferent way. There has been a lot of talk this week about medical \ncare availability for women in America. In Tennessee, in 45 of our 95 \ncounties, there are no OB/GYN doctors. So pregnant women in Tennessee \nin those counties have to drive 50, 60, 70 or 80 miles for prenatal \nhealth care. They might have to check into a hotel for a few days in a \nbig city in order to have their baby.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I add, the mirror opposite of that is the State of \nTexas which was hemorrhaging medical doctors and care providers and \nthen, after they enacted a very modest malpractice reform, there was a \nflood of physicians returning to the State of Texas. Isn't that the \ncase?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is exactly right. In fact, a number of us have \noffered to the Senate, as a part of the way we would go about reducing \nhealth care costs, basically adopting the same kind of provisions they \ndid in Texas which still leaves anyone who is hurt, a complete right to \nrecover from that injury, but makes a major change in the availability \nof doctors to that patient. And in the case of Tennessee, we were \ntalking about OB/GYN doctors to women who are about to have babies. The \nSenator from Arizona said that would save at least $54 billion over 10 \nyears. No one doubts that reform of medical malpractice, junk lawsuits \nagainst doctors, would reduce costs. The point we are trying to make \nhere is, instead of that historically arrogant 2,074-page bill that \npresumes we know enough to change every aspect of health care in \nAmerica, why don't we re-earn the trust of the American people, who \nhave lost a lot of confidence in those of us in Washington, and start \ntaking steps in the right direction to reduce cost? We could do it by \nadopting our legislation to reduce unwarranted medical malpractice \nsuits. That would be one step.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I revisit with the Senator an issue we talked about \na little earlier and with my friend from Utah as well. This is the \nrecent spate of publicity concerning a recommendation that women wait \nuntil 50 years of age before--I see our physician Dr. Barrasso is here \nalso--getting routine mammograms. That ignited a firestorm throughout \nAmerica and story after story of women who have experienced breast \ncancer who state categorically that if they hadn't gotten the mammogram \nwhen they did, it is possible they would not be alive today.\n  Now that is a nice academic discussion. But I would ask--maybe Dr. \nBarrasso would answer it--isn't that the kind of advisory board this \nlegislation could put into law; that those kinds of mandates could come \ndown, which could literally jeopardize the health and lives of \nAmericans?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague and friend \nfrom Arizona, this type of legislation would have cost my wife her \nlife. She is a breast cancer survivor, diagnosed by a routine screening \nmammogram. She was in her forties when that mammogram was performed. \nShe went through the testing and had the operation. In that age, in her \nforties, she already had the breast cancer spread from her breast to \none of the lymph nodes. It was a screening mammogram that saved her \nlife. She has had three operations, two bouts of chemotherapy. As a \nresult, she is a survivor--6 years later.\n  But this piece of legislation says: No, no, do not worry about it. \nThere is not going to be any denial of care. There is not going to be \nanything like that. But if you turn to page 1,150, it talks \nspecifically about this preventative task force, specifically saying \nwhen they make their recommendations there is going to be money that \ntaxpayers are going to pay to tell people what those recommendations \nare. Then, if you go to page 1,190, it says that if it is not approved, \nthey will deny payment for that service--deny payment. It does not say \nthey might.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator, you would not describe that as a \n``penal panel''?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Some people might.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I went back to my office and got the exact \npages our doctor colleague has just been talking about--page 1,189 and \npage 1,190 of the actual bill. My colleague from Arizona asked the \nquestion--this entity, this U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; the \nentity that made the recommendations with regard to mammograms is it \npossible their recommendations could be used to deny coverage or reduce \npayments or deny payments?\n  Well, here is the exact language, if my colleagues would like to hear \nit. The Secretary of HHS is, of course, the person who implements this. \nIt is not the task force. The task force makes the recommendations, and \nthen the Secretary of HHS issues the regulations. Quoting:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, \n     effective beginning on January 1, 2010,--\n\n  That is just a couple months from now--\n\n       if the Secretary determines appropriate, the Secretary \n     may--\n       (1) modify--\n       (A) the coverage of any preventive service described . . . \n     to the extent that such modification is consistent with the \n     recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task \n     Force. . . .\n\n  So there you have modifying the coverage. Then, secondly, as my \ncolleague was just reading:\n\n       (2) provide that no payment shall be made under this title \n     for a preventive service described in subparagraph (A) of \n     such section that has not received a grade of A, B, C, or I \n     by such Task Force.\n\n  In other words, they make the recommendation, and they say this does \nnot meet our standards, so she can say, therefore, we are not going to \npay for it.\n  That is taking the recommendations of this task force and translating \nit into the rationing of health care. This is how rationing begins.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I could share with Senators this \nstatistic. We hear a lot of talk about everybody has to be covered. We \ntalk about the United Kingdom, where they have a plan where everybody \nis covered. The cancer survivor rate for women with breast cancer in \nthe United Kingdom, after diagnosis, is 57 percent. The cancer survivor \nrate in the United States, where we have people who are not covered, is \n67 percent. I do not think we want to move in the direction of bringing \nthat rate down.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The reasons for that are they are not doing early \nenough screening, and even once they are able to find the cancer in \nGreat Britain, how long do they have to wait in line until they \nactually receive the surgery? The delay of care is the denial of care, \nand that is what is going to happen under this bill.\n  I see my colleague from Idaho standing as well because he is familiar \nwith this situation. But I look at this and see the numbers. They said: \nWell, we don't want to cover this service because it would only save 1 \nlife out of 1,900 women in their forties. Well, in my case, that 1 life \nout of 1,900 was my wife Bobbi.\n  I know the Senator from Idaho wants to get involved in this \ndiscussion.\n  Senator Risch.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as you read these pages, most of it is \nincomprehensible. But, interestingly enough,\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nthe point made by the good Senator from Arizona about the ability of \nthe U.S. Government to cut off health care to people is stated so \nclearly on page 1,189 of the bill. The title of the provision is \n``Authority to Modify or Eliminate Coverage of Certain Preventive \nServices.'' How much clearer can it be? This bill gives authority to \nthe group that was identified to modify or eliminate coverage of \ncertain preventive services.\n  Had this bill been in effect in the last week when the \nrecommendations came out on mammograms, American women would be denied \ncoverage for mammograms in the time period that was identified by this \ngroup. This is absolutely clear on this. This is just the beginning of \nthe kind of health care rationing you are going to see under this bill. \nAmericans are frightened, and they should be. Health care rationing is \ncoming to America if this bill is passed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to share another statistic \nin this whole circumstance that I think we need to focus on because, \nback to the Broder column Senator McCain talked about, we are talking \nabout the amount of expenditures and the creation of a new entitlement.\n  Let's go back to the debate on the budget. We got the numbers that \nsaid the projected revenue for fiscal year 2009 was $2.2 trillion. The \nentitlement spending for 2009 was $2.2 trillion. That means everything \nwe have done in government--our embassies overseas, our military, the \nnational parks, education, whatever it is--absolutely everything in \n2009, other than entitlement spending, had to be borrowed money.\n  What are we doing with this bill? We are going to increase \nentitlement spending. We are going to increase the role of government \nthat this Congress or future Congresses have no direct control over \nthrough the appropriations process. I have been chairman of an \nappropriations subcommittee. The amount we have control over in the Ag \nSubcommittee is about $17 billion. The total bill was $80 billion. The \nrest of that $80 billion was off-limits to the Appropriations \nSubcommittee because it was on autopilot as entitlement spending.\n  The entitlement spending for farm subsidies is small potatoes, to use \na farm subsidy word, compared to the entitlement spending for health \ncare. So facing the kinds of deficits we are facing, facing the runaway \nentitlement spending we have, the largest portion of which is \nentitlement spending for health care, what are we being told to do? \nIncrease the entitlement spending for health care and put future \nCongresses in an even deeper financial bind by taking even more of the \ntotal portion of the Federal budget that is outside the appropriations \nprocess and putting it on autopilot. That is the issue we must keep in \nmind as we look at this whole circumstance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Could I go back, again, and reemphasize with my colleagues and the \nAmerican people what is very odious about the bill that is before us; \nthat is, the Madoff-style budget gimmickry associated with this \nlegislation. In 40 days--in 40 days--tax increases and Medicare cuts of \napproximately $1 trillion will begin--in 40 days. That is 6 weeks from \nnow. But any benefits that would accrue from this legislation would \nbegin in 208 weeks--1,460 days.\n  So why in the world would we approve--and, obviously, we know why it \nis done. It is to make the budget look better, when it is deception \nbeing perpetrated on the American people because we are not telling \nthem the true cost. We are not telling the truth because, if the \nbenefits started at the same time the taxes started, it would be a $2.5 \ntrillion deficit over 10 years.\n\n  It is unfair to the American people, who are going to have to foot \nthe bill for this massive piece of legislation--it is unfair to them to \ntell them they are going to have to start paying the taxes and footing \nthe bill for it and only 4 years later would any benefits come to them. \nI think that is a really wrong thing to do to the American people.\n  Do you know what. The American people are beginning to figure it out. \nMr. President, 51 to 35, the American people do not want this. The \nAmerican people do not want an increase in the deficit. They want the \nspending stopped, and they are figuring it out. I am afraid my friends \non the other side of the aisle may have underestimated the intelligence \nof the American people.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senators from \nArizona, Utah, and Idaho. Reading that big bill is very hard to do. So \nfor those who are watching, what we have been trying to do--as Senator \nMcCain and Senator Kyl just did--is take specific provisions and \ndiscuss them and interpret them.\n  We have done that with the higher premiums. We have done that with \nthe higher taxes that the bill will require. We have done that with the \nMedicare cuts. Earlier today we had an hour discussion, led by Senator \nCorker, that discussed how the bill would send the costs for Medicaid \nexpansion to States.\n  We have talked now about what we would do if this bill were to fail, \nwhich we hope it does. We think this bill is historic in its \narrogance--arrogance that we could turn over this whole system, that we \nthink the American people cannot figure out that the bill costs $2.5 \ntrillion, instead of the $849 billion, as advertised.\n  What we propose is, we move step by step in the direction of cutting \nhealth care costs for individuals and for our government. We have \nproposed legislation that would reduce junk lawsuits, combat waste, \nfraud, and abuse, allow small businesses to pool resources to purchase \ninsurance, allow Americans to purchase health insurance across State \nlines, expand health savings accounts, and promote wellness and \nprevention.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to make the point, again, \nfollowing up on what the Senator from Tennessee has had to say, that \nthe argument we are hearing from the other side is a false argument \nwhen they say it is either this bill or the status quo and the \nRepublicans have nothing to offer.\n  We have been offering proposals all along. I have been immersed in \nthis for 3\\1/2\\ years, cosponsoring, with my Democratic friends, ideas \non the way to go forward. Those proposals were not even allowed to be \nconsidered in committee. The 2,000 pages we see before us were written \nwithout a single Republican knowing where the room was, let alone being \nin the room. Then we are told: But you stand for the status quo, and \nthe status quo is unacceptable.\n  I repeat what I said earlier: The way this bill is constructed, the \nstatus will remain quo until 2014, as far as benefits are concerned, \nbut the taxes will start immediately. But we all know the revenue that \ncomes from those taxes will not be held in trust to pay for the \nbenefits in 2014. They will go for other things, to pay for the $1.4 \ntrillion deficit we have this year. Then, in 2014, when the expenses \nstart, the money will all have been spent that had been brought in, in \nthe 4 years previously, and, as the CBO says, there will be change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time reserved for the Republicans is \nexpired.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 6:30 p.m. will be controlled \nby the majority.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and honor this evening \nto be here to strongly support this motion, this historic motion to \nproceed to a historic debate about whether we, as America, the greatest \ncountry in the world, are going to make sure all Americans have access \nto affordable health care insurance. This is something that has been \ndebated for 100 years. Now we have the opportunity, with the House \nhaving passed their version, to move forward to this debate where we \nwill have lots of opportunity to offer amendments and to debate honest \ndifferences in policy. But in the end, I believe confidently that we \nwill come together to move forward to pass legislation that will save \nlives, that will save money for the American people, that will protect \nMedicare, and that will stop insurance abuses happening for families \nevery single day.\n\n  I have come to the floor so many times to talk about health insurance \nreform, as has the distinguished Presiding Officer from Rhode Island. I \nwish to take just a moment to say thank you to a few people because, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, we would literally not have this \nopportunity today if it were not for Senator Harry Reid,\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\nour distinguished majority leader. He is a quiet, smart, determined, \nfocused leader who has listened to everyone, who has looked at the work \nproducts from the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee and brought \ntogether a combined bill that is the best of both. He is going to give \nus the opportunity to continue to debate and improve it on the floor \nbefore final passage. So I thank Senator Reid. I know he is passionate \nabout his State of Nevada, and that is his No. 1 love after family, but \nI think No. 2 is the Senate and the ability to lead and get things \ndone, and I thank him.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for his incredible leadership on the Finance \nCommittee; Senator Dodd for his leadership and stewardship in bringing \nthe HELP Committee through with their legislation; Senator Harkin, \nSenator Wyden, and Senator Bennett, who is on the floor. We are not \nagreeing on the movement forward on this bill, but there have been 2 \nyears of working on health care that I appreciate, and their efforts \ntogether to work on health care.\n  I thank Senator Snowe. I don't know if she is going to be with us \nthis evening, but her courageous vote on the Finance Committee is \nsomething we desperately appreciate. I know she is going to continue to \nprovide input, and I am hopeful she will be with us on the final vote \nbecause her input and her knowledge have been extremely important in \nthis process.\n  I also thank the memory of a very important Senator named Ted \nKennedy, who I know is here in spirit, for 40 years of dedication to \nthis cause.\n  Finally, I thank President Obama. If not for his vision, we would not \nbe here today. For 8 years under a former President, we did not have \nthe opportunity to get here to this place. We did not have the \nopportunity to be able to end insurance abuses and truly protect \nMedicare for the future, to put forward health care reform, to save \nlives, and to save money. I also thank President Obama for \nunderstanding that health care is also about jobs and that we have too \nmany people in this country today who are losing their job, and with \nthat they are losing their health insurance. So it is impossible to \ntalk about health care reform without also talking about jobs because \nfor most families they are connected and one and the same.\n  I have spoken on the floor so many times on health care cost and \naccess. Frankly, health care is something that brought me to public \nservice 30 years ago; when I was 5, I just want to say that for the \nrecord. I led an effort in our community to keep a nursing home open in \nOkemos, MI, and ever since then have been fighting to get to this \ndebate, to get to this point in terms of affordable health insurance \nfor all Americans.\n  So tonight, after this vote, we start the real debate. This bill \nprovides a framework for every American to find affordable insurance. \nIs it everything I would do if I was writing it by myself? Of course \nnot. Every Member can say the same thing. But the Democratic process is \ncoming together with the best ideas and negotiating and doing the best \nwe can to be able to solve as much as we can in the best way possible. \nI am going to continue to work to make health care truly affordable and \nwill be sponsoring and cosponsoring amendments as we move forward to \nimprove on what I believe is a very good bill. I am confident that at \nthe end, again, we will pass legislation that saves lives, that saves \nmoney, that protects Medicare, and that stops insurance abuses.\n  When we first started this effort, I set up the Health Care People's \nLobby on my Web site so that people could share their stories, how they \nfelt about what we should be doing. Should we move forward and act? \nWhat should happen? What were their experiences with their health \ninsurance and the companies that cover them now? I have heard so many \nstories. I wish to thank everyone--thousands of people--who has shared \ntheir story. I want to put a face on this debate and vote tonight by \nsharing just a couple with you.\n  When we say saving lives, this is not just a slogan. We are talking \nabout saving lives. Forty-five thousand people have the ultimate \nrationing every year because they can't find affordable insurance. As a \nconsequence, they lose their lives--45,000 people in the greatest \ncountry in the world. We can do better than that, and that is what this \nbill is about.\n  I wish to share just one story of a young man, Joe, from Okemos, MI. \nHe is a recent graduate of dental school. He worked very hard, was very \nbright. He was just between jobs after completing his residency, and we \nknow how long and hard that is, to get to that point. He suddenly fell \nill. This was only a few months ago. He called his mom. She urged him \nto go to the doctor, but because Joe didn't have insurance, he was \nworried about going to the doctor, so he didn't. He continued to feel \nworse. His family finally got him to agree to go to the hospital, but \nby then it was too late. Joe died at age 27 of an aneurism--27 years \nold--because in America, he didn't have insurance and was afraid he \ncouldn't afford it if he went to a doctor.\n  This is about saving lives. This is about saving money for businesses \nthat are trying to keep the doors open, that may provide insurance now \nbut are at a point where either the jobs go or they have to stop \nproviding insurance. So people come in, and the owner says: I want to \nkeep you working, but we are not going to be able to have health care \nfor you anymore.\n  This is about the fact that our country is spending twice as much as \nany other country on health care and yet sometimes having outcomes that \nare far worse than we would like to see as it relates to other \ncountries. We are 29th in the world in the number of babies who make it \nthrough the first year of life. Of all of the insurance companies a \nwoman can choose from if she goes into the private individual insurance \nmarket--59 percent don't provide maternity care, basic care, prenatal \ncare, care for mom and baby during the first year. So that is going to \nchange because of the values we bring to this.\n  We are going to protect Medicare. Folks don't have to believe us. \nThere is a lot of debate about what is happening in Medicare. I am very \nproud to say we have received a very strong letter from the AARP \nsupporting a ``yes'' vote this evening to move forward on this debate, \nand that is critically important for us.\n  Let me share from the Web site of AARP what they say--the champions \nfor seniors in this country; what they say, not what we say--about what \nis being done in health care reform.\n  On their Web site:\n\n       Myth: Health care reform will hurt Medicare.\n       Fact: None of the health care reform proposals being \n     considered by Congress would cut Medicare benefits or \n     increase your out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services.\n       Fact: Health care reform will lower prescription drug costs \n     for people in the Medicare Part D coverage gap or doughnut \n     hole so they can better afford the drugs they need.\n       Fact: Rather than weaken Medicare, health care reform will \n     strengthen the financial status of the Medicare program.\n\n  That is why AARP has written a letter urging us all to vote yes on \nthe motion this evening we will be voting on, because we are \nstrengthening Medicare for the future.\n  Then let me speak to the question of insurance reforms because the \nreality is that the majority of people have insurance. The majority of \nus so far have insurance through our employer, and we hope that as we \nbring down the costs and save money, that, in fact, we will be able to \nmake sure people are going to be able to continue to have the coverage \nthey are paying for today. So we are talking about insurance abuses and \nstopping those insurance abuses.\n  I wish to share a couple of stories from individuals who have found \nthemselves in a very difficult situation. I realize my time has come to \nan end, so I will be brief, but I do want to share just a couple of \nstories in conclusion.\n  From the newspaper recently: Benjamin French, a young boy in \nMichigan, was born with his right arm missing below the elbow. In his \n12 years, he has been fitted with seven prostheses. His most recent \nreplacement will cost nearly $30,000, and his doctor says he will soon \ngrow out of it. He is a 12-year-old who is growing up, so as he gets an \nartificial arm, it has to be replaced periodically to be able to grow \nwith him. But according to his insurance company, the boy is ineligible \nfor future coverage of prosthetic devices because he has already spent \nhis lifetime maximum benefit. That is going\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\nto stop. We are going to eliminate those lifetime caps that get in the \nway of a 12-year-old being able to have the artificial arm he needs as \nhe grows up so he can lead a normal life.\n  I wish to share one other story, and that is from Glen from Sterling \nHeights. He is 62 years old. He got laid off in December. It doesn't \nlook as if he will be called back. He writes:\n\n       I am too young for Medicare. I have preexisting conditions, \n     so nobody wants to insure me. If I get sick before I can get \n     Medicare, my savings and everything else will be wiped out. \n     This is not the way I pictured retirement was going to be. I \n     raised four children, got them through school, and married; \n     paid taxes and did what I thought was the right and moral \n     thing to do. I didn't create this mess, but I am sure paying \n     for it.\n\n  He did the right and moral thing, and that is what we are being asked \nto do on behalf of the American people.\n  Vote to move forward tonight. Vote for the debate. Doing nothing is \nnot an option when we are losing jobs, people are losing lives; when we \nare losing the capacity of the country to be able to provide the health \ncare for our families that we need to provide. It is our turn tonight \nto vote yes on proceeding to a debate that I believe, working together, \nwill result in legislation on health care that will save lives, save \nmoney, protect Medicare, and stop insurance abuses.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, for many months the voices of opposition \nto any health care reform have been loud and clear. They have been \nshouting at townhall meetings and heard in debates in this Chamber. All \ntoo often, we have heard shrill voices raised in anger from those who \nare either misinformed or who would choose the status quo that benefits \ninsurers at the expense of families. For too long those voices have \ngone unanswered.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act we are about to \nconsider is our answer. It is loud and it is clear. It is thoughtful \nand historic. Once again, like so many other pieces of landmark \nlegislation in the last century, it is a product of this side of the \naisle.\n  Those who have chosen to block any attempt at health care reform this \nyear are on the wrong side of history, just as those who came before \nthem had one response to every landmark piece of legislation for the \nlast 80 years. Their response has been a resounding ``no.'' They told \nus that it is not good for business, that it is socialism, that it \nstifles free market forces, and that it is too much and it goes too \nfar.\n  We have heard the same fear mongering and innuendo since the New \nDeal. There are those who raised the specter of socialism then and said \nno to Social Security. They said no to unemployment insurance when \nPresident Roosevelt proposed it as part of the Social Security Act. \nThey said no when John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson fought for Medicare. \nThey said no to the Civil Rights Act. They said no to the Voting Rights \nAct. They said no to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. They said no \nto jobs programs. They said no to increasing unemployment insurance, \nwhen people needed it the most. They said no to government oversight of \npolluters who poison our land with toxic waste, and then they said no \nto cleaning it up. They have been on the wrong side of history for \nalmost a century on every major piece of legislation that has leveled \nthe playing field for average Americans. They are on the wrong side of \nhistory once again.\n  All we hear from the other side of the aisle is the dim echo of the \npast, with no plan for the future. Americans are tired of the \nnaysayers, tired of the shrill voices of no, when so much is at stake. \nIt is time to say yes, time to say yes to stopping greedy insurance \ncompanies from standing between doctor and patients, time to say yes to \nending medical decisions based on risk management and the bottom line \nrather than on saving people's lives.\n  This historic legislation, like so many other pieces of legislation \ndebated on this floor, is about people--their lives, their hopes, their \nhealth, and their dreams for a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. We can be proud of this legislation. I know that when the \ndust settles and the provisions of this bill become clear, America will \nbe proud of it as well.\n  This landmark reform legislation includes State-based exchanges \ncreating a fair, open, and competitive marketplace for affordable \nhealth care coverage. It includes an amendment I proposed for long-\noverdue consumer protections for emergency services without having to \ncall your health care provider and get a prior authorization. It \nrequires insurance plans to provide behavioral health treatments, such \nas those for children who face the challenges of autism, as part of the \nminimum benefit standards. It encourages investments in youth therapies \nto prevent, diagnose, and treat acute and chronic disease. There is a \ntax credit for innovative biotechnology research. It ensures that minor \nchildren qualify as exchange-eligible and provides for the availability \nof child-only health insurance coverage in the exchanges. It stops \ninsurance companies from denying coverage for some preexisting \ncondition, some preexisting health status, or gender. It ends the \nmedical benefits shell game that insurers have played with people's \nlives.\n  As soon as this bill passes and the President signs it into law, 1.3 \nmillion seniors in New Jersey will receive free preventive care, such \nas colonoscopies or any other recommended preventive service; 227,000 \nNew Jersey seniors will have their brand-name drug costs in Medicare \nPart D cut in half; 854,000 New Jerseyans will qualify for tax credits \nto help them buy health insurance and ease the burden of premiums, \ndeductibles, and copayments; 107,000 small businesses in New Jersey \ncould get a small business tax credit--up to 50 percent of premium. \nHealth care reform will end the hidden tax that gets passed along with \nthe $1.1 billion spent on uncompensated care in New Jersey. It will \nprovide portability, security, and choice through the health insurance \nexchange for 1.5 million New Jersey residents who don't have health \ninsurance at all.\n  The bottom line is that Senator Reid's merged bill helps New Jersey \nand America. It is fair, balanced, and fixes a badly broken system. It \nis truly a historic piece of legislation and will be remembered as \nsuch. Yet there are all those who will stand against all of it, those \nwho will stand firmly on the wrong side of history once again, those \nwho will use every legislative tactic to stop this legislation as they \ntried to stop Social Security and Medicare. I am afraid history is \nabout to repeat itself.\n  We have seen that the truth has been a victim on the Senate floor \ntoday. We listened to some of the most dire predictions, some of the \nmost incredible statements, with figures thrown out there that are \nastronomical, simply not true, and in defiance of what the nonpartisan \nCBO said, which we all depend on--Democrats and Republicans. They said \nthis bill actually cuts the deficit by $130 billion in the first 10 \nyears and $650 billion in the second 10 years.\n  In the face of a health care system that seems to work only for \nhealth insurers--certainly not for average Americans--one must ask \nwhat, if any, health care reform are my friends on the other side for. \nWhat were their predecessors for when Americans were standing in bread \nlines and needed unemployment insurance? What were they for when they \nvoted against Medicare? What are our Republican colleagues for now? \nThey seem to be for one thing only: protecting the status quo, leaving \nhealth care just the way it is, letting insurers make medical \ndecisions, letting insurers collect premiums and then find creative \nways to deny coverage.\n  On the other hand, this bill represents the change America voted for. \nBut as we have seen, change does not come easily. You have to work for \nit. You have to fight for it. Sometimes, in the face of the naysayers \nand fear mongers, you need more than the truth, common sense, and even \na good plan; you need to fight for what you know is the right thing to \ndo for every American, not the few, not the powerful and the well-\nconnected but everyone.\n  At the heart of it, this vote we will cast tonight is about change. \nWe can see how hard real, honest, commonsense change is. We must ask \nourselves: Do we continue to be the agents of change or do we stand \nwith the status quo that discriminates against\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\nhard-working Americans who are denied health coverage because of \npreexisting conditions? Do we continue to be agents of change or do we \nstand with the status quo and deny coverage to women when they are \npregnant? Do we continue to be agents of change, however hard it may \nbe, or do we continue to deny millions of Americans access to quality, \naffordable care?\n  History calls on us to stand on rare occasions for what is fair and \njust and right for the American people. This is one of those occasions. \nIt requires more than parliamentary maneuvers to slow the process. It \nrequires more than voices raised under the banner of free market values \nat the expense of fundamental human values. It requires doing what is \nright for the American people. Only then will we find ourselves on the \nright side of history. That is what this vote is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis very strong and poignant statement. I listened to it all. I think \nhe really summed it all up.\n  Let me add to that by saying we are at a momentous crossroads right \nnow in the history of our country. We are at a time that likens itself \nto 1935, when this Congress passed the Social Security Act. It is like \nthe time in 1965 when Congress passed Medicare. Both of them were giant \nsteps forward in the health and economic security of the American \npeople. But as much as they are part and parcel of our American life \ntoday, both Social Security and Medicare were bitterly opposed in this \nSenate by conservatives who did not want to change. In fact, one \nconservative Republican Senator said that passing Social Security would \nput an ``end to the progress of our great country.'' They attacked \nMedicare as socialized medicine. As Senator Robert Taft said at that \ntime, ``It is going to Sovietize America if we have Medicare. It is \ngoing to be a government takeover.'' Well, here they go again. They are \nunduly frightening people in this country. We saw it earlier with the \ndeath panels--all bogus. It was to instill fear in people.\n  It is hard to change, but the people of America voted last November \noverwhelmingly for Barack Obama and for Democrats in the House and \nSenate because they wanted to change the system. They knew we had to \nchange.\n  People don't fear change. They know it is tough, but they don't fear \nit. They don't fear change in our health care system either. What \npeople fear is keeping the present system. That is what I hear. They \nfear being denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition or \none of their children has a preexisting condition and they will not be \nable to get health care coverage. That is what people fear. They fear \nthey will be dropped from their policy because they have come down with \ncancer or heart disease or some other chronic illness. They fear that \nif they have a serious illness, they will have to go into bankruptcy to \npay the bills. Sixty-two percent of all the bankruptcies in this \ncountry are because of medical causes. Eighty percent of those are \npeople who already had coverage. That is what people really fear.\n  Another reason I think conservative forces will fail this time is \nbecause they believe people who have good health insurance really lack \ncompassion and they don't care about the 46 million other Americans who \ndon't have it. I disagree. People care deeply about those 46 million \nAmericans who don't have insurance. It is a national shame when \nchildren don't have access to a doctor.\n  It is unfortunate that our Republican friends are determined to \nprevent us from even debating and amending the bill. That is what the \nvote tonight is about. Republicans and the health insurance industry \nare joined at the hip, using the same talking points, same distortions, \nsame cooked-up scare tactics.\n  All I can say is, since the Republicans' goal is to obstruct, \nobstruct, and obstruct, the people of this country are looking to us, \nto the Democrats, as they did in Social Security and as they did in \nMedicare, they are looking to us to move this country forward. So this \nis a call to arms for our caucus. I hate to put it in those kinds of \npartisan terms, but what can I do when every single Republican says \nthey want to obstruct and stop this bill? It is now on us, the \nDemocratic caucus, all 60 Members, to come here and stand strong for \nthe American people. Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees, I \nsay to my friends in the Democratic caucus. Now is the time to stand \nstrong, the time to come to the well at 8 o'clock tonight and move this \ncountry forward. It is time to say yes to the American people and no to \nthese fears and unfounded allegations you will hear from the other \nside. Now is the time to take the next step forward in the real \nprogress of this country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 7:15 \np.m. will now be controlled by the Republicans.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to be notified when I have spoken \n20 minutes, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will gladly do that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on November 10, former President Clinton \nvisited the Democratic Senate caucus. It has been widely reported that \nhis message to Senate Democrats was that on health care reform, the \nworst thing to do is to do nothing.\n  With all due respect to the former President, that is simply wrong. \nMr. Clinton, the worst thing we can do is pass this bill. This is not \nsomething I say lightly because there are serious problems with our \nhealth care system. There are important steps we need to take to fix \nthe problems in our system. But the excesses of this bill appear \nwillfully ignorant of what is going on outside health care. Those \nthings deal with our economy. Those excesses make this bill far worse \nthan doing nothing.\n  We are a nation facing challenging economic times. We have seen the \nauto industry go into bankruptcy. We have seen banks shutter their \ndoors.\n  I want to refer to a chart of our national debt. The Federal debt has \nincreased by $1.4 trillion since inauguration. This chart shows the \ngrowing amount of debt the Federal Government is taking on. The amount \nof increased debt added since the inauguration is $11,535 per \nhousehold. The national debt now exceeds $12 trillion for the first \ntime in history.\n  I wish to show a chart on Federal health spending. As this chart \nillustrates, this bill bends the Federal spending curve further upward \nby $160 billion over the next decade. The red area of this chart is \nthat net additional Federal health spending, not according to this \nSenator but according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \nAmericans have rightly lost faith when in the face of the current \neconomic crisis Congress thinks this $2.5 trillion restructuring of the \nhealth care system happens to be a good idea.\n  Perhaps one of the biggest warning signs that this bill will saddle \ntaxpayers with more spending and debt is the fact that the budget fail-\nsafe mechanism was dropped from the bill behind closed doors in the \nCapitol where this bill was written--and I emphasize ``closed doors.'' \nThe Grassley budget fail-safe mechanism was cut from the bill and lots \nof budget gimmicks were added.\n  Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin wrote \nin yesterday's Wall Street Journal that this bill is ``fiscally \ndishonest'' and that it uses ``every budget gimmick and trick in the \nbook . . . leave out inconvenient spending, back-load spending to \ndisguise the true scale, front-load tax revenue, let inflation push up \ntax revenues, promise spending cuts to doctors and hospitals that have \nno record of materializing,'' and so on.\n  This bill is simply irresponsible. It is worse than doing nothing.\n  Let's talk about some of the excesses in the bill. It increases the \nsize of government by a staggering $2.5 trillion when fully \nimplemented. It imposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in new fees and taxes. Imposing \nthese new fees and taxes as the economy is struggling to recover is \nworse than doing nothing. This $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes will hurt \nsmall businesses and destroy job creation. It breaks President Obama's \ncampaign promise by increasing taxes on individuals and families making \nless than $250,000 per year. Adding insult to injury, these fees and \ntaxes will also cause health care premiums to go up beginning next \nyear.\n\n[[Page S11959]]\n\n  But I don't want you to take my word for it. Both the nonpartisan \nCommittee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office have \nconfirmed these taxes and fees will be passed through to the consumers \nin the form of higher health insurance premiums, and these taxes and \nfees will start increasing premiums 4 years before most of the reforms \nin this bill take effect in 2014.\n  Let's take a look at what happens to Medicare and Medicaid in this \nbill. Both of these health care entitlement programs are already on \nperilous financial footing. Both are facing a financial meltdown. This \nbill adds to that burden.\n  First of all, the Medicare trust fund started going broke last year. \nIn the year 2008, the Medicare Program began spending more out of the \ntrust fund than was coming in. The Medicare trustees have been warning \nall of us for years that the trust fund is going broke. They now \npredict it will go broke right around the corner, about 2017. But \nrather than work to bridge Medicare's $37 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities, this bill cuts $\\1/2\\ trillion from that Medicare Program \nto fund yet another unsustainable health care entitlement program.\n  Medicare has a major problem with physician payments that will cost \nmore than $250 billion to fix. But this bill ignores that problem by \npretending the problem does not exist. This bill would leave future \nCongresses virtually no way to restructure Medicare to do the doctors \nfix.\n  By diverting Medicare resources elsewhere and ignoring major problems \nsuch as that one, this bill does worse than nothing.\n  Then there is Medicaid. The Medicaid Program serves 59 million low-\nincome children and families. It is our health care safety net and it, \ntoo, is on very shaky financial ground. The Government Accountability \nOffice has reported to Congress that States are reaching a financial \nand budgetary crisis with Medicaid. Like Medicare, Medicaid is \nessentially going broke. The Government Accountability Office models \npredict that State spending on Medicaid will grow faster than State \nrevenues for at least the next 10 years.\n  Here is what the Government Accountability Office has said about this \nsituation:\n\n       Since most State and local governments are required to \n     balance their operating budgets, the declining fiscal \n     conditions shown in our simulation suggest that, without \n     intervention, these governments would need to make \n     substantial policy changes to avoid growing fiscal \n     imbalances.\n\n  But this bill does not fix this problem either. Here again, this bill \nmakes the problem worse. This bill adds another $374 billion in \nspending to the Medicaid Program. It adds 15 million people to the \nrolls of the worst delivery system in health care. It increases State \nspending by $25 billion, and that happens to be a hidden tax increase \nbecause States will be forced to raise taxes to pay for this increased \ncost--another unfunded mandate. By dropping the equivalent of a 10,000-\npound weight through to our frayed Medicaid safety net, this bill does \nworse than nothing. This bill also compounds these long-term \nentitlement spending problems by creating yet another new entitlement \nprogram called the CLASS Act. This one is a voluntary Federal program \nfor long-term care insurance.\n  I devoted several years of effort to improving long-term care \nsupport, particularly for the disabled and the elderly.\n  I understand the issues that supporters of the CLASS Act want to \naddress. But the CLASS Act is simply not viable in its current form.\n  The CLASS Act is almost certain to attract people who are most likely \nto need it. This is known as adverse selection. That will cause \npremiums to increase and healthier people to drop out of the program. \nIt is a classic insurance death spiral.\n  On November 13, the administration's own chief actuary confirmed \nthis. The chief actuary issued a dire warning in a report on the CLASS \nAct in the House bill, which is virtually identical to the Senate \nversion. Quoting the chief actuary:\n\n       There is a significant risk the problem of adverse \n     selection would make the CLASS program unsustainable.\n\n  For the first 10 years, the CLASS Act saves money. It saves money at \nthe beginning because it collects premiums before benefits start \ngetting paid out. But some time afterwards, it starts to lose money. We \nall know what happens from there. It will become the taxpayers' \nresponsibility to rescue the program as it fails. Look at financial \nstruggles of Social Security. Look at Medicare. Look at Medicaid. Now \ngo home and look at your children and grandchildren.\n  Creating an unsustainable CLASS Act is not a responsible thing to do \nfor our children and grandchildren. By adding the ticking time bomb of \nyet another unfunded liability to our children and grandchildren \nthrough the CLASS Act, this bill, again, does worse than nothing.\n  Health care is one-sixth of the economy. The American people do not \nwant a bill that makes the economy worse. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the Committee on Taxation, and even the Office of the \nActuary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have told \nus what the American people already knew: These massive partisan health \ncare reform bills are going to make the problem worse when it comes to \nthe cost of health insurance.\n  According to a September 22 letter from the Congressional Budget \nOffice to Chairman Baucus about the Finance Committee bill, CBO wrote:\n\n       Premiums in new insurance exchanges would tend to be higher \n     than the average premiums in the current law individual \n     market.\n\n  So according to CBO, after these bills spend $1 trillion, many of the \npeople struggling to afford their premiums today will actually end up \npaying more if this bill moves forward and is enacted. By increasing \ncosts when people desperately need Congress to lower costs, this bill \ndoes worse than nothing.\n  It does not have to be this way. When the debate began last year, \ninterested legislators of both parties set forth benchmarks that were \nno-brainers. Health care reform should lower the cost of premiums. It \nshould make health care more affordable. It should do so without \nMedicare cuts that jeopardize access to care for seniors. It should do \nso without overloading the Medicaid safety net until it rips. It should \ndo so without adding to the already unsustainable, unfunded liabilities \nby creating yet another unsustainable entitlement program. It should \nhave done all those things. That is what we intended to do when we \nstarted out.\n  Instead, this bill threatens the economic recovery. It is $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion of new taxes hurting small business and destroying job \ncreation. It calls for an even bigger and more unsustainable Federal \nbudget. It adds to that burden with a massive new government-run health \nplan. It makes health care more unaffordable and lowers quality.\n  I know some people believe we should get on to the bill and try to \nfix it by amendment. But this 2,000-page bill has many more problems \nthan can be fixed by amendment on the Senate floor.\n  If you want to improve it, it should be stopped right now and get \nback together where we were at one time. Democratic leaders and the \nWhite House have put together one extreme health care plan after \nanother. After the bailouts for Wall Street and Detroit, a stimulus \nbill that led to the highest unemployment in 26 years, and the Fed \nshoveling money out the door without any accountability, this health \ncare reform bill is the straw that broke the camel's back.\n  What Senate Republicans are trying to say tonight, with tonight's \nvote, is we don't support reform just for the sake of reform. Changes \nto the health care system must be responsible and not break the backs \nof the taxpayers and the job-creating engine in America, small \nbusiness.\n  It doesn't make any sense to make major new unsustainable commitments \nto entitlement spending. Already, Medicare's solvency is in jeopardy \nand the Reid bill would make things worse for Medicare. Seniors are in \na tough situation today with the way the economy has hit their \nretirement savings. We have to step back and remember it is not our \nmoney, it is their money. It is the taxpayers' money we are talking \nabout--$2\\1/2\\ trillion of taxpayers' dollars over the decade when this \nbill is fully implemented.\n  Generations of hard-working Americans will be forced to pay the \ncostly\n\n[[Page S11960]]\n\nprice for this bill if it moves forward. It is irresponsible for \nDemocratic leaders to use their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate \nand their control of the House and the White House to push through such \nmassive legislation, reshaping one-sixth of the American economy. The \nunintended consequences of this legislation could have a destabilizing \neffect at just the wrong time as America's economy struggles to recover \nand working families are doing everything in their power just to hold \non.\n  The late Senator Moynihan often warned about the perils of a majority \nparty pushing through major bills and changes in a partisan way. It is \na well-founded warning that Democratic leadership has not heeded--this \ntime, at least. If a bill like this one cannot get support more \nbroadly, then something is wrong with it.\n  Moreover, grassroots America has spoken out against this legislation. \nIt is alarming how those voices have been disregarded by congressional \nleaders. President Andrew Jackson made it clear that our duty is to \ntune in to the common sense of the American people who sent us here. I \nquote President Jackson:\n\n       Our Government is founded upon the intelligence of the \n     people. I, for one, do not despair of the republic. I have \n     great confidence in the virtue of the great majority of the \n     people, and I cannot fear the result.\n\n  Listen to what President Jackson said. Listen to the concerns of the \npeople. They are telling us to reconsider this massive, complicated \nlegislation and take a path that leads to less spending, less taxes, \nand less debt. Instead of continuing to mortgage the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren, we need to get back to basics. Congress \nshould pass commonsense medical malpractice reform to stop wasting so \nmuch money on defensive medicine. Congress should empower consumers to \nshop around for health care and lower costs with competition just like \nwith other services the consumers buy. Congress should make market \nreforms that help small businesses and the self-employed have greater \naccess to health insurance at an affordable rate.\n  These issues can be addressed without upending the entire health care \nsystem with the result of higher taxes, higher insurance premiums, and \ndeficits and debts that will get in the way of the opportunity that \nresults from the ingenuity and industry of the American people.\n  If we were sitting around a coffee shop in Springfield, IL, or Little \nRock, AR, and we were discussing health care reform and I told them we \nare talking about a bill that is going to raise taxes, cut Medicare, \nraise premiums, and not do anything about costs, they would say that is \nnot health care reform.\n  I encourage my colleagues to listen to the American people and to \nsend this bill back to the drawing board.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as morning broke over our Nation today, \nmillions of Americans woke to a typical, crisp fall day. It seemed \nordinary as shop-owners opened their local grocery stores; children \nfilled soccer fields and families made preparations for Thanksgiving \nholiday. It seemed ordinary. But today is anything but ordinary in the \nlife of our Nation.\n  We have all heard the phrase and repeated it so many times, that we \nhave almost grown numb to it--America is facing the worst economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression. Think about that for a minute. What \nthat really means is that for every single legislator in this Senate, \nwe are in unchartered territory.\n  We have never been here before and recent signs of a slow, unsteady \nand jobless recovery are troubling. And, the American people know it. \nIn a survey from this past week, 82 percent of Americans said that our \nNation's economic conditions are poor.\n  Consider the news reports from just yesterday that 14 percent of all \nmortgage loans--meaning 7.4 million households--were delinquent or in \nforeclosure in the last quarter. That is the highest number since the \nmortgage bankers industry began this survey in 1972.\n  Consider the unemployment rate--it reached a 26-year high of 10.2 \npercent in October. We lost 190,000 jobs in just the month of October \nalone. And, according to the Department of Labor's broadest measure, \nsome 17.5 percent of Americans are without a job entirely or \nunderemployed. We have shed 3.5 million jobs since January of this year \nand the average work-week is now down to 33 hours for the American \nworker.\n  It is against this backdrop that the Senate majority leader has \nchosen to bring up this health care bill. Health reform is a huge \nundertaking.\n  Every one of the 2,074 pages in this bill will have a dramatic impact \non the health care of every American. I have to tell you, that is a \nbridge. This is a bigger problem than anyone can imagine because it \nwill affect every single American. This bill represents a massive \ngovernment intrusion into the medical care of every American.\n  Under this bill, the government will review every employer health \ninsurance plan in the Nation to determine if it satisfies all of the \ngovernment mandated benefit requirements. If it does not, the \ngovernment will then tax many of those employers.\n  The government will also now determine whether it believes your \nhealth insurance costs too much. It will decide what benefits should be \ncovered and what preventive services you should receive.\n  Earlier this week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force \nrecommended that women under age 50 should not receive annual \nmammograms. Anyone who was concerned about this decision needs to \nunderstand that this bill empowers a task force just like that to \ndetermine which preventive services should be covered by every health \nplan in America.\n  As one of the only Members of the Senate to sit on both committees of \nhealth care jurisdiction, I understand the complexities at work in \ncomprehensive health care legislation. And I understand that this bill \ngets it wrong.\n  Instead of taking a step-by-step approach to health reform, \nidentifying consensus reforms where we can fix what is broken and leave \nwhat works, the majority leader has chosen a different approach. \nWithout Republican support and without the approval of a growing \nmajority of the American people, Senator Reid has chosen to shake \nnearly 20 percent of our economy in its foundation in attempting to jam \nthrough a strictly partisan bill.\n  This bill will increase our health care costs, do nothing to improve \nthe quality of our care, it will increase our Nation's debt and deficit \nand it will harm our Nation's tenuous job market.\n  There is no credible study and there will be no serious, unbiased \neconomist who will say that this bill will create jobs or strengthen \nour economy. And that is what the people in the most recent election \nsaid was mot important.\n  Recently, in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the dean of Harvard \nMedical School Dr. Jeffrey Flier gave the current health reforms a \n``failing grade.'' Dean Flier wrote about the reform bills being \ndebated in Congress, that ``there are no provisions to substantively \ncontrol the growth of costs or raise the quality of care. So the \noverall effort will fail to qualify as reform.''\n  Dean Flier went on to write:\n\n       In discussions with dozens of health care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care \n     spending rather than restrain it. Likewise, nearly all agree \n     that the legislation would do little or nothing to improve \n     quality or change health-care's dysfunctional delivery \n     system.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in its \nentirety in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. ENZI. With ratings of failed reform like the dean of the Harvard \nMedical School, why are we talking about taking the time to tweak a \nfailure of ideas so we can say we did something. We are not fooling the \nAmerican people. The voices of August are still echoing and coming from \na vast majority.\n  Other experts have weighed in on the provisions in the Reid bill and \ntheir potential impact on jobs. One such provision is the job-killing \ntax of $28 billion that will disproportionately fall on the backs of \nsmall business employers in the form of a mandate on employers to\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\nprovide Washington government-approved insurance.\n\n  This job-killing tax has been studied by the non-partisan score \nkeepers at the Congressional Budget Office as well as nationally \nrecognized economists and health experts. These experts have said that \nthe costs of this new tax will ultimately be paid by the American \nworking men and women.\n  Businesses that cannot afford to provide health insurance will pass \nthe costs of these new penalties on to their workers in the form of \nlower wages, reduced hours and jobs cut. Yes, this so-called health \nreform bill will threaten your jobs and if this vote is successful we \nwill spend weeks debating this bill. And just like committee work so \nfar, the majority will reject real solutions just like they have \nthrough the two amendment processes that have been merged to make this \nflawed bill.\n  According to one recent study by the Heritage Foundation, this new \njob-killing tax in the Reid bill will place more than 5 million low-\nincome workers at risk of losing their jobs or having their hours \nreduced and an additional 10 million workers could see lower wages and \nreduced benefits. At a time of unprecedented economic peril, the \nmajority has chosen to bring a bill to the Senate that will threaten \nour Nation's jobs and our economic growth.\n  This bill will also increase our Nation's growing debt and deficit. \nCurrently, our Nation's debt is greater than $112 trillion and our \ndeficit for fiscal year 2009 was greater than $1.4 trillion. As a \npercentage of the economy, our deficit is 10 percent of GDP--the \nhighest it has been since the Second World War. Once again, we are not \ndebating this bill in a vacuum. Rather, we are debating this bill at a \ntime when our credit card is maxed out.\n  I worry about the country that I am leaving for my children and \ngrandchildren. Our Nation is being buried under a mountain of debt, \nwhich poses a deadly threat to the future of our Nation.\n  The Federal Government will spend $1.4 trillion more than it receives \nin revenue this year. The government will make up that deficit by \nborrowing more money, mostly from China and other foreign governments.\n  These levels of debt are not sustainable and, our foreign creditors \nare beginning to recognize this fact. As our creditors grow more \nconcerned about our ability to pay our debt obligations, the interest \nrates we pay will grow. That means that it will soon cost us \nconsiderably more to allow Washington to continue to borrow the money \nit needs to fund its current spending binge.\n  With our current and growing debt, Congress should be concerned. \nThink about it--our most fundamental duty as Members of Congress is to \nwisely manage the power of the purse for our Nation. The Framers wisely \nput in place a process of appropriations that would be annually checked \nby the representatives of the American people here in Washington.\n  In this bill we create yet another stream of mandatory spending in \nperpetuity--or until it runs out--that is not reviewed by Congress on \nan annual basis.\n  I remind my colleagues that our Federal deficit is nearly nine times \nthe size of the deficit just 2 years ago. During the same 2-year \nperiod, our Nation lost 8 million private sector jobs. Our total \nFederal debt is now around 85 percent of GDP. According to David \nWalker, the former head of the Government Accountability Office, at the \nend of the fiscal year 2000, the Federal Government had about $20.4 \ntrillion in total liabilities and commitments and unfunded promises for \njust Social Security and Medicare. That number rose to $56.4 trillion \nat the end of fiscal year 2008. That is a 176-percent increase in only \n8 years. By the end of this year, that number is expected to rise to \n$63 trillion. With these staggering statistics, it is astonishing we \nare even debating the creation of a new entitlement obligation forever.\n  A couple days ago, Majority Leader Reid stated that this bill will be \ndeficit neutral, but you have to understand what that means. First, the \ntrue cost of this bill is hidden by implementing the massive middle-\nclass tax increases and Medicare cuts in the first year and pushing the \nmassive costs in health care subsidies out to the fifth year. \nRepublican Leader McConnell referred to this gimmick as being akin to \npaying a mortgage for 4 years before actually moving into the house. I \nwish to emphasize that a little bit. It is a gimmick. You collect the \nmoney to begin with, but you don't provide the benefits until further \ndown the road. Then you say: We covered all those costs. But when you \nextend it on out, it will not continue to cover those costs. So \ndisaster.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I am shocked to see that what \nwould constitute as fraud in the accounting world seems to be reason to \nhold a press conference to do a hollow boast. The gimmicks in this bill \nare stunning, whether it comes to implementation of the tax on so-\ncalled Cadillac health plans or the increased taxes or the $464 billion \nin Medicare cuts--Medicare cuts. We are already having a problem with \nMedicare solvency. It is going to go broke. We are going to take $464 \nbillion from Medicare. Then we are going to form a special commission \nand this commission will be able to tell us, on an annual basis, where \nwe can make cuts in Medicare so it doesn't go broke. But let's see, \nthere is a deal with the hospitals that they are not going to be \ntouched. There is a deal with the doctors that they will not be \ntouched; in fact, theirs is going to be increased. There is a deal with \nPhRMA where they will not be touched. Who does that leave? That means \ncutting benefits for seniors. They and home health care and nursing \nhomes are the only places you can cut it, if you let those other people \noff the hook. That is what the bill does.\n  When it comes to the long-term care provisions in this bill that \nBudget Committee Chairman Conrad has referred to as a Ponzi scheme, you \nhave to be a little bit worried. If Washington accounting had to come \nunder the same laws as private business, the administration and \nCongress would be in jail. To attempt to claim the mantle of fiscal \nresponsibility, the majority leader has jammed 10 pounds of entitlement \nspending into a 5-pound sack. Again, entitlement means the payments \nautomatically go on forever with no further review or constraint. That \nis not fiscal responsibility and the American people are not buying it. \nThey know, evidently better than we do, what we are talking about.\n  A large majority of Americans believe their prescription drug costs \nwill go up under this bill and that the cost of their premiums will go \nup. They are right. What the CBO score doesn't provide us with and \ncan't provide us with is the cost of this bill to each and every one of \nus. But we know that cost will be great. The CBO evaluation says it is \ngoing to be paid for. Paid for? That is an evaluation of whether it is \ngoing to cost the government anything. It is not an evaluation of \nwhether it is going to cost the people anything. The only place to get \nthat money is from the people or, in this case, also stealing it from \nMedicare. In order for this bill to reduce the deficit, the majority \nleader has to assume that the Medicare payments to physicians will be \ncut by 21 percent next year. He also has to assume these payments will \nbe annually cut another 5 percent for the next 9 years.\n  In order for this bill to reduce the deficit, the majority leader \nalso has to assume that more and more middle-class Americans will pay \nthis new tax on high-cost health insurance plans. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, 84 percent of the revenue collected by \nthis new tax will come from Americans earning less than $200,000 in \n2019. This reminds me of another tax which was originally intended to \ntarget just 155 individuals who made more than $200,000 and did not pay \nany income tax. Today the alternative minimum tax now hits millions of \nmiddle-class Americans, and every year Congress has to enact \nlegislation to prevent it from hitting millions more. This bill is \ndrafted that same way. It will creep up there and catch everybody in \nincreased taxes.\n  In order to believe that this bill will reduce the deficit, its \nsponsors must believe that future Congresses will allow millions of \nmiddle-class Americans to be subject to these new taxes. While the \nmajority leader claims all these things will happen, the American \npublic isn't fooled.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, the dean of Washington \njournalists, David Broder, not a politically conservative columnist and \nsomeone often\n\n[[Page S11962]]\n\ncited by the other side, pointed out that a recent survey found that \nless than one-fifth of the American people believe that health care \nreform will be deficit neutral over the next 10 years. By a 16-point \nmargin, the majority in this poll said they opposed the legislation \nmoving through Congress. Mr. Broder called this legislation a ``budget-\nbuster in the making.''\n  It is difficult to quantify the scope of this bill. I have heard some \nof my colleagues talk about how many years would elapse in 2\\1/2\\ \ntrillion seconds. I heard some of my colleagues talk about how many \ncars $2.5 trillion would buy or how many school districts it would fund \nor how many decades it would fund State budgets across America. I don't \nthink people are understanding how comprehensive this bill is that \nentails 100 percent of the people. That is the difficulty we in the \nGang of 6 had coming to any conclusion because it is so big that as we \nget into one area and scratch the surface and find out what we don't \nknow, it takes a lot of research time to get there to be able to make \nbasic decisions. But it was easy to cram into a bill and say: This \nsolves it, solves it for $1 trillion. We should never say $1 trillion \nbecause that sounds like one, and one is not a very big number.\n  It is $1,000 billion. We don't know what 1 billion is either, but 1 \nbillion is 1,000 million. So we are talking about a lot of money here.\n  Perhaps the best way to quantify this bill is, it keeps me up nights \nand, more importantly, these issues we are debating keep our \nconstituents up at night. I am sure everybody has been hearing from \ntheir constituents. We worry immensely about the cost and the \nobligations we are passing on to our children and grandchildren. Where \nis this bill taking our country, and will we have the courage in our \ntime to preserve and protect our Nation's great strengths for future \ngenerations? These are the questions that keep me up at night, and I \nknow these concerns are shared on the other side of the aisle. I sense \nit in conversations I have had with the senior Senator from Delaware \nand the senior Senator from Nebraska. I sensed it in my work over the \nsummer with the chairman of the Budget Committee. I know they share \nthese concerns on the other side. That is why I believe passionately \nthat we must defeat the motion to proceed on this bill.\n  I am sometimes an optimist, and I still hope we can start over and \nget to work on a bipartisan bill that has the trust and support of the \nAmerican people. Any major piece of legislation that has gone through \nthis body has done so in a bipartisan way. It has been necessary to get \nthe confidence of the American people. They don't have confidence in \nCongress right now. This bill is not helping.\n  We say we are spending our children and grandchildren's money. \nActually, we are doing that plus spending seniors' money. When you take \nthat Medicare money, that is what you are doing. The seniors have \nfigured it out. That is why it was so raucous in August and ever since. \nThey have been concerned about their future and the promises made to \nthem. We have a system that is going broke, and then we are going to \ntake money from it. We ought to back up and make sure Medicare money \ngoes to Medicare. I know part of that is listed as fraud and abuse. I \nam always fascinated when government talks about fraud and abuse \nbecause we talk about it, but if we have known that these billions of \ndollars of fraud and abuse were out there, why haven't we been \ncollecting that money? Once we turn it over to the government to do \nthat, it is no longer needed. Well, it is needed to pay the bills, but \nit is no longer that much of a care because the paid-for has already \nbeen taken care of.\n  There ought to at least be a separate account set up that you have to \nactually collect the fraud and abuse money before you can spend it, but \nwe are not going to do that.\n  Every senior can tell you some instances of fraud and abuse that they \nthink are happening, and we have passed those on. I see some effort to \ncollect that but not a lot.\n  As many of my colleagues know, before I came to the Senate, I was a \nsmall business owner. My wife and I owned three small shoestores in \nWyoming and Montana. When I was showing someone a shoe and he or she \nsaid they didn't like it or couldn't afford it, I didn't try to give \nthem a sales pitch. I knew it was time to try to find another shoe, one \nthey liked and could afford. There is a lesson from this in this health \ncare bill. The people of America are complaining, and we are showing \nthem the shoe we want to show them. They don't want to see that shoe. \nThey said: We thought you were going to lower my costs. Every person \nout there thought they were going to have the benefit of reduced costs, \nand they are not seeing it in this bill. They wanted to help out other \npeople, and some of that is in here, to a limited extent. But that \nisn't the main thing that they expected to have happen from this. Small \nbusinesses out there are particularly hurting, and this will react on \nsmall businesses, those shoestores all over the United States, the \ngrocery stores, the dry cleaners. This is even going to affect doctors. \nThey are small businesses, for the most part.\n  So there is a lesson in this story when it comes to reforming health \ncare. It is time to listen to the customers and find the alternative \nthey expected, that they wanted, and they can afford.\n  Probably the biggest help to me in legislating has been the \nexperience of working in a shoestore. The people tell you what they \nwant, and they have told us what they want. We haven't listened. If you \nwant to make the sale, you better listen. You better see how your \ninventory matches what they want. We haven't checked the inventory or \nwe have said: We don't have anything in here that you need, but we have \nsome things to take care of other people. That is not going to sell.\n  We have a big decision to make tonight. It will have a lasting effect \non our country, a lasting effect in that if the motion to proceed \npasses, we are going to debate it for a long time. A bill this size \ndeserves a lot of time. It is necessary. And it is more comprehensive \nthan we are going to be able to get into, no matter how long we debate \nit.\n\n  So the American people are going to be surprised at the time we waste \nwhen we could be solving jobs and the economy, which is their biggest \nconcern at the present time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 Health ``Reform'' Gets a Failing Grade\n\n                         (By Jeffrey S. Flier)\n\n       As the dean of Harvard Medical School I am frequently asked \n     to comment on the health-reform debate. I'd give it a failing \n     grade.\n       Instead of forthrightly dealing with the fundamental \n     problems, discussion is dominated by rival factions \n     struggling to enact or defeat President Barack Obama's \n     agenda. The rhetoric on both sides is exaggerated and often \n     deceptive. Those of us for whom the central issue is health--\n     not politics--have been left in the lurch. And as controversy \n     heads toward a conclusion in Washington, it appears that the \n     people who favor the legislation are engaged in collective \n     denial.\n       Our health-care system suffers from problems of cost, \n     access and quality, and needs major reform. Tax policy drives \n     employment-based insurance; this begets overinsurance and \n     drives costs upward while creating inequities for the \n     unemployed and self-employed. A regulatory morass limits \n     innovation. And deep flaws in Medicare and Medicaid drive \n     spending without optimizing care.\n       Speeches and news reports can lead you to believe that \n     proposed congressional legislation would tackle the problems \n     of cost, access and quality. But that's not true. The various \n     bills do deal with access by expanding Medicaid and mandating \n     subsidized insurance at substantial cost--and thus addresses \n     an important social goal. However, there are no provisions to \n     substantively control the growth of costs or raise the \n     quality of care. So the overall effort will fail to qualify \n     as reform.\n       In discussions with dozens of health-care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care \n     spending rather than restrain it. Likewise, nearly all agree \n     that the legislation would do little or nothing to improve \n     quality or change health-care's dysfunctional delivery \n     system. The system we have now promotes fragmented care and \n     makes it more difficult than it should be to assess outcomes \n     and patient satisfaction. The true costs of health care are \n     disguised, competition based on price and quality are almost \n     impossible, and patients lose their ability to be the \n     ultimate judges of value.\n       Worse, currently proposed federal legislation would \n     undermine any potential for real innovation in insurance and \n     the provision of care. It would do so by overregulating the \n     health-care system in the service of special\n\n[[Page S11963]]\n\n     interests such as insurance companies, hospitals, \n     professional organizations and pharmaceutical companies, \n     rather than the patients who should be our primary concern.\n       In effect, while the legislation would enhance access to \n     insurance, the trade-off would be an accelerated crisis of \n     health-care costs and perpetuation of the current \n     dysfunctional system--now with many more participants. This \n     will make an eventual solution even more difficult. \n     Ultimately, our capacity to innovate and develop new \n     therapies would suffer most of all.\n       There are important lessons to be learned from recent \n     experience with reform in Massachusetts. Here, insurance \n     mandates similar to those proposed in the federal legislation \n     succeeded in expanding coverage but--despite initial \n     predictions--increased total spending.\n       A ``Special Commission on the Health Care Payment System'' \n     recently declared that the Massachusetts healthcare payment \n     system must be changed over the next five years, most likely \n     to one involving ``capitated'' payments instead of the \n     traditional fee-for-service system. Capitation means that \n     newly created organizations of physicians and other health-\n     care providers will be given limited dollars per patient for \n     all of their care, allowing for shared savings if spending is \n     below the targets. Unfortunately, the details of this massive \n     change--necessitated by skyrocketing costs and a desire to \n     improve quality--are completely unspecified by the \n     commission, although a new Massachusetts state bureaucracy \n     clearly will be required.\n       Yet it's entirely unclear how such unspecified changes \n     would impact physician practices and compensation, hospital \n     organizations and their capacity to invest, and the ability \n     of patients to receive the kind and quality of care they \n     desire. Similar challenges would eventually confront the \n     entire country on a more explosive scale if the current \n     legislation becomes law.\n       Selling an uncertain and potentially unwelcome outcome such \n     as this to the public would be a challenging task. It is \n     easier to assert, confidently but disingenuously, that \n     decreased costs and enhanced quality would result from the \n     current legislation.\n       So the majority of our representatives may congratulate \n     themselves on reducing the number of uninsured, while quietly \n     understanding this can only be the first step of a multiyear \n     process to more drastically change the organization and \n     funding of health care in America. I have met many people for \n     whom this strategy is conscious and explicit.\n       We should not be making public policy in such a crucial \n     area by keeping the electorate ignorant of the actual road \n     ahead.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the bill we have before us today is a \n2,074-page, multi-trillion-dollar bill written in the dark of night. \nThis process brings back the worst of Washington. The substance of the \nbill raises taxes during a recession, compromises individual health \ncare choices, cuts Medicare to pay for the uninsured and will \neventually explode the deficit--the combination of which will \njeopardize the finest health care system in the world without lowering \ncosts. Today we are voting on the motion to proceed to the bill and I \nwill vote no because this bill is broken beyond repair. Instead of \nproceeding to a flawed bill, we should stop and start over.\n  Despite President Obama's repeated statements that Democrats would \nlegislate in an open and transparent manner, this bill was drafted in \nsecret and Republicans were excluded. As a candidate and now as \nPresident Obama, he even went so far as to tell the American people \nthat the negotiations would be broadcast live on C-SPAN. Instead of the \nchange Americans thought they voted for, we have gotten more of the \nsame.\n  The bill we are moving to consider will cost $2.5 trillion once fully \nimplemented; nearly three times the official CBO score of $848 billion. \nThe Democrats are playing a shell game to hide the true cost of this \nlegislation. With this bill we get 10 years of taxes and only 6 years \nof programs. While some may claim that the bill is deficit neutral, the \nFederal Government's financial commitment to health care under this \nbill actually grows. Health care costs are not contained or reduced, \nthey are simply offset by reductions and tax increases elsewhere in the \nFederal ledger.\n  A central premise of this legislation is that Congress will allow \nnearly half a trillion dollars in Medicare cuts to go into effect. \nCongress has not had the political will to allow these types of cuts to \nstand in the past, so why should we believe that future Congresses will \nnot follow suit. Case in point, the ``doc fix.'' When we passed the \nBalanced Budget Act in 1997, we included a formula to limit the cost \ngrowth in physician spending in Medicare. Congress allowed that formula \nto reduce payments to physicians only once and has not done so again. \nWe leave the flawed formula in place and each year we act to block the \nscheduled cuts to physician payments instead of fixing the problem. \nThis bill increases doctor payments by half a percent in 2010 and then \nassumes a 23-percent cut in 2011, budget gimmickry at its finest.\n  Medicare is currently $36 trillion in the hole, but as we have seen, \nCongress doesn't have the will to cut Medicare by fifty cents, much \nless $500 billion. When we tried to rein in Medicare costs in the \nbudget in 2007, we proposed $33 billion in savings and only got two \ndozen votes.\n  In a nod to Congress' traditional actions, or lack thereof, Democrats \neven included an Independent Medicare Advisory Board that can cut \nMedicare provider payments if Congress fails to act. Cutting an already \ncash-strapped program is not the way to finance health care for the \nuninsured.\n  In addition to the nearly half trillion dollars in cuts contained in \nthis bill, we get a half trillion dollars in new and increased taxes. \nThe bill would tax Americans who choose higher cost insurance plans, it \nwould tax employers for not providing health coverage, it would tax \nAmericans for not buying health coverage, and it would increase the \nMedicare payroll tax on some Americans to fund a new health care \nentitlement program. In the midst of the worst recession this country \nhas seen in decades, how can these job-killing tax increases be \njustified?\n  I believe the provisions contained in this bill are bad for America. \nWe must work to enact policies that preserve patient access to care, \nrein in ever increasing costs in the health system while ensuring the \nviability of current programs, and promote choice. This bill is a \nbudget buster that does none of those things.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a noted psychologist once said:\n\n       To be mature means to face, and not evade, [a] crisis. . . \n     .\n\n  Our health care system is in a crisis. This crisis has been decades \nin the making, and history has made clear that this crisis will not \nsolve itself. It is time for us to face the crisis. It is time for \nCongress to show mature leadership. It is time for us to reform health \ncare, once and for all.\n  For years now, we have prepared for this moment. The Finance \nCommittee and the HELP Committee studied the issues thoroughly. We have \nheld nearly 70 hearings, roundtables, and walk-throughs. We have \nstudied this issue very thoroughly and exhaustively. We each produced a \nblueprint for reform--each committee--and we worked together with \nLeader Reid and President Obama to combine those blueprints into one \nsolid plan. This week, tonight, we have brought that plan to the Senate \nfloor. Tonight, we seek to begin that momentous debate. Tonight, we \nseek, at last, to face the crisis.\n  We have a bill that will put Americans, patients, and their doctors \nback in control. We have a bill that will end harmful insurance \nindustry practices. Under our bill, no longer will insurance companies \nbe allowed to deny you health insurance. No longer will insurance \ncompanies be allowed to hike up rates for Americans with preexisting \nconditions, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes. No longer will \nhealth insurance companies be able to take away your health insurance \nor reduce benefits when people get sick. Under our bill, no longer will \ninsurance companies be able to limit the amount of health care you can \nuse in a lifetime. No longer will insurance companies be able to put \nunreasonable limits on the amount of health care you can use in 1 year. \nIf you pay your bill, the insurance company must renew your coverage \nand provide your benefits. No longer will insurance companies be able \nto discriminate based on gender or health status. No longer will \ninsurance companies be able to charge more for women or for people who \nare sick.\n  Our bill will also require insurance companies to disclose the share \nof premiums that goes to medical benefits. That is new and very \nimportant. No longer will insurance companies receive tax credits when \nthey use their profits to provide excessive executive paychecks.\n\n[[Page S11964]]\n\n  Our bill is fully paid for. It is fiscally responsible. It will lower \nhealth care costs, and it will reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, our bill will reduce \nthe deficit by $130 billion in the first 10 years. Over the next \ndecade, it will further reduce the deficit by about one-quarter of 1 \npercent of gross domestic product. That is hundreds of billions of \ndollars in deficit reduction.\n  As well, our bill will provide billions in tax cuts for American \nfamilies and small businesses. Our bill will create new marketplaces \ncalled insurance exchanges. Individuals and small businesses will be \nable, quickly and easily, to view, compare, and buy health insurance \nplans.\n  Today, many Americans already receive quality health care coverage \nthrough their employers. Many are happy with their current insurance \nplans. This bill will not change that. We keep the best of our current \nhealth care system. People who are satisfied with their current health \ninsurance coverage will be able to keep it. But too many others do not \nhave access to insurance, to quality insurance. For too many, this \nsystem is broken.\n  Under our bill, new exchanges will provide one-stop shops where plans \nare presented in a simple, consistent format. Americans will be able to \nknow exactly what they are buying. Insurance companies will have to \ncompete on price and on quality, not on their ability to select the \nhealthiest people or hide restrictions. Americans will be able to count \non the health care coverage they buy. And tax credits will help to \nensure all Americans can afford quality health insurance.\n  Small businesses will also have access to exchanges and tax credits. \nThrough small business exchanges, these companies will be able to pool \ntogether to spread their risk, increase their leverage, and enhance \ntheir choice, just as big companies do.\n  Members of Congress will be required to buy their health insurance \nthrough the same exchanges that people in their own States use--exactly \nthe same. No longer will there be a separate congressional health plan.\n  Our bill will strengthen Medicare. It will improve benefits for \nseniors. And it will help to ensure Medicare is sustainable for future \ngenerations. Our bill will cut costs, but it will not cut benefits. Our \nbill will increase Medicare benefits. Our bill will provide seniors \nwith free preventive care and wellness checkups. It will improve care \nfor seniors with chronic conditions. And it will provide a 50-percent \ndiscount on brand-name prescription drugs to help close the doughnut \nhole, the gap in benefits in the Medicare prescription drug program.\n  Our plan is a good, commonsense answer to the crisis facing American \nfamilies and businesses.\n  On this floor, here in the Senate, tonight, we have a historic \nopportunity to consider this plan. We have the chance to make it even \nbetter. We hope to have a full debate. But more important than the \nprocess or rhetoric, we have the opportunity, at last, to face the \ncrisis. We have the opportunity to show mature leadership. At long \nlast, we have the opportunity, the historic opportunity, to reform \nhealth care, once and for all. History is knocking on the door. Let's \nopen it. Let's begin the debate to improve this bill before us today \nand provide the service all Americans expect us to perform when they \nelect us to this office.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of this melded \nbill, drafted and put together by our distinguished leader, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act.\n  Before I begin with some brief remarks, let me extend my heartfelt \nthanks to our majority leader for his tireless work and thank Max \nBaucus of Montana for his tireless work and the members of the \ncommittees who have worked over the past many months to bring us to \nthis moment.\n  Others this evening have spoken with great eloquence, in my view, \nabout the provisions of this bill, what we hope to achieve for our \nfellow citizens with the adoption of this legislation.\n  I commend the Senate HELP Committee, which did such heroic work \nduring the writing of our portion of the bill--my colleagues, Tom \nHarkin of Iowa, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Jeff Bingaman of New \nMexico, Patty Murray of the State of Washington, and so many others.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues on that committee as well. While we \ndid not end up with a bipartisan vote at the end of that very long \nprocess, we did end up adopting more than 160 amendments offered by my \nRepublican colleagues to that bill, which I think strengthened the \nlegislation, made it a better piece of legislation, and many of which \nare a part of this legislation this evening.\n  I also want to pause for a moment, if I can, to recognize a colleague \nwho is here tonight only in spirit, Ted Kennedy. So much has been said \nand written about his lifelong quest to ensure that every American--\nevery American--has decent health care. Tonight and in the days to \ncome, we will pay him the highest compliment, as our colleague, by \nfulfilling that quest of achieving the goal all Americans aspire for; \nthat is, a national health care plan that serves every one of our \ncitizens.\n  I would like to speak briefly, if I could, to the American people who \nare at home this evening and I suspect are just tuning in to this \ndebate.\n  This important vote will occur momentarily. Why does this issue and \nthis debate matter? Why are we here on a Saturday evening? But then \nagain, for that matter, why are you watching C-SPAN on a Saturday \nevening, I might add?\n  Well, for one thing, health care represents one-sixth of our economy \nand affects 100 percent, as we all know, of the population of this \ncountry. And it is true that skyrocketing health care costs are the \nsingle biggest threat to the financial future of our fellow citizens.\n  But the reason tonight's vote is so historic, beyond those last two \npoints, is that never, ever before--never before--has this body, \nelected to serve the American people, confronted directly this simple \ntruth: Nothing, absolutely nothing, matters more to you and to your \nfamily than the ability to get the health care you need, when you need \nit, from the doctor you choose, at the price you can afford.\n  Health care is our most basic need. Health care is the most basic \ncommitment we should be willing to make to each other. No matter what \nyour family finances, no matter what your hopes and dreams are, no \nmatter who you are or where you live or what your job is in America, in \nour 21st century America, you should be able to get the care you need.\n  But for too many American families--perhaps your family, as you watch \nthis tonight from your homes--health care has become your most basic \nfear. If you do not have health insurance, you go to bed every single \nnight knowing that if you wake up sick or your child does, you might \nnot be able to see that doctor or afford one if you can even find one. \nEven if you have health insurance, you are paying more and more in \npremiums and getting less and less coverage for your money.\n  Millions of you are seeing your premiums skyrocket. Yet you lie awake \nat night--millions do--wondering: What if I lose my job? What if I get \nsick and find out my policy does not cover the costs and the care I \nneed--or, even worse, your insurance company cancels your policy \naltogether? What if you run out of benefits and have to pay out of your \npocket? I wish I could say these fears are irrational fears, but they \nare not. There is nothing irrational about those fears. Insurance does \nnot allow you to be sure of anything these days.\n  Our system, all 100 of us here know, is broken. People are losing \ntheir homes because they get sick. People are dying because they cannot \nafford the cure. This is just not acceptable in our America. That is \nwhy we are here on a Saturday night.\n  If you have watched the news over the past few months, you have \nprobably noticed there is a wide range of opinions on how we should fix \nthings. And that is as it should be. We need all the good ideas we can \nget, and hopefully this debate will produce that. But if you have also \nwatched the debate in the Senate over the last 2 days, you have \nprobably noticed something else as well. I don't believe a single \nperson in this body has stood up at any point and said we are OK doing \nnothing at all. Therefore, in the weeks ahead we will have a full and \nopen debate about every provision of this bill.\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\n  But tonight's vote is nothing more than a choice--a choice between \ndoing something or doing nothing. I urge my colleagues this evening to \njoin us, hopefully unanimously, to say we should do something. We \nshould do something about this most basic right that all Americans \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Nation is watching the Senate \ntonight. The American people know how important this vote is. They have \nseen the bill the Democratic leaders want to impose upon them, and they \nwant to know where the rest of us will stand.\n  This bill itself is a massive monument to bureaucracy and spending. \nBut at its core it is quite simple. At a moment when more than 1 of 10 \nworking Americans is looking for a job, at the time when the Chinese \nare lecturing us about our debt, this bill--this bill right here--costs \n$2\\1/2\\ trillion the government doesn't have and cannot afford. It \nimposes punishing taxes on almost everyone. It raises health insurance \npremiums on the 85 percent of Americans who already have health \ninsurance. And if that were not bad enough, it slashes Medicare by $\\1/\n2\\ trillion. Anyone who votes aye tonight is voting for all of these \nthings.\n  It is a fact: A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in \nfavor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst \nof double-digit unemployment. A vote in favor of proceeding to this \nbill is a vote to raise health insurance premiums on people who were \ntold--they were told--that they could expect their health insurance \ncosts to go down. A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote \nin favor of deep cuts to Medicare for tens of millions of seniors who \ndepend on it totally. A vote to proceed to this bill is a vote to \ncontinue the completely out-of-control spending binge this Congress has \nbeen on all year. A vote in favor of this bill tells every American \nfamily sitting in a waiting room tonight, wondering when they will get \nto see a doctor or how much it is going to cost: It is not our concern. \nWorst of all, a vote in favor of this bill is a vote in favor of the \nspending binge that is leading to a massive and unsustainable, long-\nterm debt that will shackle our children to a future they can't afford.\n  That is what tonight's vote is all about. If it weren't, none of us \nwould be here on a Saturday night with the Nation watching and waiting \nto see what we do. They are watching because they know that none of \nthis--none of this--is inevitable.\n  All it takes is one vote--just one. The simple math is this: If there \nwere one Democrat, just one of our friends on the other side of the \naisle, just one who would say no tonight, none of this would happen. \nThe voices of the American people would be heard. We have seen all the \nsurveys. We know how they feel. If one Democrat were to say no tonight, \nhe would be saying no to the premium increases, no to the tax cuts, no \nto the Medicare cuts--just one on the other side of the aisle. Then we \ncould start over with a commonsense, step-by-step approach to fix the \nproblem that got us here in the first place, and that is that health \ncare costs too much.\n  That is the sad irony of this whole debate. The problem that got us \nhere is that health care costs are out of control. Yet the neutral, \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the scorekeeper around here, \nsays under this bill--this massive bill--health care costs are actually \ngoing to go up, not down, and the American people thought that is what \nthis whole debate was about in the first place. So 2,074 pages and \ntrillions of dollars later--2,074 pages and trillions of dollars \nlater--this bill doesn't even meet the basic goal the American people \nhad in mind in what they thought this debate was all about--to lower \ncosts. This bill will actually make the situation worse, and now we are \nabout to vote on it.\n  We have heard some Senators come to the floor today and say that they \noppose this bill, but they don't want to stop the debate. They oppose \nthe bill, but they don't want to stop the debate. Nobody is suggesting \nwe stop the debate. No one. Not a single Senator on this side of the \naisle have I heard suggest that we stop the debate. But if we don't \nstop this bill tonight, the only debate we will be having--the only \ndebate we will be having--is about higher premiums, not savings for the \nAmerican people; higher taxes instead of lower costs, and cuts to \nMedicare rather than improving seniors' care. That is what the debate \nwill be about.\n  The American people and 40 of us in this room sitting on this side of \nthe aisle are not asking to end the debate. That is not what we have in \nmind, to end the debate. What we want to do is change the debate--not \nend it, change it--because once we get on this bill, ladies and \ngentlemen, the basic dimensions will not change. The basic dimensions \nwill not change.\n  So I ask: Why should we consider a bill we already know the American \npeople oppose? This is not anything anybody is in doubt about. The \nAmerican people think if you don't like this bill, you have an \nobligation to try to stop it, and that opportunity will come at 8 \no'clock.\n  I am sure this won't come as a surprise to any Member of the Senate, \nbut it is going to take 60 votes to change this bill. That means the \nbill as introduced--this bill we are looking at right here--will \nfundamentally be the bill we will be asked to pass sometime in the \nfuture. That is a fact.\n  After tonight's vote we will all go home and face our constituents. \nWe will have to tell them how we voted on raising their premiums, \nraising their taxes, and cutting their Medicare. For some of us, that \nis not going to be a very easy conversation, but it doesn't have to be \nthat way. If you want to lower costs and premiums, then we can work \ntogether step by step and pass the commonsense reforms the American \npeople have been asking for all along.\n  We can end junk lawsuits against doctors and hospitals which drive up \ncosts. We can encourage healthy choices such as prevention and wellness \nprograms which hold down costs. We can lower costs by letting consumers \nbuy coverage across State lines. We can allow small businesses to band \ntogether to get lower insurance rates. And certainly we can address the \nrampant--absolutely rampant--waste, fraud, and abuse that drives up \ncosts. All of those, my colleagues, are changes worth making.\n  The American people are looking at the Senate tonight. They are \nhoping we say no to this bill so we can start on a better plan that \nfixes the problem the American people care about most, and that is \ncost. They want us to start over. There is nothing about this massive \nbill they like. They want us to start over. They want us to address \ntheir real concerns. All it would take, Mr. President and my \ncolleagues, is one Member of the other side of the aisle--just one--to \ngive us an opportunity not to end the debate but to change the debate \nin the direction the American people would like us to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my dear friend, the Republican leader, has \nhad since Wednesday to read this bill. Obviously he hasn't done so \nbecause the facts he is talking about do not exist except in the minds \nof a few people who don't understand this legislation.\n  For 200 years we have styled ourselves the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Deliberation necessarily implies discussion and \ngreat issues, necessarily requires great debate. Today we vote on \nwhether to even discuss one of the greatest issues of our generation; \nindeed, one of the greatest issues this body has ever faced: whether \nthis Nation will finally guarantee its people the right to live free \nfrom fear of illness and death which can be prevented by decent health \ncare for all. In the coming weeks, we will finally put people, not \ninsurance companies, in charge of their lives.\n  The road to this point has been started many times. It has never been \ncompleted. Merging two such large and consequential bills has never \nbeen done before. It has been an enormous undertaking and we would not \nbe in this position without the unflagging dedication of many Senators \nand extremely loyal staff members. At the top of the list are Chairmen \nBaucus and Dodd who have shown dedication and determination in recent \nweeks and months that has rarely been seen.\n  I am proud of every single Senator's input, and I am especially proud \nof the two most recent classes of Senators. Elected with strong \nmandates for\n\n[[Page S11966]]\n\nprogress, they have demonstrated a studious approach to our historic \nendeavor and an unwavering belief that all Americans should be able to \nafford to live a healthy life.\n  I wish to explain why we are holding this important vote at this \nhour. As a matter of principle that I respect, the senior Senator from \nArkansas insisted we vote only after Senators had time to read and \nunderstand this bill. Senators all have now had ample time to do so. \nThat is because of the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln, of Arkansas.\n  As I have done many times this year privately, personally, as well as \npublicly, I again invite my Republican colleagues to join on the right \nside of history. I, again, invite them to join us, at the very least, \nin a debate about our future.\n  Around dining room tables in Nevada and across the Nation, families \nare agonizing over what to sacrifice next to buy health insurance. They \nare questioning whether to fill a prescription or go without it and \nhope for the best. Employers are wondering whether they can afford to \nprovide health care to their employees. They are asking how their \nbusinesses can survive while health care costs grow faster than ever. \nAmericans need health insurance reform.\n  Debate is constant between television commentators and the editorial \npages of great newspapers and magazines. The only place where silence \nis even considered is in the Senate of the United States.\n  Tonight--finally--we have the opportunity to bring this debate where \nit belongs. We finally have the opportunity to bring this great \ndeliberation to this great deliberative body. That--and nothing more--\nis what tonight's vote does. A ``yes'' vote says to America: I know \nthis issue is important to your family and to our country, and the \nSenate should, at the very least, talk about it.\n  Let's be real transparent. Beyond all the hype, the hyperbole, and \nthe hyperventilation, that--and nothing more--is what tonight's vote \ndoes. A ``yes'' vote says to America: I know this issue is important to \nyour family and to our country, and the Senate should at least talk \nabout it.\n  Some of my Republican friends would like the American people to think \nthat voting to debate the bill is voting to pass the bill. Any high \nschool civics textbook will tell you that suggestion is absolutely \nfalse. Tonight's vote is not the end of the debate, it is only the \nbeginning of the debate.\n  It is clear by now that my Republican colleagues have no problem \ntalking about health care in press conferences, radio interviews, \ntelevision interviews, and townhall meetings. My distinguished \ncounterpart, the Republican leader, has given many speeches in this \nChamber on the issue of health care reform.\n  Yet now that we have the actual legislation to debate, to amend, and \nbuild on--now that we have a plan on paper and not just wild rumors--\nwill they refuse to debate?\n  After all, if we are not debating, if we refuse to let the Senate do \nits job, what are we doing here? If Senators refuse to debate about a \nprofound crisis affecting every single citizen, the Nation must ask, \nwhat do you fear? In whose voice do you speak? In whose interest do you \nvote?\n  Surely, deliberating health reform cannot be more difficult than \ndeciding, as Americans have to do, whether to pay your mortgage or your \nmedical bills. It can't be more painful than not taking your child to \nthe doctor because it costs too much. It cannot be more humbling than \nfacing your own employees and telling them: I am sorry, you can't count \non me for your health insurance next year. You are on your own.\n  It can't be more upsetting than having an insurance company take away \nyour coverage at the exact moment you need it the most.\n  My Republican friends, there is nothing to fear in debate. President \nKennedy once said:\n\n       Let us not be afraid of debate or discussion. Let us \n     encourage it.\n\n  Be not afraid of debate. It is our job, and it is exactly what the \nlegislative process is all about--discussing, amending, improving. We \nDemocrats stand ready to do what needs to be done. We welcome debate, \nencourage debate.\n  Does any Senator seriously think the Founders conceived the Senate \nrules in the hopes that legislation would never be deliberated? Of \ncourse not.\n  Did the Framers of the Constitution explicitly enumerate the powers \nof the Senate but in truth hope this body would avoid the hardest and \nmost urgent questions of the day? Of course not.\n  Did our Nation's visionaries build this Capitol Building and design \nthis great Chamber we stand in tonight only so it would remain dark and \nsilent? Quite to the contrary.\n  Imagine if, instead of debating either of the historic GI bills--\nlegislation that has given so many brave Americans the chance to attend \ncollege--this body stood silent. Imagine if, instead of debating the \nbills that created Social Security or Medicare, the Senate voices had \nbeen stilled.\n  Imagine if, instead of debating whether to abolish slavery, instead \nof debating whether giving women and minorities a right to vote, those \nwho disagreed had muted discussion and killed any vote.\n  I say to my Republican Senators, don't try to silence a great debate \nover a great crisis. Don't let history show that when given the chance \nto debate and defend your position and work with us for the good of our \nconstituents, you ran and hid. You cannot wish away a great emergency \nby closing your eyes and pretending it doesn't exist.\n  There is an emergency that exists, and it exists now. The right \nresponse to disagreement is not dismissal, it is discussion. Democracy \nis discussion. Democracy needs deliberation. Let us debate our \ndifferences. On some, we will find common ground; on others, we may \nnot. But let's at least tell America their legislators in the Senate \nare willing to find where we can come together.\n  Nobel Prize awardee Andre Sakharov, one of the great thinkers of the \npast century, knew that when opposing sides come together, some of \ntheir ideas can outweigh its parts. Sakharov said:\n\n       Profound thoughts arise only in debate, with a possibility \n     of counter-argument. . . .\n\n  So come on, my friends, let us share our ideas in the Senate. Let us \nlegislate. Let us negotiate. Let us deliberate. Let us debate. Our \ncountry cries for this debate. Our country deserves this debate. Our \ncountry needs this debate.\n  I extend my great appreciation to the truly tireless men and women at \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senate HELP Committee, Congressional \nBudget Office, Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the White House:\n\n\n                      Congressional Budget Office\n\n       Doug Elmendorf, Director; Holly Harvey, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis; Kate Massey, Unit Chief, Low-\n     Income Health Programs and Prescription Drugs Cost Estimates; \n     Tom Bradley, Unit Chief, Health Systems and Medicare Cost \n     Estimates; Phil Ellis, Unit Chief, Health Policy Analysis; \n     Jean Hearne, Lara Robillard, Lori Housman, Mindy Cohen, \n     Stephanie Cameron, and the rest of their staffs.\n\n\n                Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel\n\n       Jim Fransen, Bill Baird, Ruth Ernst, John Goetcheus, Kelly \n     Malone, Mark Mathieson, Mark McGunagle, Stacy Kern-Scheerer, \n     Allison Otto, and the rest of their staffs.\n\n\n                      Joint Committee on Taxation\n\n       Thomas Barthold, Adam Block, John Bloyer, Tanya Butler, Jim \n     Cilke, Tom Dowd, Robert Harvey, Marjorie Hoffman, Melanie \n     Houser, Deirdre James, Rachel Levy, Julie Marshall, Pam \n     Moomau, John Navratil, Ned Newland, Mary Risler, Cecily Rock, \n     Bernard Schmitt, Chris Simmons, Carrie Simons, Lori Stuntz, \n     Kristeen Witt.\n\n\n                Department of Health and Human Services\n\n       Jeanne Lambrew, Meena Seshamani, Caya Lewis.\n\n\n               Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n       Erin Clapton, Ira Burney, Amy Hall, Maria Martino, Isabella \n     Leung, Anne Scott, Nancy DeLew, Sharon Arnold, Allison Orris, \n     Jennifer Snow, Jill Gotts, Chantelle Britton, Molly Long, \n     Adam Aten, Lisa Joldersma, Sylvia Yu, Laura McWright, Greg \n     Jones, Dan Miller, Ariel Novick, Rick Foster.\n       Program Experts in the following offices/centers (in \n     alphabetical order): Center for Drug and Health Plan Choices \n     (Tim Hill); Center for Medicare Management (Jon Blum, Liz \n     Richter); Center for Medicaid & State Operations (Cindy Mann, \n     Penny Thompson); Office of Clinical Standards & Quality \n     (Barry Straube); Office of E-Standards and Services\n\n[[Page S11967]]\n\n     (Tony Trenkle); Office of Financial Management (Deborah \n     Taylor); Office of General Counsel (Janice Hoffman); Office \n     of Legislation; Office of Research, Development and \n     Information (Tim Love).\n\n\n                            The White House\n\n       Nancy-Ann DeParle, Mike Hash.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we just did one of the most important \nthings I have ever done in my professional life, and I join my \ncolleagues in noting that. We have taken a major step in doing several \nthings today--in providing health insurance to tens of millions of \nAmericans who don't have insurance, in building consumer protections \naround 80 percent of Americans who are insured so people will no longer \nbe disqualified from preexisting conditions, no more discrimination \nbased on gender.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows from his work in Minnesota, women pay \nsignificantly higher health insurance premiums than men on average. \nThose days are behind us. There will no longer be lifetime caps so if \nsomebody gets sick and their cost of treatment--from physician care, \nfrom hospital visits--so high, the insurance company chooses to do what \nthey call rescission, cutting their insurance coverage off, those days \nare behind us, once we move forward with this bill.\n  Tonight is the first step. Even though none of my Republican \ncolleagues, not 1 of the 39 who voted, not 1 of them wanted to proceed \nwith the debate, clearly the country wanted us to move forward. Now \neverybody has a fair shot. If they don't like the public option, they \ncan try to get rid of it. If they don't like the way we are paying for \nit, they can try to change it. If they don't like what we have done \nwith biologics, those opportunities are in front of us now for the next \n2 or 3 weeks.\n  I have come to the Senate floor leading up to this debate, since \nJuly, sharing letters from people in my State who have a few things in \ncommon. Almost every single letter I get comes from somebody who a year \nor two ago was pretty satisfied with their health insurance. Then maybe \nthey had a baby with a preexisting condition or they lost their \ninsurance or they owned a small business and 1 person out of 50 \nemployees got cancer and their premiums spiked so high, the insurance \nwas either terminated by the company or it was so expensive they \ncouldn't afford it. Someone got so sick and the costs were so high, the \ninsurance cut them off. In almost every one of these letters, people \nwere generally satisfied with their insurance.\n  I get letters from a lot of people in their early sixties, people \nfrom Springfield to Troy to Zaynesville. These people in their early \nsixties who have lost\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\ntheir insurance, their job, or they had a preexisting condition, can't \nwait to be 65. It is a pretty bad commentary on how we do this when a \n62-year-old is so anxious to be 65 so that they have insurance. Then \nthey have the security and the stability of Medicare. Why shouldn't we \ninstead give them the security and the stability of the public option, \nif that is what they choose, if they are uninsured and in their sixties \nor forties or any other age.\n  The last thing I have found in these letters is an overwhelming \nsentiment in support of the public option. The public option does \nseveral things. The public option is only an option. If you want CIGNA \nor WellPoint or Medical Mutual, a not-for-profit company in Ohio, you \ncan choose that or the public option. The public option, even with \nthese reforms, will help keep the insurance companies honest. Nobody \ngets eliminated from Medicare because of a preexisting condition. \nNobody will lose their health insurance with the public option because \nof a preexisting condition. Too many times, they have, if they had \nCIGNA or if they had WellPoint or Blue Cross or Aetna. That is the \nsecond reason the public option is so important.\n  Third, the public option is going to keep costs in check because in \nsouthwest Ohio, in Cincinnati, and the three surrounding counties, two \ninsurance companies have 85 percent of the insurance policies.\n  What does that mean? It means lower quality and higher cost. Put the \npublic option in as a competitor, people in Lebanon and Batavia and \nMiddletown and Butler and Cincinnati don't have to choose the public \noption, but its very existence will discipline the market. It is good, \nold-fashioned American competition, and it will mean that the private \ninsurance companies will act better. They will provide better quality \nat a lower price. That is the whole point of the public option.\n  Let me share a couple letters this evening. Debbie from Clark County:\n\n       In May, I suffered a serious ankle injury. After an ER \n     visit and then a consultation by a specialist, I was told not \n     to bear weight on my foot and that I needed major surgery.\n       Up until June 1, I was covered by my husband's employer-\n     based plan. His company then changed its insurance policy and \n     stated that any spouse of an employee who worked full time, \n     and had access to insurance, would no longer be covered.\n       At the time, I was still employed and had access to an \n     employer plan. But shortly after my injury on May 29, I \n     couldn't work, and asked that I be put on my husband's plan.\n       The insurer initially declined, but after weeks of \n     fighting, they agreed to put me back on his plan, but only \n     during open enrollment in March 2010.\n       My surgery is critical and needs to be done immediately; I \n     have to wait until March 2010--nearly ten months after my \n     injury.\n       I have researched private insurance, but we can't afford \n     it. Nor can we afford the surgery without insurance.\n       We have worked hard and raised our four children to believe \n     that nothing worth having comes easy. But now, I feel like \n     I'm somehow letting my family down.\n       How can this happen when living in the United States of \n     America?\n\n  Debbie is like so many Ohioans and so many Americans who have worked \nhard, paid their taxes, played by the rules, and something happened \nwith their insurance. They lost their insurance. She was victimized by \na set of circumstances that simply shouldn't happen. Under our bill \nthis will not happen. They will not be allowed to take people's \ninsurance away. People will not fall through the cracks. She will be \nable to get insurance by buying on the insurance exchange. If she \nchooses to, she could choose the public option.\n  Robert from Lake County:\n\n       In 1986 my wife was terminally ill with cancer and several \n     other illnesses. When I switched jobs and looked for new \n     insurance, we were denied because of her pre-existing \n     condition.\n       In 2001, when I was 58, I lost my job. When COBRA ran out, \n     I was denied insurance based on my pre-existing conditions of \n     diabetes and heart disease.\n       I managed to limp through until I turned 65 and became \n     eligible for Medicare.\n       I'm sure the fear and anxiety I suffered over health \n     insurance hasn't been at all beneficial to my overall health.\n\n  We don't think about that in this body. Most of the people we hang \naround with have insurance. Most of the people we hang around with as \nSenators don't have a lot of these problems. We certainly have sick \nrelatives and friends who have disabilities and illnesses. But rarely \ndo they have to worry so much before they turn 65 and can get the \nstability of Medicare, the same stability we want to give people in the \npublic option. When you think about that, think of all the people who \nhave insurance and they go to the doctor or hospital and get a medical \ntreatment. They then apply to their insurance company to get their \nbenefits paid for their expenses. Thirty percent of the time insurance \ncompanies deny claims--30 percent of the time, often on appeal to the \ninsurance company, though they will pay the claim on the second round.\n  Think about putting people through that. You are sick, you have a \n$14,000 medical bill. You are making $35,000 a year. You can't afford \nanything close to that. Your insurance company turns you down. You go \nback and fight with them, you argue with them, or your spouse argues \nwith them. Where does that leave you?\n  In difficult times with their health, the anxiety makes it even \nworse. That is why we need to change this model of the private \ninsurance companies finding all kinds of reasons to not insure people \nwith preexisting conditions, to discriminate because of gender and then \nto refuse to pay claims. That is what the public option will do, inject \ncompetition so they would not be able to do that.\n  The last letter I wish to share is from Shelly from Coshocton County \nin sort of eastern-southeastern Ohio:\n\n       I have no health insurance coverage for myself or my son. \n     My husband is disabled and receives Social Security \n     Disability and Medicare.\n       My son was born with a congenital heart defect and has \n     already had one open heart surgery. Along with my pre-\n     existing condition, neither of us can afford private \n     coverage. Pre-existing conditions should be illegal for \n     insurance companies to use to delay health care for \n     Americans.\n\n  A public option would protect Shelly. She asks for a public option. \nShe says: A public option would protect me from preexisting condition \nexclusions. That is exactly right. The insurance industry model--you \nthink about how it works.\n  They first hire a bunch of bureaucrats to keep people from buying \ninsurance if they are sick. So they deny people the ability to buy \ninsurance because they might be expensive, on the one hand. And then, \nafter you do have coverage, and you get sick and you submit a claim, \nthey hire a bunch of bureaucrats on that end to stop you from getting \npayment, to stop you from getting reimbursed for your claim.\n  That is why the CEO of Aetna was able to make $24 million last year. \nThat is why insurance companies have seen profits increase 400 percent \nin the last 7 years. When you have a business model where you hire a \nbunch of bureaucrats to keep people who are sick from buying your \ninsurance, and on the other end you hire a bunch of bureaucrats to deny \npayment of their claims, those are companies that are going to make a \nlot of money.\n  That is a pretty good business model. It works for them. The CEOs of \nthe top 10 insurance companies in the country average $11 million in \npay. It works for them. It works for their shareholders. It works for \ntheir profitability. It is not working so well for Shelly. It is not \nworking so well for Debbie from Springfield. It is not working so well \nfor Robert from Wickliffe or Willowick, in that part of Ohio.\n  So it is clear we have our work cut out for us tonight. It is a major \nstep. I am sorry none of my Republican colleagues wanted to even debate \nthis, wanted to even move forward and put this bill on the floor. But I \nam confident as we process these amendments, the dozens and dozens of \namendments--I know the Presiding Officer has a great amendment on \nmaking sure the drug companies that advertise do not get subsidized by \ntaxpayers through a tax deduction, which they do now. There are a lot \nof amendments that are coming to this floor that will make this bill \nbetter.\n  There are some amendments that will not make it better. But everybody \nis going to have a free shot--all 100 of us. That is the way this \nsystem should work. That is why open debate is good, even though some \nof my colleagues did not want us to do that. But that is why, in the \nnext month or two, we are going to get a bill through the Senate, \nthrough the conference committee, to the President's desk, and it is \ngoing to change Americans' lives.\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\n  Those who have insurance, who are satisfied with it, will be able to \nkeep their insurance with consumer protections. It will help small \nbusinesses so they can insure their employees. And it will help those \npeople who do not have insurance get some help and get some insurance. \nThe public option will improve the system all up and down in other \nways.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11969-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11969-S11971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NSWG TRAVEL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in my capacity as the cochairman \nof the Senate's National Security Working Group. It is in that capacity \nI recently traveled on a CODEL with the senior Senator from California.\n  Pursuant to the requirements of the current Memorandum of \nUnderstanding on the Administrative Procedures for the U.S. Senate \nNational Security Working Group, specifically paragraph 6, Senator \nFeinstein and I have filed in the Office of Senate Security a \nclassified memorandum available to the members of the working group and \ntheir designated staffer.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the NSWG, which is the successor of the \nSenate's Arms Control Observer Group, was created by the Senate to aid \nadministrations that choose to negotiate arms control treaties. In view \nof the 67-vote threshold to ratify a treaty, and given the complexity \nand importance of the subject matter at the heart of arms control \ntreaties, as well as the Constitution's mandate that the U.S. Senate \nhas a role of advice and consent in treaty making, the NSWG exists to \nprovide a forum for an expert group of Senators to have up-to-date \ninformation on ongoing treaty negotiations, and to provide the \nAdministration with consultation from the Senate.\n  This consultative role is important, because the Constitution \nentrusts the Senate with the responsibility to provide its advice along \nwith, perhaps, its consent to a treaty. This means administrations are \nsupposed to listen to the advice of Senators if they expect to earn the \nSenate's consent.\n  The U.S. negotiating team is lead by Assistant Secretary of State \nRose Gottemoeller, a highly capable administration official and a \ngracious host. I thank her for her time and hospitality, as well as for \nher service.\n  I urge my colleagues in the NSWG to take the time to study the \nclassified memorandum Senator Feinstein and I have drafted. The issues \ncovered in our memorandum are significant, and, in some cases \nworrisome. I won't go into detail here--the memorandum is classified \nand for good reason.\n  That said, I will ask to have printed four recent articles on the \nSTART follow-on treaty negotiations to the Record. These articles \nhighlight issues that every Senator should consider.\n  As my colleagues know, the 1991 START Agreement expires 2 weeks from \ntoday. I urge my colleagues to consider what will happen on December 6, \nthe day after the expiration of that agreement. For the first time in \n15 years, an extensive set of verification, notification, elimination \nand other confidence building measures will expire.\n  The U.S. will lose a significant source of information that has \nallowed it to have confidence in its ability to understand Russian \nstrategic nuclear forces; likewise, the Russian Federation will lose \ninformation about U.S. nuclear forces, almost all of which are \nstrategic, unlike the Russian-forces, which place tremendous emphasis \non tactical nuclear forces not covered by the 1991 Agreement or its \nsuccessor.\n  Yet, no one appears to know what will come next. According to the \nreports I will add to the Record, there is no plan for what provisions \nof the 1991 Agreement will be maintained after the 1991 Agreement \nexpires on December 5.\n  The question of what happens after the 1991 Agreement expires is \nimportant. The Russian Federation is already telling us they intend to \ndeploy a new road mobile missile, one which, for the first time, will \nhave multiple independent reentry vehicles. Open source reports \nindicate this missile will constitute 80 percent of Russian ICBM forces \nby 2016. This is a significant deployment. Moreover, it confirms that \nRussia, unlike the U.S., is modernizing its nuclear forces.\n  How will we monitor this highly destabilizing weapon, the RS-24? \nAccording to the article I introduced from the Global Security Newswire \nby Elaine Grossman, we won't have the entry and exit portals at \nVotkinsk.\n  That we don't have answers to these questions is alarming, more so \nbecause our negotiators must have known for months that a ``bridge'' \nwould be necessary. Why do I say this? Simple: the Moscow Treaty took \nthe Senate 9 months--287 days--to ratify from the date of its \nsignature. And that was a very limited treaty--it was about two to \nthree pages long.\n  The START agreement of 1991 took 429 days to ratify on October 1, \n1992, after it was submitted to the Senate on July 31, 1991. And by \neverything we have seen in the press and been briefed on in the \nNational Security Working Group, this new treaty will be almost as \ncomplicated, and will include highly significant nuclear force \nreductions, that will take time for Senators to consider. In fact, the \nSenate has not had even one hearing on the START process yet.\n  The administration must have understood this. Yet it spent the first \nhalf of the year negotiating a joint understanding that would allow it \nto show progress towards the President's goal of world without nuclear \nweapons. According to press reports, only now have the negotiators \nbegun looking at the question of verification.\n  I was shocked that there had been virtually no talk--and I know this \nfrom my conversations with members of both the Russian and U.S. \ndelegations in Geneva--of what happens after December 5 and prior to \nthe possible entry into force of the follow-on agreement when and if it \nis signed by the two executives. Mr. President, I don't say this \nlightly, but, this borders on malpractice.\n  I have said repeatedly that I hope to be able to support the treaty \nbeing negotiated now. I have kept an open mind throughout this process. \nYet as I learn more about what has been negotiated thus far, and the \ngeneral process this treaty negotiation has taken, I grow more \nconcerned.\n  The paramount object of this treaty should have been to extend the \nverification measure of the 1991 Agreement. But, it appears that the \nadministration's object was to lock in significant nuclear weapons \ncuts; they achieved that with the July joint understanding. Only \nrecently has verification gotten the attention it deserved all along.\n  And, now, the Russians may think they have the advantage. That may be \nwhy they returned a counter offer a little over a week ago that the \nU.S. was ``very disappointed about'' in the words of Under Secretary of \nState Ellen Tauscher. We have entered an end-game where the Russians \nmay feel that the U.S. wants the START follow-on agreement more than \nthey do; even though Russia needs this treaty, needs to lock the U.S. \ninto strategic delivery vehicle reductions as Dr. Keith Payne explained \nin his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, only the \nHouse so far has held a hearing on START.\n  I believe the U.S. would have been very well served with a simple 5 \nyear extension of the 1991 Agreement, as the treaty allowed. But, now \nthe President is preparing to head to Oslo to collect his Nobel Peace \nPrize, one that was apparently based on the President's endorsement of \nthe Global Zero vision. The Russians apparently perceive that the \nPresident would be quite embarrassed if he had to pick up his Prize \nhaving failed to get a START follow-on completed. In the interest of \nthe United States, I implore the administration not to negotiate \nagainst an artificial deadline. There are means to lock in verification \nand associated activities from the 1991 Agreement after it expires in 2 \nweeks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the four articles to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     New Russian-U.S. Arms Reduction Treaty Hampered by Differences\n\n                           (By Ilya Kramnik)\n\n       Moscow.--Russia and the United States cannot agree on a new \n     strategic arms reduction treaty to replace the START-1, which \n     will expire on December 5, 2009.\n       The problems concern control of mobile missile systems, \n     cuts in delivery vehicles, and a connection between the new \n     treaty and\n\n[[Page S11970]]\n\n     limits on the deployment of ballistic missile defense \n     systems.\n       The START-1 treaty signed in 1991 stipulated the size of \n     mobile missile systems' deployment areas and the number of \n     basing stations for rail missile systems. It also limited the \n     number of missile systems that can be simultaneously deployed \n     outside their deployment sites, and the duration of such \n     deployment.\n       The liquidation procedures stipulated for mobile missiles \n     are stricter than for silo-based missiles. In particular, \n     mobile missiles must be liquidated together with their \n     delivery vehicles, whereas the cuts for silo- and submarine-\n     launched missiles stipulate only the liquidation of silos and \n     submarines.\n       Topol is the only mobile intercontinental ballistic missile \n     on combat duty in Russia. The United States decided in the \n     early 1990s that submarine-launched Trident II missiles could \n     replace its land-based mobile systems.\n       When the silo-based group of missiles was cut in Russia, \n     the focus was shifted to the Topol missiles. The role of \n     mobile systems increased when the Topol-M system was \n     introduced and the RS-24 Yars MIRVed missile, which is \n     heavier than Topol-M and can carry up to ten independently \n     targetable warheads, was created.\n       Given the current trends, land-based mobile missiles will \n     constitute the bulk of Russia's Strategic Missile Force in \n     the next 20 years. Russia might also deploy new rail missile \n     systems.\n       In this situation, limits put on the deployment areas and \n     movement of mobile systems will deprive Russia's Strategic \n     Missile Force of its main advantage--mobility, which ensures \n     a degree of safety in case of a first strike. However, \n     the survival of silo-based missiles in a first strike is \n     not assured either, given the growing precision of reentry \n     vehicles.\n       The U.S. strategic nuclear might is based on the naval \n     element of the nuclear triad, in particular its 14 Ohio-class \n     nuclear submarines armed with 336 Trident II missiles, each \n     with eight individually targeted warheads. It would be \n     useless to try to limit the deployment areas and movement of \n     submarines, because such a limitation cannot be effectively \n     verified.\n       Another bone of contention is the number of delivery \n     vehicles. Russia has proposed cutting them to 500, whereas \n     the United States sets the limit at 1,000. This explains the \n     big difference in the proposed limitations, between 500 and \n     1,100 delivery vehicles and 1,500-1,675 nuclear warheads.\n       The issue of delivery vehicles is closely connected to the \n     ``upload potential,'' which is the number of warheads for \n     cruise missiles carried by heavy bombers that can be stored \n     for potential deployment in a dangerous period. The more \n     delivery vehicles a side's strategic nuclear forces have, the \n     larger the upload potential, which makes strategic arms \n     reductions senseless.\n       And lastly, the main problem of the new reduction treaty is \n     a connection between strategic nuclear weapons and ballistic \n     missile defense (ABM) systems. Russia insists that the ABM \n     systems should be curtailed, whereas the United States is \n     only prepared to recognize a connection between strategic \n     offensive arms and ballistic defense systems in the preamble \n     to the new treaty.\n       Unless the sides agree on this issue, the new treaty will \n     be a useless document suiting neither side. This will not \n     please the United States, the economically stronger partner. \n     At present Russia plans to supply 30 new missiles to its \n     strategic nuclear forces annually and may step up the \n     process. If necessary, Russia will be able to maintain its \n     nuclear forces at standards guaranteeing unacceptable damage \n     to the aggressor, irrespective of the ABM systems.\n       If the sides do not sign the new treaty, or if the treaty \n     does not limit the deployment of ABM systems, this will \n     actually restart a nuclear missile race, even if at a lower \n     level than in the 1950s through 1980s.\n       The opinions expressed in this article are the author's and \n     do not necessarily represent those of RIA Novosti.\n                                  ____\n\n\n U.S. Treaty-Monitoring Presence at Russian Missile Plant Winding Down\n\n                        (By Elaine M. Grossman)\n\n       Washington.--With the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty \n     expiring in early December, U.S. inspectors are winding down \n     their nearly 15-year presence in the remote Russian village \n     of Votkinsk.\n       Roughly 630 miles northeast of Moscow, the town is home to \n     the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a weapon factory where \n     the accord allows as many as 30 U.S. personnel to ensure \n     Russian compliance with treaty provisions on nuclear-capable \n     missiles. Moscow uses the facility to manufacture SS-27 \n     Topol-M and SS-26 Bulava ICBMs.\n       Operating 24 hours a day, the monitoring staff can observe \n     and inspect vehicles leaving the facility by rail or road, \n     according to the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The \n     monitors also conduct twice-daily perimeter inspections to \n     verify that missiles cannot leave the facility by any other \n     means.\n       Washington and Moscow are engaged in intense negotiations \n     to replace the treaty with a new accord that sets lower caps \n     on deployed nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles. However, \n     the envoys have not yet reached agreement. Despite earlier \n     hopes to the contrary, the two nations will be unable to \n     achieve ratification of a new treaty before the old one comes \n     to an end.\n       Lacking a new agreement that allows for a continued U.S. \n     presence at the Votkinsk facility, the monitors would be \n     forced to move out by Dec. 5, when the 1991 treaty expires.\n       There is no public indication yet that a new pact would \n     maintain a provision allowing for U.S. inspectors on the \n     ground at Votkinsk.\n       With the United States not currently producing any new-\n     design strategic missiles, there is nothing for Moscow to \n     monitor at shuttered U.S. production lines. In that the \n     production-monitoring verification measure is now not \n     reciprocal, Moscow no longer finds it useful, even if \n     Washington does, according to nuclear weapons expert Jeffrey \n     Lewis of the New America Foundation.\n       Lewis has pointed to indications that Moscow wants to \n     jettison any such missile-production monitoring in the so-\n     called ``New START'' agreement.\n       ``The Russians have been saying that for a long time,'' one \n     U.S. Defense Department official told Global Security \n     Newswire last week.\n       Given clear signals that a Russian change of heart was \n     unlikely, ``we had to [start packing up],'' the official \n     said. ``We had to. You can't just walk away.''\n       U.S. facilities at the Votkinsk site include a large \n     administrative building and three residential buildings, \n     called Lincoln, Roosevelt and Washington.\n       Although preparing to depart Votkinsk has been a major \n     undertaking, responsibility for winding down operations has \n     fallen largely to the support staff, freeing inspectors to \n     continue their treaty-controlled mission, officials said.\n       ``We've got monitors there right now . . . and we will \n     continue to monitor until the treaty expires on Dec. 5,'' the \n     defense official said. ``Nobody has suspended it. Nobody \n     would. We've maintained that [monitoring since 1995 when] we \n     sent our first monitors there, and they've been there \n     continuously, 365 days a year, since that point.''\n       This official and several others interviewed for this \n     article spoke on condition of anonymity. They cited \n     diplomatic and political sensitivities involved in discussing \n     a verification regime under negotiation in the ongoing U.S.-\n     Russian arms control talks.\n       Asked to describe treaty-verification activities at \n     Votkinsk, a U.S. official would say only that ``the United \n     States has fully implemented its rights under START at \n     Votkinsk and will continue to do so until Dec. 5.''\n       However, the monitoring process at Votkinsk is based on \n     clearly established rules and is fairly straightforward, \n     other officials said.\n       From inside a Navy-issued trailer called a ``Data \n     Collection Center,'' the inspectors observe traffic exiting \n     the production facilities through a huge portal, according to \n     those familiar with the setup.\n       They use red traffic lights to control vehicles, and can \n     exercise treaty rights to inspect cargo if a truck or railcar \n     exceeds a specified length and is potentially capable of \n     transporting a missile, these sources said. U.S. personnel \n     also can record the serial numbers of START-limited missiles, \n     aiding in any subsequent efforts to track deployed missiles \n     under treaty provisions.\n       The inspections have helped Washington assess Moscow's \n     nuclear-capable missile fleet and remain aware of new \n     missiles under development, officials say.\n       Under a New START accord, Washington and Moscow each \n     anticipate reducing deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no \n     more than 1,675, U.S. and Russian Presidents Barack Obama and \n     Dmitry Medvedev announced in July. The pact would also cut \n     nuclear-capable delivery vehicles to a level between 500 and \n     1,100, the leaders said.\n       Perhaps the greatest challenge in the ongoing negotiations \n     has been finding common ground on how to verify the new \n     numerical limits, experts say. Moscow has resisted a number \n     of measures that it interprets as nonreciprocal, including \n     Washington's interest in tracking Russia's mobile ICBMs, \n     according to reports. The United States fields no such mobile \n     systems for possible monitoring.\n       Russian negotiators also have opposed renewing START \n     provisions for exchanging missile-test data, called \n     ``telemetry,'' Lewis said early this month on his blog, \n     ArmsControlWonk.com. However, it remains unclear what the \n     U.S. negotiating position has been on this issue, he said.\n       Interviewed last week, Lewis rued the potential loss of \n     these verification measures under the anticipated New START \n     pact, saying, ``I suspect we're going to lose Votkinsk, but I \n     hope we can hang onto the telemetry.''\n       Not everyone views Votkinsk monitoring as a valuable \n     verification provision to be sought in a forthcoming treaty.\n       The basis for exchanging inspectors at U.S. and Russian \n     weapon-production facilities essentially is that ``we think \n     you're cheating and we're here to prove it,'' said one \n     retired nuclear-weapons officer. ``[But] if they're going to \n     do something they don't want us to know about, they'll go and \n     do it someplace else.''\n       Over the years, it has become increasingly possible to \n     verify missile-test performance and weapon deployments via \n     direct observation or satellite imagery, according to this \n     defense expert and others.\n       Under the 1991 treaty, ``we put some rather onerous \n     requirements on the Russians because we could,'' said the \n     retired officer. ``If the Cold War is either over or thawing, \n     there are certain things you would not require a counterpart \n     to do.''\n\n[[Page S11971]]\n\n       Moscow actually never exercised its reciprocal right to \n     continuously monitor a U.S. missile production facility by \n     deploying inspectors, according to a DTRA fact sheet. In \n     April 2001--a year after Thiokol Corp. stopped making \n     Peacekeeper missiles at a plant in Promontory, Utah--the \n     Russian right to maintain such inspectors in the United \n     States came to an end.\n       That left Votkinsk as the only operating strategic-missile \n     production facility in either nation, and the only site to \n     host continuous monitoring. The START accord also allows for \n     12 types of intrusive verification measures that include \n     suspect-site inspections to confirm that clandestine weapons \n     production is not occurring, according to the U.S. defense \n     agency.\n       Even as hosting the only remaining monitoring mission at a \n     production facility has evolved into an irritant for Moscow, \n     it is unclear how useful the U.S. presence at Votkinsk has \n     been for Washington. Intelligence officials have prized the \n     U.S. opportunity to observe Russian manufacturing operations \n     at Votkinsk, but how much militarily useful information has \n     been gleaned is uncertain, some experts said.\n       For many of the U.S. civilian and military inspectors who \n     served at the remote Russian location, there were apparently \n     few surprises.\n       ``It was very monotonous. We could have months go by \n     without inspecting a missile,'' a former U.S. inspector at \n     Votkinsk told GSN in an interview. ``It all seemed like the \n     whole process was very ridiculous, in a way.''\n       A photograph posted on a Facebook page for the ``Votkinsk \n     Portal Monitoring Facility'' shows a group of U.S. personnel \n     wearing swimsuits and big smiles, posing on beach chairs in \n     several inches of snow. A Defense Threat Reduction Agency \n     building appears in the background.\n       ``It always felt like an episode from `M*A*S*H,' '' said \n     the former inspector, referring to the television comedy \n     series about an Army medical unit during the Korean War. \n     ``There's people from all over the country just thrown in \n     there to do this job. It was very surreal at times.''\n       Military duty officers would cycle through the facility on \n     three- or six-week rotations, this source said. Civilians \n     typically served much longer tours--many on DTRA contract \n     with Raytheon Technical Services, or Hughes before that--on \n     duty for nine-week stretches, with three weeks of leave in \n     between.\n       Under the START accord, the U.S. government could deliver \n     food and other goods to the inspection and support teams at \n     Votkinsk in two cargo aircraft flights a year.\n       The defense agency describes a typical inspection team as \n     including a team chief and deputy, two linguists, a weapons \n     specialist and other experts. Government and contracted \n     support personnel include translators, technicians, cooks and \n     medical staff, according to defense officials.\n       The former inspector said the U.S. team at Votkinsk used \n     relatively little advanced technology for its monitoring \n     operations, and the staff's computers or other electronics \n     could likely be moved using a single cargo aircraft. Most \n     furniture and office supplies would likely be disposed of or \n     left behind, officials speculated.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Russia Hints at Delay in START II Negotiations\n\n       Washington--A report from Interfax news agency has quoted \n     the Russian Foreign Ministry as saying that the provisions of \n     the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) can remain in \n     force even after it expires on December 5.\n       To some, the pronouncement looks problematic for the \n     administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, which was \n     hoping to sign a new treaty with Russian President Dmitry \n     Medvedev when Obama goes to Europe to accept his Nobel Peace \n     Prize on December 10.\n       At a November 15 meeting with Medvedev in Singapore after \n     the close of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, \n     Obama said that the two men's ``goal continues to be to \n     complete the negotiations and to be able to sign a deal \n     before the end of the year.''\n       He added that he was ``confident'' that with ``hard work \n     and a sense of urgency,'' it could happen.\n       But as Russian and U.S. weapons negotiators continue to \n     meet in Singapore, it has emerged that a key sticking point \n     is how each country inspects the other's nuclear weapons \n     facilities.\n       ``If you believe the leaks that have been coming out over \n     the past couple of days, the issue is now about disagreements \n     over the systems and processes of how things are checked,'' \n     Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor of the journal ``Russia in Global \n     Affairs,'' told RFE/RL's Russian Service. ``For its part, the \n     Russian side is opposed to the proposals that the Americans \n     have put forward.''\n       Lukyanov said that one point of disagreement could bring \n     the talks to a crashing halt.\n       ``Nothing is agreed on until everything is agreed on,'' he \n     said.\n\n\n                       ``Working Through Issues''\n\n       Obama may have been referring to that issue in Singapore \n     when he said he felt ``as if both sides are trying to work \n     through some difficult technical issues but are doing so in \n     good faith.''\n       Obama and Medvedev met in Moscow in July and agreed to \n     reduce the number of nuclear warheads that each country could \n     possess to between 1,500 and 1,675 within seven years.\n       Kennette Benedict, executive director of the Bulletin of \n     Atomic Scientists, which focuses on the consequences of \n     nuclear weapons, thinks the statement by the Russian Foreign \n     Ministry about allowing the original START treaty to remain \n     in force is a positive sign from Moscow.\n       ``I take this as a very positive sign because the START \n     Treaty does expire on December 5--and there are provisions \n     for extending it, and the reason it's so important to extend \n     is because it has such robust verification measures in it. We \n     have inspectors now in Russia and they have inspectors here \n     in the United States,'' Benedict said. ``If START I is not \n     extended, then our inspectors would need to leave, Russia and \n     their inspectors would need to leave the U.S., and the trust \n     that we've built may make it more difficult to come to a \n     final agreement.''\n       Benedict said she expects that Obama and Medvedev will sign \n     a START II Treaty soon, perhaps by the end of the year. The \n     hard part, she said, will be persuading getting the U.S. \n     Senate to ratify it.\n\n\n                           Domestic Politics\n\n       For the past decade, Benedict said, the Senate has been \n     reluctant to ratify any international treaties, regardless of \n     subject matter.\n       ``As I understand it, they think that the United States can \n     go it alone on any number of things, and that we have a right \n     to have as many weapons as we want, and they believe, I \n     guess, that all weapons are useful,'' Benedict said. ``So \n     they think that military might is the best way for the United \n     States to proceed.''\n       Gary Schmitt, director of advanced strategic studies at the \n     American Enterprise Institute, a private policy-research \n     center in Washington, agreed that Senate ratification will be \n     difficult, but for a more nuanced reason.\n       ``It's not going to be a slam-dunk [in the Senate] because \n     the actual agreement's going to reduce the number of warheads \n     and platforms,'' Schmitt said. ``And if it's really a \n     substantial cut, there'll be a serious debate about what the \n     nature of our deterrent looks like.''\n       In fact, Schmitt said he's surprised that Obama is acting \n     as if the United States needs a START II Treaty. One of the \n     snags in the negotiations so far, he noted, is that Moscow \n     wants to cut weapons further than Washington does.\n       ``I think one of the problems with the Obama \n     administration's approach was that they actually acted like \n     we needed this arms-control agreement, when, in fact, it was \n     the Russians who were looking for it because, first of all, \n     it costs a lot of money to develop new weapons, and the \n     second thing is that a lot of what they have is extremely old \n     and should be taken out of commission,'' Schmitt said. \n     ``Somebody was telling me that at the most recent military \n     parade in Moscow they were driving some of the missiles by \n     and they were noticeably rusty, which is not what you want \n     when you have ICBMS.''\n       Ultimately, Schmitt said, it is good news that both Russia \n     and the United States aren't arbitrarily standing by the \n     December 5 deadline.\n       Give the two sides plenty of time to talks, he said, \n     because both sides can easily live with an extension of START \n     I.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Russia Not Preparing Interim Agreement at START Talks\n\n       Moscow, Nov. 17.--The United States and Russia are not \n     preparing some interim agreement on strategic offensives \n     weapons, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n       ``According to the instructions that were given our \n     delegation is working on a new agreement on the reduction and \n     limitation of strategic offensive weapons and not some \n     interim documents,'' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman \n     Andrei Nesterenko said at a briefing in Moscow on Tuesday.\n       Nesterenko was commenting on the statement by U.S. \n     presidential aide Michael McFaul that Moscow and Washington \n     need to prepare an interim agreement on strategic offensive \n     weapons, as the main agreement will not be ratified by \n     December 5 when the current one expires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11971-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11971-S11972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CHANGES TO S.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the \nadoption credit and adoption assistance programs and to allow the \nadoption credit to be claimed in the year expenses are incurred, \nregardless of when the adoption becomes final; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today is National Adoption Day, and there \ncould be no more fitting day to introduce legislation that will help \nAmerican families achieve their dream of adopting a child.\n  For too many families, the high cost of adoption makes this dream \ndifficult and sometimes impossible to reach. That is why Congress acted \nin 2001 to strengthen the adoption tax credit and make welcoming a \nchild into a family more affordable. Unfortunately, this important tax \nrelief will expire at the end of next year.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Ben Nelson, the \nAdoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act, will permanently extend and improve \nthe 2001 adoption incentives. By easing this financial burden, we will \nencourage the development of more stable families and provide a \nbrighter future for countless children for years to come.\n  The Adoption Tax Relief Guarantee Act will allow adoptive families to \nreceive a tax credit of up to $10,000 and guarantees the maximum \n$10,000 credit for families who adopt children with special needs. This \nlegislation will help middle-income families break the financial \nbarriers and successfully adopt a child, especially those children with \nspecial needs who are in particular need of a loving home. In addition, \nthis bill will allow families to receive the credit in the year an \nadoption expense is paid or incurred. Currently, those who adopt a \nchild must wait until the following taxable year before receiving a tax \ncredit for an adoption expense. This important change will expedite \nfinancial relief, putting money back into the pockets of middle-income \nfamilies who struggle through the lengthy and costly adoption process.\n  I am pleased that Senators from both sides of the aisle have \ncosponsored this legislation, and that it has received endorsements \nfrom the National Council for Adoption and RESOLVE: the National \nInfertility Association, the National Council for Adoption, and the \nAmerican Academy of Adoption Attorneys. The adoption tax credit and \nassistance programs have already helped countless children and families \nby making adoption more affordable. We owe it to future generations of \nchildren in need to make these provisions permanent.\n  Our entire society benefits when children are placed with loving, \npermanent families. I urge my colleagues to support critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kallon, of Alabama, to be United States District \n     Judge for the Northern District of Alabama.\n\n\n                   Executive Office of the President\n\n       Daniel I. Gordon, of the District of Columbia, to be \n     Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy.\n\n\n         Nominations of Judge Christina Reiss and Abdul Kallon\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \nconsider and confirm Judge Christina Reiss to a seat on the U.S. \nDistrict Court in Vermont. Judge Reiss will be the first woman to serve \non that Court.\n  As the senior Senator from the State of Vermont, I was honored to \nrecommend Judge Reiss to President Obama for this post. She has \nconsiderable criminal and civil experience, and is extremely qualified. \nFor the past 5 years, she has been a State trial court judge in \nVermont--a position to which she was appointed by Governor Jim Douglas, \na Republican, and confirmed unanimously. She formerly was a partner in \ntwo Vermont law firms. Judge Reiss earned her B.A. from my alma mater, \nSaint Michaels College, and earned her J.D. with high honors from \nUniversity of Arizona College of Law, where she was editor-in-chief of \nthe law review.\n  Judge Reiss has been nominated to fill the vacancy created when my \ngood friend, Judge Garvan Murtha, announced his intention to take \nsenior status on the court. It is the first vacancy on this court since \n1995, when the Senate confirmed Judge Murtha and Judge William \nSessions. Judge Reiss will make an excellent addition to that court. \nShe has already demonstrated as a state court judge her ability to \nrelate to litigants of many backgrounds, and knows how important it is \nfor judges to possess an understanding of the effects of legal rulings \non people's lives.\n  In making this recommendation, I looked to Vermont's Judicial \nNominating Commission, a practice I started with the late Senator \nRobert Stafford, a Republican, and a practice I have continued to \nfollow. The Commission that helped select Judge Reiss was comprised of \na nine member non-partisan panel appointed by me, Senator Sanders, and \nthe Vermont Bar Association, and we were aided in the selection process \nby input from Congressman Peter Welch. The non-partisan, merit-driven \nprocess is a good fit for our approach to government in Vermont.\n  Senators of both parties have clearly seen that Judge Reiss has all \nof the qualities that are important on the Federal bench. Earlier this \nweek, Judge Reiss's nomination was reported from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without dissent in a voice vote. I am confident that Judge \nReiss is the right person for this position.\n  The Senate will also consider and confirm Abdul K. Kallon to the \nNorthern District of Alabama, the home state of the Ranking Member of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Mr. Kallon's nomination has the support of \nboth Senator Sessions and Senator Shelby, and was reported out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee this week with approval by voice vote.\n  I congratulate Judge Reiss, Mr. Kallon and their families on their \nconfirmations today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/21/senate-section/article/S11974-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am always looking for ways in which we \ncan improve the investigation and prosecution of international human \nrights abusers, including those who seek safe haven in the United \nStates. That is what led me to develop and fight for several years to \nenact the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, which became law in \n2004. That is what I did in supporting and implementing legislation for \nthe Convention Against Torture. That is what I have done in my work on \nthe State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  It is vital that the United States reclaim its historic role as a \nworld leader on issues of human rights. President Obama and Secretary \nClinton are working hard to make that a reality. I worked in the last \nCongress to create the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the \nLaw, and to reconstitute it again this Congress. I have worked closely \nwith Senator Durbin as he has ably chaired it.\n  This country should not provide a refuge for those who commit human \nrights violations. Congress took an important step when we passed the \nAnti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act. That statute closed loopholes in \nour immigration law, making it easier to keep out perpetrators of human \nrights abuses, and to deport those who are already here. It established \nby statute the Office of Special Investigations, OSI, within the \nDepartment of Justice, an office that previously existed only under the \ndiscretionary authority of the Attorney General. The Anti-Atrocity \nAlien Deportation Act expanded OSI's mission from denaturalizing Nazi \nwar criminals, to investigating, extraditing, or denaturalizing any \nalien who participated in genocide, torture, or extrajudicial killing \nabroad. This law has prompted, among other accomplishments, the \ndeportation of Kelbessa Negewo to Ethiopia, where he is now serving a \nlife sentence for torture and multiple killings.\n  The Human Rights Enforcement Act of 2009, a bill which I was pleased \nto cosponsor, builds on the foundation created by the Anti-Atrocity \nAlien Deportation Act. It seeks to improve our ability to identify and \nprosecute human rights abusers. It proposes consolidating two sections \nwithin the Department of Justice: the Office of Special Investigations, \nand the Domestic Security Section, which is charged with criminally \nprosecuting human rights abusers.\n  This bill also amends a section of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct that makes those who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise \nparticipated in genocide, as defined in section 1091(a) of title 18, \nUnited States Code, inadmissible, and therefore ineligible for the \nprotection of our asylum laws. This bill does not alter our intent, \nwhich the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, that asylum laws are \nmeant to implement our obligations under the 1967 United Nations \nProtocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Like our asylum laws, that \ninternational treaty bars those who have committed a crime against \npeace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity from qualifying as a \nrefugee.\n  During its last term, in Negusie v. Holder, the Supreme Court, in an \n8-1 decision, held that nearly identical language barring those who \n``ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \npersecution'' of others from the benefits of our asylum laws did not \nautomatically disqualify those whose conduct was coerced or otherwise \nthe product of duress. Individuals who have been forced to commit such \ncrimes under duress have been determined to be exempt from that bar by \nboth the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Handbook and by \nnations that have interpreted the Refugee Convention and Protocol. This \nbill is consistent with that interpretation.\n  It is vital that the United States reclaim its historic role as a \nworld leader on issues of human rights. We can support the work of \nPresident Obama and members of his cabinet, who are working hard to \nmake that a reality. I am pleased that the Senate will pass the\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\nHuman Rights Enforcement Act of 2009.\n  Mr. BROWN.
