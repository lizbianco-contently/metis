BYRD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our Senate family grieves today with the \nByrd family over the loss of one of the most dedicated Americans ever \nto serve this country; one of the most devoted men ever to serve his \nState; one of the most distinguished Senators ever to serve in the \nSenate.\n  Robert Byrd's mind was among the greatest the world has ever seen. As \na boy, he was called upon, when he was in elementary school, to stand \nbefore the class and recite not paragraphs from the assignment of the \nnight before but pages of the night before. He did this from memory.\n  From his graduation as valedictorian of his high school class at the \nage of 16 to his death this morning as the Senate's President pro \ntempore at age 92, he mastered everything he touched with great \nthoughtfulness and skill. This good man could drive from his home here \nin Washington to West Virginia and back--it took 8 hours--reciting \nclassic poetry the entire time, and not recite the same poem twice.\n  I was asked by Senator Byrd to travel to West Virginia to do an \nexchange with the British Parliament. There were a number of us there, \neight or nine Senators, and a like number of British Parliamentarians. \nI can remember that night so well. We had the music up there he liked \nthe best--bluegrass music--and they played. It was a festive evening.\n  Then it came time for the program. In the program, Senator Byrd said: \nI am going to say a few things. And he passed out little notebooks. He \nhad notebooks passed out to everyone there with a little pencil. He \nwanted to make sure everything was just right; that people, if they had \nsomething to write, had something to write on and write with. And he \nproceeded, standing there without a note, to pronounce the reign of the \nBritish monarchs, from the beginning to the end. He would give the\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\ndates they served. On some of the more difficult spellings, he would \nspell the name. And he would, as I indicated, if it was something he \nreally wanted to talk about that they had accomplished that he thought \nwas noteworthy, he would tell us about that. That took about an hour \nand a half to do that. The British Parliamentarians were stunned. They \nhad never heard anyone who could do anything like that, an American \ntalking about the reign of the British monarchs. Those of us who were \nSenators, nothing surprised us that he could do from memory.\n  I can remember when he decided he was no longer going to be the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Dole did an event for him in the Russell \nBuilding, and all Senators were there, Democratic and Republican \nSenators. He told us a number of things he did not do, and he told us a \nnumber of things he did do. For example, he read the Encyclopedia \nBritannica from cover to cover twice. He studied the dictionary. He \nread that from cover to cover during one of our breaks.\n  I have told this story on an occasion or two, but to give the depth \nof this man's memory--I had been to Nevada, and when I came back, he \nasked me: What did you do?\n  I said: Senator Byrd, I pulled a book out of my library on the way \nback. I didn't have anything to read. It was a paperback. I read ``The \nAdventures of Robinson Crusoe.''\n  And as those of us who can remember him, he looked at me and he held \nhis head back a little bit and his eyes rolled back and he said: \nRobinson Crusoe. He proceeded to tell me--I had just read the book--how \nlong he had been on that island: 28 years, 3 months, a week, and 2 \ndays, or whatever it was. I was stunned. I did not know. I went back \nand pulled the book out to see if he was right, and he was right. He \nprobably had not read that book in 35 or 40 years, but he knew that. \nWhat a mind. It was really stunning, the man's memory.\n  The head of the political science department at the University of \nNevada at Las Vegas, Andy Tuttle, taught a graduate course, based on \nSenator Byrd's lectures on the Roman Empire.\n  He gave 10 lectures here on the Senate floor on the fall of the Roman \nEmpire. He gave a lecture because he was concerned because of the line-\nitem veto, and he felt the line-item veto would be the beginning of the \nend of the Senate. He proceeded to give 10 lectures on that on the \nSenate floor, every one of them from memory--every one of them from \nmemory. Timed just perfectly. They ended in 1 hour. That is how much \ntime he had been given. The original Roman Emperors served for 1 year. \nHe could do it from memory. He knew who they were, how long they \nserved, knew how to spell their names--truly an unbelievably brilliant \nman.\n  He is the only person who earned his law degree while he was a Member \nof Congress. What he accomplished is really very long. His thirst for \nknowledge was simply without equal.\n  Senator Byrd once observed that the longer he lived, the better he \nunderstood how precious the gift of our time on Earth was.\n  I quote Senator Byrd:\n\n       As you get older, you see time running out. It is \n     irretrievable and irreversible. But one should never retire \n     from learning and growth.\n\n  Robert Byrd never retired from anything. He served in the Senate for \nmore than half a century and the House of Representatives for 6 more \nyears, and he dedicated every one of those days to strengthening the \nState and the Nation he loved so dearly. He never once stopped fighting \nfor the good people of West Virginia and for the principles in our \nfounding documents. He was forever faithful to his constituents, his \nConstitution, and his country. He fought for what he thought was right, \nand when he was wrong, he was wise enough to admit it, and he did admit \nit a few times.\n  Senator Byrd's ambition was legendary. He took his oath in this \nChamber on January 3, 1959, the same day Alaska became our 49th State. \nHe told the Charleston Gazette newspaper in that freshman year:\n\n       If I live long enough, I'd like to be Chairman of the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n  Thirty years later, he was, and then he lived and served for 21 more \nyears. His legislative accomplishments are many, and those achievements \nfortify his incomparable legacy. But he is perhaps best known in this \nChamber as the foremost guardian of the Senate's complex rules, \nprocedures, and customs. He did not concern himself with such precision \nas a pastime or mere hobby; he did so because of the unyielding respect \nhe had for the Senate--a reverence the Senate always returned to him \nand now to his memory.\n  With Robert Byrd's passing, America has lost its strongest defender \nof its most precious traditions. It now falls to each of us to keep \nthat flame burning.\n  Throughout one of the longest political careers in history, no one in \nWest Virginia ever defeated Robert Byrd in a single election. In \nWashington, his fellow Democrats twice elected him to lead us when we \nwere in the majority and once more when we were in the minority. Having \nseen both sides, he knew better than most that legislating is the art \nof compromise. Many years ago, in this Chamber where he served longer \nthan any other Senator, Senator Byrd taught a heartfelt history lesson \nto guide our future. It was a lesson about both the Constitution and \nthis institution. He said:\n\n       This very charter of government under which we live was \n     created in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession. And \n     it is only in that spirit that continuance of this charter of \n     government can be prolonged and sustained.\n\n  In his tenure he saw partisanship and bipartisanship, war and peace, \nrecession and recovery. His perspective and legacy are invaluable to \nthe way we carry ourselves as United States Senators. It is instructive \nthat the man who served the longest and saw the most concluded we must \nwork together as partners, not partisans, for the good of our States \nand our country.\n  In 1996, Robert Byrd spoke to a meeting of incoming Senators and \nreminded them that the Senate is still the anchor of the Republic. \nSenator Byrd was the anchor of the Senate. There will never be another \nlike him.\n  He was a Member of this Nation's Congress for more than a quarter of \nthe time it has existed, and longer than a quarter of today's sitting \nSenators and the President of the United States have been alive. His \npolitical career spanned countless American advances and achievements. \nA dozen men called the Oval Office his own while Senator Byrd called \nthe Capitol Building his office--and he would be the first to remind us \nthat those two branches are equal in the eyes of the Constitution. I \nhave heard him say so many times that we work with the President, not \nunder the President.\n  The nine times the people of his State sent him to the Senate and the \nmore than 18,500 votes he cast here will never be matched.\n  As the President pro tempore and I, and each of us fortunate enough \nto be here, have the privilege of knowing firsthand, it was an \nincomparable privilege to serve with him and learn from this giant. By \nvirtue of his endurance, Robert Byrd knew and worked with many of the \ngreats of the Senate. Because of his enduring virtue, he will be \nforever remembered as one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5466-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5466-S5467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I too wish to say a few words about our \ndeparted colleague. The first thing to say is that we are sorry, first \nand foremost, to the family and also to the staff of Senator Byrd for \ntheir loss. The next thing to say is that it is a sad day for the \nSenate. Everybody who has been here for a while has a few Robert Byrd \nstories. A couple come to mind I thought I would share.\n  Along with Senator Reid and Senator Dodd, who were here on the floor \nearlier, Senator Byrd, in the early part of the decade, responded to my \nrequest to come down to the University of Louisville, my alma mater, to \nspeak to the students and to a broader audience. At his age and \nparticularly given the fact that I was a member of the opposition \nparty, there was, frankly, no particular reason for him to do that. But \nhe did and made an extraordinary impression on the students and \ninconvenienced himself on my behalf, which I always appreciated.\n  My second--and really my favorite--recollection of Senator Byrd, I \nfound myself a few years ago in a curious position, at variance with \nvirtually everybody on my side of the aisle. I had reflexively, as I \nthink many Members had, responded negatively to a decision of the U.S. \nSupreme Court in the late 1980s essentially holding that flag burning \nwas a permissible first amendment expression of political speech. The \nfirst time that amendment came before the Senate, I voted for it. Then \nI began to have some pangs of discomfort about my position. Having \nspent a good portion of my political career focusing on political \nspeech and the first amendment, I, frankly, decided I was wrong and in \nsubsequent votes have opposed it.\n  A few years ago, it became clear it was going to be defeated in the \nSenate by the narrowest of margins. I remembered that Senator Byrd was \nalways carrying around a Constitution in his pocket and had a feeling \nthat upon reflection, he might reach the same conclusion I did. So I \nlobbied Senator Byrd. I thought initially it would be a futile act, but \nhe reexamined his position. As a result, he too changed his position, \nand as it turns out, there was not a vote to spare the last time the \nSenate considered whether it would be appropriate to amend the first \namendment for the first time in the history of the country to kind of \ncarve a niche out of it to make it possible to punish an act we all \nfind despicable. But, nevertheless, the most unfortunate of speech is \nprobably what the first amendment was all about initially. So Senator \nByrd did change his position. There was not a vote to spare, and the \namendment was defeated. And from my point of view, the first amendment \nwas saved on that important occasion.\n  We will all remember Senator Byrd for a variety of different things. \nAs the majority leader pointed out, he was a unique individual in so \nmany different ways. Those are two of my favorite stories about Robert \nByrd.\n  More than anyone else in any of our lifetimes, Robert Byrd embodied \nthe Senate. He not only wrote the book on it, he was a living \nrepository of its rules, its customs, and its prerogatives. So it would \nbe a mistake to think that Senator Byrd became synonymous with the \nSenate simply because he served in it longer than anybody else. Rather, \nit was a fitting coincidence that a man who cherished and knew this \nplace so well would become its longest serving Member.\n  Yet it is probably true that he will be remembered above all for his \nlongevity.\n  Everyone seems to have a different way of communicating just how long \na time he spent here. For me, it is enough to note that Robert Byrd had \nalready spent nearly 20 years serving in elected office in West \nVirginia and in the House of Representatives before he was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate during the Eisenhower administration.\n  And over the years, he would walk the floor with 4 future Presidents, \n4 of the 12 he would serve alongside in a 57-year career in Congress. I \nwon't enumerate all the legislative records Senator Byrd held, but I \nwould venture to say that the figure that probably made him proudest of \nall was the nearly 70 years of marriage he spent with a coal miner's \ndaughter named Erma.\n  If he was synonymous with the Senate, he was no less synonymous with \nWest Virginia. Here is how popular Robert Byrd was in his home State: \nIn the year Robert Byrd was first elected to the U.S. Senate, 1958, he \nwon with 59 percent of the vote, a margin that most people around here \nwould consider a landslide. In a record 9 Senate elections, it was the \nsmallest margin of victory he would ever get.\n  Members will offer tributes of their own in the coming days.\n  I will close with this. Last year, in becoming the longest serving \nMember of Congress in history, Senator Byrd surpassed another legendary \nfigure, Carl Hayden of Arizona. Hayden was known to many as the \n``silent Senator,'' a phrase few would use to describe Senator Byrd.\n  But what the two men shared was a devotion to the United States and, \nin particular, to the legislative branch of our Government, which the \nfounders envisioned and established as coequal with the other two.\n  A few years ago, Senator Byrd's official portrait was unveiled at an \nevent in the Old Senate Chamber. And I think that portrait pretty well \nsums up the image Senator Byrd wanted to leave of himself. It is the \nimage of a dignified man, in the classical mold, supported by three \nthings: the Bible, the U.S. Constitution, and his wife. A lot of people \nlooked at Senator Byrd's record-long tenure in Congress, his immense \nknowledge of poetry, history, and the Senate, and wondered where he got \nthe strength. With this painting, he gave us the answer. He showed us \nthe anchors.\n  As I noted at that ceremony, Senator Byrd once wrote that if the \nquestion was whether to be loved or respected, he always chose to be \nrespected. Yet his real accomplishment is that, in the end, he managed \nto be both.\n  So I join my colleagues, my fellow Americans, the people of West \nVirginia, and the Byrd family today in remembering our colleague. We \nwill surely miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on this day, West Virginia has lost \nprobably its most prominent son and the Senate has lost probably its \nmost able statesman. For myself, I have lost an admired colleague and a \ntreasured friend. More than nine decades of a remarkable life and five \ndecades as an accomplished public servant in the Senate only serve as \none form of proof that Robert C. Byrd was and always will be an icon, \nparticularly in his own State. A man of great character, faith, \nintellect, who rose to the heights of power, yet never forgot where he \ncame from, his story holds such a profoundly significant place in both \nWest Virginia and American history. But it was in the coalfields of \nsouthern West Virginia where a young Robert C. Byrd first gained the \nskills, the moral character, the toughness, and the shrewdness that \nwould make him a truly great man.\n  After his mother passed away, he was raised by his aunt and uncle, a \ncoalminer, he movingly called ``the most remarkable man I have ever \nbeen privileged to know.'' From them Senator Byrd learned early in life \nwhat it meant to be loyal, to have a ferocious work ethic, really \nalmost beyond imagination, and possess a deep faith in God. And it was \nthese values--these innately West Virginia values, I argue--that guided \nhis every action and made him such a unique and strong fighter for our \nState and who got such joy in doing that fight.\n  He was proud of West Virginia. He was proud of his ideals. He was \nproud of the service he could render to the people from whom he came. \nHe believed with all of his heart that our breathtaking mountains, our \nrivers, and our deep valleys, and especially our well-rooted people, \nwho face adversity always and face it with strength and courage, make \nour State a place like quite none other in the world.\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\n  He loved the music of the mountains and played his fiddle, in fact, \nvery brilliantly. He was a master violin player. He loved to quote the \nancients, lending depth to his analysis and observations, with \nknowledge of history and philosophy to rival any professor. Just as \neasily as he could quote Cicero from memory, he could sing every verse \nof ``Amazing Grace'' from memory, too, and often did.\n  Everything about Senator Byrd was a testament to his faith in God. \nThis man, who wrote and debated countless laws, lived with 10 clear \nCommandments in his heart. His aunt and uncle kept the King James Bible \nin their home and instilled in him an enduring reverence for God. He \nalways remembered that as important as the Senate and our \nconstitutional government might be, there was always a higher law that \ntook precedence.\n  He started his career humbly by any definition--as a butcher, as a \nwelder, other things too--and then campaigned by playing his foot-\nstomping music, the fiddle, to get elected to the West Virginia \nLegislature--that is how he did it--the very same body that decades \nlater would deem him the ``West Virginian of the 20th Century.''\n  It was at Mark Twain High School where a lifetime of love first began \nfor Robert C. Byrd and his future wife, Erma Ora James. Calling her the \n``wind beneath this Byrd's wings,'' as he put it, Senator Byrd was \nnever shy to tell you that Erma--a beloved coal miner's daughter \nherself--was the reason he reached all of his goals. He believed that \nwith all of his heart. So from the fiddle-playing young man to a \nhistory-making American icon, she loved and supported him every step of \nthe way until her passing in 2006.\n  I know and I observed maybe earlier than some that Senator Byrd lost \njust a bit when Erma died. Watching him hurting was painful. His wife \ndied from the same disease my mother died from; that is, Alzheimer's, \nand we talked about it, especially a few years ago when he was talking \nmore frequently. I always felt bad that I could not give him comfort \nand that I could not say something to him that would relinquish his \npain, which was evident and obvious--very obvious in privacy. But I \ncould not do that because you cannot do that for diseases like that \none. There were not words to describe the difficulty such a devastating \nloss can bring, and I commend my friend for continuing on so strongly--\nas he did--for so long.\n  Erma was his soulmate, his best friend and trusted counselor. Their \nmarriage was something to behold. My wife Sharon and I loved watching \nthem together. He became a different person. They radiated an \nextraordinary faith in God, in each other, and in the beautiful family \nthey built together, which in the end was what he loved the most. \nIndeed, it was the time Robert C. Byrd spent with Erma; their \ndaughters, Mona and Marjorie, their husbands, and their grandchildren \nand their great-grandchildren that brought sheer joy--pure, \nunadulterated--to his life. So with sadness in my heart, I also have \njoy at the thought of my friend united with his precious Erma, with his \ndear grandson he lost at a young age. And we all know, those of us who \nhave been here for several years, the agony he went through at the \ndeath of that young man, setting up a shrine in his office. It affected \nhim deeply. It was interesting that a man who could be so oriented \ntoward policy, and sometimes almost remote from personal matters, as a \nprofessional self-definition, could be so utterly moved by sadness in \nhis own life and I think in the lives of others.\n  It was in the Halls of the U.S. Senate where Robert C. Byrd became \nknown as the ``Soul of the Senate,'' a fierce defender of the \nConstitution, a respected historian, and an absolutely fearless \nlegislator. He held, as has been said many times before, more \nleadership posts than any other Senator, cast more votes than any other \nSenator, and served longer than any other Senator. And one could go on \nin many ways in that theme. He literally wrote the authoritative book \non the rules and procedures of the Senate. He taught all of us who were \nfreshmen in this body about that in classes which he would conduct \nstanding in the well of the Senate. He loved and he revered this \ninstitution. Everybody says that. It is true.\n  Some people pass through this institution. They experience this \ninstitution. He lived this institution. Yet, still, his entire career \nwas fundamentally an act of commitment to the State of West Virginia \nand its people--a day-in and day-out effort to do the best he possibly \ncould for the people of the Mountain State; always put upon, often \nlooked down upon, even disdained by others who did not understand where \nthey came from, what their lives were like, and, for example, what it \nwas like to be a coal miner. People do not understand West Virginia \nwell. Most people do not go there. Senator Byrd sprung from West \nVirginia and, yes, was an intensely devoted statesman.\n  He put himself through law school while also serving in Congress. I \nknow a few others have done that, but I just sort of deny that. I think \nit is amazing that Senator Byrd did that; therefore, any others who did \nit do not get my attention.\n  He understood that people with the fortitude to ask questions and to \ndebate and to dissent one from another makes America stronger. He had \nthat courage himself, standing up time and time again to defend the \nideals upon which our Nation was founded. And often those ideas were \nvery different from those of others. No matter with Senator Byrd; he \nalways spoke for what he felt was correct.\n  As the minority leader has pointed out, the Senator always had the \nConstitution in his pocket, close to his heart. And he outlasted \nPresidents and Supreme Court Justices. He served with an absolute \ninsistence on the equality of the three branches of government as \nenvisioned by our Founding Fathers, and he, therefore, helped us as a \nbody be more than our separate parts. He spread the words of our \nConstitution to young children and his colleagues alike. His patriotism \nwas strong and confident, infusing his every action with deep devotion \nfor our Nation and its people.\n  A Senator from a State that has sent legions of sons and daughters to \nwar--out of courage, out of love of country, sometimes just out of a \nneed to get work--he supported our troops whether he agreed with their \ncause or not, fought for our veterans, and worked hard to make sure \nthose who served our country got the respect, the support, the supplies \nthey needed and they deserved.\n  He also earned the loyalty of West Virginians with a record of \nsupport for education and economic opportunity that few Senators, at \nany time, in any State, in my judgment, could ever match. To him, every \nschool building or education grant was a chance for a better life for \nsome West Virginia child or maybe quite a lot of children. He cared \nabout that, and he helped that become true.\n  Every overpass, every road represented an opportunity for a more \ndynamic economy for our cities and towns, which might be taken casually \nin some places but not in West Virginia because only 4 percent of our \nland is flat, and unless there is a road or a bridge, you cannot build \nanything anywhere or virtually do anything anywhere. Every business \npark or government office meant the possibility of a better job for \nWest Virginians trying to raise their families--people he fought for \nall his life.\n  Senator Byrd also believed health care is one of the most important \nways to strengthen a community, and his support for medical research \nresulted in breakthrough medical opportunities. He spread this research \nall across West Virginia, to West Virginia University, to Marshall \nUniversity, to institutions of all kinds. He believed in medical \nresearch and did more than most of our colleagues even know.\n  So in a State with rugged terrain, full of people like the family who \nraised him, doing their best for their family, for their country, for \ntheir God, Robert C. Byrd decided that somebody needed to do the best \nfor them, and he did so each and every day of his life.\n  To me, he was a perfect colleague and a reliable friend, a walking \nexample of the kind of America I believe in, and a living testament to \nthe values that made West Virginia my own home forever. It has been my \ngreatest privilege to serve with Robert C. Byrd in the U.S. Senate. I \nrespected him and I fought side-by-side with him for causes we both \nbelieved in, and obviously I am profoundly saddened that he is gone.\n  So in closing, Mr. President, I think he leaves a void that probably \ncannot\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nbe filled. But I am lifted by the knowledge of his deep and abiding \nfaith and that he is in the hands of the One who inspired these words \nin ``Amazing Grace:\n\n       Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\n       And mortal life shall cease,\n       I shall possess within the veil,\n       A life of joy and peace.\n\n  I think that gives all of us some comfort. It certainly does me.\n  So peace and Godspeed, Senator Byrd, and peace to your family, your \nloyal staff, and to the loving people of West Virginia, who held you \nhigh for so long and will continue to do so.\n  I thank the Chair and yield my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5469-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by expressing my deep sorrow \nand my condolences to Robert C. Byrd's family. And that family \nincludes, obviously, not only his direct, immediate family but \nobviously the literally legions of people who worked for Robert C. \nByrd--worked with him in both the House of Representatives and this \nbody for the more than five decades he served in the U.S. Congress.\n  I suspect I am one of a handful of people left who remember the day \nwhen I was 7 years old, in the gallery of the House of Representatives, \nwatching my father be sworn in as a new Congressman, watching my father \nand a young 34-year-old West Virginian named Robert C. Byrd to be sworn \nin as a Member of the House on January 3, 1953. Seven years later, at \nthe age of 14, I was in the gallery of this Chamber when I watched my \nfather and his great friend be sworn in together on January 3, 1959, as \nMembers of the Senate. Two years later, as a 16-year-old sitting on the \nvery steps where these young pages sit today, in the summer of 1961, I \nworked with Robert C. Byrd. In fact, with his departure and his death, \nhe is now the last remaining Member of the Senate who was there that \nday when I first arrived as a page in the summer of 1961 when all these \nchairs were filled by 100 Senators. For the last 25 years, I have sat \nnext to him at this very seat to be the recipient of his good counsel, \nhis advice, his humor, his contributions in so many ways to me, as he \nwas to so many others with whom he served during his tenure in the \nCongress.\n\n  So this is a very poignant day, one that begins, in a sense, a sense \nof bookmarks to me and a sense of public life. It won't be the same for \nthe remaining 6 or 7 months of my tenure here to not have this \nwonderful human being, Robert C. Byrd, as my seatmate in the Senate.\n  So I rise today to mark the passing and to celebrate the prolific \nlife of Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. As I have said to his family \nand to his staff, and, of course, to the people of West Virginia, for \nwhom he has been such a champion throughout his public life, Robert \nByrd loved three things above all else during the 30 years we spent \ntogether in this Chamber. He loved his wife Erma, he loved the State of \nWest Virginia, and he loved deeply the Senate. I might say that each in \nturn loved him back.\n  Our sadness at his passing is tempered by our joy that he now joins \nhis beloved Erma. What a love story it was. They met in grade school. \nThey married in 1937, well before I was even born. They spent nearly 70 \nyears on an incredible journey together, and even after passing a few \nyears ago, his love for her was apparent in everything he did.\n  In 1946, when Robert Byrd first ran for office, West Virginia ranked \nat the bottom in nearly every economic indicator you could possibly \nthink of. It was a bleak landscape pockmarked by coal fields and \npopulated by hard-working people from hardscrabble backgrounds and \ncommunities struggling to make ends meet.\n  Then a young grocer from the town of Sophia arrived on the scene, \nasking his neighbors in those communities around Sophia for their votes \nin his race for the West Virginia House of Delegates. As the Washington \nPost noted in its obituary this morning, Robert C. Byrd met nearly \nevery person--I would suspect every person--in his district, \ncampaigning alone, with no one else, talking about the issues he cared \nabout and those that would affect and did affect the people he wanted \nto represent; and when all else failed, wowing potential voters with \nhis fiddle prowess.\n  He won that election, as he would every single election--every single \nelection for which he ever ran. The people of West Virginia never could \nsay no to Robert C. Byrd, and he could never say no to them. As a State \nlegislator, a Congressman, and as a Senator, Robert C. Byrd fought for \nWest Virginians, and our Nation, I might add, at every single turn.\n  If you travel the State of West Virginia today, you will see his name \non schools and bridges and highway signs. You will perceive his \ninfluence when you see the government buildings and research \nlaboratories he brought to West Virginia--investments that contributed \nboth to the State and to our national economy and to our Nation. But \ndon't just look for his name on the sides of buildings or overpasses. \nListen for it in the appreciative words of his constituents, his \nextended family, and of a grateful nation for his service.\n  No State has ever had such a deep appreciation for the Senate \nAppropriations Committee because no State has ever had such an \neffective appropriator and fighter. Robert C. Byrd came to Congress \nwith my father, as I pointed out, in January of 1953, and they both \narrived on the same day as they had in the House, on January 3 of 1959. \nIn the summer of 1961, I mentioned I was a Senate page sitting on the \nSenate floor. I still remember the eloquent speeches of the freshman \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  It is incredible to imagine that he was once a freshman Senator. Even \nthen, he had the same gentlemanly manner; he was kind to pages, as I \nrecall, the same knack for triumphant oratory, and the same respect for \nthe rules and traditions of the Senate. But he soon became a fixture \nand a mentor to new Senators as well. I expect that over the next few \ndays many Senators will take this floor with a Constitution in their \npockets, as I do, that they received from Robert C. Byrd. Here is my \ntattered and rather worn copy signed by Robert C. Byrd: ``To my friend, \nChris Dodd, with great personal esteem. Sincerely, Robert C. Byrd.'' I \nhave carried this with me every day of my life for the last quarter of \na century, given to me by my colleague in this Chamber, along, I might \nadd, with a stern but kind lecture about Senate protocol. I have mine \nright here, as I said. It is a tattered and withered copy, after this \nmany years.\n  For the past quarter of a century I have occupied some prime real \nestate on the floor of the Senate. This desk right next to me today, \nadorned with these flowers and this black cape, marks the seat Robert \nC. Byrd sat in for many years. As have all of us, I have been awed by \nhis deep knowledge of this institution and his deeper commitment to \npreserving its place in our legislative system.\n  So, in many ways, Robert Byrd's story is one of constancy, of \npreservation, and of tradition. You could define his life by longevity, \nI suppose--his 69 years of marriage, his 52 years of service in the \nSenate, his 64 years of public service to the people of West Virginia. \nBut he wouldn't have wanted it that way. This country has changed over\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\nthe many years in which Robert C. Byrd helped to lead it and to shape \nit, and he grew and changed with it, I might add. His story in so many \nways parallels the American story over these many years--the story of a \nnation on a long and difficult journey, always trying to seek that more \nperfect union that our Founders described more than two centuries ago.\n  He wouldn't have wanted us to forget about the positions and \naffiliations that marked the early part of his life and career, and he \ndid not as well. We should learn from our mistakes, as he did, draw \ninspiration from his journey, and credit him, I might add, for being \nwilling to admit wrong and embrace right when he had the opportunity to \ndo so, because, like our country, Robert C. Byrd grew wiser as he grew \nolder.\n  So we can remember him not only as a tremendously effective \nlegislator, not only as a powerful speaker, not only as a parliamentary \nwizard, but also as a human being who fought for equality with the true \nsense of urgency of a convert. He was a man unafraid of reflection, a \nman who voted to make Martin Luther King's birthday a Federal holiday \nbecause, as he put it--I remember him saying it so well--``I'm the only \none who must vote for this bill.''\n  Here was a man unafraid of progress, a man who, in one of his final \nacts in the Senate, voted to overturn the don't ask, don't tell rule in \nour military. Here was a man unafraid of conscience, a man who, as the \nguns of war prepared to fire in 2003, delivered one of history's most \ncourageous and memorable pleas for peace.\n  So let us not remember Robert C. Byrd for how much he stayed the same \nthroughout his life. Let us remember him for how the years changed him, \nand how he changed America for the better through so many years of his \nservice.\n  Let us remember him as West Virginia's greatest champion, the \nSenate's gentlemanly scholar, Erma's husband, and above all, a true \nfriend to each and every one of us who knew and loved him so well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nI would ask through the Chair--I plan to speak for about 5 minutes. \nDoes that leave him time to make remarks?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 1981, after a surprising election, \nthe Republican leader, Howard Baker, became the majority leader of the \nSenate, and the Democratic leader, Robert C. Byrd, became the minority \nleader.\n  According to Senator Baker, he walked to Senator Byrd's office and \nsaid to him: Bob, I will never know the Senate rules as well as you do, \nso I will make you an offer. I will not surprise you if you will never \nsurprise me.\n  Senator Byrd looked at Senator Baker and said: Let me think about it.\n  The next morning, Senator Byrd called Senator Baker and said: It is a \ndeal. And that is the way they operated the Senate in those 4 years \nwhen Senator Baker was the majority leader and Senator Byrd was the \nminority leader. They operated the Senate during that time under an \nagreement where Senator Byrd was careful to try to give every Senator \nthe right of amendment. He thought that was very important. In return, \nSenator Byrd was able to get unanimous consent agreements on amendments \nthat many Senators thought were frivolous or unnecessary or not \ngermane, which permitted him and Senator Baker to have a fairly orderly \nmanagement of the Senate during that time.\n  Senator McConnell a few minutes ago talked about the time Senator \nByrd reexamined the Constitution and changed his mind on the first \namendment and flag burning. Senator Byrd and Senator Baker during that \ntime both read David McCullough's book and changed their minds on the \nPanama Canal Treaty, at great political cost to both of them. I bring \nthis up today because I never saw Senator Byrd, after I was elected to \nthe Senate a few years ago, when he did not ask me about his friend and \ncolleague Howard Baker.\n  We will miss Senator Byrd's fiddling and his love of mountain music. \nHe campaigned in Tennessee a long time ago for Albert Gore, Sr. who was \nrunning for the Senate and who also played the fiddle. Senator Byrd \nplayed the fiddle at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville and came back to \nNashville in October of 2008 and sang along with a group of fiddlers \nwho were playing songs at his request. I went over there with him. He \nknew all the songs and all the fiddlers knew him. A few days later I \ncame to him on the Senate floor and talked to him about an old mountain \nsong called ``Wreck on the Highway'' that Roy Acuff made famous in the \n1930s or 1940s, and Senator Byrd began to sing the song--he knew all \nthe words--so loudly that the staff was afraid the galleries would all \nnotice it.\n  We will miss his love of United States history, not just any United \nStates history, but in his words ``traditional American history.'' He \nwas the sponsor of the Teaching Traditional American History Program, \nwhich is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. He has \nprovided nearly $600 million to 1,000 local school districts to improve \nthe professional development of American history teachers. He and the \nlate Senator Kennedy and I were working on a piece of legislation which \nwe have introduced to consolidate all the Federal programs that support \nthe teaching of U.S. history, hoping that our children can grow up \nlearning what it means to be an American.\n  Senator Byrd is also responsible for the celebration of September 17 \nas Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.\n  Senator Byrd had no time for revisionists who didn't believe America \nwas exceptional. He believed this is one country, unified by a common \nlanguage and a few principles. He did not want our country to become a \nUnited Nations, but always to be the United States of America. He \nwanted us to be proud of where we came from, but prouder to be \nAmerican.\n  We will especially miss Senator Byrd's love of and understanding of \nthe Senate. One of the most special occasions I ever experienced was \nthe opportunity as a freshman Senator in 2003 to attend an \nindoctrination, one might say--or orientation would be the proper \ndescription--on what it means to be a Senator. Senator Byrd began by \nsaying: ``You are presently occupying what I consider to be hallowed \nground.''\n  I wish to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks the remarks of Senator Byrd at the orientation of \nnew Senators on December 3, 1996.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Byrd served long enough to know that, as he \nput it:\n\n       As long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the \n     power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will \n     remain secure.\n\n  He believed that when he was lecturing Republicans in 2005 who were \ntrying to change the rules when there was a controversy about President \nBush's appointees to the Federal judiciary, and he said the same thing \nto young Democrats who grew impatient this year and wanted to change \nthe rules to limit unlimited amendment and unlimited debate.\n  Perhaps his last Senate appearance was before the Rules Committee on \nMay 19, 2010, where his opening statement on the filibuster and its \nconsequences warned against a rules change.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that statement printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I was 12 years old when Senator Robert \nByrd was elected to the House of Representatives. I was a senior in \nMaryville, TN, when he was elected to the Senate. When I came here as a \nSenate aide 42 years ago, he had just been elected to his second term \nand was working his way up the party leadership.\n  He was an imposing man. He had a wonderful photographic memory. But, \nafter one got to know him especially, he was a kind man.\n  All of us can be replaced, but it is fair to say the Senate will \nnever be the same place without Robert C. Byrd.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd at the Orientation of New \n                       Senators, December 3, 1996\n\n       Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Senate \n     Chamber. You are presently occupying what I consider to be \n     `hallowed ground.'\n       You will shortly join the ranks of a very select group of \n     individuals who have been honored with the title of United \n     States Senator since 1789 when the Senate first convened. The \n     creator willing, you will be here for at least six years.\n       Make no mistake about it, the office of United States \n     Senator is the highest political calling in the land. The \n     Senate can remove from office Presidents, members of the \n     Federal judiciary, and other Federal officials but only the \n     Senate itself can expel a Senator.\n       Let us listen for a moment to the words of James Madison on \n     the role of the Senate.\n       `These [reasons for establishing the Senate] were first to \n     protect the people against their rulers: secondly to protect \n     the people against the transient impression into which they \n     themselves might be led. [through their representatives in \n     the lower house] A people deliberating in a temperate moment, \n     and with the experience of other nations before them, on the \n     plan of government most likely to secure their happiness, \n     would first be aware, that those charged with the public \n     happiness, might betray their trust. An obvious precaution \n     against this danger would be to divide the trust between \n     different bodies of men, who might watch and check each \n     other. . . . It would next occur to such a people, that they \n     themselves were liable to temporary errors, through want of \n     information as to their true interest, and that men chosen \n     for a short term, [House members], . . . might err from the \n     same cause. This reflection would naturally suggest that the \n     Government be so constituted, as that one of its branches \n     might have an opportunity of acquiring a competent knowledge \n     of the public interests. Another reflection equally becoming \n     a people on such an occasion, would be that they themselves, \n     as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils. \n     [emphasis added]\n       Ladies and gentlemen, you are shortly to become part of \n     that all important, `necessary fence,' which is the United \n     States Senate. Let me give you the words of Vice President \n     Aaron Burr upon his departure from the Senate in 1805. `This \n     house,' said he, `is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, \n     and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hand of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.' Gladstone referred to the Senate as \n     `that remarkable body--the most remarkable of all the \n     inventions of modern politics.'\n       This is a very large class of new Senators. There are \n     fifteen of you. It has been sixteen years since the Senate \n     welcomed a larger group of new members. Since 1980, the \n     average size class of new members has been approximately ten. \n     Your backgrounds vary. Some of you may have served in the \n     Executive Branch. Some may have been staffers here on the \n     Hill. Some of you have never held federal office before. Over \n     half of you have had some service in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Let us clearly understand one thing. The Constitution's \n     Framers never intended for the Senate to function like the \n     House of Representatives. That fact is immediately apparent \n     when one considers the length of a Senate term and the \n     staggered nature of Senate terms. The Senate was intended to \n     be a continuing body. By subjecting only one-third of the \n     Senate's membership to reelection every two years, the \n     Constitution's framers ensured that two-thirds of the \n     membership would always carry over from one Congress to the \n     next to give the Senate an enduring stability.\n       The Senate and, therefore, Senators were intended to take \n     the long view and to be able to resist, if need be, the \n     passions of the often intemperate House. Few, if any, upper \n     chambers in the history of the western world have possessed \n     the Senate's absolute right to unlimited debate and to amend \n     or block legislation passed by a lower House.\n       Looking back over a period of 208 years, it becomes obvious \n     that the Senate was intended to be significantly different \n     from the House in other ways as well. The Constitutional \n     Framers gave the Senate the unique executive powers of \n     providing advice and consent to presidential nominations and \n     to treaties, and the sole power to try and to remove \n     impeached officers of the government. In the case of \n     treaties, the Senate, with its longer terms, and its ability \n     to develop expertise through the device of being a continuing \n     body, has often performed invaluable service.\n       I have said that as long as the Senate retains the power to \n     amend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the \n     people will remain secure.\n       The Senate was intended to be a forum for open and free \n     debate and for the protection of political minorities. I have \n     led the majority and I have led the minority, and I can tell \n     you that there is nothing that makes one fully appreciate the \n     Senate's special role as the protector of minority interests \n     like being in the minority. Since the Republican Party was \n     created in 1854, the Senate has changed hands 14 times, so \n     each party has had the opportunity to appreciate firsthand \n     the Senate's role as guardian of minority rights. But, almost \n     from its earliest years the Senate has insisted upon its \n     members' right to virtually unlimited debate.\n       When the Senate reluctantly adopted a cloture rule in 1917, \n     it made the closing of debate very difficult to achieve by \n     requiring a super majority and by permitting extended post-\n     cloture debate. This deference to minority views sharply \n     distinguishes the Senate from the majoritarian House of \n     Representatives. The Framers recognized that a minority can \n     be right and that a majority can be wrong. They recognized \n     that the Senate should be a true deliberative body--a forum \n     in which to slow the passions of the House, hold them up to \n     the light, examine them, and, thru informed debate, educate \n     the public. The Senate is the proverbial saucer intended to \n     cool the cup of coffee from the House. It is the one place in \n     the whole government where the minority is guaranteed a \n     public airing of its views. Woodrow Wilson observed that the \n     Senate's informing function was as important as its \n     legislating function, and now, with televised Senate debate, \n     its informing function plays an even larger and more critical \n     role in the life of our nation.\n       Many a mind has been changed by an impassioned plea from \n     the minority side. Important flaws in otherwise good \n     legislation have been detected by discerning minority members \n     engaged in thorough debate, and important compromise which \n     has worked to the great benefit of our nation has been forged \n     by an intransigent member determined to filibuster until his \n     views were accommodated or at least seriously considered.\n       The Senate is often soundly castigated for its \n     inefficiency, but in fact, it was never intended to be \n     efficient. Its purpose was and is to examine, consider, \n     protect, and to be a totally independent source of wisdom and \n     judgment on the actions of the lower house and on the \n     executive. As such, the Senate is the central pillar of our \n     Constitutional system. I hope that you, as new members will \n     study the Senate in its institutional context because that is \n     the best way to understand your personal role as a United \n     States Senator. Your responsibilities are heavy. \n     Understand them, live up to them, and strive to take the \n     long view as you exercise your duties. This will not \n     always be easy.\n       The pressures on you will, at times, be enormous. You will \n     have to formulate policies, grapple with issues, serve the \n     constituents in your state, and cope with the media. A \n     Senator's attention today is fractured beyond belief. \n     Committee meetings, breaking news, fundraising, all of these \n     will demand your attention, not to mention personal and \n     family responsibilities. But, somehow, amidst all the noise \n     and confusion, you must find the time to reflect, to study, \n     to read, and, especially, to understand the absolutely \n     critically important institutional role of the Senate.\n       May I suggest that you start by carefully reading the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers. In a few weeks, you \n     will stand on the platform behind me and take an oath to \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith \n     and allegiance to the same; and take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and to \n     well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on \n     which you are about to enter: So help you God.'\n       Note especially the first 22 words, `I do solemnly swear \n     that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States against all enemies foreign and domestic . . .'\n       In order to live up to that solemn oath, one must clearly \n     understand the deliberately established inherent tensions \n     between the 3 branches, commonly called the checks and \n     balances, and separation of powers which the framers so \n     carefully crafted. I carry a copy of the Constitution in my \n     shirt pocket. I have studied it carefully, read and reread \n     its articles, marveled at its genius, its beauty, its \n     symmetry, and its meticulous balance, and learned something \n     new each time that I partook of its timeless wisdom. Nothing \n     will help you to fully grasp the Senate's critical role in \n     the balance of powers like a thorough reading of the \n     Constitution and the Federalist papers.\n       Now I would like to turn for a moment to the human side of \n     the Senate, the relationship among Senators, and the way that \n     even that faced of service here is, to a degree, governed by \n     the constitution and the Senate's rules.\n       The requirement for super majority votes in approving \n     treaties, involving cloture, removing impeached federal \n     officers, and overriding vetoes, plus the need for unanimous \n     consent before the Senate can even proceed in many instances, \n     makes bipartisanship and comity necessary if members wish to \n     accomplish much of anything. Realize this. The campaign is \n     over. You are here to be a Senator. Not much happens in this \n     body without cooperation between the two parties.\n       In this now 208-year-old institution, the positions of \n     majority and minority leaders have existed for less than 80 \n     years. Although the positions have evolved significantly \n     within the past half century, still, the only really \n     substantive prerogative the leaders\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n     possess is the right of first recognition before any other \n     member of their respective parties who might wish to speak on \n     the Senate Floor. Those of you who have served in the House \n     will now have to forget about such things as the Committee of \n     the Whole, closed rules, and germaneness, except when cloture \n     has been invoked, and become well acquainted with the \n     workings of unanimous consent agreements. Those of you who \n     took the trouble to learn Deschler's Procedure will now need \n     to set that aside and turn in earnest to Riddick's Senate \n     Procedure.\n       Senators can lose the Floor for transgressing the rules. \n     Personal attacks on other members or other blatantly \n     injudicious comments are unacceptable in the Senate. Again to \n     encourage a cooling of passions, and to promote a calm \n     examination of substance, Senators address each other through \n     the Presiding Officer and in the third person. Civility is \n     essential here for pragmatic reasons as well as for public \n     consumption. It is difficult to project the image of a \n     statesmanlike, intelligent, public servant, attempting to \n     inform the public and examine issues, if one is behaving and \n     speaking in a manner more appropriate to a pool room brawl \n     than to United States Senate debate. You will also find that \n     overly zealous attacks on other members or on their states \n     are always extremely counterproductive, and that you will \n     usually be repaid in kind.\n       Let us strive for dignity. When you rise to speak on this \n     Senate Floor, you will be following in the tradition of such \n     men as Calhoun, Clay, and Webster. You will be standing in \n     the place of such Senators as Edmund Ross (KS) and Peter Van \n     Winkle (WEST VIRGINIA), 1868, who voted against their party \n     to save the institution of the presidency during the Andrew \n     Johnson impeachment trial.\n       Debate on the Senate Floor demands thought, careful \n     preparation and some familiarity with Senate Rules if we are \n     to engage in thoughtful and informed debate. Additionally, \n     informed debate helps the American people have a better \n     understanding of the complicated problems which besiege them \n     in their own lives. Simply put, the Senate cannot inform \n     American citizens without extensive debate on those very \n     issues.\n       We were not elected to raise money for our own reelections. \n     We were not elected to see how many press releases or TV \n     appearances we could stack up. We were not elected to set up \n     staff empires by serving on every committee in sight. We need \n     to concentrate, focus, debate, inform, and, I hope, engage \n     the public, and thereby forge consensus and direction. Once \n     we engage each other and the public intellectually, the tough \n     choices will be easier.\n       I thank each of you for your time and attention and I \n     congratulate each of you on your selection to fill a seat in \n     this August body. Service in this body is a supreme honor. It \n     is also a burden and a serious responsibility. Members' lives \n     become open for inspection and are used as examples for other \n     citizens to emulate. A Senator must really be much more than \n     hardworking, much more than conscientious, much more than \n     dutiful. A Senator must reach for noble qualities--honor, \n     total dedication, self-discipline, extreme selflessness, \n     exemplary patriotism, sober judgment, and intellectual \n     honesty. The Senate is more important than any one or all of \n     us--more important than I am; more important than the \n     majority and minority leaders; more important than all 100 of \n     us; more important than all of the 1,843 men and women who \n     have served in this body since 1789. Each of us has a solemn \n     responsibility to remember that, and to remember it often.\n       Let me leave you with the words of the last paragraph of \n     Volume II, of The Senate: 1789-1989: `Originally consisting \n     of only twenty-two members, the Senate had grown to a \n     membership of ninety-eight by the time I was sworn in as a \n     new senator in January 1959. After two hundred years, it is \n     still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and evening \n     star in the American constitutional constellation. It has had \n     its giants and its little men, its Websters and its Bilbos, \n     its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the stage of high \n     drama, of comedy and of tragedy, and its players have been \n     the great and the near-great, those who think they are great, \n     and those who will never be great. It has weathered the \n     storms of adversity withstood the barbs of cynics and the \n     attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength to \n     the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, \n     panics and depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the \n     sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of \n     a political minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--\n     the great forum of constitutional American liberty!'\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n    Statement of Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Senate Rules and \n                 Administration Committee, May 19, 2010\n\n\n                  The Filibuster And Its Consequences\n\n       On September 30, 1788, Pennsylvania became the first state \n     to elect its United States senators, one of whom was William \n     Maclay. In his 1789 journal Senator Maclay wrote, ``I gave my \n     opinion in plain language that the confidence of the people \n     was departing from us, owing to our unreasonable delays. The \n     design of the Virginians and of the South Carolina gentlemen \n     was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill \n     passed.''\n       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing \n     body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the \n     protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this \n     since the Senate first convened.\n       In his notes of the Constitutional Convention on June 26, \n     1787, James Madison recorded that the ends to be served by \n     the Senate were ``first, to protect the people against their \n     rulers, secondly, to protect the people against the transient \n     impressions into which they themselves might be led . . . \n     They themselves, as well as a numerous body of \n     Representatives, were liable to err also, from fickleness and \n     passion. A necessary fence against this danger would be to \n     select a portion of enlightened citizens, whose limited \n     number, and firmness might seasonably interpose against \n     impetuous councils.'' That ``fence'' was the United States \n     Senate.\n       The right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence. But \n     it is not a right intended to be abused.\n       During this 111th Congress in particular the minority has \n     threatened to filibuster almost every matter proposed for \n     Senate consideration. I find this tactic contrary to each \n     Senator's duty to act in good faith.\n       I share the profound frustration of my constituents and \n     colleagues as we confront this situation. The challenges \n     before our nation are far too grave, and too numerous, for \n     the Senate to be rendered impotent to address them, and yet \n     be derided for inaction by those causing the delay.\n       There are many suggestions as to what we should do. I know \n     what we must not do.\n       We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary \n     fence--this nation has against the excesses of the Executive \n     Branch and the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.\n       The path to solving our problem lies in our thoroughly \n     understanding it. Does the difficulty reside in the construct \n     of our rules or in the ease of circumventing them?\n       A true filibuster is a fight, not a threatt or a bluff. For \n     most of the Senate's history, Senators motivated to extend \n     debate had to hold the floor as long as they were physically \n     able. The Senate was either persuaded by the strength of \n     their arguments or unconvinced by either their commitment or \n     their stamina. True filibusters were therefore less frequent, \n     and more commonly discouraged, due to every Senator's \n     understanding that such undertakings required grueling \n     personal sacrifice, exhausting preparation, and a willingness \n     to be criticized for disrupting the nation's business.\n       Now, unbelievably, just the whisper of opposition brings \n     the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' to a grinding \n     halt. Why?\n       Because this once highly respected institution has become \n     overwhelmingly consumed by a fixation with money and media.\n       Gone are the days when Senators Richard Russell and Lyndon \n     Johnson, and Speaker Sam Rayburn gathered routinely for \n     working weekends and couldn't wait to get back to their \n     chambers on Monday morning.\n       Now every Senator spends hours every day, throughout the \n     year and every year, raising funds for re-election and \n     appearing before cameras and microphones. Now the Senate \n     often works three-day weeks, with frequent and extended \n     recess periods, so Senators can rush home to fundraisers \n     scheduled months in advance.\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady. Most recently, Senate \n     Majority Leader Reid announced that the Senate would stay in \n     session around-the-clock and take all procedural steps \n     necessary to bring financial reform legislation before the \n     Senate. As preparations were made and cots rolled out, a deal \n     was struck within hours and the threat of filibuster was \n     withdrawn.\n       I heartily commend the Majority Leader for this progress, \n     and I strongly caution my colleagues as some propose to alter \n     the rules to severely limit the ability of a minority to \n     conduct a filibuster. I know what it is to be Majority \n     Leader, and wake up on a Wednesday morning in November, and \n     find yourself a Minority Leader.\n       I also know that current Senate Rules provide the means to \n     break a filibuster. I employed them in 1977 to end the post-\n     cloture filibuster of natural gas deregulation legislation. \n     This was the roughest filibuster I have experienced during my \n     fifty-plus years in the Senate, and it produced the most-\n     bitter feelings. Yet some important new precedents were \n     established in dealing with post-cloture obstruction. In \n     1987, I successfully used Rules 7 and 8 to make a non-\n     debatable motion to proceed during the morning hour. No \n     leader has attempted this technique since, but this procedure \n     could be and should be used.\n       Over the years, I have proposed a variety of improvements \n     to Senate Rules to achieve a more sensible balance allowing \n     the majority to function while still protecting minority \n     rights. For example, I have supported eliminating debate on \n     the motion to proceed to a matter (except for changes to \n     Senate rules), or limiting debate to a reasonable time on \n     such motions, with Senators retaining the right to unlimited \n     debate on the matter once before the Senate. I have authored \n     several other proposals in the past, and I look forward to \n     our committee work ahead as we carefully examine other \n     suggested changes. The Committee must, however, jealously \n     guard against efforts to change or reinterpret the Senate \n     rules by a simple majority, circumventing Rule XXII where a \n     two-thirds majority is required.\n       As I have said before, the Senate has been the last \n     fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this \n     Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators \n     will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and \n     tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.\n\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, since hearing this morning about the \npassing of Senator Byrd--he died shortly after 5 a.m.--I have been \nreflecting on the man I knew.\n  Those who have the great privilege to serve in the Senate have \noccasion to meet and interact with great people. The expression \n``giant'' is used not too frequently about Senators. It certainly would \napply to Senator Byrd, but I believe it is insufficient. Searching my \nown mind for a more apt term, ``colossus'' might better fit Robert \nByrd.\n  His career in the Congress of the United States was extraordinary, \nreally astounding. To think that he was elected in 1952 and was sworn \nin while Harry Truman was still President of the United States and has \nserved since that time, with many things that happened, during the \nadministrations of President Eisenhower, President Kennedy, President \nJohnson, President Nixon, President Carter, President George H.W. Bush, \nPresident Ronald Reagan before, President George W. Bush, President \nClinton, and now President Obama.\n  One of the distinctions he made early on was the fact that in the \nSenate, we serve with Presidents; we do not serve under Presidents. I \nthink that was a calling card by Senator Byrd as a constitutionalist on \nthe separation of powers. He was a fierce fighter for that separation \nof powers.\n  When the line-item veto was passed, he took up the battle to have it \ndeclared unconstitutional as an encroachment on article I powers in the \nU.S. Congress on appropriations. The bills which we present to the \nPresident have a great many provisions, and Senator Byrd was looking \nupon the factor of the President perhaps taking some provisions he did \nnot like too well in order to take the whole bill. I am sure on Senator \nByrd's mind was the largess which came to the State of West Virginia. \nThat is part of our Federal system, part of our democracy, part of our \nConstitution of the advantage of seniority, where Senator Byrd had been \nelected and reelected on so many occasions.\n  I recall Senator Byrd and his swift action shortly after the 1986 \nelection. I was on the Intelligence Committee at that time. Senator \nByrd stepped into the picture to see to it that the witnesses who \ntestified on what was later known as the Iran Contra controversy were \nplaced under oath. He had a sense that there was a problem that had to \nbe investigated by Congress, again, under the doctrine of separation of \npowers.\n  I recollect his position on the impeachment proceeding as he stood at \nthis chair and recited the provisions of the Constitution, about the \nimpeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors, and then started to talk \nabout the action of the respondent in the case, President Clinton, and \nthe charges which were levied. He came to the conclusion that the \nconstitutional standard had been met and then voted not guilty--with a \nsweep on the conclusion, a judgment of a higher principle involved that \nPresident Clinton had not lost the capacity to govern, and he ought to \nstay in office.\n  I recall in October of 2002 we debated the resolution authorizing the \nuse of force for President Bush. The resolution did not say force would \nbe used but gave the President the authority to use force as he decided \nit appropriate.\n  I was concerned about that. The scholars who had written on the \nsubject for the most part said it would be an inappropriate delegation \nof constitutional authority for the Congress to say to the President: \nYou may start a war at some future date.\n  The starting of a war depended on the facts and circumstances at hand \nwhen the decision was made. Senator Byrd and I discussed that at some \nlength and finally concluded there ought to be some flexibility. Both \nof us voted for that resolution on the ground that empowering the \nPresident without authority, we might have the realistic chance of \navoiding a war.\n  While serving with Senator Byrd on the Appropriations Committee, I \nrecall 1 year when he chaired the Appropriations Committee--I think in \nthe late 1980s--the allocations made were not in accordance with the \nbudget resolution which had been passed. Some of us on the \nAppropriations Committee thought we ought to have those allocations in \naccordance with what Congress had set in the budget resolution. Senator \nD'Amato, Senator Kasten, and I staged a minor revolution. It did not \nlast too long. The vote was 26 to 3. But we expressed ourselves.\n  I recall hearing Senator Byrd and participated in a discussion with \nhim on the Senate floor about the right to retain the floor, whether \nyou could yield to someone or whether you had to have an order of \nconsent before you retained your right to the floor. Discussing or \ndebating Senator Byrd on procedural issues was indeed an education. He \nwas always regarded as the foremost expert on Senate procedure and the \nrules of this body.\n  His service--most recently in coming in ill, in a wheelchair for a \nseries of cloture votes at 1 a.m.--historians, I think, will write \nabout the passage of the comprehensive health care bill and the cloture \nvotes and passage in the Senate on Christmas Eve early in the morning--\nfinally, we had a concession we would not vote at 11:59 on Christmas \nbut would vote earlier in the day. Even the objectors wanted to leave \ntown. Senator Byrd came here performing his duty, although he certainly \nwas not well and it was a tremendous strain on him. He came and made \nthe 60th vote.\n  It is a sad occasion to see a black drape on Senator Byrd's desk and \nflowers. I am sure in days to come there will be many comments, many \neulogies about Senator Byrd. He leaves a great void. But reflecting on \nthe experiences I have had with him, there is much to celebrate in his \nlife. He was a great American, a great Senator. We will all miss him \nvery much.\n  In the absence of any other Senator on the floor seeking recognition, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, early this morning, our country lost an \nicon and a national treasure. Our friend and colleague, Senator Robert \nC. Byrd, became a legend in his own time. And in many ways, he came to \nembody the institution of the Senate.\n  As a leader, and as a guardian of Senate procedure and tradition, \nSenator Byrd was without equal. For more than half a century, he helped \nshape federal policy, and guided the course of a nation.\n  But on the day he was born, in 1917, this unique place in history was \nfar from assured.\n  Raised in the coal country of West Virginia, few could have predicted \nthat this intelligent but unassuming young man would rise to the very \nhighest levels of our democracy. He was an avid fiddle player, and \nvaledictorian of his high school class. But he could not afford to go \nto college until many years later. So as a young man, he found work as \na meat cutter, a gas station attendant, and a store owner. And the \nstore owner is very dear to me because our family were store owners, \nand I know how tough that business is. He welded Liberty and Victory \nships during the Second World War, and several years later entered \npolitics at the State level.\n  That is where Robert Byrd found his true calling: public service.\n  He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1952, and has \nserved the people of West Virginia in this Chamber since 1958. Over the \ncourse of his extraordinary career, he worked alongside 11 Presidents. \nHe served in Congress longer than anyone in American history, cast more \nthan 18,000 votes, and was elected to more leadership positions than \nany other Senator.\n  Most recently, he assumed the role of President pro tempore of the \nSenate, ranking him third in the line of Presidential succession. At \nevery turn, he dedicated himself to the sanctity of our Constitution, \nand fought to uphold its principles and the weight of Senate tradition.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  It is difficult to measure the vast impact he has had on the lives of \nevery single American.\n  No, he was not right on every issue. His past was not without \nmistakes and errors in judgment. But it is a credit to Senator Byrd \nthat, over the years, he gained the wisdom to recognize the moments \nwhen he strayed from the right path. It is the mark of greatness that \nhe worked hard to overcome these errors and set America on course for a \nmore prosperous, more inclusive future.\n  In recent years, Senator Byrd raised his voice against the unilateral \ninvasion of Iraq.\n  He fought to preserve the filibuster, ensuring that the voice of the \nminority will always have a place in this august Chamber. He offered \nhis support to a young Senator from Illinois named Barack Obama, as he \nfought to become the first African-American President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Byrd's historic tenure spanned 11 administrations, thousands \nof bills, and more than half a century. Thanks to his leadership, and \nthe leadership of others he has inspired and mentored over the years, \nwe live in a very different world today.\n  The year he launched his first campaign for the House of \nRepresentatives, gas cost about 25 cents a gallon, Winston Churchill \nwas Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and I was only 15 years old.\n  Senator Byrd has left an indelible mark on this Nation, and for that \nwe will be forever grateful.\n  But today, as we remember and celebrate the contributions he has \nmade, we also offer our condolences to his friends and loved ones in \nthis time of mourning. We offer our sympathies to the people of West \nVirginia, who have lost a staunch advocate. We offer our fervent hope \nthat a new generation of Americans, liberal and conservative; Black and \nWhite; from all races and religions and backgrounds.\n  We hope that a new generation will take up the legacy of patriotism \nand service that was left to us by Senator Byrd; that today's young \npeople will inherit his fierce loyalty to the Constitution, and \nrecognize their responsibility to confront every challenge we face.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring the life of our \ndear friend, Senator Robert Byrd.\n  And I call upon every American to learn from the example set by this \nson of the West Virginia hills who overcame poverty, lack of education, \nand the prejudice of his times to become one of the greatest public \nservants in our history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the Judiciary Committee just wrapped \nup its hearings on the first day of the nomination of Elena Kagan to be \nan Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. These hearings will provide \nSenators on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to examine Ms. \nKagan's record, legal experience, and background in light of the \nawesome responsibility that comes with a lifetime appointment on our \nNation's highest Court. These hearings also provide an opportunity for \nthe American people to focus their attention on a woman whom President \nObama would like to see deciding cases on many of the most important \nand consequential issues we face as a people, long after the \nPresident's time in office is through.\n  In the near term, she would be ruling on the actions and policies of \nan administration of which she is now a member. So it is well worth \nasking why the President chose Ms. Kagan in the first place. We know \nthe President and Ms. Kagan are former colleagues, and we know from the \nPresident himself that they are friends. We know he views her as an \nimportant member of his team and that he was especially pleased with \nher handling of the Citizens United case. The President is no doubt \nconfident that Ms. Kagan shares his view that judges should be judged \nprimarily on their ability to empathize with some over others; in other \nwords, that she embraces the empathy standard he has talked about time \nand time again. But as I have said before, while empathy may be a very \ngood quality in general, in a court of law it is only\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\ngood if you are lucky enough to be the guy the judge empathizes with. \nIn those cases, it is the judge, not the law, who determines your fate.\n  In a nation such as ours, conceived from its very beginning as a \nnation not of men but of laws, this is a very dangerous road to go \ndown. In the case of President Obama's previous nominee to the Supreme \nCourt, Senators had many years of court cases to study in determining \nwhether Sonia Sotomayor could be expected to treat everyone who came \nbefore her equally, just as Americans would expect in a judge and just \nas the judicial oath requires. In Elena Kagan's case, however, no such \nrecord exists. She has no experience as a judge, nor does she have much \nof a record as a legal practitioner. This is one of the reasons some \nhave raised Ms. Kagan's experience as an issue.\n  It stands to reason that in order to know what kind of judge John \nRoberts or Sam Alito or Sonia Sotomayor would be, it was useful for \nSenators from both parties to look at the kind of judge these nominees \nhad been. Since Ms. Kagan has not had the judicial or private practice \nexperience common to most modern-day nominees, it is all the more \nimportant that we look more closely at the kind of experience she has \nhad. A review of that experience reveals a woman who has spent much of \nher adult life not steeped in the practice of law but in the art of \npolitics. To be more specific, when we look at Elena Kagan's resume, \nwhat we find is a woman who spent much of her adult life working to \nadvance the goals of the Democratic Party.\n  As a young woman in college, she spent one summer working 14 hours a \nday for a liberal Democratic candidate for the Senate, and when her \ncandidate lost, Ms. Kagan wrote that she believed the ``world had gone \nmad, that liberalism was dead.'' If all we had were the comments of an \nimpassioned young student, they would not be worth all that much. Few \nof us would want everything we wrote as a college student put up on an \noverhead projector.\n  Yet the trajectory of Ms. Kagan's career, the testimony of those who \nknow her work well, and the recently released records of her time as a \npolitical adviser in the Clinton White House, suggest otherwise. Taken \ntogether, they suggest someone, as one news story put it, who long \nafter college and even at the highest peaks of political influence was \n``driven and opinionated, with a flare for political tactics. . . .''\n  What else do we find in Ms. Kagan's resume? Well, she volunteered for \nthe Dukakis Presidential campaign, working as an opposition researcher \nto defend the then-Governor of Massachusetts from attacks, and to look \nfor ways to attack the Republican opposition. As an aide to President \nClinton, Ms. Kagan did not serve mostly as an attorney, as she put it, \nbut as a policy advocate, frequently looking for ways to advantage \nDemocrats over Republicans.\n  If you believe the role of a judge is to be an impartial arbiter, \nthese things cannot be ignored. Indeed, Members of both parties should \nappreciate the importance of confirming judges who are more interested \nin what the law says than in how the law can be used to advantage any \none individual, party, or group. It is to no one's advantage if judges \ncannot be expected to rise above politics. As the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee once put it:\n\n       No one should vote for somebody that's going to be a \n     political apparatchik for either the Democratic Party or the \n     Republican Party.\n\n  If there is one thing we can all agree on, it is that politics should \nend at the courtroom door.\n  So this is one of the key questions Senators will be looking to \nanswer as these hearings proceed: Is someone who has done the kind of \npolitical work Ms. Kagan has done in her career more or less likely to \nrestrain her political views if she were confirmed to a lifetime \nposition on the country's highest Court?\n  Ms. Kagan has never made a secret of her professional aspirations. \nShe has cultivated all the right friendships along the way, which is \nall well and good. No one ever rose to the heights of their profession \nby ignoring or upsetting the people who could get them there. But the \nquestion before us is whether Ms. Kagan's political views would be more \nor less constrained by the Constitution she swears to uphold once she \nreaches her goal.\n  Some of Ms. Kagan's supporters wish us to focus on her personality. \nThey wish to point out she has a knack for making friends and for \ngetting along well with different kinds of people in academia and among \nthe political class. Once again, these are all fine qualities. No one \nhas any doubt that Ms. Kagan is bright and personable and easy to get \nalong with. But the Supreme Court is not a dinner club. If getting \nalong in polite society were enough to put somebody on the Supreme \nCourt, then we would not need confirmation hearings at all.\n  The goal here is not to determine whether we think someone will get \nalong well with the other eight Justices; it is whether someone can be \nexpected to be a neutral and independent arbiter of the law rather than \na rubberstamp for any administration.\n  These are just some of the questions Senators will be asking and \nwhich Ms. Kagan will be expected to answer. No one should have any \ndoubt that Republicans will treat Ms. Kagan with the same respect and \nprofessionalism they treated Judge Sotomayor. But questions must be \nanswered and clear judgments must be made.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listen sometimes on the floor of the \nSenate and think there should be an Olympic Gold Medal for flexibility. \nIt is interesting. For example, the flexibility would mean you are \nflexible enough to understand if a Republican President were to send \ndown a nominee for the Supreme Court, and that person had never served \nas a judge previously, that would be a big advantage, and you would \nargue that would be something that is very salutary, that this person \ndoes not have judicial experience. Such was the case of Chief Justice \nRehnquist, who did not have such experience. But because they were \nnominated by a Republican, it was a big advantage not to have judicial \nexperience. Now a Democrat sends a nominee down and all of a sudden not \nhaving judicial experience is a liability. That is some flexibility, as \nfar as I am concerned.\n  I met with the nominee, Ms. Kagan, and she is a great nominee. I am \nsure she is going to be confirmed easily in the Senate. I cannot \nbelieve the Judiciary Committee will have any opportunity to find very \nmuch wrong with this very credible, very high-qualified, well-qualified \nnominee. I did not come here to say that. But listening, again, as I \ndo, I keep hearing the sound of sawing on the floor of the Senate, \nsawing away in a partisan manner. I simply wanted to observe that much \nof this has very little to do with substance and has everything to do \nwith partisan politics that we hear on the floor of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5475-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5475-S5479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, today I rise on the floor of the Senate \nrecognizing that we have white roses and a black drape adorning the \ndesk of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  I had told him personally in the past that when my service is done I \nwill have considered it a great privilege to have served in this body \nat the time when Robert Byrd served in this body. He was a lot of \nthings. He was smart and tough and honest. Because he legislated and \nbecause of his career here, this is a better country, I am convinced of \nthat.\n  All of us know Senator Byrd grew old here and became someone with \nhealth problems in recent years and yet even last week would come to \nthis Chamber and cast his vote. In recent weeks I had several visits \nwith him on the floor of the Senate.\n  All of us know as well that he loved his country. He, most of all, \nloved the Senate. He wrote a two-volume book of history on this body, \nand I say to anybody listening, if they enjoy history and enjoy knowing \nanything about the wonderful history of this body, read what Senator \nByrd has written. It is extraordinary.\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\n  He loved the Constitution of the United States, and he never appeared \non the floor of the Senate without having a copy of that Constitution \nin his suit pocket. He always had a copy of the Constitution with him.\n  He was also someone who did not just love the history of the Senate \nbut loved Roman history. I recall sitting on the floor of the Senate \nmany years ago when I first came to the Senate, listening to Senator \nByrd talk about Roman history and the lessons in it for us. I recall \nhim 1 day describing Hannibal crossing the Alps, with a conclusion of \nHannibal, who had lost an eye--a one-eyed Carthaginian--on the plains, \nriding the last emaciated elephant before he was cornered, and taking a \npill from a secret container in a ring and, rather than being captured, \ntook his life.\n\n  I learned a lot listening to Senator Byrd on the floor of the Senate \nabout a lot of things, including Roman history.\n  I also learned that he had one of the extraordinary memories you have \never known. And I thought today--because we are saddened but also \nmourning the loss of a friend and someone who served this country so \nwell--I would read something he read on the floor of the Senate a \ncouple of times, but he read the preamble to it and then recited it \nfrom memory, this great story. He did it because he was talking about a \ncrime that occurred with respect to a dog, an animal. He talked a lot \nabout his dog Billy, that he loved very much, and then he told us the \nstory about a man named Vest, George G. Vest, who was to become a \nSenator later.\n  I will read what Senator Byrd said. He said:\n\n       At the turn of the century, George G. Vest delivered a \n     deeply touching summation before the jury in the trial \n     involving the killing of a dog, Old Drum. This occurred, I \n     think, in 1869. There were two brothers-in-law, both of whom \n     had fought in the Union Army. They lived in Johnson County, \n     MO. One was named Leonidas Hornsby. The other was named \n     Charles Burden.\n       Burden owned a dog, and he was named ``Old Drum.'' He was a \n     great hunting dog. Any time that dog barked one could know \n     for sure that it was on the scent of a raccoon or other \n     animal.\n       Leonidas Hornsby was a farmer who raised livestock and some \n     of his calves and lambs were being killed by animals. He, \n     therefore, swore to shoot any animal, any dog that appeared \n     on his property.\n       One day there appeared on his property a hound. Someone \n     said: ``There's a dog out there in the yard.'' Hornsby said: \n     ``Shoot him.''\n       The dog was killed. Charles Burden, the owner of the dog, \n     was not the kind of man to take something like this lightly. \n     He went to court.\n\n  This was Old Drum that was killed.\n\n       He won his case and was awarded $25. Hornsby appealed, and, \n     if I recall, on the appeal there was a reversal, whereupon \n     the owner of the dog decided to employ the best lawyer that \n     he could find in the area.\n       He employed a lawyer by the name of George Graham Vest. \n     This lawyer gave a summation to the jury.\n\n  Senator Byrd recited the summation to the jury, and he did it without \na note. It so reminded me of all the things I heard on the floor from \nSenator Byrd--yes, ``The Ambulance Down in the Valley,'' a piece of \nlengthy prose without a note, and this without a note. He recited the \nsummation to the jury by George Vest:\n\n       Gentlemen of the jury. The best friend a man has in the \n     world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or \n     daughter whom he has reared with loving care may prove \n     ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those \n     whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may \n     become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he \n     may lose. It flies away from him perhaps when he needs it \n     most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of \n     ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on \n     their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the \n     first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its \n     cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend \n     that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never \n     deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or \n     treacherous, is the dog.\n       Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in \n     prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will \n     sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow and the \n     snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master's \n     side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he \n     will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with \n     the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper \n     master as if he were a prince.\n       When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take \n     wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in \n     his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens. If \n     fortune drives the master forth an outcast into the world, \n     friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher \n     privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against \n     danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene \n     of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and \n     his body is laid in the cold ground, no matter if all other \n     friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the \n     noble dog be found, his head between his paws and his eyes \n     sad but open, in alert watchfulness, faithful and true, even \n     unto death.\n\n  Well, I read this summation to the jury in the case of Old Drum. But \nSenator Byrd recited it, as he did all of these similar circumstances, \ncompletely from memory.\n  Senator Byrd came to the floor, and he had a way with words that does \nnot so much exist in the Senate anymore. I was sitting on the floor one \nday when another Senator came to the floor and said some very \ndisparaging things about a President of the United States. They \nreferred to the President in a way that was very disparaging. Senator \nByrd did not like that, no matter who the President was. He came to the \nfloor, and I am sure the person who was disparaging the President at \nthat point never understood what had happened to him after Senator Byrd \nwas done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I remember that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But Senator Byrd came to the floor, and he stood up, and \nhe said this: I have served here long enough to see pygmyies strut like \nColossus. And he said, very like the fly in Aesop's fable, sitting on \nan axle of a chariot, ``My, what dust I do raise.''\n  And it occurred to me he had just told someone what they had done was \nunbelievably foolish. I am not sure they understood it. But he wrapped \nit in such elegant language, as he always did.\n  In addition to serving at a time early on in his career when things \nwere different, when there was perhaps less anger and less partisanship \nand committee chairmen and ranking members got together and decided \nwhat we needed to do for the country and did it together and came to \nthe floor together, he was also, on the floor of the Senate, someone \nwho knew the rules. He studied the rules because he understood that \nknowing the rules to this Chamber and how this process works was also \nimportant to be successful here.\n  Aside from that, he was a skillful legislator--very skillful. I \nwatched him walk out of this Chamber from that door and very often stop \nas a bunch of Senate pages--high school kids who serve in the Senate--\nwould gather around and then he would spend 15, 20 minutes telling them \na story about the Senate, about the history of this great place. Too \nmany of us walk back and forth around here, walking very briskly \nbecause we are late to go here or there and we are working on a lot of \nthings. Senator Byrd always took time to talk to the pages--not just \ntalk to them but tell them stories about what this great Senate has \nmeant to this great country.\n  He also loved very much his late wife Erma and talked about her a lot \nto many of us.\n  He loved to play the fiddle. Early on when I came to the Senate, if \nyou expressed even the least interest in music, he would get you down \nto his office and put a tape in his recording device to show us that he \nplayed the fiddle on the program ``Hee Haw.'' He was so proud of that. \nHe was someone who loved West Virginia, loved his country, and was a \nfriend to all of us.\n  Today is a very sad day for those of us who see a desk that was \noccupied by a great U.S. Senator for so many decades, now occupied with \na dozen roses and a black cloth, signifying that we have lost this \ngreat man. America has lost a great public servant. As one Member of \nthe Senate, I say it has been a great privilege--my great privilege--to \nserve while Senator Byrd served in this body.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I appreciate the words of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. I recall sitting here on the floor, I tell my friend \nfrom North Dakota, who may well have been here at that time when \nSenator Byrd spoke of the pygmies strutting like a colossus. We both \nknow who he meant and we both know the effect it had, and I thank him \nfor reminding us of that.\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\n  I believe all of us who served with him and knew Senator Byrd were \nsaddened by the news of his passing. No Senator came to care more about \nthe Constitution or was a more effective defender of our constitutional \ngovernment than the senior Senator from West Virginia. How many times \ndid we see him reach into his jacket pocket and hold up the \nConstitution? He would say: This is what guides me.\n  I said in the Judiciary Committee today that many of us carry the \nConstitution and we can turn to it and read from it. Senator Byrd, if \nasked, would recite it verbatim from memory from page 1 straight \nthrough.\n  Senator Byrd was a Senator's Senator. During the time before he \nstopped playing, some of us would be at an event with him where he \nwould play the fiddle. I recall one of those times when he played the \nfiddle, and now his successor as President pro tempore, Senator Inouye, \nplayed the piano, playing compositions only requiring one hand, and the \ntwo of them played in the caucus room now named after our late Senator \nTed Kennedy. I heard him play in the happy times and the enjoyable \ntimes when he would try to bring Senators of both parties together and \nact like human beings.\n  I have also sat here with him when he reminded Senators of what the \nConstitution stood for, what our role was in the Constitution, when he \nspoke against going to war in Iraq without reason and without a \ndeclaration of war. It was one of the most powerful speeches I have \nheard him give. In over 36 years of serving with him, I heard many \nspeeches.\n  Others will speak of his records for time served in the Senate and in \nCongress and the number of votes he cast. I think of him more as a \nmentor and a friend. I recall in the fall of 1974 becoming the Senator-\nelect and coming down here to talk to Senators and meeting with Senator \nByrd and Senator Mansfield, Senator Mansfield being the leader, Senator \nByrd the deputy leader. I recall one of the things he told me--both of \nthem did: Always keep your word. Robert Byrd, Robert Carlyle Byrd, if \nhe gave you his word, you could go to the bank with it, but he would \nexpect the same in return, as he should. That is something all of us \nshould be reminded of and all of us should seek to achieve.\n  I was honored to sit near him on the Senate floor. Sitting near him \nin the same room we would engage in many discussions about the Senate \nand the rules or about the issues of the moment, or about our families. \nBut now I sit here and I look at the flowers on his desk; I look at the \ndrape on that desk. Over the many years I have had the privilege of \nrepresenting the State of Vermont in this body, I have had to come on \nthe floor of the Senate to see the traditional drapery and the flowers \non either side of the aisle when we have lost dear colleagues; more \nthan that, we have lost dear friends. Party is irrelevant. The \nfriendship is what is important. It tugs at your heart and it tugs at \nyour soul to see it. Walking in here and looking down the row where I \nsit and seeing that, I don't know when I have felt the tug so strong.\n  Marcelle and I were privileged to know Bob and Erma, his wonderful \nErma. We would see them in the grocery store in Northern Virginia. Our \nwives would drive in together for Senate matters. I recall sitting with \nhim in his office 1 day when we spoke of the death of his grandson and \nhow it tore him apart to have lost him in an accident. He had his \nportrait in his office with a black drapery. We sat there--this man who \ncould be so composed--we sat and held hands while he cried about his \ngrandson. At that time I did not have the privilege of being a \ngrandfather yet. Today, I think I can more fully understand what he \nwent through. I remember the emotion and the strength of it. This was \nnot just the person whom we saw often as the leader of the Senate, the \nchairman of a major committee, ready and in control, but a human being \nmourning somebody very dear to him.\n  He was a self-educated man. He learned much throughout his life, but \nthen he had much to teach us all. It has been spoken about how he \ntalked to the pages, but he would talk to anybody about his beloved \nSenate. He did more than that. He wrote the definitive history of the \nSenate. We all learned from him. He was a symbol of West Virginia. He \nwas an accomplished legislator. He was an extraordinary American.\n  As a form of tribute I suspect Senator Byrd himself would \nappreciate--let me quote from Pericles' funeral oration from Thucydides \nHistory of the Peloponnesian War about the inherent strength of \ndemocracy. Senator Byrd was well familiar with this passage, and with \nits relevance to our Constitution and our form of government. I heard \nhim use it before. Pericles is said to have spoken this:\n\n       Our form of government does not enter into rivalry with the \n     institutions of others. Our government does not copy our \n     neighbors, but is an example to them. It is true that we are \n     called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of \n     the many and not of the few. But while there exists equal \n     justice to all and alike in their private disputes, the claim \n     of excellence is also recognized; and when a citizen is in \n     any way distinguished, he is preferred to the public service, \n     not as a matter of privilege, but as a reward of merit. \n     Neither is poverty an obstacle, but a man may benefit his \n     country whatever the obscurity of his condition.\n\n  Senator Byrd believed in this country. He believed that a youngster \nwho had been adopted, who lived in a house without running water, who \nhad to work for every single thing he obtained, could also rise to the \nhighest positions in this body, a body he loved more than any other \ninstitution in our government, save one: the Constitution. The \nConstitution was his North Star and his lone star. It was what guided \nhim.\n  Senator Byrd was such an extraordinary man of merit and grit and \ndetermination who loved his family. I recall him speaking of his \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren and he would proudly tell you \nabout each of them. I remember even after he was a widower walking by \nand leaning over and saying, How are you? He would say, I am fine. How \nis Marcelle? And Senators from both sides of the aisle would come just \nto talk with him.\n  He drew strength from his deep faith. He took to heart his oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. The arc of \nhis career in public service is an inspiration to us all, and it will \ninspire Americans of generations to come.\n  So, Robert, I say goodbye to you, my dear friend. I am not going to \nforget your friendship. I am not going to forget how you mentored me. \nBut, especially, I will not forget, and I will always cherish even \nafter I leave this body, your love of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd, you are one of a kind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Members of the Senate are coming to the \nfloor today from both sides of the aisle to acknowledge a moment in our \nhistory: the passing of Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. Senator Byrd \nwas the longest serving Senator in the history of the United States of \nAmerica; a man who cast more than 18,000 votes; a man who served as \nmajority leader, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as \nPresident pro tempore. He was, in fact, the Senate. He embodied the \nSenate in his life. It was his life.\n  Each of us, before we can become a Senator, takes a walk down this \naisle and goes over to the side here where the Vice President of the \nUnited States swears us in. You put your hand on a Bible and you take \nan oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. You \nhave to say that or you can't be a Senator. For many people, it is a \nformality. For Robert C. Byrd, it was a commitment, a life commitment \nto a document, the Constitution of the United States. He used to carry \none in his pocket every day of his life. That is the kind of commitment \nmost people will not make because they think: Well, maybe I will change \nmy mind. For Robert C. Byrd, there was no changing his mind. He was \ncommitted to that Constitution.\n\n  For him, it was the North Star, it was the guiding light, it was the \ndocument that created this Nation, and he had sworn on his Bible to \nuphold and defend it, and he meant it. That is why he was so \nextraordinary.\n  He understood this Constitution because he understood what our \ngovernment is about. He made a point of saying whenever a new President \nwould come in, even a President of his own party: I will work with the \nPresident but as a Senator; I do not work for the President. We are \nequal to the President because we are an equal branch of\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\ngovernment. I will be glad to work with the President, but I have a \nresponsibility as a Senator.\n  I remember so well in what I consider to be the finest hour I \nwitnessed when it came to Robert C. Byrd. It was in October of 2002. It \nwas a little over a year after 9/11. President George W. Bush was \nasking this Senate to vote for a resolution to invade Iraq. At the \ntime, the pressure was building. Public sentiment was strongly in \nfavor. Remember, there was talk about weapons of mass destruction, \nnuclear weapons, attacks on our allies and friends, even on the United \nStates if we did not move, and move quickly. There was a prevailing \ngrowing sentiment to go to war.\n  But the Senator from West Virginia stood up, took out his \nConstitution, and said: This is a mistake. We should not be going to \nwar.\n  He proceeded day after day, week after week, and month after month to \nstand there at that desk and lead the charge against the invasion of \nIraq. It was an amazing display of his talent, which was prodigious, \nand his commitment to this Constitution as he saw it, and the fact that \nhe was politically fearless.\n  I agreed with him on that issue. I was inspired by him on that issue. \nI can recall when my wife and I went to a Mass in Old St. Patrick's \nChurch in Chicago, we were in the pew kneeling after communion. The \nchurch was quiet as people were returning from communion. An older \nfellow, whom I did not know, stood next to me in the aisle and looked \ndown at me and said in a voice that could be heard across the church: \nStick with Bob Byrd.\n  I came back and told him that story, and he just howled with \nlaughter. I said: Senator Byrd, your reach is beyond West Virginia and \nbeyond the Senate. It is in Chicago and across the country. What you \nare saying is resonating with a lot of people.\n  In the end, 23 people voted against that war--1 Republican and 22 \nDemocrats. For a while, we were not popular. Over time I think that \nvote became more respected. Robert C. Byrd was our leader, and he used \nthis Constitution as his inspiration.\n  He had such a sense of history. My favorite story related to about 16 \nor 18 years ago. I was a Member of the House of Representatives then on \nthe Appropriations Committee, and Robert C. Byrd was the chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. He was a powerful man. We were \nsupposed to meet downstairs in a conference committee, House and \nSenate, the conferees from both Appropriations Committees, on a \ntransportation bill.\n  To no one's surprise and without any apology, Senator Byrd had quite \na few West Virginia projects in that bill. Congressman Frank Wolf of \nVirginia, a Republican, sat on the committee on the House side. When he \nlooked at the West Virginia projects, he got upset. He said it publicly \nin the Washington Post and other places that he had thought Senator \nByrd had gone too far.\n  That was a pretty bold move by Congressman Wolf to make those \nstatements in the minority about the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. I could not wait for that conference \ncommittee because the two of them would literally be in the same room. \nIn fact, it turned out to be even better. They were not even in the \nsame room, but Senator Byrd's staff had reserved a chair directly \nacross the table from Congressman Wolf.\n  The place was packed, waiting for this confrontation. Senator Byrd \ncame in last and sat down very quietly in his chair and waited his \nturn. Congressman Wolf at some point asked for recognition and went \nafter the Byrd West Virginia projects. Frank is a passionate man. I \nserved with him and agreed with him on many issues and disagreed on \nothers. I respected him. He was passionate and committed and made it \nclear he thought this was unfair and unjust.\n  Senator Byrd, in his three-piece suit, sat across from him with hands \non the table showing no emotion until after 15, 20 minutes, Congressman \nWolf was exhausted by his protests about these Byrd projects, at which \npoint Senator Byrd leaned over and said to whomever was presiding at \nthat moment: May I speak? And they said: Of course.\n  Then he said--and I am going to paraphrase this. I think it is pretty \nclose to what he said. There was no video camera there. I wish there \nhad been. He said: In 1830, in January of 1830, January 19, 1830, \nwhich, if my memory serves me, was a Thursday, Daniel Webster and Mr. \nHayne engaged in one of the most famous debates in American history. \nAnd off he went.\n  For the next 15 minutes, without a note, Robert C. Byrd tried to \nexplain a very basic principle, and it was this: The Senate is created \nto give every State the same number of Senators--two Senators. The \nHouse is elected by popular vote. A small State such as West Virginia \ndoes not have much of a chance in the House of Representatives. It is \nsmall in a body of 435 Members. But in the Senate, every State, large \nand small--Virginia and West Virginia, Illinois, New York, California--\neach has two Senators.\n  The point Senator Byrd was making was: If I do not put the projects \nin in the Senate, we will never get them in in the House. That is what \nthe Great Compromise, the Constitution, and the Senate and the House \nare all about.\n  It was a masterful presentation, which led to a compromise, one might \nexpect, at the end of the day in which Senator Byrd did quite well for \nhis State of West Virginia.\n  Years passed, and I was elected to this body. I came here and I saw \nSenator Byrd sitting in that seat one day, and I said: I want to tell \nyou the most famous debate I can ever remember--there was not a camera \nin the room, and I do not think anyone recorded it--I recalled his \ndebate with Frank Wolf.\n  I said: What I remember particularly is when you said: January 19, \n1830, which was a Thursday, if I recall.\n  He said: Yes, I think it was a Thursday.\n  I said: I don't doubt it was a Thursday, but that little detail was \namazing.\n  He kind of smiled. He did not say anything more. About an hour passed \nbefore the next rollcall, and he called me over to that desk. He had \nbrought out a perpetual calendar and found January 19, 1830, and said: \nMr. Durbin, it was a Thursday.\n  I said: I didn't dispute it, Senator.\n  It was an example in my mind of a man who understood this \nConstitution, understood his use of that Constitution for his State--\nsome would say he overused it, but he was fighting for his State every \nday he was here--his command of history and his command of the moment.\n  That was Robert C. Byrd. They do not make them like that anymore. \nThere just are not many people in our generation who can even claim to \nbe in that position.\n  I recall it and I remember very well another conversation I had with \nhim. You see, history will show that in his early life, Robert C. Byrd \nwas a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Many of his detractors and enemies \nwould bring that up. He would be very open about it, not deny it but \nsay that he had changed, and his votes reflected it.\n  I once said to him: Of all these thousands and thousands of votes you \nhave cast, are there any you would like to do over?\n  Oh, yes, he said. Three. There was one for an Eisenhower \nadministration appointee which I voted against, and I wish I voted for \nhim. I think that was a mistake. And, he said, I was wrong on the civil \nrights legislation. I voted the wrong way in the 1960s. And, he said, I \nmade a mistake and voted for the deregulation of the airline industry \nwhich cut off airline service to my State of West Virginia. Those were \nthree.\n\n  If you have been in public life or even if you have been on this \nEarth a while, I think you have learned the value of redemption. Robert \nC. Byrd, in his early life, made a mistake with his membership in the \nKu Klux Klan. He was open about it, and he demonstrated in his life \nthat he was wrong and would do better in the future. That is \nredemption--political redemption--and, in my mind, it was total \nhonesty.\n  There were so many other facets to this man too. Senator Leahy talked \nabout him playing the fiddle. That is the first time I ever saw him in \nperson. He came to Springfield, IL, in 1976, when he was aspiring to \nrun for President of the United States. He stood out from the rest of \nthe crowd because he got up and said a few words about why he wanted to \nbe President. Then he reached in and grabbed his fiddle and started \nplaying it.\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\n  I tell you, it brought the house down. I don't remember who else was \nthere. I think Jimmy Carter was there. But I do remember that Bob Byrd \nwas there.\n  When I came to the Senate, I thought: I cannot wait to see or hear \nhim play that fiddle again. I learned that after his grandson died in \nan automobile accident, he said: I will never touch it again, in memory \nof my grandson. That is the kind of family commitment he made as well. \nHe would sing and occasionally have a Christmas party downstairs, and a \nfew of us would be lucky enough to get invited. He would sing. He was a \nman who had gone through some life experiences and family experiences \nthat were very meaningful to him.\n  I remember another day when I was on the floor of the Senate and \nthere was a debate about the future of the National Endowment for the \nArts. Senator Ashcroft of Missouri wanted to eliminate the National \nEndowment for the Arts and take away all its money. I stood up to \ndebate him. I was brandnew here, not smart enough to know when to sit \ndown and shut up. I started debating: I thought it was wrong, the arts \nare important, so forth.\n  Through the door comes Bob Byrd. He walks in here and asks if he \ncould be recognized. Everything stopped when he had asked for \nrecognition. They said: Of course.\n  He said: I want to tell you what music meant to me. I was an orphan, \nand I was raised in a loving family. Early in life, they went out and \nbought me a fiddle. Music has always been a big, important part of my \nlife. Out of nowhere, this man gives this beautiful speech, and then he \nquotes poetry during the course of the speech.\n  As one can tell, all of us who served with him are great fans of \nRobert C. Byrd and what he meant to this Senate and what he meant to \nthis Nation. West Virginia has lost a great servant who was so proud of \nhis home State. Time and again that was always the bottom line for him: \nIs this going to be good for the future of my little State of West \nVirginia? He fought for them and put them on the map in some regards \nand some projects. He was respected by his colleagues because of the \ncommitment to the people who honored him by allowing him to serve in \nthe Senate.\n  There may be a debate as to whether there is a heaven. If there is a \nheaven and they have a table for the greats in the Senate, I would ask \nDaniel Webster to pull up a chair for Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, very shortly, we are going to be voting \non a judicial nomination. I come before this body to bring my thoughts \non that action.\n  As a lawyer, as a former attorney general for the State of Illinois, \nI consider it a great privilege to evaluate and confirm nominees to the \nbench. The constitutional power of advise and consent is one this \nSenate must exercise with discretion. It determines the makeup of our \njudicial branch and helps preserve the principle of equal justice under \nlaw.\n  That is why I have come to the floor today in support of Gary Scott \nFeinerman, President Obama's nominee to become a judge for the Northern \nDistrict Court of Illinois.\n  Gary is an Illinois native and a graduate of both Yale and Stanford \nUniversities. Over the past two decades, he has worked extensively in \nprivate practice--most recently for Sidley Austin, the respected \nChicago law firm. He has served in the public sector, as well as a \nclerk to the U.S. Supreme Court and counsel at the Department of \nJustice.\n  From 2003 to 2007, he was Solicitor General of the State of Illinois. \nThat is the person who argues the cases on behalf of the attorney \ngeneral before the highest court, whether in Illinois or in the Nation. \nHe held that position with distinction, proving his commitment to the \nhighest ideals of fairness and justice.\n  Time and again over the years, Gary Feinerman has demonstrated his \ncompetence in the legal profession. His training is without equal. His \nexperience is second to none. That is why I am proud to support his \nnomination to the Northern District Court of the State of Illinois.\n  We must demand the very best of our public officials, especially \nthose who are entrusted with lifetime appointments on the Federal \nbench.\n  These fine men and women are charged with interpreting a body of law \nthat is constantly evolving. They must navigate a treacherous \nlandscape, full of gray areas, to arrive at sound legal truth. The \nanswers are seldom easy, but I have confidence in Gary Feinerman's \nability to rise to this challenge. At every stage, he has proven his \nconsiderable intellect and his passion for the law. I am proud to join \nthe President in calling for his swift confirmation. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in pledging to afford the nominee with a fair and \ntimely vote to confirm him to the bench.\n  This body has a crowded legislative calendar in the months ahead, but \ncases have piled up in the Northern District of Illinois, and every \nsingle day more judicial nominees await as vacancies remain unfilled. \nEven as we consider Mr. Feinerman's confirmation today, another \nIllinois nominee, Judge Sharon Johnson-Coleman, awaits a similar up-or-\ndown vote. We need to rise to our constitutional duty and vote on these \nnominees. We must waste no more time in allowing this fine public \nservant to get to work.\n  Let's put our judges to work. Let's confirm Mr. Feinerman now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMontana for allowing me to make some brief remarks, and then I will \nturn to him.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Burris, in asking my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to vote in just a few moments on the nomination of \nGary Feinerman to be U.S. district court judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois.\n  Gary Feinerman is one of the brightest lights in the Chicago legal \ncommunity. He is a partner at one of Chicago's oldest and largest law \nfirms, Sidley Austin, where he specializes in litigation and appellate \nwork. Before that, he served as Illinois' solicitor general and \nrepresented our State in many very valuable and important appeals. He \nwon five ``Best Brief'' awards from the National Association of \nAttorneys General, and he has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, as well as \nthe Illinois Supreme Court. Earlier in his career, Mr. Feinerman worked \nat the Chicago law firm of Mayer Brown and in the Justice Department's \nOffice of Policy Development. He served as law clerk for Supreme Court \nJustice Anthony Kennedy and for Seventh Circuit Judge Joel Flaum. He is \na leader in the Chicago legal community. He is the president of the \nAppellate Lawyers Association of our State and serves on Chicago's \nConstitutional Rights Foundation and the Midwest chapter of the Anti-\nDefamation League. He has also had a very active pro bono practice, \nwhich speaks well of his commitment as a professional.\n  Mr. Feinerman's academic record is also impressive. He graduated from \nYale and Stanford Law School, where he finished second in his class. \nNot surprisingly, he received the highest possible rating of ``well-\nqualified'' from the American Bar Association for this commitment.\n  We currently have six--six--vacancies in the Northern District of \nIllinois. We need to fill them quickly so that we don't slow down the \nprocess of justice. I hope the Senate will confirm Gary Feinerman today \nand move very quickly to Justice Sharon Coleman, who is also on the \ncalendar. Mr. Feinerman will be an excellent judge, and Judge Coleman \nwill join him, with the blessing of the Senate, to start to fill these \nimportant vacancies.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and again thank my colleague from \nMontana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5480-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING SENATOR\n                             ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I have a short speech to give today \nabout a giant of a man. I rise today out of deep respect for our \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd. Sharla and I extend our condolences \nto the Byrd family and to all the people of West Virginia. We join you \nin mourning but also in a celebration of his life and his successes as \na public servant.\n  Senator Byrd liked to call me ``the Mountain Man,'' and when somebody \nfrom the Mountain State calls you that, it is an incredible compliment.\n  Senator Byrd and I had a few things in common: We were both from very \nsmall towns, we both married our high school sweethearts, and we both \nmade a living at one time as meat cutters. He must have had an eye for \nthe butchering business because he liked to guess my weight. And \nwouldn't you know, he always came within 3 pounds. You could say \nSenator Byrd convinced me to spend a little more time in the gym.\n  Senator Byrd was elected to Congress 4 years before I was even born, \nand he always shared his wisdom with those of us who admired it. I am \nhonored to call Senator Byrd a respected teacher and a trusted friend.\n  I was Presiding Officer on the day the farm bill came before the \nSenate. Instead of signing the farm bill himself, Senator Byrd let me \nsign the bill. Although it went unspoken, I know it was because he saw \nme as the farmer in the Senate. It was truly an honor for me to be able \nto do that.\n  Another thing Senator Byrd and I had in common was our upbringing in \nrural America. He was always proud to fight for folks making a living \noff the land and in the mountains and in the woods. He was a powerful \nadvocate, and he represented West Virginia with tireless passion. He \nvalued hard work and common sense. Those values are a matter of \nsurvival in America. They are values you take with you as you go to \nCongress, and Senator Byrd showed us that.\n  Madam President, we will miss Senator Byrd very much. His work over \nthe decades on the Hill has made the entire country a better place for \nus and for our kids and grandkids.\n  Before I came to Capitol Hill 3\\1/2\\ years ago, many folks came up to \nme and said: You are going to have an experience of a lifetime. You \nwill meet some incredible people.\n  And I will tell you that one of the most incredible men I have met \nsince I have been here was Senator Byrd.\n  We miss you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5480-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Boxer are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate is proceeding on only \none of the 23 judicial nominees stalled by Republican obstruction from \naction by the Senate. The nominee the Senate will confirm tonight has \nbeen stalled for more than 10 weeks, even though his nomination was \nreported without a single objection from the Judiciary Committee on \nApril 15. There are eight other judicial nominees who have been stalled \nfor at least as long, or longer, and nominees who were favorably \nreported last year, last November, still being obstructed.\n  This confirmation was needlessly delayed for no good purpose. The \nservices of this judge are sorely needed in the Northern District of \nIllinois. I congratulate Mr. Feinerman and his family on his \nconfirmation today.\n  The Senate Republican leadership refuses to enter into time \nagreements on pending judicial nominations. That stalling and \nobstruction is unprecedented. They refuse to enter into a time \nagreement to consider the North Carolina nominees to the Fourth \nCircuit, who were reported in January, despite the fact that one was \nreported unanimously and one with only a single negative vote. They \nrefuse to enter into a time agreement to debate and vote on the Sixth \nCircuit nominee from Tennessee who was reported last November. I have \ntold Senator Alexander that all Democrats are prepared to vote on that \nnomination, and have agreed to do so since November. It is his own \nleadership that continues to obstruct the nominee.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. A useful comparison is that in \n2002, the second year of the Bush administration, the Democratic Senate \nmajority's hard work led to the confirmation of 72 Federal circuit and \ndistrict judges nominated by a President from the other party. In this \nsecond year of the Obama administration, we have confirmed just 22 so \nfar--72 to 22.\n  In the first 2 years of the Bush administration, we confirmed 100 \nFederal circuit and district court judges. So far in the first 2 years \nof the Obama administration, the Republican leadership has successfully \nobstructed all but 34 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees--100 to 34. We confirmed twice that many in just 2002. \nMeanwhile Federal judicial vacancies around the country hover around \n100.\n  By this date in President Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed \n57 of his judicial nominees. Despite the fact that President Obama \nbegan sending us judicial nominations two months earlier than did \nPresident Bush, the Senate has to date only confirmed 34 of his Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees--57 to 34.\n  Last year, Senate Republicans refused to move forward on judicial \nnominees. The Senate confirmed the fewest judges in 50 years. The \nSenate Republican leadership allowed only 12 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees to be considered and confirmed despite the \navailability of many more for final action. They have continued their \nobstruction throughout this year. By every measure, the Republican \nobstruction is a disaster for the Federal courts and for the American \npeople.\n  To put this into historical perspective, consider this: In 1982, the \nsecond year of the Reagan administration, the Senate confirmed 47 \njudges. In 1990, the second year of the George H.W. Bush \nadministration, the Senate confirmed 55 judges. In 1994, the second \nyear of the Clinton administration, the Senate confirmed 99 judges. In \n2002, the second year of the George W. Bush administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 72 judges. The only year comparable to this year's record-\nsetting low total of 16 was 1996, when the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider President Clinton's judicial nominees and only 17 \nwere confirmed all session.\n  Senate Democrats moved forward with judicial nominees whether the \nPresident was Democratic, 1994, or Republican, 1982, 1990, 2002, and \nwhether\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nthey were in the Senate majority, 1990, 1994, 2002, or in the Senate \nminority, 1982. Senate Republicans, by contrast, have shown an \nunwillingness to consider judicial nominees of Democratic Presidents, \n1996, 2009, 2010.\n  Over the last recess, I sent a letter to Senator McConnell and to the \nmajority leader concerning these matters. In that letter, I urged, as I \nhave since last December, the Senate to schedule votes on these \nnominations without further obstruction or delay. I called on the \nRepublican leadership to work with the majority leader to schedule \nimmediate votes on consensus nominations--many, like that finally being \nconsidered today, I expect will be confirmed unanimously--and consent \nto time agreements on those on which debate is requested. As I said in \nthe letter, if there are judicial nominations that Republicans truly \nwish to filibuster--after arguing during the Bush administration that \nsuch action would be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should so \nindicate to allow the majority leader to seek cloture to end the \nfilibuster. It is outrageous that the majority leader will be forced to \nfile cloture petitions to get votes on the North Carolina, Tennessee \nand other nominees.\n  After this confirmation, there will still be 22 judicial nominees \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee being stalled from Senate \nconsideration by the Republican leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Under the previous order, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nGary Scott Feinerman, of Illinois, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nNorthern District of Illinois?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator Robert \nC. Byrd, my mentor, supporter, and good friend.\n  Senator Byrd was the dean of the Senate, our foremost constitutional \nscholar. No one in the history of our country served longer in \nCongress.\n  For more than a half century, Robert C. Byrd kept the Senate in line. \nHe always kept a copy of the Constitution in his jacket pocket, close \nto his heart. He was meticulous, a master of the rules of this historic \ninstitution. Through hard work and dedication, Senator Byrd became an \ninstitution himself.\n  When I joined the Senate 20 years ago, to my great fortune, Senator \nByrd took me under his wing. He guided me through procedural rules and \ntaught me how to preside over the floor. I still have the notes he gave \nme when I was a freshman Senator. He was adamant that the Presiding \nOfficer should always be respectful of the speakers, while maintaining \nstrict adherence to the rules of the Senate.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd was a patriot who cared for and loved this \ncountry, the United States of America. He worked hard for the people of \nWest Virginia, who showed their support for him election after \nelection.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd was a spiritual man. Each week a number of \nSenators got together for a morning prayer breakfast. Senator Byrd was \na regular participant when he was well. His favorite hymn was ``Old \nRugged Cross.'' I enjoyed singing it with him many times.\n  We shared a love for music and the arts. His fiddle playing was \nlegendary.\n  He loved his family. He loved his children and grandchildren. He \nloved his dogs. Closest always was his wife Erma who was always by his \nside until her death in 2006. They spent many wonderful years together, \nand now they are together again.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Byrd family.\n  Senator Byrd, we love you and we miss you.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5481-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5481-S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       USE OF IEDS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise tonight to speak about the war in \nAfghanistan, but on a particular subject. In particular, I wish to \nspeak about the terribly destructive force of improvised explosive \ndevices. These improvised explosive devices, known by the acronym IEDs, \nrepresent the single greatest threat to the United States and coalition \nforces in Afghanistan. The impact of this deadly tool of war has been \nfelt in my home State of Pennsylvania, and I know so many of our \ncolleagues have had not only loved ones in some cases but constituents \nwho have lost their lives because of IEDs. In Pennsylvania, we have \nlost marines, soldiers, and National Guard troops to this insidious \nthreat.\n  In the first 4 months of 2010, incidents of IEDs in Afghanistan \nincreased 94 percent over a comparable period in the previous year \naccording to the United Nations.\n  In 2009, more than 6,000 IEDs were discovered, the vast majority of \nwhich\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nused ammonium nitrate as their main explosive ingredient. This is the \nNo. 1 killer of United States and coalition forces. In 2009 alone, 275 \nAmerican troops were killed by IEDs. In addition to the lethality of \nIEDs, they have a tremendously demoralizing effect on our troops. Just \nthe threat of IEDs forces troops to move at a slower pace and take away \ntheir focus from the mission at hand.\n  Ammonium nitrate bombs, often crude wood and graphite pressure-plate \ndevices buried in dirt lanes or heaps of trash, are very difficult to \ndetect.\n  Americans remember, unfortunately, the deadly power of ammonium \nnitrate from its use by Timothy McVeigh in the 1995 Oklahoma City \nbombing which killed 168 Americans. It can be used, as we know, as a \nfertilizer as well as an explosive in the mining and construction \nindustry. Its use in the United States is tightly restricted. President \nKarzai of Afghanistan has rightly recognized the threat and has banned \nits use as a fertilizer. Afghan troops and police, supported by ISAF \nforces, have begun a concerted effort to crack down on its \nproliferation, distribution, and sale. On Wednesday, ISAF reported that \n11 tons of ammonium nitrate were seized by Afghan forces supported by \nNATO troops. These 11 tons would have been enough to build more than \n500 IEDs--IEDs that could have been used to kill NATO forces, Afghan \ntroops, and civilians.\n  The Afghan Government appears committed to this fight and has enacted \nthe appropriate legal measures and enforcement efforts. But ammonium \nnitrate is still ubiquitous in Afghanistan due to smuggling along \nsupply routes from its neighbors, particularly along Pakistan's tribal \nbelt where smuggling is a way of life. The Los Angeles Times newspaper \nreported last month that as much as 85 tons of ammonium nitrate is \nsmuggled into Afghanistan from Pakistan in a single night, a shipment \nthat could yield more than 2,500 bombs. Even as we heard recently that \n11 tons were intercepted, this published report says that 85 tons can \nbe smuggled in a single night.\n  Along with seven of my colleagues--Senators Levin, Reed, Snowe, Webb, \nKyl, McCaskill, and Kaufman--I have submitted a resolution calling for \ncontinued support for and increased efforts and focus by the \nGovernments of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the central Asian countries \nin that region to effectively monitor and regulate the manufacture, \nsale, transport, and use of ammonium nitrate fertilizer in order to \nprevent criminal groups, insurgents, and terrorist organizations from \ntransporting ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan where it is used in \nthese improvised explosive devices.\n  I am committed to highlighting this threat and supporting United \nStates and international efforts to crack down on the proliferation of \nprecursor chemicals such as ammonium nitrate. The Joint Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Organization--JIEDDO--which includes coalition \npartners from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, has led an \nimpressive effort to combat IEDs at every step in the process. The U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Agency will soon commence Project \nGlobal Shield, which is an unprecedented multilateral law enforcement \noperation aimed at countering the illicit diversion and trafficking of \nprecursor chemicals, such as ammonium nitrate.\n  Pakistan has made efforts to contend with ammonium nitrate in large \npart because the threat has begun to impact the security of its country \nas well. Recent coordination between Pakistani civilian and military \nentities on the IED issue has been positive. The Government of Pakistan \nhas formed an interagency national coalition IED forum. We are also \nbeginning to see efforts at the local level, such as small-scale bans \nand regulations in the community of Malakand. I hope Pakistan \nexpeditiously approves its draft legislation to better control \nexplosive materials in the country and make a concerted effort at \nenforcement.\n  We must exercise extraordinary vigilance in stemming the unregulated \nflow of ammonium nitrate in this region because of its importance to \nU.S. national security interests, as well as, of course, to the lives \nof our troops.\n  The United States, together with our allies, must do everything we \ncan to make it more difficult for our enemies to make IEDs. I am \ncommitted to this task for the long term. I also understand terrorists \nwill resort to different strategies and different ingredients after we \nare better able to restrict the flow of ammonium nitrate. Implementing \nmore robust and interdiction measures is important, but we also must do \nmore to disrupt and dismantle terrorist and criminal organizations in \nmaking IEDs. This will involve multilateral engagement, regulatory \nmeasures, training, and technological efforts, building border control \ncapacity, and other means as well.\n  There are a host of other ingredients terrorists can and probably \nwill utilize in IEDs. But ammonium nitrate is what they are using today \nto kill scores of U.S. troops. We must do all that is in our power to \nensure the job of making these bombs is made more difficult. When they \nshift tactics and use other ingredients, we will go after those too. \nRestricting the flow of ammonium nitrate is, in fact, a very difficult \nchallenge. But we must do all we can to protect our troops on the \nground across the world, but especially our troops in Afghanistan. \nThere is no more important task at hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5482-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5482-S5483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words in remembrance \nof Senator Byrd. I will offer a longer statement for the Record, but I \nwish to give a few thoughts now.\n  We do mourn his passing. We see at his desk today a reminder of his \npassing. To say that Robert Byrd was a towering figure in the history \nof the Senate does not begin to describe his impact, his influence and, \nindeed, the memory he leaves behind, the legacy he leaves behind for \nthose of us in the Senate, for his home State of West Virginia, and I \nknow for millions of Americans.\n  He was a strong advocate for not just his point of view but, more \nimportantly, for the people of West Virginia. He arrived in the Senate \nin 1958--before I was born. I was pleased to have the opportunity and \nhonor, the chance to serve with him a couple of years.\n  He was a strong advocate. He was also a remarkable orator. Even in \nthe last couple years of his life when some thought he might have been \nslowing down a little, when he got the microphone, he could deliver a \nspeech like no other. He was a tremendous orator who believed in what \nhe was saying, believed in the traditions of the Senate but mostly, and \nmost importantly, believed in fighting for the working men and women \nand the families of West Virginia.\n  We also knew him as a scholar--a scholar of not just this \ninstitution, maybe the leading scholar of all time when it comes to the \ninstitution of the Senate, but also as well as a constitutional \nscholar.\n  His was a life of commitment, of real fidelity, first and foremost I \nbelieve to his family. He spoke often of his wife Erma. In the portrait \nthat is just outside the door, there are three items in his area of \ncontrol in the picture. He has his hand on the Bible, the Scriptures, \nhe has a copy of the Constitution, and a picture of his beloved wife \nErma, about whom he spoke so often.\n  He was committed and had a life of commitment to his family and his \nfaith. But he was also committed to the people of West Virginia for so \nmany years, so many battles on their behalf and especially the families \nof West Virginia.\n  Of course, he also led a life of commitment and fidelity to the \nConstitution and knew it better than anyone I have ever met and \ncertainly better than some of our more renowned constitutional \nscholars.\n  Of course, we know of his commitment to this institution, to the \nSenate. He loved this institution and wrote volume after volume about \nthe Senate. We know that the multivolume work he did, the one volume in \nand of itself--hundreds of pages on the history of the Senate--is a \ncompilation of speeches he gave on the floor of the Senate, some of \nthem written out, but some of them he could give by memory.\n  We know of his capacity to extemporaneously talk about so many \ntopics, whether it was history or poetry or Scripture or the history of \nthe Senate.\n  We will miss his scholarship, we will miss his service, and we will \nmiss his\n\n[[Page S5483]]\n\nfidelity to his country and to his home State. I, along with others \nhere, am honored to have served with him in this body. For me it was \n3\\1/2\\ years. To be in his presence, to listen to him, to learn from \nhim is a great gift. We mourn his passing. I do not think any of us \nwill believe there will ever be a Senator quite like him in the 50 \nyears he served in this body, in addition to serving the people of West \nVirginia in the House of Representatives, as well as in the legislature \nin West Virginia.\n  We say farewell and God bless and Godspeed to Robert Byrd and his \nmemory. We are praying for and thinking this day and I know many future \ndays about his legacy and his family.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to Joe Frank \nNeikirk and the business success he has helped build. Mr. Neikirk is \nthe president and general manager of Paul's Discount in Somerset, KY. \nPaul's Discount has become a local institution in the region, and this \nmonth celebrated its 50th anniversary of operations.\n  The land that Paul's Discount now sits upon was purchased by Joe's \nancestor, Franklin Neikirk, and his spouse for 500 cords of wood in \n1856. Joe's parents, Paul E. and Frances R. Neikirk, opened the first \ndiscount store in south-central Kentucky on that land 104 years later \nin the early spring of 1960.\n  Founder Paul Neikirk passed away in 1974. Today Joe runs the store \nwith his wife Jamie. The original store occupied only about 1,800 \nsquare feet and had three employees. Today, Paul's Discount boasts more \nthan 20,000 square feet of selling space, plus three warehouses.\n  They offer sporting goods, hardware, automotive goods, clothing and \ncrafts. Joe's glad he's still in the same original location, saying, \n``You can't duplicate the atmosphere of this building.'' Judging by the \ncrowd that turned out for the 50th anniversary, he must certainly be \nright.\n  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an excellent article \nabout Paul's Discount, the Neikirk family's legacy and the 50th \nanniversary celebration that I would like to share with my colleagues. \nI ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Somerset Commonwealth Journal, June 13, 2010]\n\n     50 Years of Service--``Unique'' Paul's Discount--A Pulaski Gem\n\n                   (By Tricia Neal, CJ Staff Writer)\n\n       Paul's Discount has always had a steady stream of \n     customers, but yesterday, the customers came in droves--\n     packing the parking lot and spilling out onto Ky. 2227 to \n     help president and general manager Joe Frank Neikirk and his \n     employees celebrate 50 years in business. Paul's Discount, \n     opened in 1960 by Joe's parents, Paul and Frances Neikirk, is \n     described by Joe as a ``unique'' store--offering sporting \n     goods, hardware, automotive goods, clothing, and crafts.\n       What started as an Army surplus store with three employees \n     has evolved into a sprawling, multi-department retail store \n     with 30 employees, all of whom Joe says help make Paul's what \n     it is. ``God has blessed us with good employees at every \n     level, from department managers to cashiers,'' he said.\n       Some of Paul's Discount's employees have worked in the \n     store for nearly 30 years. Joe himself worked in his parents' \n     store while he was in high school and college--and even \n     earlier, he recalled, passing out baby chickens to customers \n     at Easter.\n       ``Customer service is the big thing about Paul's,'' Joe \n     said. ``You actually get somebody to ask you if you need \n     help.'' That kind of friendly service is what brings \n     customers from Pulaski and surrounding counties--and even, \n     Joe says, from northern Kentucky, southern Ohio, and from \n     other points east and west.\n       Paul Neikirk opened Paul's Surplus on his ancestors' land \n     north of Somerset in 1960. In the beginning, the shop--the \n     first discount store in south central Kentucky--occupied only \n     about 1,800 square feet of space. Paul passed away in late \n     1974. At that time, his brother, Lyle Neikirk, took over \n     management of the business. Lyle retired about 14 years \n     later, leaving the shop in the hands of Paul's sons, Joe and \n     Randy Neikirk.\n       Joe continues to manage the store, which now offers more \n     than 20,000 square feet of selling space plus three \n     warehouses, but he says his job has been made easy by those \n     who surround him. ``Today, my wife, Jamie, and I run the \n     store. She does human resources, the employees do most \n     everything else, and I handle whatever is left,'' he said.\n       ``Our employees are almost self-sufficient.'' While the \n     merchandise available at Paul's is constantly changing, Joe \n     hopes the store's quality customer service and its atmosphere \n     will keep customers loyal.\n       ``We could never open another Paul's,'' Joe said. ``You \n     can't duplicate the atmosphere of this building.'' Joe adds \n     that his employees help create the atmosphere there.\n       While many things have remained the same at Paul's \n     throughout the years, the current management is making sure \n     the business keeps current. Paul Neikirk never would have \n     imagined that his little shop would eventually be accessible \n     to millions on the Internet. Now, the business can be found \n     at www.paulsdiscount.com and on Facebook. ``That's part of it \n     nowadays,'' Joe said. But he still believes customers \n     appreciate a good, old fashioned brick and mortar shopping \n     experience.\n       ``People still like to come to a store and look at what \n     they're buying,'' he said. Paul's Discount is located on Ky. \n     2227, just north of SomerSplash water park. Ky. 2227 is part \n     of the former North U.S. 27, and was once the most highly \n     traveled road in the county. The store is now a little more \n     out-of-the-way than it once was, but Joe says the change in \n     traffic patterns hasn't hurt his business.\n       ``Many local people were lost for a while,'' Joe recalled. \n     ``We were really dead for a couple of weeks. But people find \n     their way. . . . It was an incredible risk (to stay in the \n     same location). I thought it would affect us a lot more than \n     it has.'' Store hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Mondays through \n     Saturdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5483-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5483-S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this morning, the Supreme Court concluded \nits work for the term and, accordingly, it was Justice John Paul \nStevens' last day on the Court. This afternoon, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee began the hearing on the nomination of Elena Kagan to succeed \nJustice Stevens on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Solicitor General Kagan appropriately included a tribute to Justice \nStevens in her opening remarks. The Nation is indebted to Justice \nStevens for his decades of service to this country, from his days as a \nNavy intelligence officer during World War II for which he was awarded \na Bronze Star, to his contributions as a circuit judge, to his 35 years \non our highest Court and his leadership there.\n  When I visited with Justice Stevens earlier this year he shared with \nme the note President Ford had written a year before his death in which \nthe President said: ``I am prepared to allow history's judgment of my \nterm in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination 30 \nyears ago of John Paul Stevens to the U.S. Supreme Court.'' President \nFord was justifiably proud of his nomination. Despite those on the far \nright who have ranted against Justice Stevens' refusal to be bound by \nnarrow, conservative ideology and who have criticized his good \njudgment--just as they have Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice \nDavid Souter--his was principled jurisprudence founded on adherence to \nthe rule of law and\n\n[[Page S5484]]\n\nan appreciation for the effects of decisions.\n  His was the first Supreme Court nomination on which I have been \nprivileged to vote. I have never regretted supporting his confirmation. \nJust as I reached across the political aisle to vote for Justice \nStevens, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter, who were nominated by \nRepublican Presidents, I have urged Senate Republicans to fairly \nconsider President Obama's nominations.\n  Justice Stevens has written important decisions upholding the power \nof Congress to pass legislation to protect hard-working Americans. He \nbrought to his opinions a keen understanding of the distinct roles set \nforth in our Constitution for courts and for our democratically elected \nCongress, and a respect for both. In Gonzales v. Raich and in Tennessee \nv. Lane, Justice Stevens authored the Supreme Court's opinions \nupholding Congress' actions. I suspect these precedents will be even \nmore important as the Supreme Court continues to examine laws passed by \nCongress to protect Americans from discriminatory health insurance \npolicies and fraudulent Wall Street practices.\n  A decade ago, the Supreme Court overreached and unnecessarily waded \ninto the political thicket to award the presidency in a close election \nto George W. Bush. In his dissent, Justice Stevens lamented that the \ndecision would damage the Court's reputation and it did. He noted: \n``Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of \nthe winner of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the \nloser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as \nan impartial guardian of the rule of law.''\n  While the public's memory of that partisan decision was receding, it \ncame rushing back when the Supreme Court issued another election-\nrelated decision in the Citizens United case. In Citizens United, five \nconservative, activist Justices overturned a century of law to empower \ncorporations to overwhelm and distort the democratic process by using \ncorporate funds to influence elections. Those five Justices substituted \ntheir own preferences for the judgment of Congress that had built on \ndecades of legal development to pass bipartisan campaign finance reform \nlegislation. In order to reach its divisive decision granting \ncorporations, banks, and insurance companies new rights to the \ndetriment of the voices of individual Americans, the Court overstepped \nthe proper judicial role, and rejected not just the conclusions of the \nelected branches, but also its own recent precedent upholding the very \nlaw it chose to overturn. In one of his most powerful dissents, Justice \nStevens noted that: ``[The] Court's ruling threatens to undermine the \nintegrity of elected institutions across the nation. The path it has \ntaken to reach its outcome will, I fear, do damage to this \ninstitution.'' He was right, again.\n  I share Justice Stevens' concern for the Court's reputation. Two of \nthe three branches of government are involved in campaigns and \nelections. When the American people see the third branch reaching out \nto influence those elections--as they did most recently in Arizona--\nthey rightly get suspicious of its impartiality. I hope that Elena \nKagan will show the judgment and forthrightness of Justice Stevens and \nshare our concern about the public's confidence in our judicial system. \nBased on her Oxford thesis almost 20 years ago, before she had even \nattended law school, I expect that she will. I hope that she will honor \nJustice Stevens' extraordinary legacy and that of the Justice for whom \nshe clerked, Justice Thurgood Marshall, by so doing.\n  The country needs and deserves a Supreme Court that bases its \ndecisions on the law and the Constitution, not politics or an \nideological agenda. A recent pattern of Supreme Court decisions has \nemerged by a conservative, activist majority. These opinions have \ntwisted both the Constitution and the law to favor big corporations \nover the interests of hard-working Americans.\n  The most recent example of this conservative activism came just last \nweek in a case called Rent-a-Center v. Jackson when they distorted \ntheir own precedent the clear congressional intent in passing the \nFederal Arbitration Act, FAA. Congress did not intend the FAA to apply \nto employment cases and certainly did not intend involuntary and \nunconscionable provisions requiring binding mandatory arbitration to \noverride civil rights protections against racial discrimination and \nretaliation, as was allowed in that case. The five Justices distorted \nthe law to forbid almost all court challenges to arbitration. In doing \nso, the court stripped quintessential civil rights protections that \nCongress has passed over the last several decades for hundreds of \nthousands of Americans who work under mandatory arbitration agreements. \nIt is artifice and activism to the detriment of hard-working Americans \nwho deserve their day in court.\n  The law is not a game. The law is intended to serve the people--\nprotecting the freedom of individuals from the tyranny of government or \nthe mob, and helping to organize our society for the good of all. No \nJustice should substitute his or her personal preferences and overrule \ncongressional efforts passed into law to protect hard-working Americans \npursuant to our constitutional role. Judges must approach every case \nwith an open mind and a commitment to fairness and the rule of law. I \nwas encouraged to hear Solicitor General Kagan voice similar views in \nher eloquent opening statement today. I hope Americans took the \nopportunity to see and hear from the nominee herself. If they did, I \nsuspect that they will be supportive.\n  Tomorrow each Senator on the Judiciary Committee, whether Republican \nand Democrat, will have 30 minutes to question her. I urge Senators to \nlisten to Solicitor General Kagan's responses and to approach the \nhearing with the same openmindedness and impartiality that we expect \nfrom Supreme Court Justices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5484-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Private First Class Barry Daniel Smith\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

He enlisted in the Army in \nOctober of 2009 and completed basic training and Multiple Launch Rocket \nSystem training before joining the 2nd Battalion, 20th Field Artillery, \nMLRS, 41st Fires Brigade. The American people will forever be grateful \nto Private First Class Smith for his willingness to serve.\n  A longtime New Hampshire resident, Barry was a graduate of Littleton \nHigh School and Hesser College in Manchester, where he earned a degree \nin criminal justice. He was a lover of the great outdoors, of hunting \nand camping with family and friends. With his friendly nature and \nwonderful laugh, Barry made friends easily and had many.\n  Private Smith exemplified the best in America's long tradition of \nservice to this country. He was extremely proud to serve in the U.S. \nArmy. Our Nation can never adequately thank Private Smith for his \nwillingness to make the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of the \nAmerican people, nor can words diminish the pain of losing this young \nsoldier. It is now up to us to honor his memory by supporting our \nveterans and their families and ensuring America's continued security.\n  Private Barry Smith is survived by his parents Dan and Shelly Smith \nof Auburn, ME, and Linda and Jonathan Larrivee of Littleton, NH. He is \nalso survived by numerous siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles and \ncousins. This young patriot will be dearly missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nof Army PFC Barry Daniel Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5484-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5484-S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX EXTENDERS BILL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I was surprised to see the Senate \nmajority leader on Friday morning, in some of the harshest possible \nlanguage, make the misleading assertion that Senate Republicans oppose \nthe underlying policy in the tax extenders bill. His statement \nconveniently ignored the basic reason nearly every Republican for \nopposing the Democratic leadership's substitute. It was opposed to \nbecause it perpetuated the large deficit spending that has become the \nmodus operandi of the Democratic leadership.\n  The way to a bipartisan agreement is to follow the path set 1 week \nago\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\ntoday. Just 1 week ago, the Senate passed a bill that extended the so-\ncalled Medicare doc fix for several months.\n  The bill was fully offset. It was paid for. It did not add to the \ndeficit. Every Republican Senator supported that fiscally responsible \napproach. I would like to make a couple of points on the process \nemployed by the Democratic leadership. The majority leader's comments \nthis morning are typical of the dysfunctional way that these routine \nextenders have been unnecessarily delayed by the strategy and tactics \nof the Democratic leadership.\n  What I find surprising is that we took up a package, the fourth in \nthe latest series, that, like previous exercises, absolutely belongs to \nthe Senate Democratic leadership. That is to say they continued to \nrefuse to take up a bipartisan package that I put together with Finance \nCommittee Chairman Baucus. To be sure, some of the structure reflected \nthe agreement my friend, the chairman and I reached.\n  I was under the impression that the Senate Democratic leadership was \ngenuine in its desire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was \nmistaken. Although the Senate Democratic leadership was highly involved \nin the development of a bipartisan bill, they arbitrarily decided to \nreplace it with a bill that skews toward their liberal wing.\n  My second comment goes to the way in which these expiring tax \nprovisions have been described by many on the other side, including \nthose in the Democratic leadership. If you rolled the videotape back a \nfew months or so ago, you would hear a lot of disparaging comments \nabout these routine, bipartisan extenders. From my perspective, those \ncomments were made in an effort to sully the bipartisan agreement \nreached by Chairman Baucus and me.\n  If you take a look at newspaper accounts of that period, you'd come \naway with the impression that the tax extenders are partisan pork for \nRepublicans. A representative sample comes from one report, which \ndescribes the bipartisan bill as ``an extension of soon-to-expire tax \nbreaks that are highly beneficial to major corporations, known as tax \nextenders, as well as other corporate giveaways that had been designed \nto win GOP support.'' The Washington Post included this attribution to \nthe Senate Democratic leadership in an article at that time: ``We're \npretty close,'' [the majority leader] said Friday during a television \nappearance in Nevada, adding that he thought ``fat cats'' would have \nbenefitted too much from the larger Baucus-Grassley bill.''\n  The portrait that was painted by certain members of the majority in \nsome press reports was inaccurate.\n  For one thing the tax extenders include provisions such as the \ndeduction for qualified tuition and related expenses and also the \ndeduction for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school \nteachers. If you are going to school or if you are a grade school \nteacher, the Senate Democratic leadership apparently viewed you as a \nfat cat. If your house was destroyed in a recent natural disaster and \nyou still need any of the temporary disaster relief provisions \ncontained in the extenders package, too bad, because helping you would \namount to a corporate giveaway in the eyes of some.\n  The tax extenders have been routinely passed repeatedly because they \nare bipartisan and very popular. Democrats have consistently voted in \nfavor of extending these tax provisions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \nreleased a very strong statement upon House passage of tax extenders in \nDecember of 2009, saying this was ``good for businesses, good for \nhomeowners, and good for our communities.'' December of 2009 was not \nvery long ago. In 2006, the then-Democratic leader released a \nblistering statement ``after Bush Republicans in the Senate blocked \npassage of critical tax extenders'' because ``American families and \nbusinesses are paying the price because this Do Nothing Republican \nCongress refuses to extend important tax breaks.''\n  Recent bipartisan votes in the Senate on extending expiring tax \nprovisions have come in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent and the Working Families Tax Relief Act of \n2004, which originally passed the Senate by voice vote, although the \nconference report only received 92 votes in favor and a whopping 3 \nagainst. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, \nextension of several of these provisions go back even further, \nincluding the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, which again passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent, but lost 1 vote on the conference report.\n  One Member on the other side said ``Our side isn't sure that the \nRepublicans are real interested in developing good policy and to move \nforward together. Instead, they are more inclined to play rope-a-dope \nagain, My own view is, let's test them.'' Another Member of this large \n59-vote majority exclaimed, ``It looks more like a tax bill than a jobs \nbill to me. What the Democratic Caucus is going to put on the floor is \nsomething that's more focused on job creation than on tax breaks.''\n  Reading those comments I found myself scratching my head. The only \nexplanation for this behavior is that certain senators decided last \nweek that it serves a deeply partisan goal to slander what have been \nfor several years bipartisan and popular tax provisions benefitting \nmany different people. The Washington Post article I quoted from \nearlier includes a statement from a Senate Democratic leadership aide \nsaying that ``No decisions have been made, but anyone expecting us \nimmediately to go back to a bill that includes tax extenders will be \nsorely disappointed.''\n  You can imagine, that today, after considering these comments, I am \nreally scratching my head. We have before us the expiring tax and \nhealth provisions that were disparaged just a short time ago. Have they \nmorphed from corporate tax pork? Have they suddenly re-acquired their \nbipartisan character? Are these time-sensitive items, now expired for \nmore than 2 months, suddenly jobs-related?\n  Madam President, I also want to correct the record regarding a \nstatement made last Thursday night by the senior Senator from Illinois. \nHe said that the international tax increases that the Democrats have \ncalled for in the extenders bill would stop companies from sending jobs \noverseas. If only these international tax increases would do that, I \nwould be at the front of the line, doing what I could to pass them. \nBut, unfortunately, that is not what they would do. I would like to \nbriefly describe why, if anything, these international tax increases \nwould actually tend to hurt the job market here at home in America.\n  Quite to the contrary of the complaint by the senior Senator from \nIllinois, these international tax increases may make American \nbusinesses less competitive in the global marketplace. Increased taxes \nincrease the cost of doing business. Those tax increases are targeted \nonly at U.S. companies on their business abroad. They are not aimed at \nforeign companies with which the U.S. companies are competing side-by-\nside. Guess what. The cost must be absorbed by the U.S. company. The \ncost of these tax increases may make it less likely that American \nbusinesses will hire. Instead German, or Indian, or Chinese companies \nwill out-compete and thus be hiring more. If the U.S. taxes the foreign \nsubsidiaries of U.S. parent companies at ever higher rates, the result \nwon't be jobs kept here at home.\n  No, the result will instead be that the U.S. will become a less and \nless attractive place to have a parent company, to have a global \nheadquarters. This will result in less, not more, but less jobs here in \nAmerica.\n  But that is certainly not my only objection. Not only could these \ninternational tax increases result in less American jobs, but these \nproposed tax increases have not had adequate vetting. In some cases, \nthe proposed tax increases would actually be retroactive. These tax \nincreases would be permanent tax increases, meant to pay for temporary \ntax reductions--a strange miss-match. If these international tax \nincreases really are loophole closers, then it is squandering them to \nuse them for such temporary provisions, rather than to use them to pay \nfor corporate tax reform.\n  Finally, the business community--that is, the hiring sector--has \nreacted quite negatively to this bill, even though the bill also \ncontains the tax extenders that the business community wants.\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\n  Those are the reasons that I oppose these tax increases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5486-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SAFER AIR ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today to speak \nabout an important piece of legislation that I introduced last week \nwith my friend Senator Klobuchar. The SAFER AIR Act is going to bring \nour commercial air travel security checkpoints into the 21st century. \nThreats to our Nation's air travelers have advanced and magnetometers \nare simply not enough in this post-9/11 world. Our legislation would \nsupport and expand TSA's current efforts to adopt and deploy advanced \ntechnologies, like the advanced imaging technology, and explosive trace \ndetection at an accelerated pace to ensure such equipment is the \nprimary screening method in every commercial airport.\n  The December 25 terror attempt on NW flight 253 was a frightening \nwake-up call that could have been prevented. It represents a failure in \nthe mechanisms of our national security. This failed plot highlights \nour need to look at areas that can increase our security in the \nnational airport system immediately. Important security improvements \nhave been made in intelligence handling, but I am convinced more needs \nto be done. Airport security improvements are a needed and overdue part \nof the equation.\n  I have been watching our domestic airport security closely in the \npast year. My airport in Salt Lake City, UT, is a testing site for \nadvanced imaging technology. I have seen this machine in use, and been \nimpressed with what represents a true advancement in the technology of \nsafer skies. TSA needs to utilize equipment that is currently available \nto identify plastic and liquid explosives as well as move forward with \nthe development and testing of new technologies to fight emerging \nthreats.\n  Our bill will require TSA to install technology with the capability \nof detecting plastic explosives, liquid explosives and other \nnonmetallic threats and explosives. These devices have been tested and \navailable since 2007. The delay in deployment has gone on long enough. \nThe SAFER AIR Act will require this technology in all commercial \nairports by 2013 and will encourage the further development of these \ntechnologies as threats continue to advance.\n  An important provision in our legislation is the privacy protections \nit will establish for our traveling public. I applaud TSA for the \nprotections it has already put in place. Our language will codify those \nprotections and ensure the new technologies will also be used in a \nmanner that doesn't violate the personal privacy of commercial flyers \nin the United States.\n  New and emerging technologies have a great ability to detect \nnontraditional threats. I am eager to see these capabilities improved \nthrough further innovation and testing. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting the SAFER AIR Act and do all we can to better protect the \ntraveling public from existing and emerging threats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5486-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ARKANSAS NEWS-EDITORIAL CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

On a cold January day in 1982, Lenny was \nreturning home from work when he witnessed Air Florida flight 90 crash \ninto the Potomac River. Risking his own life, Lenny jumped into the icy \nwaters and saved one of the passengers from drowning. His selfless and \nheroic act was widely acclaimed at the time. President Reagan honored \nLenny in his State of the Union Address, singling him out in the House \ngallery. This acknowledgement began the tradition of Presidents, in \ntheir State of the Union Addresses, recognizing people who have done \nextraordinary things. The President's gallery in the House is now often \nreferred to as ``the Heroes' Gallery,'' thanks to Lenny.\n  Lenny received many awards and honors for his actions on that day. \nBut he never sought out the limelight or asked for special treatment. \nHe remained a humble and hardworking public servant. Lenny insists he \n``wasn't a hero,'' and that he ``was just someone who helped another \nhuman being.'' But we know a hero when we see one. We can't thank Lenny \nenough for his long, faithful service to CBO and the American people. I \nwish him a long, happy, and well-deserved retirement.\n Mr. GREGG. Madam President, today I would like to recognize \nand thank a dedicated civil servant, Martin Leonard Skutnik. Lenny, as \nhe is known, recently retired after working for 30 years for the \nCongressional Budget Office. He started at CBO in 1980 handling the \nmail and messenger duties--before the advent of the internet, email, \nand blackberries--and later worked to help print and produce CBO \nreports and provide IT support. Lenny worked behind the scenes, \ntirelessly for three decades, to help provide Congress with the \ninformation it needed. Lenny was a model civil servant, and for that he \ndeserves our respect and praise.\n  Lenny was also a model citizen, and whether he thought so or not, a \nhero. In January 1982, Lenny witnessed a horrible event when an Air \nFlorida plane crashed into the Potomac River near the 14th Street \nbridge. Without so much as a thought about his own safety, Lenny jumped \ninto the river, which was full of chunks of floating ice, and saved the \nlife of one of the crash victims. He was honored later that month by \nPresident Reagan during his State of the Union Address, and this began \nthe inspirational tradition of Presidents honoring ordinary people who \nhave done extraordinary things.\n  Through it all, Lenny shied away from the spotlight and continued to \nreport to work, putting 100 percent effort into his work each day. He \nworked hard, remained humble, and never sought to exploit his fame. His \ncharacter exemplifies the best of the American spirit, and for that he \ndeserves our admiration. I wish to thank Lenny for his hard work and \nfor his heroism--may he enjoy a healthy and well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5486-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5486-S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to\n\n[[Page S5487]]\n\nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5487-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CAPS EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding 0fficer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5487-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on today, June 28, 2010, by the President pro tempore \n(Mr. Inouye):\n\n       H.R. 2194.

A bill to prohibit royalty incentives for deepwater \ndrilling, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDeepwater Drilling Royalty Prohibition Act.\n  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not \nused to incentivize the dangerous and often dirty business of offshore \ndrilling in deep waters.\n  Over the past decades, Congress has established a number of royalty-\nrelief programs to encourage domestic exploration and production in \ndeep waters. This may have made sense in times when oil prices were too \nlow to provide energy companies with an incentive to drill in difficult \nplaces, and before we were ready to deploy large-scale renewable energy \nproduction.\n  But that is no longer the case. The events of the last weeks have \nshown that safety and response technologies are not sufficient in deep \nwaters. I believe taxpayer-funded incentives should go to clean, \nrenewable energy, not deepwater drilling for oil.\n  The disastrous impacts of the leak from the Deepwater Horizon have \nshown that offshore drilling has enormous environmental and safety \nrisks--particularly in deep waters. Eleven people died and 17 others \nwere injured when the Deepwater Horizon caught fire. All these weeks \nlater, we continue to watch in horror as the scope of the disaster \nkeeps expanding:\n  Oil slicks spread inexorably across the Gulf of Mexico;\n  Pelicans and other wildlife struggle to free themselves from crude \noil; tar balls spoil the pristine white sand beaches of Florida; \nWetlands are coated with toxic sludge; More than 1/3 of Federal waters \nin the Gulf have been closed to fishing; The plumes of oil under water \nmay create zones of toxicity or low oxygen for aquatic life; The oil \nmay spread into the Atlantic Ocean via the Loop Current; The response \ntechniques, such as the use of dispersants, may have their own toxic \nconsequences; and\n  Upcoming storms may delay or prevent continued containment and \nresponse efforts.\n  The impacts of an oil spill are so dramatic and devastating, it seems \nclear to me that regulation, oversight and prevention technologies \nshould be rigorous. But that is clearly not the case.\n  Regulators failed to ensure appropriate safety and response \ntechnologies were in place.\n  MMS gave BP a categorical exclusion from an environmental impact \nanalysis that in my opinion should never have been allowed.\n  MMS allowed BP to run a drilling operation without the demonstrated \nability to shut off the flow of gas and oil in an emergency.\n  MMS allowed BP to operate without remote shutoff capability in case \nthe drilling rig became disabled.\n  MMS did not have an inspector on the rig to settle the heated \nargument between the BP, Transocean, and Halliburton officials on how \nthey would stop drilling and plug the well.\n  MMS did not have--and did not require the industry to have--emergency \nequipment stationed in the Gulf of Mexico that could respond \nimmediately to an emergency.\n  MMS did not have a plan for responding to disasters.\n  MMS did not, in fact, have a real inspection and compliance program. \nIt relied on the expertise and advice of the industry on how and how \nmuch they should be inspected.\n  This is not how things should be done. We expect more from our \ngovernment.\n  Prevention and response technologies show similar unacceptable \ndeficits: they are not good enough.\n  These have not improved much since the oil spill in 1969 off the \nCalifornia coast near Santa Barbara. That too was caused by a natural \ngas blowout when pressure in the drill hole fluctuated. It was \nsuccessfully plugged with mud and cement after 11 and a half days, but \noil and gas continued to seep for months. The Santa Barbara spill was \ndevastating, but it was a tiny fraction of the size of the Deepwater \nHorizon spill.\n  The old technology was not good enough, but now it appears that even \nthe newest safety technology fails to prevent wellhead blowouts.\n  The Deepwater Horizon drill rig was just completed in 2001.\n  The drill rig that caused the 2009 spill in the Montara oil and gas \nfield in the Timor Sea--one of the worst in Australia's history--was \ndesigned and built in 2007. That spill continued unchecked for 74 days.\n  The New York Times reports that the blind shear rams in the blowout \npreventers--the last line of defense to prevent wellhead leaks are \n``surprisingly vulnerable'' to failure. One study found that blowout \npreventers have a failure rate of 45 percent.\n  These technologies are insufficient, and they are particularly \nvulnerable in deep waters.\n  Methane hydrate crystals form when methane gas mixes with pressurized \ncold ocean waters--and the likelihood of these crystals forming \nincreases dramatically at about 400 meters depth. These crystals \ninterfere with response and containment technologies. They formed in \nthe cofferdam dome that was lowered onto the gushing oil in the Gulf, \nand prevented it from working. When a remotely operated underwater \nvehicle bumped the valves in the ``top hat'' device, the containment \ncap had to be removed and slowly replaced to prevent formation of these \ncrystals again.\n  Other risks increase too, as explained by the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Drilling in deeper water doesn't change the fundamental \n     process, but it makes virtually everything harder. Rigs must \n     be bigger so they can hold more drilling pipe to stretch vast \n     distances. The pipes themselves must be stronger to withstand \n     ocean currents. Equipment on the sea floor must be sturdier \n     to face extreme pressures at depth. Drill bits must be \n     tougher so they don't melt in the 400-degree temperatures \n     they encounter deep in the earth. And it is harder for \n     drillers to exert just the right amount of pressure down the \n     well bore, enough to keep oil and gas from spurting upwards--\n     a blowout--but not so much that they crack open the rocks \n     beneath the surface, which could also lead to a blowout.\n\n  It is clear that prevention, containment, and clean-up measures are \nnot sufficient to handle oil leaks, particularly in deep waters.\n  American taxpayers should not forego revenue to incentivize offshore \ndrilling. It is not good environmental policy, and it is not good \nenergy policy either.\n  We need to move to clearer renewable fuels.\n  I believe that global warming is the biggest environmental crisis we \nface--and the biggest culprit of global warming is manmade emissions \nproduced by the combustion of fossil fuels, like oil and coal.\n  Taxpayer funded incentives should not finance production of fossil \nfuels--particularly in places where the production itself poses \npotential devastation, but rather should be used to develop and deploy \nclean energy technologies like wind and solar. I very much believe \nthis.\n  That is why I have worked with my colleagues on a number of \nlegislative initiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \nincrease energy efficiency and incentivize the use of renewable energy.\n  One of our biggest victories was the enactment of the aggressive fuel \neconomy law, called the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, which was passed \nby Congress and signed into law by then-President Bush in the 110th \nCongress. This law, which I authored with Senator Snowe, will improve \nfuel economy\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\nstandards for passenger vehicles at the maximum feasible rate. The good \nnews is that the administration has taken the framework of this law and \nimplemented aggressive standards that require raising fleetwide fuel \neconomy to 35.5 mpg in 2016--a 40 percent increase above today's \nstandard.\n  The other positive development is that the domestic renewable energy \nindustry has grown dramatically over the last few years. Last year, the \nUnited States added more new capacity to produce renewable electricity \nthan it did to produce electricity from natural gas, or oil, or coal. A \ngreat deal of this growth can be attributed to government renewable \nenergy incentives. That is where public investment in energy \ndevelopment should go.\n  It is clear that the clean energy sector is the next frontier in jobs \ncreation.\n  We need to ensure that developers can access financing to launch \nwind, solar and geothermal projects, so that they can put people to \nwork. Programs like The Recovery Act grant program run by the Treasury \nDepartment have been very successful in encouraging private investment \nin this sector. So far, the program has helped to bring 4,250 megawatts \nof clean power online and is expected to generate more than 143,000 \ngreen jobs by the end of the year, according to the Lawrence Berkeley \nNational Laboratory. The program, however, is set to expire at the end \nof year if we don't act. So, I'm working on legislation that will \nextend this successful program for an additional 2 years.\n  All told, these types of measures are helping to foster the \nincentives that will push the United States to adopt a cleaner energy \nfuture, and to move away from fossil fuels.\n  Let me make one final point clear, I don't believe the oil companies \nneed taxpayer dollars to help them out. They are already reaping record \nprofits.\n  Last year, the top 10 U.S. oil companies' combined revenues were \nalmost $850 billion. Yet we continue to use money that should come to \nthe U.S. Treasury, to add to their bottom line. This is unacceptable.\n  Oil reserves are a public resource. When a private company profits \nfrom those public resources, American taxpayers should benefit too.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure that \nroyalties owed to the taxpayers are not waived to incentivize risky \noff-shore drilling.

Res. 571\n\n       Whereas Congress previously expressed its concern for \n     missing Israeli soldiers in the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     locate and secure the return of Zachary Baumel, a United \n     States citizen, and other soldiers missing in action'', \n     approved November 8, 1999 (Public Law 106-89; 113 Stat. \n     1305), which required the Secretary of State to raise the \n     status of missing Israeli soldiers with appropriate \n     government officials of Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian \n     Authority, and other governments in the region, and to submit \n     to Congress reports on those efforts and any subsequent \n     discovery of relevant information;\n       Whereas the House of Representatives passed H.

Res. 548, as \namended, with its preamble, as amended, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 548\n\n       Whereas the State of Israel, since its founding in 1948, \n     has been a strong and steadfast ally of the United States, \n     standing alone in its commitment to democracy, individual \n     liberty, and free-market principles in the Middle East, a \n     region characterized by instability and violence;\n       Whereas the special bond between the United States and \n     Israel, forged through common values and mutual interests, \n     must never be broken;\n       Whereas Israel has an undeniable right to defend itself \n     against any threat to its security, as does every nation;\n       Whereas Hamas is a terrorist group, formally designated as \n     a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Secretary of State, \n     and similarly designated by the European Union;\n       Whereas Hamas is committed to the annihilation of Israel \n     and opposes the peaceful resolution of the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict;\n       Whereas Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 \n     through violent means and has maintained control ever since;\n       Whereas Hamas routinely violates the human rights of the \n     residents of Gaza, including attempting to control and \n     intimidate political rivals through extra-judicial killing, \n     torture, severe beatings, maiming, and arbitrary detentions;\n       Whereas Hamas continues to hold prisoner Israeli Staff \n     Sergeant Gilad Shalit, who was seized on Israeli soil and has \n     been denied basic rights, including contact with the \n     International Red Cross;\n       Whereas the military build-up of Hamas has been enabled by \n     the smuggling of arms and other materiel into Gaza;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has materially aided and \n     supported Hamas by providing extensive funding, weapons, and \n     training;\n       Whereas since 2001, Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist \n     organizations have fired more than 10,000 rockets and mortars \n     from Gaza into Israel, killing at least 18 Israelis and \n     wounding dozens more;\n       Whereas approximately 860,000 Israeli civilians, more than \n     12 percent of Israel's population, reside within range of \n     rockets fired from Gaza and live in fear of attacks;\n       Whereas in 2007, the Government of Israel, out of concern \n     for the safety of its citizens, put in place a legitimate and \n     justified blockade of Gaza, which has been effective in \n     reducing the flow of weapons into Gaza and the firing of \n     rockets from Gaza into southern Israel;\n       Whereas according to Michael Oren, the Israeli Ambassador \n     to the United States, ``If the sea lanes are open to Hamas in \n     Gaza . . . they will acquire thousands of rockets that will \n     threaten every single citizen in the state of Israel and also \n     kill the peace process. . . . Hamas armed with thousands of \n     rockets not only threatens 7,500,000 Israelis but it's the \n     end of the peace process.'';\n       Whereas the Israeli blockade has not hindered the transfer \n     of approximately 1,000,000 tons of humanitarian supplies into \n     Gaza over the last 18 months to aid its 1,500,000 residents;\n       Whereas, on May 28, 2010, the ``Free Gaza'' flotilla, which \n     included the Mavi Marmara and 5 other ships, departed from a \n     port in Turkey and sailed towards Israel's defensive naval \n     blockade of Gaza;\n       Whereas the sponsor of the flotilla was a Turkish \n     organization, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation;\n       Whereas the Humanitarian Relief Foundation has aided al \n     Qaeda in the past, ``basically helping al Qaeda when [Osama] \n     bin Laden started to want to target U.S. soil,'' according to \n     statements by a former French counterterrorism official, in a \n     June 2, 2010, Associated Press interview;\n       Whereas the Humanitarian Relief Foundation has a clear link \n     to Hamas, according to a 2008 order of the Government of \n     Israel, and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation is a member of \n     the Union for Good, a United States-designated terrorist \n     organization created by Hamas leaders in 2000 to help fund \n     Hamas;\n       Whereas there were at least 5 active terrorist operatives \n     among the passengers on the Mavi Marmara, with affiliations \n     with terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Hamas, according \n     to the Israel Defense Forces;\n       Whereas the flotilla's primary aim was to break the Israeli \n     blockade of Gaza, under the guise of delivering humanitarian \n     aid to the residents of Gaza;\n       Whereas, on May 27, 2010, while the flotilla was moving \n     towards Gaza, one of its organizers admitted, ``This mission \n     is not about delivering humanitarian supplies, it's about \n     breaking Israel's siege on 1,500,000 Palestinians,'' \n     according to news reports;\n       Whereas based on interviews with Mavi Marmara passengers \n     after the incident, the actual intention of passengers on the \n     Mavi Marmara had been to achieve ``martyrdom'' at the hands \n     of the Israel Defense Forces;\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\n       Whereas Saleh Al-Azraq, a journalist who was aboard the \n     ship, recounted that, ``The moment the ship set sail, the \n     cries of `Allahu Akbar' began . . . It made you feel as if \n     you were going on an Islamic conquest or raid,'' according to \n     an interview recorded on Al-Hiwar TV on June 4, 2010;\n       Whereas Hussein Orush, a Humanitarian Relief Foundation \n     official, read from the diary of a dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger: ``The last lines he wrote before the attack were: \n     `Only a short time left before martyrdom. This is the most \n     important stage of my life. Nothing is more beautiful than \n     martyrdom, except for one's love for one's mother. But I \n     don't know what is sweeter--my mother or martyrdom.' '', and \n     also stated, ``All the passengers on board the ship were \n     ready for this outcome. Everybody wanted and was ready to \n     become a martyr. . . . Our goal was to reach Gaza or to die \n     trying. All the ship's passengers were ready for this. IHH \n     was ready for this too.'', according to an interview recorded \n     on Al-Jazeera TV on June 5, 2010;\n       Whereas Ali Haider Banjinin, another dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger, told his family before departing on the flotilla, \n     ``I am going to be a martyr, I dreamed about it,'' according \n     to news reports in Turkey;\n       Whereas Ali Ekber Yaratilmis, another dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger, ``always wanted to become a Martyr,'' one of his \n     friends told Al-Hayat Al-Jadida newspaper in an interview on \n     June 3, 2010;\n       Whereas one female passenger on the deck of the Mavi \n     Marmara stated, ``Right now we face one of two happy endings: \n     either martyrdom or reaching Gaza,'' according to Al Jazeera \n     footage taken prior to the incident;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel had extended a reasonable \n     offer to transfer the flotilla's humanitarian cargo to Gaza;\n       Whereas the Mavi Marmara and the other ships of the \n     flotilla ignored repeated Israeli calls to turn around or be \n     peacefully escorted to an Israeli port outside of Gaza;\n       Whereas, on May 31, 2010, the Israeli Navy intercepted the \n     Mavi Marmara 75 miles west of Haifa, Israel, in an effort to \n     maintain the integrity of the blockade and prevent potential \n     smuggling of arms and other materiel into the hands of Hamas;\n       Whereas upon the boarding of the Mavi Marmara by the \n     Israeli Navy, the Mavi Marmara's passengers brutally and \n     violently attacked the members of the Israeli Navy with \n     knives, clubs, pipes, and other weapons, injuring several of \n     them;\n       Whereas the members of the Israeli Navy, under attack and \n     in grave danger, reacted in self-defense and used lethal \n     force against their attackers on the Mavi Marmara, shooting \n     and killing 9 of them;\n       Whereas the incident has fomented unwarranted international \n     criticism of Israel and its blockade of Gaza;\n       Whereas in the time since the attack, the United Nations \n     has unjustly criticized the actions of the Government of \n     Israel and called for an investigation of such actions; and\n       Whereas the actions of the United Nations are undermining \n     Israel's inherent right to self-defense, compromising its \n     sovereignty, and helping to legitimize Hamas: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that Israel has an inherent and undeniable right to \n     defend itself against any threat to the safety of its \n     citizens;\n       (2) to reaffirm that the United States stands with Israel \n     in pursuit of shared security goals, including the security \n     of Israel;\n       (3) to condemn the violent attack and provocation by \n     extremists aboard the Mavi Marmara, who created a highly \n     destabilizing incident in a region that cannot afford further \n     instability;\n       (4) to condemn any future such attempts to break the \n     Israeli blockade of Gaza for the purpose of creating or \n     provoking violent confrontation or otherwise undermining the \n     security of Israel;\n       (5) to condemn Hamas for its failure to recognize the right \n     of Israel to exist, its human rights abuses against the \n     residents of Gaza, and its continued rejection of a \n     constructive path to peace for the Israeli and Palestinian \n     people;\n       (6) to condemn the Government of Iran for its role, past \n     and present, in directly supporting Hamas and undermining the \n     security of Israel;\n       (7) to encourage the Government of Turkey to recognize the \n     importance of continued strong relations with Israel and the \n     necessity of closely scrutinizing organizations with \n     potential ties to terrorist groups.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/28/senate-section/article/S5496-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PREDISASTER HAZARD MITIGATION ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Madam President, over the last few days, we have \nwatched President Obama's Cabinet Members and leaders of the G20 \nnations in Toronto for an economic summit.\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\nOur trade relationship with China has been one of the most important \namong many issues the world's leaders have addressed.\n  We know Ohio's workers and manufacturers can compete with anyone in \nthe world, but China's currency manipulation imposes an enormous and an \nunfair competitive disadvantage to our workers and our manufacturers.\n  While last week's announcement that China will allow a gradual \nappreciation of the value of the yuan is encouraging, we have all too \noften seen China revert to its old tricks when the spotlight fades. In \nfact, China made its announcement on a Saturday--a minimalist \nannouncement at that--and the next day backpedaled even on that \nannouncement.\n  China's systemic intervention in the currency market, where they \ncontinue to buy Western currency, has led to the undervaluation of the \nyuan by up to 40 percent--some economists say even more than that. That \nmeans China has a distinct advantage for its exporters and puts our \nexporters at a distinct disadvantage when they try to get into the \nChinese market. That is why we asked the Commerce Department to make \nthe important decision to investigate China's currency manipulation on \nbehalf of paper manufacturers in Ohio and several other States. These \ncompanies and their workers in West Carlton, OH, and in Miamisburg, OH, \nare holding on for their lives, and, like manufacturers and workers \naround the United States, they understand why our trade law's \nenforcement and remedies are so vital. They know firsthand why our \ntrade laws must combat currency manipulation.\n  If we fail to act, China's currency manipulation will continue to \ncontribute to our country's staggering trade deficit with China. Our \ntrade deficit with China in the last 3 years, particularly prior to our \nterrible financial situation, approached $1 billion a day. That means \nwe bought from China $1 billion more than we sold to them, day-in and \nday-out, 365 days a year.\n  Senators Graham, Schumer, Stabenow, and I are calling for a vote on \nour legislation that addresses this blatant currency manipulation to \nensure that we take action on Chinese imports until the yuan rises to \nits fair market value.\n  It is clear that our manufacturers are backed into a corner. It is \nalso clear that it did not have to be this way. Ten years ago this \nsummer, Congress passed permanent normal trade relations with China as \nour Nation entered the 21st century facing great economic opportunities \nand confronting gathering national security threats. You remember 10 \nyears ago we had a balanced budget, until the Bush years with tax cuts \nfor the rich, the giveaway for the drug and insurance companies in the \nname of Medicare privatization, and two wars, all of which were charged \nto our grandchildren, none of which were paid for. We had an economic \nsituation where we were beginning to lose manufacturing jobs.\n  I remember those days, serving in the House, and recall that every \nMember of Congress--literally probably every single Member of \nCongress--was told, even those of us who were outspokenly against this \nPNTR with China--we were told repeatedly in newspaper ads and \neditorials, told in hundreds of individual visits by CEOs of Americas \nlargest companies--they walked into our office and said: We want access \nto 1.2 billion Chinese consumers. Really, they didn't; they wanted \naccess to 1.2 billion Chinese workers.\n  Free-trade advocates in Washington and Wall Street and nearly every \neditorial board lauded the economic opportunities yet to come from U.S. \nworkers and businesses. These pundits, these CEOs, these Ivy League \neconomists, these newspaper editors heralded passage of PNTR with China \nas the best way to promote reform and stability in China and the \nregion. None hesitated for a minute calling those of us who opposed the \nPNTR protectionists, saying that we have our heads in the sand, we are \nbackward-looking Luddites and whatever adjective they chose. Today, \njust 10 years later, those proponents have been shown dreadfully wrong. \nThe problem is that those people who pushed PNTR--the CEOs, the Harvard \neconomist, the newspaper editors--few of them have lost their jobs. It \nhas been workers in Galion, OH, and Zanesville and Toledo and Mansfield \nand Chillicothe who have paid the price because of that terrible \ndecision to extend those trade preferences to the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Since receiving PNTR status and the benefits of membership in the \nWorld Trade Organization, the WTO, China has taken money from American \nconsumers and investors without fully opening its markets to American \nbusinesses and workers. The results are record trade deficits. The \nresults are millions of jobs lost. Three million manufacturing jobs \nhave been lost in the last several years--not all because of China \ntrade but a significant number.\n  Chinese workers continue to face low wages and substandard labor \nconditions. This has not worked particularly well for Chinese workers. \nIt sure has not worked well for American workers. It has worked well \nfor those American companies that outsourced their jobs, hired Chinese \nworkers at very low wages, with very few environmental or worker safety \nsafeguards, and then exported those goods back into the United States.\n  Even the most ardent proponents of China PNTR are likely to feel a \nbit of buyer's remorse, unable to do business in China because of \nChina's aggressive protection of its industries.\n  We must do more to strengthen a multilateral, rules-based system that \nholds trading partners accountable. A critical way to hold them \naccountable and advance our economic interests is strong and aggressive \ntrade enforcement.\n  President Obama, on two occasions, did something President Bush never \ndid, even though he was presented with recommendations from the \nInternational Trading Commission. President Obama twice already showed \na willingness to enforce trade rules--the first President to invoke the \nsection 421 safeguards, which he did when he granted relief to the U.S. \nconsumer tire industry. This single action saved at least 100 jobs in \nFindlay, OH, at Cooper Tire, after President Obama said China is \ncheating, China is not playing fair, and invoked these sanctions \nagainst them.\n  The Commerce Department then found that steel pipe and tube \nmanufacturers, so-called ``oil country tubular goods'' manufacturers, \nare being dramatically undercut by China. As a result, the \nInternational Trade Commission granted immediate relief for these oil \ncountry tubular goods, which is helping V Star expand operations in \nYoungstown.\n  I was in Youngstown at V Star. I saw what they were doing. We did a \ngroundbreaking today with Governor Strickland, who has played a roll in \nassembling the package for Star Steel's expansion--some recovery \ndollars to help with infrastructure leading in and out of the plant, a \n$6 million investment in V, a very productive workforce for the last \nseveral years at V Star, and this trade decision President Obama made \nto simply say the Chinese have not played fair--and the ITC has granted \nimmediate relief. Those factors show that when you enforce trade law, \nit creates jobs.\n  There will be 1,000 building trades jobs for the next 18 months in \nMahoning Valley because of these direct jobs. Then there will be \nanother 400 or so and maybe more jobs in the future as this company \nexpands.\n  These are good developments, obviously, but there is more we can do \nto show America is serious about trade enforcement. There is more we \ncan do to show we are serious about rebalancing our trade relationship \nwith China in defending our national economic interests. And we know \nthere is more we can do in defending a strong national manufacturing \nbase that leads the United States in the global clean energy economy.\n  Right now, China is working every day to win the race by any cost and \nany means necessary. Beijing invested $35 billion in renewable energy \nlast year, more or less double the $18 billion we invested as a \ncountry. Every day we delay investments in clean energy, China spends \n$51 million a day to further that unacceptable gap.\n  China is not only using its abundance of capital to monopolize clean \nenergy manufacturing, it is also elbowing competition out of the way by \ndiscriminating against U.S. companies.\n  China cries foul at our ``Buy American'' policies but has its own \n``Buy\n\n[[Page S5499]]\n\nChina'' policies, without signing onto the WTO agreement on \nprocurement. They promised in 2000, with the passage of PNTR, they \npromised they would join the agreement on procurement, which meant fair \nplay on contracts between and among governments. Yet China has not only \nrefused to sign on, they also had a strong ``Buy China'' arrangement in \ntheir economy, what would have violated WTO rules. Yet several major \nopinion leaders--Ivy League economists, pundits on television, \nnewspaper editors, and too many elected officials--pushed back and said \nwe should not do ``Buy American'' in this country.\n  China's so-called ``indigenous innovation'' policies provide \npreferences to products containing Chinese-developed intellectual \nproperty for government procurement purposes. That is why I encourage \nthe Obama administration to launch a section 301 case against the \nChinese package of policies that limit market access to U.S. companies \nin the clean energy sector.\n  If China leads the clean energy revolution, we will trade dependance \non foreign oil with dependence on Chinese or foreign clean energy \ntechnologies. With the right investments and with strong trade \nenforcement, we can make sure that does not happen.\n  Consider, as you know in Oregon, what is at stake. Five of the top \nten solar panel makers in the world are from China. But the No. 1 is \nFirst Solar, a U.S. company which has factories around the world that \ncan produce as much energy as any coal or nuclear plant but, of course, \nmuch cleaner and more efficient.\n  One of First Solar's factories is in Perrysburg, OH, and the \nentrepreneurs behind the company's success started at the University of \nToledo. If we want to keep First Solar at the top in the world, and if \nwe want our entrepreneurs to continue to lead the world in innovation, \nthey should have access to all of the world's markets. That is why we \nneed the President of the United States to lead the crusade for \nvigorous trade enforcement.\n  Just the launch of a 301 case by this administration will show China \nwe are serious about competing in this emerging market. We cannot enter \nthe next decade of the 21st century further behind, facing the same \nhurdles that faced our Nation just 10 years ago.\n  As the G20 summit convenes this weekend and beyond, we must take the \nbuyer's remorse of those who supported China PNTR and make sure we \nbegin the next decade with a rules-based trading system that works for \nAmerican workers and works for American manufacturers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

BYRD\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, my heart is heavy with sadness following \nthe passing of a dear friend, Robert C. Byrd, Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  We have been friends for nearly 50 years and I am overcome with \nmemories. Nearly 48 years ago Senator Byrd was one of the first to \ngreet me in the Chamber of the U.S. Senate.\n  Since that first moment of friendship we have worked together on many \nprojects. And since those early days, I have called him, ``my leader.''\n  He was my mentor. Over the years he provided me countless \nopportunities and tasked me with positions of critical national \noversight while guiding my actions with the temperance he learned as \nthe longest serving Senator in history.\n  He was a Senator's Senator. His many accomplishments were historic \nand he fought tirelessly to improve the lives of working families in \nWest Virginia. We shared the belief that we must provide for the people \nwho trust us to represent their communities in Washington.\n  I owe much to my leader, Senator Byrd. He will forever have my \ngratitude and respect and I will miss him dearly. My thoughts and \nprayers are with the Byrd family during this difficult time.\n  Mr. President, as America mourns, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to Senator Byrd.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know several colleagues have come to the \nfloor today to note the passing of a giant among us, Robert Byrd. I \nwant to take a moment here to speak straight from the heart about \nRobert Byrd and my experience working with him. As we look at his desk \nwith the flowers there, we of course think back to not too long ago \nwhen we lost another giant, Ted Kennedy. I think what distinguishes \nthese two from others is their unbelievable, undying commitment to the \npeople they represented and to this country.\n  I think, when all is said and done, that is what it is about. It is \nnot about how long you serve. Of course, in the case of both Senator \nKennedy and Senator Byrd, it was so long. Senator Byrd made history as \nthe longest serving Senator, and that should be duly noted. But it is \nwell beyond that. It is about this fierce sense of ``fight for your \npeople'' that they both had.\n  When I came to the Senate, of course Robert C. Byrd was a legend for \nsure. He always met with the incoming Senators, to give them the rules \nof the road about procedure, about how to conduct yourself when you \nwere in the chair, about the dignity of the Senate, and most of all \nabout reverence for the Constitution. As many know and many saw, the \nimage I will always have of Robert C. Byrd is of him reaching inside \nhis suit pocket and bringing out the Constitution--which, along with \nthe Bible, was what he cherished most. He taught us that everything we \ndo here comes from the Founders, and he taught us to love and respect \nthe Constitution and he did it in a way that was truly inspiring.\n  I can tell you, coming from the largest State in the Union, we have \nour share of problems. We have floods and fires and droughts, we have \npests in our agricultural industry, we have problem after problem--\nearthquakes, need I say that? Every single time we had one of these \ndisasters, Senator Feinstein and I knew we had to go to our colleagues \nand say: Please understand, California needs the help of the U.S. \nGovernment because the damage is so massive. Of course, we all do that \nwhenever our State has a problem, because we are the United States of \nAmerica.\n  However, there are times when you do not have an ear that is \nlistening. Senator Byrd, as the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, opened his doors to us, opened his heart to us, opened his \nexperience to us, and was always there for us. I so remember that, time \nafter time.\n  I went to see him about our water problems. We have lots of water \nproblems. We have cities and suburbs that need the water. We have \nfishermen who need the water. We have agriculture that needs the water. \nAll the stakeholders have very difficult debates over water. Senator \nFeinstein and I again have teamed up on this and we have always had a \nwilling listener in Robert C. Byrd, who understood and helped us get \nthe stakeholders to the table to find ways to preserve, to conserve, \nand increase the supply in a smart way for all those stakeholders.\n  These things are very big to the people of California, who probably \nhave not connected Robert Byrd to California. But in all of these cases \nwhere we were so in need, he was there for us.\n  I remember so well his leadership in trying to bring the troops home \nfrom Iraq. Twenty-three of us stood up and said no to that war because \nwe thought it meant taking our eye off Osama bin Laden and what was \nhappening in Afghanistan and turning around and going into Iraq. We \nworried very much\n\n[[Page S5500]]\n\nabout what would happen with our troops and that it would be a very \nlong war and there was no exit strategy.\n  Senator Byrd organized us and he opened his office here in the \nCapitol and said we need to talk about ways that we can bring this war \nto the end. We need to organize and we need to talk about what is \nhappening to our troops. He cared so much. For me, to have been in his \npresence and to watch him work has been an amazing experience. So I \nrise to pay tribute to him.\n  He has so many wonderful family members who care so much about him. \nWhen he lost his wife, it took a huge toll on Robert Byrd, and you saw \nit in his face. A light went out inside. His grandchildren and children \nstepped up, but that hole in his heart was there. It was evident to all \nof us. He stayed here through thick and thin, came in--wheeled in, in a \nwheelchair, fading, suffering, to be in this place that he loved so \nmuch, so much; that he respected so much.\n  I say, and I know, there is not a Member on either side of the aisle \nwho did not respect Robert C. Byrd for his brilliance, for his \nstrength, for his fierce representation of his State and, by the way, \nfor his extraordinary biography, coming up the way he did. Talk about \nthe American dream--a child of dire poverty, close to the mines. He \nalways fought for those miners. What a legacy he leaves.\n  I don't have any notes in front of me. I am speaking from the heart \ntoday. I will have a more complete statement, but I did want to make my \nviews known today and send my condolences to the family. It is a great \nloss for everyone.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise with a heavy heart to pay tribute \nto our friend and colleague who died early this morning, Senator Robert \nC. Byrd, the longest serving Member in the illustrious history of the \nU.S. Congress, the longest serving Senator, and the only Senator in \nU.S. history elected to nine full terms. Considering that Senator Byrd \nwon his first election, to the West Virginia House of Delegates, in \n1946, it may be that he was the longest serving elected official in \nhistory. His passing is a profound loss to all Americans, to his \nbeloved constituents in West Virginia, and particularly to the \ninstitution of the U.S. Senate and those of us who serve here. The \nSenate had no greater champion than Robert Byrd, no one with his \nunderstanding of the Senate's unique character, role, promise, history, \nand parliamentary procedures.\n  When Robert Byrd was elected to the Senate in 1958, after serving in \nthe House for 6 years, he was part of a large, distinguished class that \nincluded such future giants as Hugh Scott, Gene McCarthy, Edmund \nMuskie, and Philip Hart. He surpassed them all.\n  According to the Senate Historical Office, Robert Byrd was the \n1,579th person to become a U.S. Senator. Since he was elected to the \nSenate, another 335 individuals have become U.S. Senators. All in all, \nRobert Byrd served with over 400 other Senators. And I am certain that \neach one of them held their colleague, as I do, in the highest esteem.\n  Senator Byrd's modest beginnings in the hard-scrabble coal fields of \nAppalachia are well known. After his mother died during the 1918 flu \npandemic, Senator Byrd went to live with an aunt and uncle who adopted \nhim and raised him in a house without running water or electricity. He \npumped gas and butchered hogs. During World War II, he was a welder and \nbuilt cargo ships in Baltimore and Tampa Bay. After the war, he \nsuccessfully ran for the West Virginia House of Delegates and, 4 years \nlater, the State's senate, before entering Congress in 1953. All in \nall, he ran for and was elected to office 15 times--not counting \nprimaries--without suffering a single defeat. Suffice it to say that \nhis life is the quintessential American success story. I think every \nyoung American should learn about Senator Byrd's life as an example of \nwhat hard work and persistence and devotion can accomplish in this \ncountry. He understood better than most people the importance of being \neducated, not just for embarking on a successful career, but as an end \nto itself. He was well-read and could recite from memory long passages \nfrom the Bible, and from great poets and authors. He was a fine \nhistorian, not just of the Founding Fathers and the U.S. Senate, but of \nancient Greece and Rome and England.\n  Senator Byrd married his high school sweetheart, Erma Ora James, \nshortly after they both graduated from Mark Twain High School--where he \nwas valedictorian--in 1937. He was too poor to afford college right \naway and wouldn't receive his degree from Marshall University until 60 \nyears later--when he was 77. In between, he did something no other \nMember of Congress has ever done: he enrolled in law school--at \nAmerican University--and in 10 years of part-time study while serving \nas a Member of Congress, he completed his law degree, which President \nJohn Kennedy presented to him. Senator Byrd was married to his beloved \nErma for nearly 69 years, and was blessed with two daughters, six \ngrandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n  During his Senate tenure, Robert Byrd was elected to more leadership \npositions than any other Senator in history, including majority and \nminority leader, whip, and President pro tempore. He cast 18,689 \nrollcall votes. Only 29 other Senators in the history of the Republic \nhave cast more than 10,000 votes; Strom Thurmond is the only other \nSenator to cast more than 16,000 votes. Senator Byrd's attendance \nrecord over five decades--97 percent--is as impressive as the sheer \nnumber of votes he cast.\n  Senator Byrd's legislative accomplishments, from economic development \nand transportation to education and health care, are legendary. He \nsteered the Panama Canal Treaty through the Senate and waged a lonely \nbattle against the war in Iraq, leading an unsuccessful filibuster \nagainst the resolution granting President George W. Bush broad power to \nwage a preemptive war against Iraq. He claimed that his vote against \nthe Iraq war resolution was the vote of which he was most proud for \nhaving cast over the course of his career. When U.S. military strikes \non Iraq commenced on March 19, 2003, he stated:\n\n       Today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of \n     recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image \n     of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The \n     image of America has changed. Around the globe, our \n     friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions \n     are questioned. Instead of reasoning with those with whom \n     we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten \n     recrimination.\n\n  Senator Byrd was unabashedly determined to use his power as a Senator \nand as the chairman or ranking member of the Appropriations Committee \nto help lift his State out of grinding poverty. And he delivered for \nhis constituents. It is no surprise, then, that he won 100 percent of \nthe vote of West Virginians in one election--1976--or frequently \ncarried all 55 of West Virginia's counties. And while he fervently \nsupported the coal industry, he recognized the devastating \nenvironmental and social impact of mountaintop removal mining \ntechniques and he called for an end to that practice.\n  In the meantime, he wrote five books, including the definitive \nhistory of the U.S. Senate.\n  Perhaps the highest tribute to Senator Byrd can be found in his \nbiographical section of the Almanac of American Politics, which states: \n``Robert Byrd . . . may come closest to the kind of senator the \nFounding Fathers had in mind than any other.'' His fealty to the U.S. \nSenate and to the Constitution has served as an inspiration, a lesson, \nand a guiding light to all of us who have been privileged to follow him \nin this Chamber.\n  In the last 10 months, we have lost two towering figures here in the \nSenate: Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd--one of the Senate's greatest \nlegislators and without doubt its greatest defender. Former Senator \nPaul Sarbanes, whose seat I am privileged to hold, remarked that \nSenator Byrd liked to say that he never served under any President, but \nwas honored to serve with many Presidents. We can honor these twin \ngiants by carrying on their legacies, by fighting to make America a \nbetter place for all Americans, and by defending the Senate's role as a \nco-equal, not subservient, branch of government.\n  When Senator Byrd became the longest serving Member of Congress last \nNovember, I quoted Robert E. Lee in my floor statement. Lee said:\n\n       Duty is the most sublime word in our language. Do your duty \n     in all things.\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\n     You cannot do more. You should never wish to do less.\n\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd has done his duty in all things--to the \nSenate, to himself, to his family, to his State, to his Nation, and to \nGod.\n  I am honored to join his and my colleagues here in the Senate, West \nVirginians, and all Americans in mourning the death, celebrating the \nlife, and paying tribute to this great Senator and this great man.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 572) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 572\n\n       Whereas, the Honorable Robert C.

Byrd has served on a \n     Senate committee, the Committee on Appropriations, which he \n     has chaired during five Congresses, longer than any other \n     Senator; and\n       Whereas, the Honorable Robert C.
