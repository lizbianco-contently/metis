Mr. President, just a couple of brief remarks.\n  With all the challenges our country faces, I think we all agree on \nthe importance of this Congress getting off to a fast and effective \nstart. In many ways, I believe we are on that track.\n  Today, we will likely pass a major wilderness bill that will preserve \nour environment for the enjoyment of generations to come. The press \nreports it is the most significant environmental bill that will be \npassed in more than a quarter century.\n  We are making progress on confirmation hearings so President Obama \nwill have his team hit the ground running on January 20. We have seated \nnew Members and announced new committee assignments for the 111th \nCongress.\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\n  Today, we vote on stopping a filibuster on a motion to proceed to the \nLilly Ledbetter legislation--legislation that ensures pay fairness in \nthe workplace. This should not be necessary. It is really a waste of \ntime--our country's time. After at least 2 legislative days to get the \nbill before the Senate to have this vote today, we must wait another 30 \nhours until we can start offering amendments on the bill. That is a \nwaste of time. That is 4 days at least of wasted time and unnecessary \ndelay. I hope in the future we can just go to the bill, avoid the \ncloture filing on a motion to proceed. Instead of forcing cloture \nmotions that only waste time and delay progress, I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to offer amendments. If they object to parts of this bill, \nthe Lilly Ledbetter bill, then let's work on a list of amendments and \nget through them. I do not approve the amendments. The Republican \nleader does not approve them. Senators will have that opportunity to \nvote on amendments, up or down, and it does not get any fairer than \nthat. There may be motions to table, but at least they will have the \nright to offer those amendments.\n  I think we have the opportunity to get this Congress off on the right \nfoot. I want all to know there is no attempt by Democrats to jam \nlegislation through without Republican involvement. So I ask my \nRepublican colleagues to accept my offer to work with us rather than \nrevert to the old path of obstruction that served neither party nor the \nAmerican people well.\n  So I would hope that as soon as this vote takes place today, we would \nnot have to wait 30 hours or 5 hours or any amount of hours. Let's just \nstart legislating on the bill. People could offer amendments today, \nafter we get these votes out of the way. We could offer amendments \ntomorrow. I hope we can do that. As we have done in the past, if there \nis a series of amendments, we can always stack those votes to vote at a \nmore convenient time for everyone. But I hope we can do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S402-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING SENATOR JOE BIDEN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, finally, let me say about Vice President-\nelect Joe Biden, Senator Joe Biden, Joe Biden: Everyone knows about his \ncourage, his wonderful family, his remarkable career in the U.S. \nSenate. We know he overcame a tremendously difficult personal tragedy \nduring the first few days after his election. I am not sure many could \nhave had the strength he had to conquer this tragedy. Then, of course, \nhe got sick many years later and fought back. It was when Tim Johnson \nwas in the hospital in a coma that Joe Biden visited him and his family \nand talked to him about the fact that there will be times when, as he \nis recovering, he may be embarrassed by his inability to speak very \nwell. Joe Biden is one of the great orators in the history of the \ncountry. No one would have ever known he had a problem very similar to \nwhat happened to Tim Johnson. He was such a role model to build Tim's \nconfidence to be able to come back to the Senate.\n  We here in the Senate know his wonderful family, and now, because of \nhis exposure to America, our country has been introduced to this great \nfamily. We know he is now in his seventh term in the Senate, in which \ntime he has served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and that he is a champion of \nrights for women, the environment, a strong military, and the rule of \nlaw.\n  When I think of Joe Biden--I have known him here since I came to the \nCongress in 1982. I came to the Senate a few years later. But in all of \nthis time, the picture in my mind is during the heat of the \nPresidential campaign. I am driving down through the capital of the \nState of Nevada, Carson City, and I look out on a corner there, and \nthere is Joe Biden in Carson City, NV, campaigning. He had a number of \npeople around him. I stopped the car, got out, and gave Joe a handshake \nand a big hug. It was so Joe Biden to be there. He was there pressing \nthe flesh and talking to voters.\n  The people of Nevada have come to know and love Joe Biden for that \nvery reason. He is kind of a regular guy; whether it is at one of the \nsandwich shops which came from Delaware to Nevada, Capriotti's--now \nthey are all over Nevada--they all have a picture of Joe Biden in them \nbecause it was a Delaware-based sandwich shop. He is just a regular \nkind of guy who shows up on a street corner just to talk to people.\n  I will always remember with gratitude the kindness he showed when I \nfirst arrived in the Senate in 1986. I will be forever grateful that he \nwas one of the very first colleagues to support my candidacy for \nDemocratic whip. I can remember. I was in his office. He called in his \nsecretary, and I do not remember her name, but he said: I take no more \ncalls on this. Reid's my man.\n  Well, I have always been his. I am a Senate guy, just like Joe Biden. \nWe cannot get that out of our blood. I wish him well. He is going to be \na great representative of our country, and I am very proud to be able \nto say to Joe Biden: You are my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S402-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I, too, shortly want to make some \nremarks about our good friend from Delaware as he leaves the Senate \ntoday to take up his new responsibilities, but first a few observations \nabout the next item on the agenda, the so-called Ledbetter legislation.\n  Let me say to my good friend the majority leader, I intend to vote \nfor cloture on the motion to proceed. He and I have had a number of \nconstructive conversations privately, and he has reiterated again today \npublicly that we are going to make an effort to get the Senate back to \noperating the way it used to, which is that bills are amendable. So I \nhave said to my colleagues and I would say to my good friend from \nNevada that I trust you and believe you that we are going to get on the \nLedbetter bill, we are going to have amendments and have votes and then \ndispose of the legislation in the normal way.\n  With regard to the substance of that particular measure, despite the \ngross distortions voters heard about this legislation in the runup to \nthe November elections, the Ledbetter bill as written is neither about \nwomen nor fairness, and it is not about whether pay discrimination \nshould be illegal. Pay discrimination is illegal, and it has been since \n1963. Rather, this bill is about how long the statute of limitations on \npay discrimination suits should be.\n  Last night, Republicans began to outline a proposal for addressing \nthis question in a way that is fair for everyone. Senator Hutchison's \nbill strikes the right balance. It says the clock should not run out on \nsomeone who has been discriminated against until he or she discovers \nthe alleged discrimination. This way, the focus is where it should be, \non the injured party.\n  The Ledbetter legislation unfairly targets business owners, who may \nor may not have discriminated against a man or a woman, on the basis of \npay years or even decades ago. Its primary beneficiaries are lawyers, \nwho want to squeeze a major settlement out of every company that fears \nthe expense or the publicity of going to court. This bill is unfair to \nbusiness owners who in many cases will no longer have the evidence they \nwould need to mount a convincing defense, and it is unfair to the \nmillions of American workers who are worried about losing their jobs in \nthe current economic downturn. Job creators have enough to worry about \nat the moment. Adding the threat of never-ending lawsuits is a new \nburden the Federal Government should not even be considering at this \nparticular time.\n  No right-thinking American would defend discrimination of any kind in \nthe workplace or anywhere else. And it is unfair to the public to \nsuggest that those who oppose this bill endorse discrimination. It \ndegrades our public discourse and it degrades the legislative process.\n  Many of us oppose this bill as written because it will paralyze \nbusinesses and add an even greater strain on workers than they \ncurrently face. We support a business climate that creates the \nconditions for success, not a climate that harasses the millions of men \nand women in this country who support themselves, their families, and \ntheir\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nworkers by owning and operating small businesses.\n  Republicans have a better proposal and other good ideas to help \nAmerican workers. I believe we need to get on the Ledbetter bill, as I \nsaid a few minutes ago, and have an open debate about it so the \nAmerican people can hear Republican alternatives and the Senate has an \nopportunity to vote on more than what our good friends on the other \nside have offered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S403-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAREWELL TO SENATOR BIDEN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I turn now to the issue of the moment, \nwhich is the celebration of the career of our good friend from Delaware \nand wishing him well in the future. I remember being sworn in, in \nJanuary of 1985, thinking I had gotten to the Senate at a pretty early \nage. I was 42 years old. I thought: Gee, I have gotten here at a pretty \nearly age. At the same time I was sworn in for my first term, the \nSenator from Delaware was being sworn in for his third time. He was \nbarely old enough to vote when he got here. We were born in the same \nyear, but you got a 12-year head start on me, I would say to my friend \nfrom Delaware, and has had an extraordinarily distinguished career.\n  When we think about Senator Biden, certainly we think about his \nmarvelous personality, his demeanor, his friendliness. He can have a \ngood riproaring debate without being disagreeable, as we all say. He \nhas been a pleasure to work with. I say that as somebody who has rarely \nvoted on the same side as he has. We say goodbye today to an \noutstanding individual who has been a fixture in the Senate for 36 \nyears and a friend to everyone in the Chamber. He now, of course, is \ngoing to enjoy an even greater achievement as he becomes the Vice \nPresident of the United States.\n  I remember right from the beginning in 1985, as I was discussing a \nfew minutes ago, that Senator Biden made everybody feel comfortable. \nAlthough we were born in the same year, as I indicated, he certainly \ngot here at an early age, and it has allowed him to spend most of his \nadult life in the Senate.\n  America got to know Joe pretty well over the course of the last year. \nThey got a chance to witness his humor, his compassion, and, yes, his \nextraordinary decency. They learned firsthand his not entirely \nundeserved reputation for loquaciousness. They met his wonderful \nfamily. Barack Obama decided he liked what he saw in Joe Biden as well \nand invited him to be his running mate in what turned out to be a \nspirited Presidential campaign.\n  So next week, after the peaceful transition of power from one \npolitical party to another that has distinguished our democracy since \n1801, Joe Biden will become the 47th Vice President of the United \nStates. This inauguration marks the first time in almost 50 years that \ntwo Senators moved directly into the offices of President and Vice \nPresident. So no matter what outcome some of us may have hoped for in \nthe election, I think my colleagues and I can feel a little \ninstitutional pride at that accomplishment--the fact that two Senators \nwill be sworn in as President and Vice President.\n  Everyone knows by now Joe's famous loyalty to his beloved Amtrak and \nhis regular commute by rail 80 minutes each day from his home in \nWilmington to the Capitol. We know of his commitment to being home with \nhis family every night.\n  I am sure every single one of my friends in this Chamber has a story \nto tell of working with Joe. For my part, one of several efforts Joe \nand I worked together on is the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act passed \nin 2006. After the election of the Hamas-dominated government in Gaza, \nJoe recognized, as I and others did, the threat that situation posed--\nand continues to pose as we have seen up close over the last weeks--the \nthreat it poses to peace in the region. Thanks to his efforts, we were \nable to pass and have signed into law this important bill which \nrestricts U.S. and foreign assistance to the Hamas-led government \nunless and until it takes serious steps to renounce terror and publicly \nrecognizes Israel's right to exist. That bill was the right thing to do \nto confront terrorism. I am proud of my work with Joe Biden on it, and \nI know he is too.\n  I have also worked with Joe on tightening sanctions on the \ndictatorial, illegitimate regime currently ruling in Burma. Among other \nefforts, the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, which we collaborated \non, restricts the importation of Burmese Jade into America through \nother countries. That takes a large bite out of every lucrative source \nof profit for the Burmese regime.\n  Joe is well versed in these issues and many others, thanks to his \nyears on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, with much of that time \nas either chairman or ranking member. I know he is particularly proud \nof his role in pushing for NATO expansion in Central and Eastern Europe \nin 1998 and in 2003.\n  We will all certainly miss Joe's presence as 1 of 100. It will take \nsome getting used to, to have a Senate without him, but the good news \nis he is not going very far. Obviously, Senator Biden's election as \nVice President is a great honor and a fitting tribute to his 36 years \nof public service. I look forward to working with him as a key player \nin the incoming administration, as Congress and the new President work \ntogether to tackle the many difficult issues this Nation faces.\n  Let me say, on a personal basis: Joe, it has been a pleasure knowing \nyou and working with you over the years. Elaine and I wish you and Jill \nthe very best in the coming years.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S403-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the leaders for \ntheir kind comments. It is true that I have been here a long time, I \nsay to my friend from Kentucky. As a matter of fact, I say to my friend \nfrom Hawaii, I remember the first time I stood on the floor as a \nSenator of the United States. It was the desk directly to your left, \nSenator, the top row, second in. It was temporarily my desk. I remember \nstanding and being told that the desk on my right was the desk of Henry \nClay and on my left Daniel Webster because the senior Senators from the \nrespective States got those desks. I say to my friend from California, \nit was the only time I can remember being speechless when I stood \nthere, as a 30-year-old kid, thinking: Oh, my God.\n  Well, I never thought I would be standing here today. I never \nbelieved serving in this Chamber was my destiny, but it always was a \nbig part of my dreams.\n  I remember vividly the first time I walked in this Chamber, I walked \nthrough those doors, but I walked through those doors as a 21-year-old \ntourist. I had been down visiting some of my friends at Georgetown \nUniversity. I went to the University of Delaware. I had a blind date \nwith a young lady from a school they used to call Visi Visitation--\nwhich is now part of Georgetown. My good friend, a guy named Dave \nWalsh, was there. After the evening, staying at his apartment, I got up \nand--I shouldn't say this probably, but I will--I don't drink. Not for \nmoral reasons, I just never had a drink. There is nothing worse than \nbeing a sober guy with a bunch of college guys who have a hangover the \nnext morning.\n  So I got up and decided to get in the car--this is a true story, \nSenator Carper--and I drove up to the Capitol. I had always been \nfascinated with it. In those days, you could literally drive right up \nto the front steps. I was 21 years old. This was 1963. I say to my \nfriend from Iowa, I drove up to the steps and there had been a rare \nSaturday session. It had just ended. So I walked up the steps, found \nmyself in front of what we call the elevators, and I walked to the \nright to the Reception Room. There was no one there. The glass doors, \nthose French doors that lead behind the Chamber, were open. There were \nno signs then. I just walked\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nin. Literally, I walked in, and I walked in down here, and I came \nthrough those doors. I walked into the Chamber and the lights were \nstill on and I was awestruck, literally awestruck. I don't know what in \nGod's name made me do it, but I walked up, I say to my friend from \nArkansas, and I sat in the Presiding Officer's chair. I was mesmerized.\n  The next thing I know, I feel this hand on my shoulder and the \nCapitol Policeman picks me up and says: What are you doing? After a few \nmoments he realized I was just a dumbstruck kid. He didn't arrest me or \nanything. That was the first time I walked onto the Senate floor. It is \nliterally a true story.\n  By the way, just 9, 10 years later, I walked through those same doors \nas a Senator. A Capitol Hill policeman stopped me walking in and he \nsaid: Do you remember me? I said: No, sir. He said: I welcome you back \nto the Senate. He was retiring. He used to be a Capitol Hill policeman. \nHe was retiring 2 weeks later. He said: Welcome to the floor, legally.\n  Well, it is sort of fitting to the way I started my career here. I \nmay not be a young man anymore, but I am still awestruck. I am still \nawestruck by this Chamber. I think it brings my career full cycle, to \nknow that while I was once detained for sitting in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair, I will now occasionally be detained in the Presiding \nOfficer's chair as Vice President of the United States of America.\n  The Senate has been my life, and that is not hyperbole; it literally \nhas been my life. I have been a Senator considerably longer than I was \nalive before I was a Senator. I may be resigning from the Senate today, \nbut I will always be a Senate man. Except for the title ``father,'' \nthere is no title, including Vice President, that I am more proud to \nwear than that of a Senator of the United States.\n  When I arrived here, giants--giants--loomed over the landscape of the \nSenate, people with names such as Danny Inouye, Hubert Humphrey, Ed \nMuskie, William Fulbright, Jacob Javits, Mike Mansfield, Stuart \nSymington, Scoop Jackson, Sam Ervin, John McClellan, Warren Magnuson, \nClaiborne Pell, and a few others who are still here: Bob Byrd, and the \nlion of the Senate, Ted Kennedy. In those days, chairmen dominated. \nLiterally, as Senator Inouye will remember, if a chairman said he \nwanted a vote, almost without exception, every other chairman voted \nwith that chairman on a vote on the floor of the Senate in 1973. But \nthe old ways of doing business and the old ways of thinking were, at \nthat very moment in the Senate's history, beginning to change.\n  As my colleagues know, there is a longstanding tradition in the \nSenate--I think honored in the breach now more than the rule--but when \nI got here in 1973, it was mandatory that a new Senator would pay \nrespects to the ``old bulls of the Senate.'' I never dreamed I would be \nan old bull of the Senate.\n  I remember the first appointment I made. It was to go see Senator \nJohn Stennis, chairman then of the Armed Services Committee. I now have \nSenator Stennis's office. I remember I walked in--and Senator Stennis \nhad a great and large mahogany conference table that was a gift from \nthe President of the Philippines to Vice President Barkley for the \nliberation of the Philippines. He used it as his desk. He had a blotter \nat one end of it. It seated--I don't know how many people it seats--15 \npeople. It was a desk with a group of leather chairs around it.\n  I walked in--and those who remember John Stennis, he talked at you \nlike this when he talked; he always put his hand up like this--he \nlooked at me and he said: Young man, sit down, sit down. And he patted \nthe leather chair next to him, so I dutifully sat down. He said: \nCongratulations. He said: May I ask you a question? I said: Yes, sir, \nMr. Chairman. He said, What made you run for the Senate? Being tactful, \nas I always am, I answered honestly without thinking. I said: Civil \nrights, sir. As soon as I did, I could feel the beads of perspiration \npop out on my head, and I thought: Oh, my God. He looked at me and he \nsaid--absolutely true story--he said: Good, good, good. That was the \nend of the conversation. Well, that was 1973.\n  In 1988, time had transpired; he had become my good friend. We shared \na hospital room, a hospital suite at Walter Reed for a number of \nmonths. He had lost his leg to cancer. It was during that period when \nPresident Bush was coming into office. As the tradition is, as all my \ncolleagues know, you get to choose your offices based on seniority as \nthey come up, as offices come open. I have always thought--we all think \nour offices are the finest--I always thought of his office, which had \nbeen the office of a man whom he never referred to by his first name \nthat I can remember, and the man after whom the Russell Building is \nnamed, Chairman Russell. It had been his office.\n  I walked down to look at his office. It was that period in December \nwhen no one was around. The elections were over. I walked in, and I \nthink his secretary of 30 some years--I think her name was Mildred. My \nmemory is not certain on that, but I think her name was Mildred. I \nwalked into the anteroom to his office, and all these boxes were piled \nup. He was packing up 40-some years of service.\n  She said: Senator, welcome. Welcome. You all are going to take our \noffice?\n  I said--I think her name was Mildred: I don't know, Mildred, I am \ngoing to check. I said: Is the chairman in?\n  She said: No, you go right in the office.\n  I went in the office. Without her knowing it, Senator Stennis had \ncome in through the other door of the hallway and was sitting there in \nhis wheelchair in the same exact spot, with one leg, staring out the \nwindow of that office that looks out onto the Supreme Court.\n  I said: Oh, Mr. Chairman, I apologize. I apologize for interrupting.\n  He said: No, Joe, come in, sit down, sit down.\n  I sat down in that chair, and what astounded me, I say to Senator \nBoxer, is he looked at me and said: Joe, do you remember the first time \nyou came to see me? I hadn't. I told this story about Senator Stennis \nto my friend from Mississippi before, as he walks on the floor.\n  He asked me: Do you remember?\n  I said: No, I don't.\n  He said: I asked you why you ran for the Senate.\n  I said: Oh, I remember. I was a smart, young fellow, wasn't I.\n  He looked at me and said: You all are going to take my office, aren't \nyou, Joe? He caressed that table, the table he loved so much. He \ncaressed it like it was an animate object.\n  He said: You are going to take my office?\n  I said: Yes, sir, I am.\n  He said: I wanted to tell you then in 1973, and I am going to tell \nyou all, this table here was the flagship of the Confederacy.\n  If you read ``Masters of the Senate'' about Johnson's term, you will \nsee in the middle of the book a picture of the table in my office with \nthe famous old southern segregationist Senators sitting around that \ntable chaired by Senator Russell.\n  He said: This was the flagship of the Confederacy. Every Tuesday, we \ngathered here under Senator Russell's direction to plan the demise of \nthe civil rights movement from 1954 to 1968. It is time this table \npasses from a man who was against civil rights into the hands of a man \nwho is for civil rights.\n  I found it genuinely, without exaggeration, moving. We talked a few \nmore minutes. I got up and when I got to the door, he turned to me in \nthe wheelchair and said: One more thing, Joe. The civil rights movement \ndid more--more--to free the White man than the Black man.\n  I looked at him and said: Mr. Chairman, how is that? Probably Thad \nwill only remember as well as I do.\n  He went like this: It freed my soul; it freed my soul.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I can tell you that by his own \naccount, John Stennis was personally enlarged by his service in the \nSenate. That is the power of this institution. Men and women who come \nto Washington, who come in contact with folks in different parts of the \ncountry that we represent, with slightly different cultural \nbackgrounds, different religions, different attitudes about what makes \nthis country great, all races, all religions, and it opens a door for \nchange. I think it opens a door for personal growth, and in that comes \nthe political progress this Nation has made.\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n  I learned that lesson as a very young Senator. I got here in 1973, \nand one of the people, along with Danny and others on this floor who \nkept me here, was Mike Mansfield, the majority leader. He used to once \na week have us report to his office, which is where the leader's office \nis on the other side. He really was doing it, in retrospect, to take my \npulse, to see how I was doing.\n  I walked in one day through those doors on the Republican side, and a \nman who became my friend, Jesse Helms, and his wife Dot--who is still \nmy close friend and I keep in contact with her--I walked through those \ndoors, and Jesse Helms, who came in 1972 with me, was standing in the \nback excoriating Bob Dole for the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  I walked through the floor on my way to my meeting with Senator \nMansfield. I walked in and sat down on the other side of his desk. Some \nof you remember he smoked a pipe a lot of times when he was in his \noffice. He had the pipe in his mouth and looked at me and said: Joe, \nlooks like something is bothering you.\n  I said: Mr. Leader, I can't believe what I just heard on the floor of \nthe Senate. I can't believe that anyone could be so heartless and care \nso little about people with disabilities. I tell you, it makes me \nangry, Mr. Leader.\n  He said: Joe, what would you say if I told you that 4 years ago, \nmaybe 5, Dot Helms and Jesse Helms were reading, I think the Charlotte \nObserver, the local newspaper, and they saw a piece in the paper about \na young man in braces who was handicapped at an orphanage. He was in \nhis early teens. All the caption said was the young man wanted nothing \nmore for Christmas than to be part of a family.\n  He said: What would you say if I told you Dot Helms and Jesse Helms \nadopted that young man as their own child?\n  I said: I would feel like a fool, an absolute fool.\n  He said: Well, they did.\n  He said: Joe, every man and woman sent here is sent here because \ntheir State recognizes something decent about them. It is easy to find \nthe part you don't like. I think your job, Joe, is to find out that \npart that caused him to be sent here.\n  He said: Joe, never question another man's motive. Question his \njudgment but never his motive.\n  I think I can say without fear of contradiction, I have never \nquestioned any one of your motives. I learned that lesson very early at \nthe hands of iron Mike Mansfield who had more character in his little \nfinger than the vast majority of people we know have in their whole \nbodies.\n  That advice has guided me, and hopefully well, and I hope it guides \nthis Congress because those who are willing to look for the good in the \nother guy, the other woman, I think become better people and become \nbetter and more able legislators.\n  This approach allowed me to develop friendships I would never have \nexpected would have occurred. I knew I would be friends with Danny \nInouye who came to campaign for me. I knew I could be friends with Ted \nKennedy. And I knew I could be friends with Fulbright and Humphrey and \nJavits, men with whom I shared a common view and a common philosophy. \nBut I never thought--I never thought--I would develop deep personal \nrelationships with men whose positions played an extremely large part \nin my desire to come to the Senate in the first place to change what \nthey believed in--Eastland, Stennis, Thurmond. All these men became my \nfriends.\n  As Senator Hatch will remember, I used to go over after every \nexecutive session of the Senate Judiciary Committee and go into Jim \nEastland's office, which was catercorner, and sit down and he allowed \nme to ask him a lot of dumb questions as a young kid would want to ask: \nWho is the most powerful man you ever met, Senator? What is the most \nsignificant thing that has ever occurred since you have been here?\n  On that score, he looked at me and said: Air conditioning.\n\n  I said: I beg your pardon?\n  He said: The most significant thing that happened since I got here \nwas air conditioning.\n  I thought: Wow, that is kind of strange.\n  He said: You know, Joe, before we had air conditioning, all that \nrecessed lighting all used to be great big pieces of glass like in \nshowers. He said: Come around May, that Sun--he used to use a little \nbit of profanity which I will not use for appropriate reasons--that \ndarn Sun would beat down on that dome, hit that glass, act like a \nmagnifying glass and heat up the Chamber, and we would all go home in \nMay and June for the year. Then we put in air conditioning, stayed year \nround and ruined America.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Senator Stennis was my genuine friend. But one of the most unlikely \nfriendships was Strom Thurmond. Some of you knew my relationship with \nStrom. Did I ever think when I got here I would become friends with \nStrom Thurmond? He stood for everything--I got started because of civil \nrights. Yet on his 100th birthday, certainly thereafter, on his death \nbed I got a phone call from his wife Nancy. She said: I am standing \nhere at the nurse's station, Joe, with the doctor. I just left Strom. \nHe asked me to call you. He wants a favor.\n  I said: Of course, Nancy, whatever he wants.\n  She said: He would like you to do his eulogy.\n  Well, I never thought in my wildest dreams that this place, these \nwalls, the honor that resides, would put me in a position where a man \nwhose career was one of the most interesting in modern American history \nasked me to do his eulogy. I never worked so hard on a eulogy in my \nwhole life. I think I was completely truthful--truthful to the best of \nmy knowledge.\n  As I said, he was a man who reflected the ages. He lived in three \ndifferent ages, three different parts of American history. I remind \npeople, which some will not remember, by the time he resigned, he had \nthe highest percentage of African Americans working in his office as \nany Senator. He voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. \nHe had, in my view, I believe, changed.\n  This is an incredible place, I say to my colleagues, an incredible \nplace. It has left me with the conviction that personal relationship is \nthe one thing that unlocks the true potential of this place. Every good \nthing I have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus \nyears I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by \ninterest groups but through the maturation of personal relationships.\n  Pressure groups can and are strong and important advocates, but they \nare not often vehicles for compromise. A personal relationship is what \nallows you to go after someone hammer and tongs on one issue and still \nfind common ground on the next. It is the grease that lubricates this \nincredible system we have. It is what allows you to see the world from \nanother person's perspective and allows them to take the time to see it \nfrom yours.\n  I am sure this has not been my experience alone. In a sense, I am \nprobably preaching to the choir of the very men and women sitting in \nthis Chamber who have experienced similar things.\n  One of the most moving things I ever saw in my life was on the floor \nof the Senate. The year was 1977. We were about to adjourn for the \nyear. There was a vote cast, and as we all do, we assembled in the well \nto vote.\n  One of my personal heroes, Hubert Humphrey, was literally riddled \nwith cancer. He died very shortly thereafter. He showed up, like Dewey \nBartlett of Oklahoma, he showed up every single day knowing he \nliterally had days to live. He walked down this aisle--because I was \nstanding back here. I have been on this back row for years, with my \ngood friend Fritz Hollings for 34 years.\n  He walked down the aisle, and as he did, Barry Goldwater came through \nthe doors and was coming down the aisle to vote. Barry Goldwater and \nHubert Humphrey shared virtually nothing in common philosophically. \nThey had a pretty tough campaign in 1964. It got pretty rough. Barry \nGoldwater saw Hubert and walked up and gave him a big bear hug. He \nkissed him and Hubert Humphrey kissed him back. And they stood there in \na tight embrace for minutes, both crying. It brought the entire Senate \nto tears. But to me--to me--it was the mark of a storied history of \nthis place. Hubert loved it here. He once said:\n\n       The Senate is a place filled with good will and good \n     intentions, and if the road to hell is paved with them, then \n     this is a pretty good detour.\n\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\n\n  Friendship and death are great equalizers. Death will seek all of us \nat some point, but we must choose to seek friendship. I believe our \nability to work together with people with whom we have real and deep \nand abiding disagreements, especially in these consequential times, is \ngoing to determine whether we succeed in restoring America. I think it \nis literally that fundamental and basic.\n  Things have changed a great deal since I first arrived here. There \nwere no women in the Senate. Margaret Chase Smith had just retired and \nit would be 6 years until the next woman was elected in her own right, \nand that was Nancy Kassebaum. Today, there are 16 women in the Senate, \nand we need many more, but that is progress.\n  Our proceedings in those days were not televised. They didn't have \nfax machines, let alone e-mail. I remember the fights we used to have \nin conference about whether we would actually spend money for \ncomputers. Remember those fights? Some of the older guys thought: \nComputers? Why are we going to waste the taxpayers' money and put \ncomputers in our offices? I am almost embarrassed to acknowledge that. \nThat makes me a ``pretty old dude,'' as the kids would say.\n  I often hear Senators lament today that the 24-hour news cycle and \nthe need to go back home every weekend--or in my case every night--\nmakes it harder than it used to be to get to know one another, to share \na meal. Not long after I first was elected, there was an accident in my \nfamily, and I didn't want to stay. Senators Humphrey and Kennedy and \nMansfield and Hollings, among others, said: Just stay 6 months. It was \nnot unusual in those days for there to be groups of Senators who, with \ntheir spouses, would take turns once a month having dinner for the rest \nof the Senators. Senator Eagleton of Missouri, who recently passed away \nand was a good friend; Senator Gaylord Nelson and his wife, who was \nincredible and who has also recently passed away; Senator Hollings; and \nmy friend--and he is my friend--Senator Ted Stevens from Alaska had one \nof those groups, along with a guy named Saxby from Ohio, who became \nAttorney General. While I never, ever stayed in Washington, \nparticularly in those days, they insisted I come, and I would go to \nthose dinners. I was a kid, I was single, but they included me. The \ntruth of the matter is, they went a long way toward saving my life, \nchanging my life.\n  You know, for the first time in 36 years, I am going to have a home \nin Washington--public housing--and I hope Jill and I can use it to help \nbring us all together. I hope it can be used to foster deepening \nrelationships. We all are so busy in our own careers it is awfully hard \nto do it anymore.\n  I have seen Senators who have come to this institution to attack it--\nbecause that is how they got here, they attacked it. They called it \nuseless and venal. Attitudes such as that, which have been observed in \nthe past, can sometimes become self-fulfilling prophesies. But if you \ncome here with a dedication to hard work, an open mind, some good \nfaith, and to make progress, that, too, can become a self-fulfilling \nprophecy.\n  In 1837, Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his Phi Beta Kappa address to \nHarvard, said:\n\n       Meek young men grow up in libraries, believing it their \n     duty to accept the views which Cicero, which Locke, which \n     Bacon have given, forgetful that Cicero, Locke, and Bacon \n     were only young men in libraries when they wrote those books.\n\n  I am told today by the Senate Historian that there have been over \n1,900 Senators who have served. I have served with more than 320 of \nthem, and I have learned something from every one of them. As a matter \nof fact, I was also given a piece of discouraging information as well; \nthat only 19 Senators in the history of the United States of America \nhave ever served as long as I have, one of whom is in this Chamber. As \nI said, I have learned a lot from them, and I can tell you from \nexperience that most of them are only seen as giants in the hindsight \nof history. At the time, they were legislators trying to do their best.\n  I look in my desk and I see the names carved in the drawer. Maybe the \npublic doesn't know how much like kids we are. We get here, and we come \nover here after the Senate is closed and we sit there, somewhat \nembarrassed, and we actually carve our names in the drawers of the \ndesk, in the bottom. It is a tradition. Maybe there is someone who \ndidn't do it, but I don't know of anyone, even the most sophisticated \namong us. I look in the desk drawer I have and I see names of famous \nDelawareans, such as the longest serving family in the history of the \nState of Delaware--the Bayards. Six have been Senators. But I also see \nthe names of Scoop Jackson and John F. Kennedy and others in my drawer. \nLook in your desk and you will see names you recognize as well, and you \nall know them. Forty years from now, when someone opens your desk and \nlooks at your name, will they think of you the way I think of these \nmen? To me, that is a test we each are going to have to meet.\n  With the gravity of the challenges we face today comes--as every \nsimilar moment in our history--the most significant opportunity for \nchange, the most significant opportunity for progress. I firmly believe \nthis, too, can be an era of legends, of giants. But this much I know: \nOur Nation desperately needs it to be.\n  During my first term in the Senate, when I spoke out in favor of \ncampaign finance reform at a Democratic caucus--and Senator Inouye may \nremember this; he was then Secretary of the Senate--the President pro \ntempore, Jim Eastland, listened intently in what is now called the \nMansfield Room. When I got finished with my impassioned speech about \nthe need for public financing, he stood--and he hardly ever spoke at \nthe caucus, as Senator Inouye will remember--and he always wore a glen \nplaid suit and always had a cigar in his mouth about as big as a rubber \nhose--and he leaned up at the table in the front--and he never stood \ncompletely straight--and he sought recognition and he leaned up, put \nhimself halfway up, took the cigar out of his mouth, and he said:\n\n       Joe, they tell me ya'll are the youngest man to ever get \n     elected to this August body--\n\n  I wasn't. There was one younger than me popularly elected, but I \ndidn't dare correct him. He said:\n\n       Let me tell you something, Joe: Ya'll make many more \n     speeches like you did here today, you're going to be the \n     youngest one-term Senator in the history of the United States \n     of America.\n\n  I walked out of that conference, as I have said to Leader Reid, and \nwalked in here--and we didn't used to have those booths by the phone--\nand Warren Magnuson, who also smoked a cigar, pulled out his cigar and \nsaid: Biden, come here. Can you imagine calling to a Senator and \nsaying: Come here. He said: Stop this stuff. I didn't work this darned \nhard--a little different language used--I didn't work this darned hard \nthe past 30 years to have some sniveling little competitor get the same \namount of money as me. Stop it. Stop it.\n  I walked away as politely and as quickly as I could. I never \ndreamed--I never dreamed--that nearly four decades later I would be \nelected to a seventh term to the Senate of the United States. Never, \never dreamed it. Thirty-six years ago, the people of Delaware gave me, \nas they have given you in your States, a rare and sacred opportunity to \nserve them. As I said, after the accident, I was prepared in 1973 to \nwalk away from that opportunity. But men such as Ted Kennedy and Mike \nMansfield and Hubert Humphrey and Fritz Hollings and Dan Inouye \nconvinced me to stay--to stay 6 months, Joe. Remember that? Just stay 6 \nmonths. And one of the true giants of the Senate, who thank God is \nstill with us, Robert C. Byrd, without any fanfare, in late December, \nin a cold, driving rain, drove to Wilmington, DE, stood outside a \nmemorial service at a Catholic Church for my deceased wife and \ndaughter, soaking wet in that cold rain, and never once came to see me, \njust to show his respect, and then got back in the automobile and drove \nback to Washington, DC.\n  This is a remarkable place, gentlemen and ladies. And as I healed, \nthis place became my second family, more than I suspect it is for most. \nI needed it, and for that I will be forever grateful--forever grateful. \nSo to the people of Delaware, who have given me the honor of serving \nthem, there is no way I can ever express to them how much this meant to \nme. To my staff, past and present, and all those on the floor,\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\npast and present, dedicated to making this institution run, including \nthe young pages, wide-eyed and hopefully going home and wanting to come \nback someday in our spots, thank you for everything you have done for \nme. I suspect you have done for me more than you have done for most.\n  To my children, Hunter and Ashley and Beau, if I was nothing else, I \nwould be content to be the father of such wonderful people. To my \ngrandchildren, who constantly remind me why the decisions we make in \nthis August body are so important, and to my Jill, you once saved my \nlife, and you are my life today, I thank all of you. I thank all my \ncolleagues for making my Senate service possible and this next chapter \nin my career in life so hopeful.\n  I came here to fight for civil rights. In my office now sits that \ngrand conference table that once was used to fight against civil \nrights, and I leave here today to begin my service to our Nation's \nfirst African-American President. The arc of the universe is long, but \nit does indeed bend toward justice, and the Senate of the United States \nhas been an incredible instrument in assuring that justice.\n  So although you have not seen the last of me, I say for the last \ntime, and with confidence in all of you, optimism in our future, and a \nheart with more gratitude than I can express, I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I was elected State treasurer at the age \nof 29, 4 years after Joe Biden was elected to the Senate. For the last \n30 years or so, I have had the honor and in some cases the misfortune \nof following him as a speaker, throughout the State of Delaware and in \nsome cases around the country. It is a tough act to follow and I \nwouldn't pretend to be able to do that.\n  Over the last 200 years that we have had a Senator, we have seen any \nnumber of great orators come here and speak in this Chamber, in some \ncases to mesmerize us, in other cases to inspire us and to change our \nminds. Joe has done all of those things again today and he does it \nperhaps as well as anybody.\n  People speak here today, as in the years in the past, and they quote \nChurchill; we quote John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King. I am surprised \nhe didn't quote one of his favorite Irish poets, Seamus Heaney, I \nthink. He quotes him a lot. But the person I think I have heard Joe \nquote the most in his life has been none of those folks, none of those \nIrish poets, but it has been his mom and his dad. I wish I could ask \nfor a show of hands, how many times have you had Joe Biden say to you: \nI give you my word as a Biden. If we could count them all up today in \nthis room and if we could get a dollar a week--maybe we couldn't pay \nfor the stimulus package but make a pretty good downpayment. Many times \nI have heard him say--he quotes his dad--I will paraphrase it: It is a \nlucky man who gets up in the morning, puts his feet on the ground, and \nknows the work he is about to do has consequence, substance, is \nmeaningful.\n  A guy doesn't turn out like this by chance--to become the youngest, \nnot only one of the two youngest Senators elected in the history of our \ncountry, he is also the youngest seven-term Senator in the history of \nour country.\n  His mom is still living. She lives in a property close to Joe and \nJill's home. His dad is deceased. But I know we owe them a huge debt of \ngratitude because the values they instilled in him, the need to serve \nother people, and the Golden Rule. This is a man of deep faith. You \nwouldn't always know it, he doesn't talk a lot about it, but this is a \nperson whose life and values were shaped as much by his family and his \nfaith as anybody I know. I know his parents taught him to treat other \npeople the way he would like to be treated. That led to his great \ninvolvement and support of the Civil Rights Act and underlies \neverything he does today.\n  All of us have families. All of us love our families. I do not think \nI know anybody in public life or outside of public life who is more \ncommitted to and who loves his family any more than Joe: Jill, his \nfirst wife Neilia, whom I never had the pleasure of knowing--I tell you \nhe has a wonderful wife Jill. It is clear he loves her with all his \nheart. The three kids are not kids anymore; they are in their thirties \nand twenties. Beau is over in Iraq today serving in the National Guard. \nBut there is an extraordinary bond between a father and a child.\n  It has been said the greatest gift that a father can give to his \nchildren is to love their mother. He doesn't just love their mother, he \nloves the kids, he loves the grandchildren. This is a loving guy with a \nfamily that is as strong as any I have ever seen. You heard the old \nsaying I would rather see a sermon than hear a sermon. When it comes to \nfamily values, you see the sermon. You don't just hear it, you see it. \nWe see the sermon.\n  In politics, I like to say our friends come and go but our enemies \naccumulate. When you think about the people Joe has talked about here \ntoday, from Eastland to Jesse Helms to Senator Thurmond--he didn't \nmention Phil Gramm--you would never imagine a guy who has his \nconvictions, his philosophy, his commitment to civil rights and other \ncauses--you would never imagine he would become their friend, \nconfidant--and not so much for them to change him, but for him to \nchange them and in fact this country.\n  Joe, you have been part of the glue that holds this place together. \nAs we have said goodbye to a lot of good men in the last several weeks, \nit is a real sort of sense, not of bitterness, not of sweetness, but \nmaybe bittersweet that we say goodbye to you today. The 8 years I have \nbeen here, I know there have been a lot of times when we sought to try \nto make sure the Vice President didn't come and cast a tie-breaking \nvote. My guess is in the time you serve for Vice President--4 years or \n8 years, however long it is going to be; I hope it is 8--my guess is \nthere will be times we orchestrate the votes so you will have to be \nhere. I don't know if we can do it in a way that will allow you to come \nto the floor and give another speech like you have just given. Maybe we \ncan figure it out.\n  But as a friend, as we say goodbye and move on to this next \nassignment in life: God bless our President-elect. He has made a \nterrific choice not just from Delaware, which is hugely happy and \nexcited, but I think for our country and I think for the world. But I \nwant to say, for the last 8 years, thank you for being my friend, my \nconfidant. Thank you for being my adviser. Thank you for asking for my \nadvice from time to time and listening to my advice. To your staff that \nis gathered here today, and your family up in the balcony, thank you \nfor sharing with us a wonderful human being, for nurturing and bringing \nhim along. The staff has provided such terrific support, almost like an \nextension of my own staff. We love your family and we love your staff \nand we are going to miss you. Thank you for always having my back, and \nfor looking out for me and for making possible the extraordinary \nexperience as a junior Senator for the last 8 years.\n  I understand your resignation becomes effective, is it 5 p.m. today? \nAs I look at this clock here, I know for the next 5 hours, 49 minutes, \nI get to be a junior Senator and then after that I move up in the \npecking order. But I will always be your junior Senator and your \ncolleague and I hope your friend. God bless you in all your life ahead \nand thank you for all you have done for us and for me especially. God \nbless you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you very much. You have been one of my closest \nfriends and confidants and you will continue to be, and I appreciate \nyour sentiment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am only going to take a few minutes, but I want to say a \nfew things about my friend Joe Biden, certainly from this side of the \naisle.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Joe Biden as \nhis\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nservice in the Senate representing the great state of Delaware ends and \nhis service as our Nation's next Vice President is about to begin.\n  Like everybody else, when I think of Joe Biden, I first think of his \nfamily. As important as the Senate has been in defining his illustrious \ncareer, the man we know has been defined by his wife Jill and his \nchildren. Senator Biden, were he never elected to the Senate or the \nVice-Presidency, has succeeded and accomplished much in this life when \nyou see the tremendous job he and Jill did in raising Beau, Hunter, and \nAshley.\n  Today, however, our remarks will focus on Senator Biden's legislative \nand other professional accomplishments. I can tell you firsthand that \nanyone would be hard pressed to find a more distinguished and effective \nlegislator. In an age of endless cynicism toward our elected officials, \nlet there be no doubt that the word ``distinguished'' is a truly \nfitting description of this extraordinary public servant. He is a \nfriend of mine. I have been privileged to serve 32 years side by side \nwith Joe Biden on the Judiciary Committee and I have nothing but \nrespect for him.\n  Most of our work together was on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwhere Senator Biden served as chairman from 1985 until 1995. I served \nas ranking member for many of those years, and when I first served as \nchairman from 1995 to 1997, I had the good fortune of having Joe Biden \nas my partner on the committee, serving as ranking member. It was on \nthe committee that I saw Senator Biden at work and learned a great \ndeal.\n  I can think of no chairman of the Judiciary Committee who had a \nbetter sense of what he wanted to accomplish--a vision for the \ncommittee--than Senator Joe Biden. No one was more interested in the \ndetails of legislating than he was. The Violence Against Women Act, The \nViolent Crime Control Act of 1994, the drug czar's office and the COPS \nprogram all would not exist today were it not for his talents and \nleadership.\n  In one of my proudest moments as a U.S. Senator, I was joined by \nSenator Biden here on the Senate floor to hail the passage of the Adam \nWalsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which President Bush signed into \nlaw a week later, June of 2006. Senator Biden and I had introduced the \nbill only a year earlier, and we worked hard to see its passage in a \nrelatively short amount of time. The bill was very significant and the \nlaw has changed the landscape with regard to sentencing, monitoring, \nadjudicating, registering and tracking sexual predators.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Biden mastered the \nSenate's dying art of legislating because he valued legislating. Joe \nBiden is not just a speech giver--though he is good at giving a long \nspeech--he is an exceptional legislator. Majority Leader George \nMitchell said he was the best Senate floor strategist he had ever \nworked with, and coming from George Mitchell, that's saying something, \nbecause George Mitchell was one of the best Majority Leaders we have \nhad in the Senate. There are few like Senator Biden left in the Senate \nwho have the skill and patience to carefully and thoughtfully develop \nan idea for policy reform; craft what he believes to be the ideal bill; \npatiently--and with the long view--establish a record through hearings, \nreports, and media engagement; build institutional support by \ncorralling colleagues and crafting compromise; and skillfully managing \nthe bill's passage on the floor.\n  Political pundits and the media have for decades tried to get a \nhandle on what makes Joe Biden tick. Too often, they settled for the \neasy answer--Joe's ``a wild stallion that never felt the bridle'' or he \nis an ``unguided missile.'' That's nonsense. Senator Biden has proven \nhimself to be an accomplished statesman with enormous personal vision.\n  I am proud he is going to be our next Vice President of the United \nStates serving with, as he said, the first African-American President. \nWe are all proud of that and we should be, and we should do everything \nin our power to help.\n  No one better captured the Joe Biden we know than the author Richard \nBen Cramer, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his political reporting of \nthe 1988 Presidential race in the classic book ``What It Takes.''\n  As a kid growing up in Scranton, ``there was (to be perfectly blunt, \nas Joe would say) a breathtaking element of balls.'' That was Richard \nBen Cramer, not me. ``Joe Biden had balls. Lot of times more balls than \nsense. . . . What he was, was tough from the neck up. He knew what he \nwanted to do and he did it.'' Later in life as a lawyer, he applied \nthat mental toughness and, another quote, ``cocky self-possession'' to \nhis chosen career--politics. There, Joe Biden would envision what he \nwanted to achieve and how he wanted to achieve it. While the experts, \nstaffers, and consultants we Senators come to rely on would buzz around \nhim with advice and direction, Joe Biden would listen but know in his \ngut what to do. ``Joe could see the thing whole thing in his head, and \nwhat's more, he could talk it.''\n  In the end, what Joe Biden chose to take on and how he succeeded all \nrested on Joe's certainty. As Cramer wrote, ``Once he'd seen it . . . \nhe knew what was supposed to happen . . . Hell, it was a done deal . . \n. and then it wasn't imagination, or even balls. Not to Joe Biden. It \nwas destiny.''\n  That is from ``What It Takes,'' Richard Ben Cramer's book from 1993.\n  The record of Joe Biden's life is clear. Mr. Vice President-elect, \nyou have had ``what it takes'' to be an accomplished Senator, and you \nhave ``what it takes'' to be our Nation's Vice President.\n  Your tenure here has been marked with hard work, and much success, \nmuch pain, and much grief, much difficulty. Yet you remain humble and \nhardworking. The skills and abilities our Lord bestowed on you have \nbeen used mightily by you. Your integrity, truthfulness, and passion \nwill continue to serve you and this great country of ours.\n  I thank you for your service, and thank you for your friendship, \nthank you for your continued sacrifice on behalf of this great Nation, \nand I tell you personally that I love you. I appreciate you very much. \nI care for you. I care for your family. We are going to be helpful to \nyou as Vice President of the United States. And we hope you will not \nscrew it up too badly there. We are going to be right there with you, \nif we can.\n  Joe, we are proud of you and we ask God to bless you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like, if I may, Mr. President, to thank my friend \nfrom Utah for his kind comments. We have been buddies for a long time. \nI hope that continues in my new job.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is hard to imagine, at least for me it is hard to \nimagine, the Senate without Joe Biden--at least as a Senator on the \nfloor, in the thick of the fray. That is not just because he came here \nas a kid, so to speak, not just because he chaired some of this \ninstitution's most important committees, but it is because of this \nparticular moment that we find ourselves in, in the country.\n  This is the kind of moment Joe Biden loves to be in the middle of, \nlegislating. Obviously, we take a very special pride in knowing that \none of our own is about to become Vice President. While this makes him \nPresident of the Senate, for once I actually wish Dick Cheney was right \nand that Joe was still a part of the legislative branch. But, make no \nmistake, the Senate's loss is President Obama's and the country's gain. \nJoe will bring a terrific strategic thinking and legislative experience \nto the challenges we face.\n  This is a special moment in so many ways, and it is an emotional \nmoment. I have known Joe since we were both kids, in terms of this \njourney, since we first ran for office in 1972. We learned about each \nother then, reading the press clips of each other's races, hearing \nstories from mutual friends and joint campaign workers. The \nconventional wisdom of that year is that Joe couldn't win his race \nagainst an incumbent, Hale Boggs, who had been in office and winning \nelections in Delaware for 6 years. I, on the other hand, was favored to \nwin mine. True to conventional wisdom, it turned out exactly the \nopposite way.\n  To this day, I like to kid our longtime friend, our New Jersey \nfriend, John Marttila, who was deeply involved in both of our races \nback then, that if he had just spent a little more\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\ntime in Lowell, MA, and a little less time in Wilmington, things might \nhave turned out differently. But for Joe and me, both in politics and \nin life, things have actually turned out pretty well, and I have loved \nsharing this journey with him.\n  In a lot of ways, Joe Biden is an old-fashioned kind of guy. He lives \nlife and politics by what a lot of people think are the old rules, \nregrettably: Unfailingly loyal, your word is your bond, you tell the \ntruth, you act on principle not ideology, and you keep faith with \nfamily and home, you never forget where your roots are or who you are, \nand you are consistent and honest in all your endeavors.\n  Joe Biden is all of that and a lot more in many personal ways. He is \na patriarch to the core, in the best time-honored understanding of the \nmeaning of that word. He never smiles more broadly or picks up more \npersonal energy than when he is talking about his family. Frankly, to \nknow Joe Biden is also to know a lot of Bidens.\n  Dozens of our colleagues, hundreds over the years, know that if you \ncall Joe Biden with a late-night question, the odds are pretty high you \nare going to find him on that train, riding Amtrak home to be there \nwith Jill, Beau, Hunter, Ashley, and the grandchildren. There is \nsomething pretty great about a Senator who makes sure to stop by his \nmom's house for ice cream or a kiss good night on his way home. That is \nexactly what Joe Biden would do with his 92-year-old spitfire mother, \nJean Finnegan Biden. It is the lessons of that big, Irish, warm, \nprotective family that Joe brought to the Senate. He is the big brother \nwhose sister Val remembers him as her protector on the playground, the \ndad whom Beau and Hunter remember urging them to get up when they got \nknocked down on the soccer field, the boss who calls a staff member \nwhen they have a sick parent or who threatens to fire you if you miss \nyour kid's birthday because you are working late for him.\n  This is someone in the Senate who had a reputation for not just \ntalking about family values but living them. As Joe Biden said so \nmovingly this morning: He saw the Senate as an extended family and here \nhe applied the lessons his dad taught him in Scranton, that everything \ncomes down to dignity and respect. He has always respected the \ninstitution, and he always respected the dignity and individuality of \nevery single one of his colleagues.\n  One of the great stories that Joe told today, which has always spoken \nto me personally, is one that tells a lot about ushering in a new era \nof bipartisanship. When Joe first arrived in the Senate, he complained \nto the majority leader, Mike Mansfield, about a speech that another new \nSenator named Jesse Helms had made. Mansfield told him: Joe, understand \none thing. Everyone is sent here for a reason; because there is \nsomething in them that their folks like. Don't question their motive.\n  Every one of us who has worked with Joe Biden knows how much he took \nthis lesson to heart and how much we gain by applying it today. His \nexample is clear. If you treat people decently, look for the best in \nthem, you can sit down and work through divisive issues; not just score \nmore political points but actually get something done.\n  Joe likes to talk about his first impression of Jesse Helms, but he \nis often too modest to talk about what happened later. Some people \nmight have been surprised that Joe Biden, Jesse Helms, and I teamed up \nin the fight against global HIV/AIDS. Some never would have believed \nthat together we could bring about what is today the largest public \nhealth expenditure or effort by any single country in world history. \nThat is what happens when Joe Biden takes to heart the message of a \nwise warhorse such as Mike Mansfield, looks past the stereotypes, past \nthe party labels, and throws out all the ideological language to find \nthe common ground.\n  Nowhere did I see that more than on the issue of crime. Coming from \nthe vantage point of being a prosecutor in the 1970s, who then became a \nSenator in the 1980s, I can tell you there was no more divisive, ugly \nwedge and emotionally charged issue than crime until Joe Biden and the \n1994 crime bill. Joe put an end to the ``Willie Hortonizing'' of this \nissue. We worked closely together and put more cops on the streets of \nAmerica. I remember Joe's passion and tenacity on that bill.\n  It was a huge, landmark piece of legislation, complicated, divisive--\nbut not so because of Joe's enormous skill that shepherded it through \nthe ideological minefields that otherwise might have been impossible. \nJoe was simply not going to accept defeat. He made dozens of trips to \nthe White House, had dozens of meetings with congressional leadership, \nall to find a way to create common ground and ultimately pass a bill \nthat resulted in the lowest crime rates in a generation. Every step of \nthe way he sought out friends, he crossed the aisle, he worked the \nprocess and built allies and invited them to share not just in the work \nbut also to share in the credit, which is, in the end, the best way to \nget things done here. That is leadership in the Senate and that is \nexactly how we make progress.\n  He also brought great skill to his stewardship in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I served on that committee for the full 25 years I \nhave been here, all of it with Joe Biden and some of it with Joe Biden \nas our chair. Let me give an example.\n  When Russian tanks rolled into Georgia, respecting Georgia's \nsovereignty became a sound bite for a lot of people, but for Joe Biden \nit was a moment to pick up a phone, call up an old friend, someone he \nhad met as a young Parliamentarian, who was then in his twenties. So \nJoe Biden got on a plane, took that flight all night, and sat on a \nhilltop in Georgia with his old friend, Mikheil Saakashvili, and \ntogether they talked to not just about the security of Georgia but the \nsecurity of a man who was then in very real danger, a man Joe Biden \nbelieved was willing to die for democracy.\n  This is just one small example of the emotional intelligence and \npersonal touch that had been the calling cards of Joe's career in \npublic life for decades.\n  As we all know, Joe is blessed with a big, all-encompassing Irish \nsense of humor, an ability to have fun amidst all the rest of the \ntensions and stress and chaos. We still joke about the trip we took \nwith Chuck Hagel to a forward operating base in Kunar Province in \nAfghanistan in the middle of winter and our helicopter wound up getting \ncaught in a blizzard. We had just received a briefing that, where the \nmodern road system ends, the Taliban begins. Lo and behold, the next \nthing we knew, we had a forced landing high on a mountaintop on a dirt \nroad with nothing around us. We sat around swapping stories for a while \nand came up with a few contingency plans in case the Taliban attacked. \nFirst, we thought--use the hot air of three talkative Senators and the \nhelicopter will rise. Then we figured failing that we will talk the \nTaliban to death. Ultimately, we figured we would let Joe Biden lead a \nsnowball charge and that would be the end of the deal. But our superb \nmilitary protectors, efficient as always, soon had us out of there, \nsafe and rescued, and we have had a good time laughing about it ever \nsince.\n\n  Later, when I told him my plan to have him lead the brigade, Joe, \nreliving his Blue Hen college football glory days, flexed his right arm \nand said in that inimitable Biden way: The Taliban? They are not worth \nmy rocket arm.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Joe applied a no-\nholds-barred, unvarnished truth-telling to many politically sensitive \nissues. In the middle of his own Presidential campaign, he didn't \nhesitate to ask whether our counterterrorism policy had turned a deadly \nserious but manageable threat, a small number of radical groups that \nhate America, into a 10-foot-tall existential monster that dictates \nnearly every move we make. It was not a poll-tested or popular \nquestion, but it was a sign of leadership and a mark of vision that \nwill serve America well when he takes the oath as Vice President of the \nUnited States.\n  Let me share one last story involving my senior Senator, Ted Kennedy, \nwho has been an incredible mentor, both to me and to Joe, since we both \ngot into this business.\n  Years ago, when Ted Kennedy joined the Armed Services Committee, \nSenate rules dictated that Ted had to step down from the Judiciary \nCommittee. That would have made Joe the chairman. So Joe had all the \ninterest in the world for that to happen. But, instead--and I suppose I \nshould say what\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nSenator in their early forties, presented with the choice, wouldn't \nhave loved to have had the responsibility of the Judiciary Committee. \nBut Joe Biden went to the caucus and he gave them an ultimatum. He said \npoint blank: This is ridiculous. I wouldn't serve as a chairman unless \nI have Teddy Kennedy on my side on this committee.\n  Make no mistake, Ted Kennedy moved to Armed Services, but he stayed \non the Judiciary Committee. Together, they fought some of the greatest \nconfirmation battles in the history of the Supreme Court. No one can \nimagine the Judiciary Committee without Ted Kennedy's decades of focus \nand fire. But the Senate should know it would not have been possible if \nit had not been for Joe Biden's youthful challenge to the leadership to \nget him to be able to stay there.\n  Joe is one of the people in the Senate whom I have had the privilege \nof enjoying now for a quarter of a century and one of the people, \nobviously, I have enjoyed serving with the most. We have been through a \nlot. We have shared a lot, good and bad, ups and downs. What is \nexciting is, frankly, we still have a lot more to come. While Joe is \nmaking that short ride up to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, I \nknow there is one thing that is not going to change. We are always \ngoing to be able to count on him to be the same Joe Biden, and I know \nwe can take that to the bank. When Joe works with us in these next \nmonths--and he will work with us intensely--and when he says to you: I \ngive you my word as a Biden that this is going to happen, we can take \nthat to the bank and know it will happen.\n  We are very proud of our colleague, Senator Biden. We wish him well \nand Godspeed. We look forward to seeing him as the presiding official \nof this body, but, more importantly, we look forward to working with \nhim on the enormous challenges this country faces.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to honor my good friend and our \ndistinguished colleague, Joe Biden, who will be ending his remarkable \nSenate career to assume the office of the Vice President of the United \nStates. It has been my great privilege to serve with Joe Biden in the \nSenate for 32 years. He and I have served together on the Foreign \nRelations Committee for all of the 30 years that I have been a member \nof that panel. He entered the Senate as the sixth youngest person ever \nelected to this body, having been elected at age 29 and seated soon \nafter he reached the constitutionally required 30 years of age. He \nleaves as the longest serving Senator in the history of his State and \nthe 14th longest serving Senator in U.S. history. He has cast more \nSenate votes than all but nine other Senators in history.\n  Joe Biden comes from a modest Irish-Catholic background. He started \nout in Scranton, PA, where his father was a used car salesman and his \nmother was a homemaker. The oldest of four children, Joe and his family \nmoved to Claymont, DE, where his father had found a better job. It may \nbe hard for many to believe today, but as a teenager, Joe had trouble \nspeaking because he had a stutter. But showing the grit and \ndetermination we all have come to know, he undertook to give a speech \nto his entire school as a way to force himself to overcome his \nimpediment. At the University of Delaware, he majored in history and \npolitical science, and he received a law degree from Syracuse \nUniversity.\n  He started practicing law and worked as a public defender, but \nperhaps because his grandfather had been a State senator in \nPennsylvania, he was soon attracted to politics. At the young age of \n27, he was elected to the County Council of New Castle County in \nDelaware. Two years later he surprised all the political experts in his \nState, as well as his opponent, by defeating an incumbent Senator in a \npresumably ``safe'' seat. The margin of victory was just over 3,000 \nvotes, but Joe went on to increase his vote totals in subsequent \nreelection races\n  Although Joe was elected at an especially young age, it would be \nwrong to say that he led a charmed life. In fact, just the opposite is \nthe case. Just weeks after his election, his wife Neilia and his \nyoungest child Naomi were killed in a car crash while Christmas \nshopping. His two other children, Beau and Hunter, were critically \ninjured. Naturally, the tragedy was devastating to Joe, and he \nconsidered dropping the Senate seat to tend to his stricken family. The \ndistinguished majority leader at the time, Mike Mansfield, persuaded \nJoe to reconsider, and he took the oath of office at his sons' hospital \nbedside.\n  It was the start of a long career of dedicated service in the Senate. \nIt also was the start of a tradition for which Joe has become famous--\nhis regular commute on Amtrak from Wilmington down to Washington when \nthe Senate was in session.\n  When I arrived in the Senate 4 years later, Joe had already \nestablished a reputation as a dynamic presence on Capitol Hill. In \n1979, I joined him on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he had \nbecome a member in 1975. We have served together ever since, and I have \nbenefitted greatly from Joe's friendship during that time. I have \nalways believed that foreign policy is most effective when it is done \nin a bipartisan manner, and in Joe I found an able partner willing to \nwork across the aisle to achieve important victories on behalf of the \ncountry and the American people. Some of the battles have not been \neasy. I recall, for instance, the difficult job we had in achieving \npassage of the Chemical Weapons Convention during President Clinton's \nadministration. We celebrated another major victory last year with the \npassage of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act. Recently, \nour collaboration led to the joint sponsoring and introduction of the \nEnhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act. We have worked closely on \nlegislation related to Iraq, Afghanistan, climate change, tropical \nforest conservation, international violence against women, the control \nof global pathogens, and numerous arms control measures.\n  Each of us has twice been chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and we and our staffs have worked with special purpose \nduring those times. We share the belief that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee occupies a special place in history and is an essential \ncomponent of a successful U.S. foreign policy. It is because of Joe's \nwide experience, keen mind, steady hand and strong advocacy that he was \nchosen by our Committee colleague, Senator Obama, to be his vice \npresidential running mate.\n  While I will deeply miss working with Joe on the committee, I look \nforward to joining with him to achieve further accomplishments while he \nis vice president. Besides a new commuting routine, he will face many \nchallenges, and I know he will gain strength from the support and \naffection of his family: his lovely wife Jill, their daughter Ashley, \nand his two sons, Beau and Hunter, as well as their five grandchildren. \nI wish them all the best as they begin this exciting new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on this cold January morning, I am being \nkept warm by four glorious words that keep running through my mind--\nthose four words are: ``Vice President Joe Biden.'' I love the sound of \nthat. It is music to my ears.\n  I have known Joe Biden for nearly four decades, since he was first \nelected to the Senate in 1972. I have been enriched by his friendship. \nI have appreciated his commitment to public service. I have watched his \nwork as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary. I have admired the enthusiasm and \ndedication he has brought to his work every single day he has been a \nU.S. Senator.\n  His years of service in this institution will be one of his greatest \nassets in the years ahead. During his tenure in the Senate, Joe has \ngained a priceless working understanding of the importance of our \nconstitutional systems of checks and balances and separation of powers. \nHe has stood on this floor and argued long and hard--with fire in his \nbelly--against executives of both political parties when he felt it was \nin the best interests of this Nation. We have all watched him, time and \nagain, pacing this floor, speaking in that rhythmic Joe Biden way--\ndrawing us in with a shout and then punctuating his point in whispered \ntones. I can see him now, putting the White House on notice, and \ndefending the advice and\n\n[[Page S411]]\n\nconsent authority of Senators. Joe has seen how this part of the \ngovernment--the people's branch--lives. He will assume his new job \nfresh from membership in the world's greatest deliberative body. Those \nSenate years will, I believe, serve him, the country, and the people, \nwell.\n  Senator Biden is moving on, and while I regret losing him as a \ncolleague here, I am heartened by the experience and wisdom he takes to \nhis new duties. I believe that he will be a great Vice President. My \ngood friend and former colleague, President-elect Obama showed \noutstanding judgment when he selected Senator Joe Biden to be his \nrunning mate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the regular order is that Hillary Clinton \nwas to be recognized at 11 o'clock. There are a lot of people who want \nto say some things about Senator Biden and Hillary Clinton. We have \nvotes scheduled at noon. So I would ask the Chair, under the order, to \nrecognize the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S411-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S411-S418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAREWELL ADDRESS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am once again, and, if confirmed, for \nthe last time, honored, privileged, and proud to address you as a \nSenator from the great State of New York; to stand in this Chamber; to \nbe amongst my colleagues with whom I have won legislative victories, \nsuffered defeats, and made lasting friendships; to serve my fellow New \nYorkers; to speak amidst the echoes of historic and fiery debates which \nhave shaped the destiny and promoted the progress of this great Nation \nfor more than two centuries.\n  And I am gratified by the overwhelming support and vote of confidence \nfrom my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and I look \nforward to working with them and continuing the conversation we began \non Tuesday. And of course, I am so eager to continue working closely \nwith my friend, and the Vice President-elect, Joe Biden.\n  I have loved being part of the Senate, working alongside public \nservants of both parties who bring to bear their expertise and \nenthusiasm to the difficult, painstaking, and occasionally contentious \nwork of turning principle into policy and policy into law. And I assure \nyou I will be in frequent consultation and conversation with my \ncolleagues here in the Senate.\n  I also have been so fortunate to have what is, objectively, the best \nSenate staff, both in Washington and in New York that has ever been \nassembled, led and inspired by my Chief of Staff and friend, Tamera \nLuzzatto.\n  In outlining the purpose of the world's greatest deliberative body, \nthe authors of the Federalist Papers wrote that in part the Senate's \nrole would be to avert the consequences of ``sudden and violent \npassions'' and ``intemperate and pernicious resolutions.''\n  Well, I think each of us at times has wished that the Senate would be \never so slightly less ``temperate.'' But it is to the lasting credit \nand everlasting wisdom of our Founders that we come together, \nrepresentatives of every State, members of both parties and neither \nparty, in the hopes of finding common ground on which to build a \nstronger, safer, smarter, fairer, and more prosperous country for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  As I look back on 8 years of service here, and as I have spoken with \nmany of you in recent days about the challenges that lie ahead, I find \nmyself reflecting on the work we have done as well as the work that \nremains at this moment of tumult and transformation.\n  I asked the people of New York to take a chance on me. To grant me \ntheir trust and their votes. In the years since, as our economy has \ngrown more interconnected and the world more interdependent, and as New \nYork has faced challenges amongst the greatest in our State and \nNation's history, I have worked hard to keep faith with my fellow New \nYorkers.\n  I remember when I first arrived in the Senate. There were a few \nskeptics. Many wondered what kind of Senator I would be. I wondered \nwhere the elevators were. But I believed my charge on behalf of the \npeople of New York and the Nation was to devote myself fully to the \ntask at hand. So I got to work.\n  No sooner had I taken office, 9 short months into my first term, the \nNation was attacked on 9/11. The toll was devastating and New York \nwould bear the heaviest burden. Nearly 3,000 lives were lost. The World \nTrade Center lay in ruins. A toxic cloud of debris and poison rained \ndown over first responders, building and construction trades workers, \nresidents, students, and others.\n  We all remember as citizens and Senators the sense of common purpose \nthat arose as if to extinguish the hate and violence that took so many \ninnocent lives. In particular, I want to point out the many kindnesses \nof my fellow members who offered their words, and deeds, in support of \nthe people of New York.\n  In one moving gesture, Senators sent staff members to help answer the \nringing phones in our office as New Yorkers struggled to track down \nfamily members and turned to our offices for help. I am also grateful \nto Senator Robert Byrd who said at my State's hour of need, ``Think of \nme as the third Senator of New York.''\n  I remember visiting Ground Zero on September 12th with my colleague, \nSenator Schumer, to personally survey the devastation and to thank the \nfirst responders who were working night and day, in danger and \ndifficulty, on what would become known as ``the Pile.''\n  The air was acrid. Thick smoke made it hard to breath.\n  We knew then that there would be lasting health problems for first \nresponders, volunteers, workers, and others who rushed to provide \nassistance following the attacks.\n  Two days later, Senator Schumer and I went to the Oval Office and \nsecured a commitment from President Bush for $20 billion in Federal aid \nfor New York's recovery. In the years that would follow, Senator \nSchumer and I would fight successfully to ensure that money was \ndelivered as promised.\n  In this and every instance, I have been grateful to have had Senator \nCharles Schumer as a partner and ally. New Yorkers could not ask for a \nmore effective and determined Senator to fight for them. And I feel \nfortunate that if I miss seeing my friend Chuck, I can turn on the \ntelevision to catch his latest Sunday press conference.\n  Over the past 7 years, in a fight that continues, we have worked to \nbring business back to downtown and to secure funding for programs to \nprovide health screening, monitoring, and treatment for all those \nsuffering health consequences as a result of the attacks.\n  We have at times clashed with the administration while holding firm \nto our commitment to these efforts.\n  And I have developed close and lasting relationships with many of the \nfamilies of the victims of 9/11 who in their grief have come together \nto fight for health monitoring and for smarter policies to prevent \nfuture attacks.\n  Together, we advocated for the creation of the 9/11 Commission and \nfor the successful implementation of its findings, including funding \nbased on threat assessments and better resources for first responders.\n  These efforts would become a model for finding common ground where \npossible, and standing your ground where necessary. For coordinating \nbetween Federal, State and local governments. For forging new \npartnerships between Government, academia, labor, and the private \nsector, and between members of both parties. A model for decisions \nbased on sound evidence and solid facts, and for achieving results.\n  This is how we approached many of the economic challenges facing New \nYork. So many New Yorkers have lost jobs, or have seen their jobs \npaying less and their benefits covering less than before.\n  I have met many who have lost health care or seen their premiums \ndouble. Who are unable to afford a college education or find good work, \nor pay rising mortgage bills. Who feel as though the hardworking middle \nclass in this country experience the risk but not the reward of a \nglobal economy.\n  So I have worked hard to help make investments in New York's economy, \nby coauthoring a law to expand renewal zone tax incentives for new jobs \nacross upstate New York; helping to raise the minimum wage; working to \nextend unemployment insurance; securing $16.5 billion in transportation\n\n[[Page S412]]\n\nfunding; and increasing funds for Amtrak and high speed rail.\n  We passed legislation to create training programs for green-collar \njobs that will help New York workers fill 21st century jobs that will \nin turn help end our dependence on foreign oil and fight climate \nchange.\n  And we prevented the closure of military installations and \nfacilities, including the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, Rome Labs, \nand the Defense Finances and Accounting Service in Rome, which keep our \nNation safe and employ thousands in New York.\n  Even when we have faced obstacles, we have never given up. We have \noften promoted what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called ``bold, \npersistent experimentation.''\n  We helped expand broadband access across rural areas in the North \nCountry.\n  We secured into law funding to retrofit trucks, school buses and \nother heavy vehicles with new clean diesel technologies developed in \nCorning and Jamestown.\n  In the Finger Lakes and North Country we partnered with eBay and \nlocal universities and companies to create 21st century co-ops that \nhelp small businesses get the micro-loans and training to reach global, \nnot just local, markets.\n  In Rochester, we developed the first-ever Greenprint: a blueprint for \nhow the city can harness its research institutions, innovative \nbusinesses, proactive local leaders, and talented workforce to become \nan even stronger clean energy leader.\n  We brought Artspace to Buffalo and secured funds for cultural centers \nlike Proctors Theater in Schenectady, Stanley theater in Syracuse, and \nthe Strand Theater in Plattsburgh, creating a model for urban \nrevitalization and economic development centered on cultural projects.\n  I have worked to promote heritage tourism in places like Seneca \nFalls, home of the National Women's Hall of Fame and the site of the \nlandmark Women's Rights Convention of 1848.\n  New Jobs for New York brought together more than 2,600 entrepreneurs, \ninvestors, and researchers across New York to obtain capital, share \nideas, and grow New York businesses.\n  Farm to Fork created new markets for New York's agricultural \nproducers in New York's restaurants, schools, and colleges. And our \nannual Farm Day here in the Capitol showcased New York farmers and \nvintners.\n  With investments in transportation to ease congestion and pollution \non Long Island, in Westchester, and in the Hudson Valley, renewable \nenergy and nanotechnology in the capital region's ``Tech Valley,'' \nbiomedical research in Buffalo, Biotechnology in Syracuse, microcredit \nin the Finger Lakes, we have demonstrated to companies large and small \nthat New York, with our talented workforce, world-class educational \ninstitutions, and affordable, safe communities, is a wonderful place to \ndo business. In fact, as you know, I recently took a detour through \nmany of my colleagues' States where I had the opportunity to brag about \nNew York and the kinds of innovative strategies we are putting into \npractice.\n  Some 8 years ago, I first spoke on the Senate floor. The topic was, \nto no one's surprise, health care. And in the years since, I have \ncontinued my commitment to achieving quality, affordable health care \nfor all Americans, no exceptions, no excuses. I was proud to be part of \nthe bipartisan coalition which passed the ``Pediatric Rule'' into law, \nensuring that drugs are tested and labeled for safety and effectiveness \nin children.\n  We have expanded newborn screening. We were able to thwart the Bush \nadministration's attempt to undercut community health clinics and \nbroker a compromise to keep tens of millions of dollars in HIV/AIDS \nfunding in New York through the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Because of our work, groundbreaking legislation now provides respite \ncare for family caregivers; safety measures to prevent tragic injuries \nto children in and around cars; new resources for grandparents and \nother kinship caregivers raising children; and more affordable college \nfor students, particularly nontraditional students who are studying \nwhile working or raising a family.\n  I have also been proud to serve on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the first New York Senator to do so, and to be the only \nMember of the Senate asked to serve on the U.S. Joint Forces Command's \nTransformation Advisory Group.\n  With my fellow members of the committee, we have expanded access to \nTRICARE for all drilling members of the Guard and Reserve; improved \nhealth tracking for servicemembers, especially important in treating \ncomplex, invisible injuries like post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury; and we have passed the first ever expansion of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act so loved ones can take 6 months of \nleave to care for family members injured in service.\n  I have visited with members of the Armed Forces at military \nfacilities across the State, including 10 visits to Fort Drum, and I \nhave met with our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \nthose recovering at Walter Reed and at the military hospital in \nLandstuhl, Germany.\n  From the firefighters, police officers, and citizens who responded on \nSeptember 11, to the men and women of the 10th Mountain Division, known \nas the most deployed division in the army, New Yorkers have answered \nthe call to serve. I have worked hard to honor the principle that we \nshould serve those who serve us.\n  I am proud of the progress we have made, often against tough \nobstacles and even tougher odds, under the leadership of Senator Harry \nReid who has led with intelligence and grit.\n  But of course there remains a long way to go.\n  The House has passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act as well as the \nPaycheck Fairness Act on behalf of women and others seeking equal pay \nfor equal work. I hope we can pass these bills into law. We have moved \nHealth IT ever closer to the finish line, which holds so much potential \nfor reducing waste, errors, and costs while creating whole new data \nsets for research and avenues for innovation.\n  I was dismayed when we were unable to expand the Children's Health \nInsurance Program to millions of uninsured children under the current \nPresident, though I am hopeful we will do so under the leadership of \nPresident-elect Obama. Providing health care for every single child, as \nwe work toward coverage for every single American, is in our duty and \nin our reach.\n  There are so many other works in progress that I hope will be pursued \nby my fellow Senators. And I have spoken with many of you about taking \non the mantle and continuing the work of legislation I have proposed \nover the past 8 years.\n  Finally, to my fellow New Yorkers, I want to express my profound \ngratitude. Thank you. I love being your Senator. Serving you has been \nthe opportunity of a lifetime to continue the work of my life. To \nadvocate on behalf of every single child's chance to live up to his or \nher God- given potential. To fight so that no one feels as though they \nare facing life's challenges alone, as if they were invisible.\n  And we have had fun. 8 State fairs, 45 parades, 62 counties, and more \nthan 4,600 events across the State. But who is counting?\n  As I look back somewhat wistfully, and look forward hopefully, as I \nseek now to serve the country in a new role sustained by the same \nvalues that have motivated me for nearly four decades in public \nservice, I am grateful to my colleagues in the Senate, to the superb \nDemocratic staff, to my own staff here and across New York, to my \nsupporters, and to the people of New York for this opportunity and \nresponsibility that has meant the world to me.\n  I may not have always been a New Yorker. But know that I will always \nbe one. New York, its spirit and its people, will always be part of me \nand part of the work I do.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the \nSenate, albeit if confirmed, in a new capacity, through this \nchallenging time, at this defining moment, always with faith in my \nfellow Americans and optimism for all that we can achieve by working \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, I am so honored to be here at the same time with my \nfriend and colleague whom I admire so much and have such great \naffection for, the Vice President-elect, Joe Biden.\n  I listened with enthusiasm and a lot of sentiment to the speech he \ndelivered\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\na few minutes ago. And the way he evoked the Senate and the \nrelationships that are developed here and the work that is done on \nbehalf of our country was as good as I have ever heard it.\n  So I am deeply honored and privileged to be here with him and to \naddress this Chamber as a Senator from the great State of New York, \nperhaps, if I am confirmed, for the very last time, and particularly \namongst colleagues whom I have come to respect and like so much, and \nwhose work I believe is always in the best interests of their States \nand their country, even when we are not in agreement.\n  I am gratified by the support and vote of confidence I received \nearlier this morning from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And I \nam eager, should I be confirmed, to get to work with the President-\nelect and with the Vice President-elect and with all of you. I have \nloved being in the Senate working alongside public servants of both \nparties who bring their expertise and enthusiasm to the difficult, \npainstaking, and occasionally contentious work of turning principles \ninto policy and policy into law.\n  I also have been fortunate during these past 8 years to have been \nserved by what I objectively believe is the best Senate staff ever in \nWashington and throughout New York. This incredible group of people has \nbeen assembled, led, and inspired by my chief of staff and my friend, \nTamera Luzzatto. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks the names of all of those with whom I \nhave worked over the last 8 years, because I could not be standing here \nspeaking to you were it not for them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ncatalog of the work and achievements which they have brought about.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In the Federalist Papers, we often hear the reference \nto the Senate's role, to avert the consequences of ``sudden and violent \npassions'' and ``intemperate and pernicious resolutions.''\n  Well, to the everlasting credit and wisdom of our Founders, we do \ncome together in an effort to find common ground.\n  As I look back on my 8 years of service, I find myself reflecting on \nthis tiny piece of Senate and American history. Some 10 years ago, I \nasked the people of New York to take a chance on me, to grant me their \ntrust and their votes. In the years since, as our economy has grown \nmore interconnected and the world more interdependent, I have worked to \nkeep faith with my fellow New Yorkers.\n  I well remember, when I first arrived in the Senate, there were a few \nskeptics wondering what I would do and how I would do it. There were \nstalwart supporters and people such as my friend, Senator Barbara \nMikulski, who kind of read me the rules of the road and set me on my \nway.\n  No sooner had I figured out the way around the Senate, actually had \njust moved into my office, which all of our new colleagues will \neventually be able to enjoy, and had gone off on my first August \nrecess. I never, when I was on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, \nunderstood why the Senate went on recess all the time. But after the \nintensity of the workload and the extraordinary pressure of both the \nwork here in Washington and the constituency work in our States, I was \nthrilled and relieved to see that August recess roll around.\n  Shortly after we returned in 2001, our Nation was attacked on 9/11. \nThe toll was devastating and New York bore the heaviest burden. Here I \nwas, a very new Senator, and my city and my State had been devastated. \nNearly 3,000 lives were lost, the World Trade Center in ruins, a toxic \ncloud of debris and poison raining down over our first responders and \nothers.\n  I well remember the rallying of support and sense of common purpose \nthat all of my colleagues and the citizens of all of the States \nrepresented here showed toward me personally and toward New York. Many \nof you offered not only kind words but specific deeds. Senators sent \nstaff members to help answer the ringing phones in our office as New \nYorkers struggled to track down family members or to seek aid.\n  I will never forget Senator Robert Byrd telling me at my State's hour \nof need, ``Think of me as the third Senator from New York.''\n  On September 12, my colleague Chuck Schumer and I went to New York. \nAs you recall, the roads were shut down, there was no way in or out of \nManhattan other than by rail. The skies were clear. So Chuck and I, in \na plane provided by FEMA, were the only ones in the sky that day other \nthan the fighters who were circling overhead.\n  We landed at La Guardia. We got into a helicopter to fly to the \nheliport on the west side of Manhattan, on the west side of the Hudson \nRiver. And then we proceeded, with the Governor, the mayor, and Federal \nofficials to go toward the horror.\n  When we were circling in the helicopter above the World Trade Center \nsite, we could see the smoke still coming up, because it was, of \ncourse, burning. And we could see the very fragile piles of scrap and \nsteel teetering as firefighters, construction workers, tried to \ncontinue their search and rescue effort. That site was as close as I \nhave ever seen to what Dante describes as hell.\n  It became known as ``the Pile.'' Chuck and I and our Government \ncolleagues walked along one of the streets, and could not even see \nbeyond the curtain of blackness, and occasionally breaking through \nwould come a firefighter, totally exhausted after having been on duty \nfor 24 hours, dragging an axe, knowing already that friends and even \nfamily members had been lost.\n  The air was acrid. The thick smoke made it hard to breath. It burned \nyour throat and your lungs. I knew then there would be lasting health \nproblems for everyone who was exposed over any period of time to that \nair that carried so much death and destruction.\n  Two days later, Senator Schumer and I went to the Oval Office and \nsecured a commitment from President Bush for $20 billion in national \naid for New York's recovery. In the years that would follow, he and I \nhave stood side by side to fight for the successful delivery of that \nmoney as promised. In this and every instance, I am grateful to have \nhad Senator Schumer as my partner and my ally. No one fights harder or \nis more determined, and even though I am leaving the Senate and we will \nno longer serve together, I know that whenever I am missing Chuck, all \nI have to do is turn on the television, especially on Sunday in New \nYork.\n  Over the past 7 years, thanks to so many of you, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Cochran, and others on the Appropriations Committee--I see \nSenator Harkin and Senator Murray--you have been there with us as we \nhave worked to recover.\n  I am very proud of the progress that has been made bringing New York \nback and securing funding for the essential programs to provide health \nscreening and monitoring and treatment for all of those who still are \nsuffering.\n  I have developed close and lasting relationships with many of the \nvictims and the families of the victims of 9/11. I applaud and thank \nthem for their courage and their fortitude in not only fighting for the \nhealth benefits that were so desperately needed but for the creation of \nthe 9/11 Commission, for trying to do better on threat assessments, \nmore resources for first responders, committed, despite their grief, to \nsmarter policies to prevent future attacks on our Nation.\n  I see what we did together, and then quickly followed by that the \nanthrax attacks, and I remember with such incredible gratitude how we \nall came together. We should not only come together with that level of \nconnection and commitment in time of disaster. This is an opportunity \nfor us to pull together, with the new administration, to make a real \ndifference, a lasting difference for our Nation. That is what I have \ntried to do as a Senator from New York.\n  It has been a privilege working to improve the upstate economy, \nworking on behalf of the farmers of New York. I remember a short \nconversation one day with Kent Conrad, Byron Dorgan, Tom Harkin, and \nMax Baucus early after my arrival about how I wanted to help \nagriculture in New York.\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\n  They looked at me so quizzically and said, you have farmers in New \nYork? I said, yes, in fact we do, about 30, 40 thousand family farms.\n  Kent Conrad looked at me and he goes, you know, I do not believe that \nat all. So I gave a speech one day with a picture of a cow and said \nthat this is a cow that lives on a farm, and the farm is in New \nYork. We had a lot of fun kidding each other but working hard together.\n\n  I am grateful for the incredible efforts we made to support the \npeople who do the hard work in New York and America, who get up every \nday and do the very best they can.\n  In the Finger Lakes region in the North Country, we helped to expand \nbroadband access and partnered with eBay to create a way for people to \nhave a global marketplace, when before the market was limited to a very \nsmall region of our State.\n  We looked for ways to retrofit trucks and schoolbuses and other heavy \nvehicles with new clean diesel technologies developed by two great \ncompanies in New York, in Corning and Jamestown, to clean up our \nenvironment.\n  We created the first ever greenprint for Rochester--a blueprint, \nreally, for how the city can harness its extraordinary research \ninstitutions and their business leadership and others to come up with a \nway to be a clean energy leader.\n  We worked across the State to target investments from Bioinformatics \nin Buffalo to cultural icons such as the Stanley Theater in Utica. I \ntook special pleasure in working with tourism because New York is such \na great place of historic culture that I believed it needed to be given \nmore support. For me, going to Seneca Falls, the home of the National \nWomen's Hall of Fame and site of the landmark Women's Rights \nConvention, the first in the world in 1848, was a labor of love.\n  There is a lot to look back on with great nostalgia and a lot of \nexcitement, but I want to look forward now because we are at a turning \npoint. I know that very well, as all of you do. Our challenge will be \nto come together, putting aside partisan differences and even, insofar \nas we can, geographic differences to meet the challenges of our time. I \nknow our two leaders are struggling to do that as we speak. But I think \nthis could be one of the golden eras of the history of the Senate. This \ncould be a time when people will look back and say: You know, you never \ncan count America out. Whenever the chips are down, we always rise to \nthe occasion. We figure out a way forward and then we make life better \nfor our people. We extend peace and prosperity and progress throughout \nthe world. I am very excited about what can happen in the next 4 years. \nThere is a lot of work ahead of us, but I know the people in this \nChamber are more than up to it.\n  Finally, to my fellow New Yorkers, I wish to express my profound \ngratitude. I loved being your Senator. Serving you has been the \nopportunity of a lifetime. It gave me the chance to continue the work \nof my life, to advocate on behalf of every single child's chance to \nlive up to his or her God-given potential, to fight hard for those who \ntoo often do feel invisible, to remedy wrongs, as I hope we will do \neither today or in the next few days to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Act as well as the Paycheck Fairness Act, to do what we know will \ngive our fellow Americans a better shot at the kind of future that is \nwithin their grasp.\n  I have had a lot of fun: 8 State fairs, 45 parades, 62 counties, more \nthan 4,600 events across the State. I look back wistfully, and I look \nforward hopefully. I now, if confirmed, will have the high honor of \nserving our country in a new role, but I will be sustained and directed \nby the same values that have motivated me for nearly four decades in \npublic service.\n  So to my colleagues in the Senate, thank you. You have been wonderful \nteachers and mentors and very good friends. And to the superb \nDemocratic staff and their Republican counterparts who keep this \nChamber going day-in and day-out no matter how late we are here and how \nlong the workload turns out to be and to my own staff here and across \nNew York, to my supporters, and, most of all, to the people of the \ngreat Empire State, I may not have always been a New Yorker, but I know \nI always will be one. New York, its spirit, and its people will always \nbe part of me and of the work I do.\n  I look forward to continuing my association with this body. We have \nmuch to do over in Foggy Bottom. We need your help to kind of clear up \nthe fog, to give us a chance to operate on all cylinders with the \ndirection and the resources and the improved management techniques I \nhope to bring to the job.\n  This is a challenging and defining moment, but I will always keep \nfaith in this body and in my fellow Americans.

That has been the hallmark of her tenure: \n     Senator Clinton has fought to solve problems, working with \n     Democrats and Republicans, forging new state and local \n     partnerships, proposing creative and common-sense legislative \n     solutions, and drawing national attention to challenges and \n     opportunities in New York State.\n       Senator Clinton has fought for New York when New York has \n     needed a fighter most. These past eight years, New Yorkers \n     have\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n     faced challenges among the toughest in our state's history \n     and tragedy among the most devastating in our nation's \n     history.\n       From the time of her election in 2000, and following her \n     landslide reelection in 2006, Senator Clinton continued the \n     work she's pursued for more than 35 years in public service \n     as an advocate for children and families, a champion for \n     women's rights and human rights, a leader on health care, and \n     a voice on behalf of all those who have felt invisible.\n        Standing up for New York after 9/11\n       Creating Economic Opportunity\n       Meeting Our Responsibility to Service-members and Veterans\n       Driving Change in Health Care\n       Standing Up for Women's Health\n       Advocating for Children and Families\n       Leading the Way to a New Energy Future\n       Addressing Infrastructure Challenges\n\n\n                  standing up for new york after 9/11\n\n       In the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     Senator Clinton worked tirelessly on behalf of the victims \n     and their families and New Yorkers who needed a strong voice \n     in Washington.\n       Just three days after the attacks, Senator Clinton and \n     Senator Charles Schumer went to the Oval Office and secured a \n     commitment from President Bush for $20 billion in federal aid \n     for New York's recovery. In the years that followed, they \n     fought successfully to make sure that all of the funding \n     promised to New York was delivered.\n       Senator Clinton's first visit to Ground Zero was on \n     September 12, 2001, and she quickly recognized that there \n     would be lasting health problems for first responders and \n     others who rushed to provide assistance after the World Trade \n     Center attacks as well as for workers, residents, students \n     and others exposed to the toxic cloud of debris and chemicals \n     around Ground Zero. She fought for the establishment of, and \n     secured $335 million in funding for, programs to provide \n     health screening, monitoring and treatment for first \n     responders, building and construction trades workers, \n     volunteers, residents, office workers, and students suffering \n     health effects and stood up again and again to stop the Bush \n     Administration's efforts to slash funding for this critical \n     care.\n       The attacks of September 11 also underscored serious gaps \n     in our homeland security, and Senator Clinton worked with the \n     families who were tragically affected by 9/11 to demand the \n     creation of the 9/11 Commission and then to implement its \n     findings, including making sure our first responders have the \n     resources and support they need to meet our crucial homeland \n     security demands and pressing for threat-based homeland \n     security funding.\n\n\n                     creating economic opportunity\n\n       Senator Clinton worked across the aisle to address the \n     economic downturn facing New York and harness the state's \n     talent and resources. To help struggling New York workers, \n     she successfully extended unemployment insurance. She was a \n     driving force behind raising the minimum wage and helped \n     secure in law the first increase in a decade.\n       Senator Clinton co-authored a law that expanded Renewal \n     Zones with incentives for job creation across Upstate New \n     York. And when efforts to push additional legislative change \n     hit roadblocks in the Republican-controlled Congress, Senator \n     Clinton rolled up her sleeves and developed creative \n     strategies to stimulate economic development, expand markets \n     for New York businesses and producers and create jobs.\n       In the Finger Lakes and the North Country, she partnered \n     with eBay, local universities and local companies to organize \n     public-private trading cooperatives which provide small \n     businesses with technological support, microloans, and \n     training programs to sell goods online and improve their \n     sales.\n       Senator Clinton saw that New York City's restaurants were \n     buying produce out of state at the same time that upstate \n     farmers and producers were struggling, so she launched Farm-\n     to-Fork, an initiative that has helped New York farmers and \n     producers sell their products to New York's restaurants, \n     schools, colleges and universities.\n       She brought Artspace to Buffalo, creating a thriving model \n     for urban revitalization and economic development centered on \n     cultural projects, and secured funds to renovate downtown \n     cultural centers like Proctors Theater in Schenectady, the \n     Stanley Theater in Utica and the Strand Theater in \n     Plattsburgh.\n       She helped secure the funds needed to expand broadband \n     access to rural and underserved areas in the North Country \n     and championed an agenda that would create new investments in \n     broadband infrastructure throughout the State.\n       Senator Clinton also saw the need to better showcase \n     Upstate innovation to potential investors. She helped launch \n     New Jobs for New York, a non-profit organization that brought \n     together more than 2,600 entrepreneurs, investors and \n     researchers across New York and shined a spotlight on over \n     200 companies across New York, helping them to obtain the \n     investment capital, strategic partnerships and joint ventures \n     they need to grow their businesses and create jobs.\n       She has also intervened to prevent jobs from leaving New \n     York and was instrumental in several large employers \n     maintaining their presence and their workforce in the state.\n       Senator Clinton advocated for New York businesses and \n     research institutions, securing more than $837 million in \n     funding for cutting edge defense projects throughout the \n     state and millions more for alternative energy, \n     nanotechnology and other innovation. She championed creating \n     a business environment that encourages investments in \n     research and development and has been instrumental in the \n     renewal of the R tax credit that supports thousands of high \n     skill jobs in New York.\n\n\n       meeting our responsibility to servicemembers and veterans\n\n       As New York's first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee and as the only member of the Senate to \n     serve on the U.S. Joint Forces Command's Transformation \n     Advisory Group, Senator Clinton served as a leading advocate \n     for our men and women in uniform, military families, and \n     veterans.\n       When the Bush Administration targeted several New York \n     military bases for closure, Senator Clinton fought back, \n     working with base communities to prevent all of the proposed \n     closures. Together, they ensured that Niagara Falls Air \n     Reserve Station, Rome Laboratories and the Defense Finance \n     and Accounting Service (DFAS) in Rome remained open and that \n     the C-130 mission remained at Stratton Air National Guard \n     Base. Her efforts actually turned a potential loss of \n     thousands of jobs into a gain of hundreds of new jobs and \n     helped to preserve and strengthen New York's vital role in \n     our national security.\n       Senator Clinton was one of the first to recognize and \n     address troubling gaps in health care and health monitoring \n     for our servicemembers. Continuing work she began as First \n     Lady, she secured in law health tracking for all \n     servicemembers after it was revealed that there was no \n     baseline health history to evaluate them, ensuring that all \n     active duty personnel and reservists receive regular health \n     screenings.\n       Senator Clinton worked across the aisle to secure in law \n     access to TRICARE military health care benefits for all \n     drilling members of the guard and reserve.\n       Senator Clinton also secured in law the first ever \n     expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act to enable \n     military family members to take up to six months of leave to \n     care for their injured loved ones, often suffering from \n     serious injuries affecting their bodies and minds that \n     require care from family who work full time.\n       Senator Clinton fought to make sure our government lives up \n     to its responsibility to our veterans after they leave \n     service. She successfully changed the law to streamline the \n     VA disability benefits claim system to cut red tape and help \n     wounded servicemembers receive the benefits they have earned. \n     She also secured in law assistance for family members caring \n     for loved ones suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI), \n     the signature wound of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \n     established a Department of Defense Task Force to assess the \n     mental health challenges facing wounded warriors, including \n     post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She also fought and \n     succeeded in stopping the VA's plan to close the Canandaigua \n     VA hospital.\n\n\n                     driving change in health care\n\n       Senator Clinton distinguished herself in the Senate as a \n     leading advocate for fixing our broken health care system and \n     ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, \n     affordable health care.\n       She worked with members on both sides of the aisle and with \n     health providers across New York to press for needed change \n     to improve quality, reduce costs and expand access.\n       Senator Clinton saw that all too often family caregivers \n     are the ones who struggle, largely unnoticed and unaided by \n     our health care system, to provide care to chronically ill \n     loved ones with Alzheimer's and other debilitating \n     conditions. She became their champion, authoring and \n     successfully passing a groundbreaking law to expand access to \n     desperately needed respite care.\n       She pushed to bring the delivery of health care into the \n     21st century, pressing for Congress to enact national \n     standards for incorporating information technology into the \n     practice of medicine to reduce medical errors, improve \n     quality and reduce costs.\n       She was a driving force in efforts to expand the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program, an initiative she helped launch as \n     First Lady and which has provided access to health care for \n     thousands of children who otherwise would be uninsured, \n     including nearly 400,000 children in New York.\n       She used her unique public platform to spotlight the upside \n     down incentives in our health care system, calling for an \n     emphasis on wellness and prevention of chronic diseases that \n     are driving up health care costs. And she was vigilant \n     against Bush Administration efforts to roll back health care \n     for New York's most vulnerable, stopping a short-sighted \n     attempt to cut community health clinics that are the primary \n     source of health care for many low-income New Yorkers and \n     brokering a compromise that prevented the loss of tens of \n     millions of dollars in Ryan White CARE Act HIV/AIDS funding \n     for New York.\n\n\n                     STANDING UP FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH\n\n       Senator Clinton served as a steadfast defender of women's \n     health and a leading voice against the Bush Administration's \n     efforts to put ideology before science. She successfully \n     pressed the Bush Administration for a decision on Plan B \n     emergency contraception, after more than three years of \n     delay. She spoke out against administration efforts to\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\n     restrict access to contraception and family planning and \n     raised the alarm against the administration's last minute \n     plan to undermine women's health by putting in place new \n     rules to allow any employee of a health provider to refuse to \n     participate in any way in health care they find \n     objectionable.\n\n\n                   ADVOCATING FOR CHILDREN & FAMILIES\n\n       Senator Clinton has also continued her life-long advocacy \n     on behalf of children and families.\n       She saw significant barriers facing grandparents and other \n     family members raising children who would otherwise end up in \n     foster care. So she fought for and secured in law landmark \n     legislation to keep families together and remove obstacles \n     facing grandparents, uncles, aunts, and other family members \n     trying to enroll children in school, sign them up for health \n     care or access other needed services, information and \n     referrals.\n       Following the tragic death of Cameron Gulbransen of Long \n     Island, Senator Clinton joined with families and safety \n     advocates to pass into law legislation requiring that all new \n     vehicles produced in the United States include safety \n     features to protect children against preventable injuries and \n     death from non-traffic accidents in and around cars. Senator \n     Clinton partnered with former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim \n     Kelley to secure in law expanded access to newborn screening \n     and increase groundbreaking research at the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n       And as chair of the Senate Superfund and Environmental \n     Health subcommittee, Senator Clinton held hearings and fought \n     to address environmental health hazards, like child lead \n     poisoning and asthma, that disproportionately affect low-\n     income and minority communities.\n       When the Bush Administration stopped enforcing the \n     ``Pediatric Rule,'' a Clinton Administration regulation \n     requiring that drugs prescribed to children be tested and \n     labeled for safety and effectiveness specifically in \n     children, Senator Clinton forged a bipartisan coalition to \n     restore the rule and secure it in law. And when President \n     Bush nominated an opponent of basic safety regulations for \n     children's products to head the Consumer Products Safety \n     Commission, Senator Clinton led an alliance of consumer \n     groups and safety advocates to successfully block the \n     nomination.\n\n\n                   EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n       Senator Clinton pushed successfully for more funding for \n     Head Start programs that benefit nearly 50,000 low-income New \n     York families and pushed for the expansion of Early Head \n     Start, bringing national attention to the importance of a \n     comprehensive zero to five early childhood system. She also \n     secured in law legislation to place additional teachers and \n     principals in the schools where they are most needed.\n       Senator Clinton fought for and succeeded in expanding \n     access to affordable college loans and Pell Grants, including \n     year-round Pell for non-traditional students, so that more \n     students who want to attend college will have that \n     opportunity, regardless of their background or circumstances. \n     Senator Clinton also championed public service, securing the \n     funding needed to maintain AmeriCorps and enable more \n     Americans to serve our communities in exchange for assistance \n     with college costs.\n\n\n                 LEADING THE WAY TO A NEW ENERGY FUTURE\n\n       From her first days in office, Senator Clinton made it a \n     priority to protect New York's natural resources and develop \n     New York's potential as a leader in alternative energy. She \n     secured in law environmental protection for Long Island Sound \n     and the Great Lakes.\n       Senator Clinton also helped pass a new law to clean up \n     polluted land known as brownfields, and worked to bring \n     together developers, environmentalists, and local leaders \n     from across New York to redevelop blighted properties.\n       Senator Clinton was an early advocate for harnessing \n     alternative energy as an engine of economic growth, working \n     with public and private partners across New York to pioneer \n     new green strategies. She secured in law major federal \n     funding for New York to retrofit trucks, school buses and \n     other heavy vehicles with new clean diesel technologies \n     developed in Corning and cleaner engines manufactured in \n     Jamestown. In Rochester, Senator Clinton worked with local \n     leaders to develop the first in the nation urban ``green \n     print,'' a plan for environmentally sustainable growth and \n     alternative energy development. She also secured passage of \n     laws to create ``green jobs'' training programs, and to push \n     the federal government to install green building \n     technologies.\n\n\n                  ADDRESSING INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES\n\n       As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \n     Senator Clinton in 2005 helped craft major transportation \n     legislation reauthorized every five years that sets the \n     nation's investment in our highways and mass transit. In her \n     role as a key negotiator, Senator Clinton secured over $16.5 \n     billion in transportation funding for New York, a substantial \n     increase of approximately $3 billion over the previous bill. \n     She also succeeded in including in the law new pollution \n     controls for construction equipment and creation of a \n     commission to chart the nation's transportation future.\n       In the wake of the tragic Minnesota bridge collapse in \n     2007, which dramatically underscored the urgency of our \n     infrastructure needs, Senator Clinton helped secure in law \n     legislation to address the deteriorating condition of our \n     nation's roads, bridges, drinking water systems, dams and \n     other public works. She also successfully pressed for \n     increased funding for Amtrak and high speed rail and to \n     reduce flight delays and ease congestion in New York's \n     crowded airspace.\n       For nearly four decades, Hillary Rodham Clinton has \n     dedicated herself to public service, as an attorney twice \n     voted one of the most influential in America, a First Lady of \n     Arkansas who helped transform the state's health care and \n     education systems, a First Lady of the United States who \n     fought for families at home and women's rights around the \n     world, a renowned expert and advocate for quality affordable \n     health care for all Americans, and as a twice-elected United \n     States Senator who was a tireless champion for the people of \n     New York and a voice for the voiceless everywhere. This \n     document is a snapshot of Senator Clinton's efforts and \n     accomplishments for New York in the Senate, but she has also \n     worked across the Empire State to help communities tackle \n     local challenges and capitalize on their unique \n     opportunities.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to \nspeak today about the wonderful record of our esteemed colleague, \nSenator Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n  For 8 years, Senator Clinton and I have served jointly as New York \nSenators, and I have seen, better than anyone, her unwavering \ncommitment to her constituents and her country. Through all this time, \nHillary has demonstrated the equanimity, the prudence, and the \nfortitude that have made her an exceptional leader and a great public \nservant.\n  Hillary's career has been defined by her unflagging desire to improve \nthe lives of the least fortunate among us. Even before finishing \nschool, she was working to protect children at the Children's Defense \nFund and the Carnegie Defense Fund on Children. Turning down a \npromising career in Washington, Hillary moved to Arkansas and directed \nthe legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas Law School.\n  During her tenure as First Lady, Hillary made it her priority to \nfight for justice around the world, advocating for women's rights and \ndemocracy worldwide. She made huge gains in protecting women and \nfamilies. She helped create the Office of Violence Against Women at the \nJustice Department and was instrumental in the passage of the Foster \nCare Independence Act and the Adoption and Safe Families Act.\n  After serving her country 8 years as First Lady, when most people \nwould retire, Hillary stepped up and has served as a vital and powerful \nadvocate on behalf of the people of New York. Going from the White \nHouse to White Plains, Hillary has continued to show as much acumen in \nher dealings with national and global leaders as she shows empathy and \ninterest in the needs of private individuals around New York.\n  We are the only Federal position where two people serve the exact \nsame job, so you get to know your colleague almost better than anyone \nelse. I have seen firsthand Hillary's dedication and tenacity. Let me \ntell you all, tell the people of New York, Hillary looks great from far \naway, but the closer you get, the better she looks.\n  I just want to say this, Hillary: It is a day, as you said so well, \nof looking back wistfully but to the future with anticipation. That is \nhow I feel. I look back wistfully at the many experiences we shared, \nworking together, getting to know one another, and learning to work and \nrespect and love one another. It has been an amazing part of my \nexperience. I am so thankful for the 8 years we worked together for the \npeople of New York and America. I know our friendship, as we have said \nto one another, will continue no matter what corner of the globe you \nare in. And maybe I will try to get some international presence on \nthose Sunday press conferences so you can see them over there. They are \nmainly aimed at local New York stuff.\n  Let me just say, as Hillary said, we traveled the State together. We \ntaught each other about agriculture and worked side by side on those \nhorrible days after 9/11. We have worked for the benefit of aging \nnuclear weapons and helping the onion farmers in the Hudson Valley. \nWhat a great experience it has been.\n  Of course, as my colleagues know, for all the time she focused and \nspent on the people of New York--and it was an enormous and successful \neffort--she also at the same time has been one of our most active and \nengaged colleagues\n\n[[Page S417]]\n\nin the Senate, working on issues of national policy and international \nimportance, from national security to early childhood education. In all \nof her many roles as a public servant, Hillary has always shown the \ninsight to see the heart of a problem. She has had the courage to \ntackle it and the talent to solve it. That is the trademark of Hillary \nClinton--insight, courage, talent, all applied for the betterment of \nthe people of New York, the people of America, and now the people of \nthe world. No matter how abstract the problem, no matter how esoteric \nthe question, Hillary has never once forgotten the people whose lives \nand happiness depend on her work.\n  So Hillary, yes, it is a bittersweet day, but I am so joyful about \nthe excitement--it is palpable--that you exude going on to this new \nchallenge. I am also--and I know every one of the people of New York is \nas well--grateful for the wonderful job you have done serving them and \nus. It has been a great ride. I am so grateful, again, for the \nopportunity to work alongside of you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, in giving a tribute to our dear friend, Senator Hillary \nRodham Clinton. How special it is today that, as she gave her farewell \nspeech, we are literally within minutes on the brink of a vote to \nproceed to the Lilly Ledbetter bill. Senator Clinton has been a \nchampion for women, a champion for the opportunity of women, and was \nthe lead on introducing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. How terrific \nit is that as she gives her last speech on the Senate floor, we will be \nvoting on something for which she has been a champion.\n  She has been a champion for women both here and around the country, \nfor their economic security, their health security, and also for women \naround the world, both in her work as First Lady and here in the \nSenate, whether it was to make sure to work with our current \nadministration to have access to education for Afghan girls, but also \nas First Lady with the women of the world to make sure, through her \nproject, Vital Voices, women had those voices.\n  She has been a champion all of her career. Whether it was at the \nLegal Defense Fund, as First Lady, or now as a Senator of the United \nStates, she has always made sure she has stood up for those who had no \nvoice, and she has used her voice to speak for them. That is what we \nknow she will continue to do.\n  But I think what we also admire about Senator Clinton is, she is not \nonly at home with world leaders with whom she will certainly work in \nher new job but with community leaders as well.\n  She spoke eloquently about her challenge and Senator Schumer's \nchallenge on that despicable and horrible day of 9/11. But I also want \nto talk just very quickly about September 10 because while we know \nSenator Clinton is a woman of great integrity, keen intellect, and is a \ncan-do person, many do not realize the wonderful bipartisanship in \nwhich she has tried to engage in this body. So let me tell you as one \nof the women of the Senate where we were on September 10.\n  The night before that terrible day, we were at Senator Clinton's \nhouse, affectionately calling her Hillary. All of the women, on a \nbipartisan basis, were there because, guess what we were doing, Mr. \nPresident. We were throwing Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison a shower. \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison had just adopted a child. We were so \nenthusiastic, and we, the women of the Senate, do what women do all \nover America, we threw Senator Kay a shower, and we gathered at \nHillary's house. We had great food, a couple of drinks that made us \nfeel even better. We told stories. We teased Kay. I volunteered to be \nAunt Barb, and she knew I had many talents, but baby-sitting would not \nbe one. We had such a wonderful time. But that was not the only time, \nas she has worked with all of us. But it shows the warmth and the way \nshe goes about that.\n  We will always cherish where we were that night because it was \nspecial because the next day was so stunning. I could give many \nexamples about it, but we know she has been a tenacious advocate for \nthe people of New York, a leader on crucial issues, a respected \ncolleague, and a dear friend. We are going to miss her, but we know as \nthe Secretary of State she will be a new voice of America. And America \ndoes need a new voice.\n  Senator Clinton, we know you are going to get us back on track. You \nare going to work with President Obama to restore our national honor, \nto repair those friendships around the world which we desperately need. \nAnd as you have been in so many things, we know you will be unflinching \non human rights and unflagging in strengthening America's alliances \nabroad. We will work together on those issues, and we know you will be \na great Secretary of State. You have been a spectacular Senator, and it \nis because you are just simply a wonderful human being.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from New York, \nthrough the Chair, I believe the new President could not have made a \nbetter selection for Secretary of State. Senator Clinton has had a \nunique career in the Senate, actually having only been here 8 years, \nbut nevertheless a candidate for President of the United States who \ncame very close. She had fabulous public service before that as First \nLady for 8 years. She has clearly made a difference throughout her \nlife, and I expect she will do the same again.\n  I told her on the floor privately, I am particularly enthusiastic \nabout her selection as Secretary of State because I think she will be \nthe first Secretary of State in the history of the United States who \nhas actually been to Hazard and Pikeville, KY. That should give her an \nextra edge in this new responsibility which she is about to assume.\n  I say to the Senator from New York, we will be anxious to work with \nher on some of the issues for which we shared a passion during her \nyears as Secretary of State. I know she will do an outstanding job. She \nhas been a credit to the Senate and will be one of the Nation's \noutstanding Secretaries of State.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as I think about Senator Clinton's leaving \nthe Senate to become Secretary of State, I am reminded of the words of \nthe great English bard William Shakespeare, who wrote that ``parting is \nsuch sweet sorrow.''\n  Senator Clinton's departure from this chamber is a time for joy as \nwell as sorrow. Hillary Clinton has been an effective, hard-working \nSenator.\n  When Senator Clinton first came to the Senate in 2001, she asked my \nadvice. Although Mrs. Clinton had been an accomplished and graceful \nFirst Lady, she told me that she wanted to excel at working for the \nState of New York.\n  I advised her to be a work horse about her new role as a Senator and \na work horse she has been, and the people of her State have benefitted.\n  Following the terrorists attacks of September 11, 2001, she and I \nworked with Senator Schumer to secure financial aid for New York City \nto help the city to recover from that terrible tragedy. For that, she \nhas since referred to me as the ``third Senator from New York,'' and I \nam very proud of that designation.\n  Senator Clinton and I have worked together on legislation for the \nwithdrawal of American forces from Iraq, served on the Budget Committee \ntogether, and worked on several important appropriations issues.\n  Senator Clinton has been an active and aggressive Senator, always \nmindful of the traditions of this great Chamber. She has won the \nrespect and admiration of everyone.\n  In her 2008 Presidential bid, Hillary Clinton broke down barriers for \nwomen all across this country, and inspired many of them to pursue \ntheir own hopes and dreams of a future in politics.\n  I will miss Senator Clinton. This Chamber has been graced by her \neloquence, intelligence, and her natural leadership.\n  Mrs. Clinton's 8 years as our country's First Lady, and her 8 years \nin the U.S. Senate, where she served on five different Senate \ncommittees, including the Senate Armed Services Committee, certainly \nqualify her for the high honor of being Secretary of State. She will\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\nshine in that office because of her sound judgement, keen intellect, \nsharp wit, infectious charm, and powerful commitment to making this \nworld a better place.\n  I congratulate Senator Clinton on her new position and wish her the \nbest of luck and success. These are troubled times and she will have a \nmost difficult job in the years ahead. Speaking at her graduation at \nWellesley College, Hillary Clinton declared that, ``the challenge now \nis to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be \nimpossible, possible.''\n  I say go to it Secretary of State-designate Clinton. If anyone can \nmake ``what appears to be impossible, possible,'' Secretary of State \nHillary Rodham Clinton can and will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President. I have known Hillary Clinton for many years, \nbut for the past 8 years I have had the pleasure of working with her as \na colleague in the U.S. Senate.\n  People on all points of the political spectrum agree that Senator \nClinton is one of the brightest, most highly accomplished U.S. \nSenators.\n  Born in the hometown of our President-elect--Chicago--Hillary Clinton \ngraduated from Wellesley College, where she was the first student in \nthe school's history to deliver her own commencement address--not a \nGovernor, a U.S. Senator, dean, or the university president.\n  She then attended Yale Law School, where she met her future husband \nand our future President, Bill Clinton.\n  After law school, she worked for the Children's Defense Fund and \nserved as a member of the Watergate inquiry staff in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  When the Clintons moved to Arkansas, Hillary became a successful \nattorney in private practice and served as the State's First Lady.\n  We all know that she was a remarkable First Lady, leading the way on \nhealth care reform, helping create the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, as well as the Violence Against Women Act.\n  We also know that she was not just a leader for domestic policy, but \nalso became an admired and effective diplomat throughout the world, \nespecially in her call for human rights.\n  When Senator Clinton came to the Senate 8 years ago, some expected \nher to have trouble fitting in. Those concerns quickly disappeared--she \nwas a natural. She has proven in her time here to be exceptionally \nadept at the give-and-take of the legislative process.\n  As a result, in just 8 years, she has left an indelible mark, \nespecially through her seats on the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the \nSpecial Committee on Aging and the Armed Services Committee.\n  As with Senator Biden, the departure of Senator Clinton is \nbittersweet. She brought a wealth of knowledge, skill and wisdom here, \nand she will be sorely missed.\n  But after the last 8 years--with so much work ahead to repair our \ncountry's once-lofty stature in the world, I can think of no one better \nsuited for the challenges ahead than the Senator from New York, Hillary \nClinton, our next Secretary of State.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S418-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S418-S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LILLY LEDBETTER ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I, too, would like to congratulate Senator \nClinton on her nomination to be Secretary of State; and, alas, there is \nother work left to do in the Senate, as the Senator from Maryland \nalluded to, the Lilly Ledbetter Act, for which we will be voting on \ncloture in a minute. So I have a few words I would like to add \nspecifically on that topic.\n  We will be voting for the so-called Lilly Ledbetter Act, and I think \nit is important to reflect a little bit on what that bill would \nactually do because, honestly, I think it has been characterized as a \nbill that will protect women's rights, which as a father of two \ndaughters I am all in favor of not just cracking the glass ceiling but \nbreaking it altogether.\n  But, actually, this bill, has a much broader impact and perhaps \nunintended by those who believe it is only about protecting women's \nrights. Indeed, what the Lilly Ledbetter Act would do is eliminate the \nstatute of limitations. That sounds like an arcane topic for lawyers \nthat only lawyers could love, but basically what it would do in the \ncase of Ms. Ledbetter--who had waited almost two decades before she \nraised her discrimination claim, long after the principal witness who \ncould have testified in opposition to that claim had died--indeed, the \npurpose of the statute of limitations, as the lawyers in this body well \nknow, is to be fair both to the plaintiff who brings the claim and to \nthe defendant who has to defend against that claim, to make sure the \ndocuments and the memories and, indeed, the very existence of those who \nmight be able to give testimony can be preserved so the jury can make a \ngood decision. But, indeed, if you wait 20 years before you assert your \nrights, and after the principal witness who could testify in opposition \nto your claim has died, that is not exactly fair either.\n  So, Senator Hutchison, my distinguished senior Senator from Texas, \nwill have an alternative which I hope will be offered. I expect it will \nbe offered as an alternative and substitute, which I believe is fair to \nboth those who bring a claim of discrimination and those who have to \ndefend against it.\n  Indeed, I mentioned a moment ago I am the father of two daughters, \nnow 27 and 26. Many small businesses that are created in America today \nare headed up by women. Indeed, we need to make sure those small \nbusinesses have some certainty, have some rules they can rely on in \nterms of knowing when they are likely going to be sued.\n  I think the Ledbetter Act could more appropriately be called a trial \nlawyer bailout because, of course, it is premised on the idea that one \ncan slumber on their rights and never have to assert them and, indeed, \nfight an uneven fight because those who have to defend against them can \nno longer defend against them because the witnesses are no longer \navailable.\n  Indeed, at a time when this country is in a recession, I think it is \nappropriate to point out that no country has ever sued its way out of a \nrecession. Yet the bill that comes to the floor on which we are called \nupon to vote--the very second bill that is presented to this Senate in \nthe midst of this economic crisis--is one that would effectively, as I \nsaid, eliminate the statute of limitations in employment litigation so \ntrial lawyers can bring multimillion-dollar lawsuits over decades-old \nworkplace disputes.\n  There are many good policy reasons, as I mentioned, why it is \nimportant to have those statutes of limitations, but it is particularly \ntrue in employment cases where a person's subjective intent can be the \ndecisive issue that the factfinder has to decide, where memories of the \npast can be colored by decades of subsequent workplace experience.\n  Another important policy behind the statute of limitations is called \nrepose. That is a fancy word that represents the idea that people \nshould be allowed to move on with their lives without the constant fear \nof being sued for something that happened 20 years previously.\n  Again, during times of economic uncertainty, the Ledbetter bill would \ncreate not more certainty but more uncertainty. As I suggested earlier, \nsmall businesses would suddenly be exposed to new liability for acts \nthat may have occurred years or decades ago, even if those acts \noccurred under a previous ownership before the current management was \neven in place.\n  There will be no way for small businesses and large businesses alike \nto quantify this risk because there is no way to know which of the \nemployees may have had a secret grievance they have been harboring for \nmany years just waiting for the opportunity to present the claim at a \ntime when it cannot be adequately defended.\n  Worst yet, this bill would actually encourage plaintiffs and their \nlawyers to strategically lie in wait, delaying their employment \nlawsuits for years while damages accumulate.\n  Now, this does not help anybody except for perhaps the lawyers and \nthe clients who can take advantage of this one-sided equation. Why sue \npromptly and limit your damages to a few months of back wages when you \ncan wait 5 years and sue for 5 years of back wages? This can be \nespecially rewarding to a plaintiff who strategically sues\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\nwhen you consider that during that 5 years, the plaintiff can \ndiligently be preparing a lawsuit while the defendant is ignorant about \nthe very grievance itself, perhaps, and memories and records fade.\n  So I think it is important, as we go into this bill, that it be \ncharacterized as the Trojan horse that it is. This is just the \nbeginning. If you eliminate the statute of limitations in employment \ndiscrimination claims, why not eliminate the statute of limitations in \nother claims: medical malpractice, any other business disputes, and the \nlike? It is just not fair, and it is not right. We should not allow \nthis bill to be represented as a blow for women's equality and women's \nrights because it simply is much broader and has much more of a broader \nimplication than that.\n  I am convinced this bill is actually a solution in search of a \nproblem because it is worth noting that in fiscal year 2007, a total of \n82,000-plus people timely filed complaints of employment discrimination \nwith the EEOC. It is important to ask what prevented Ms. Ledbetter from \ndoing exactly the same thing, from filing her complaint at the time she \nknew that perhaps she had a grievance that could be presented to the \nemployer.\n  So I thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak briefly \non the bill. Assuming cloture is adopted, I hope we will be taking up \nSenator Hutchison's alternative, which I think strikes the fair balance \nfor which I would hope we would all strive, protecting the rights of \nboth those who are victims of discrimination and the companies that \nhave to defend against those claims.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S419-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

These modifications, \nwhich were subsequently incorporated, reflect the joint\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nconsideration, input, and understandings of the Governors' \nrepresentatives from the Basin States concerning the act and how it \nrelates to the interstate compacts for the Colorado River system. I \nwant to congratulate the representatives on reaching agreement \nregarding what I recognize are complicated legal and operational issues \nassociated with the Colorado River.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I join with the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in congratulating the representatives of the seven \nColorado River Basin States on reaching agreement regarding certain \nprovisions in the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, and \nconcur in the request for unanimous consent that the August 27, 2008, \nletter be made a part of the Record relating to the consideration of S. \n22.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nAugust 27, 2008, letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  August 27, 2008.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Committee Chairman, Energy and Natural \n         Resources Committee, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator, Ranking Member, Energy and Natural Resources \n         Committee, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici: In recent \n     years, the seven Colorado River Basin States, (``Basin \n     States''), have, through extensive interstate consultation, \n     taken steps and forged agreements designed to ensure that use \n     and management of the Colorado River System continues to meet \n     existing and future demands in a manner that respects and \n     protects the interests, rights, claims and privileges of each \n     of the seven states. Along those lines, enclosed are the \n     Basin States' recommended modifications to S. 1171, the \n     Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Project Act, as reported \n     by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on June \n     25, 2008, and consolidated into S. 3213, the Omnibus Public \n     Land Management Act as Title X, Subtitle B. The undersigned \n     Governors' Representatives on Colorado River Operations \n     request that Congress adopt proposed modifications to S. \n     1171/S. 3213 in a form substantially consistent with the \n     attached language, and that the Congressional legislative \n     history of S. 1171/S. 3213 specifically reflect and reference \n     the joint consideration, input and consensus from the Basin \n     States as provided herein.\n       S. 1171/S. 3213 provides Congressional approval of a \n     settlement of the Navajo Nation's claims to water rights in \n     the San Juan River Basin in New Mexico that will authorize \n     diversion and distribution of San Juan River water through \n     the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project to Navajo and non-\n     Navajo communities in the Upper Colorado River Basin, the \n     Lower Colorado River Basin and the Rio Grande Basin within \n     New Mexico. Contingent upon enactment of federal legislation \n     approving a water rights settlement between the State of \n     Arizona and the Navajo Nation, S. 1171/S. 3213 also \n     authorizes the diversion of up to 6,411 acre-feet of water by \n     the Project from the San Juan River in New Mexico in the \n     Upper Colorado River Basin for delivery to the Navajo \n     reservation in Arizona in the Lower Colorado River Basin. S. \n     1171/S. 3213 directs that Project diversions for use within \n     New Mexico will be accounted as part of the State of \n     New Mexico's Upper Basin allocation of Colorado River \n     water.

ADAMS TUNNEL AND GRAND RIVER DITCH\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I commend the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for their diligent \nwork on this package, which contains several bills that I have \nchampioned for Colorado. I particularly wish to thank my colleague and \nfriend, Chairman Bingaman, and his staff, for his work and cooperation \non the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness and Indian Peaks \nWilderness Expansion Act, which is included in subtitle N of title I of \nS. 22, and which is critical to preserving some of the Nation's most \nbeautiful and critical wilderness lands. This has been a long road to \nreach agreement with all constituencies involved and we have faced some \nunique challenges. But ultimately, and with the chairman's assistance, \nwe have worked through a number of issues to our mutual satisfaction in \norder to pass a bill that is good for all Coloradans.\n  One of those challenges has been our effort to protect the operation \nand maintenance of the Alva B. Adams Tunnel which is the critical \ncomponent of the Colorado-Big Thompson Reclamation Project. The Adams \ntunnel was authorized in 1915 by Congress and later constructed within \nthe park and has delivered water from the Colorado River drainage to \nColorado's north eastern communities for decades.\n  I appreciate the Chairman working with us on protecting this facility \nthat provides water to hundreds of thousands of people in Colorado. \nWith his help, we included within section 1953(d) a provision that \nensures that nothing in the subtitle, including the designation of \nwilderness, ``prohibits or affects current and future operation and \nmaintenance activities . . . that were allowed as of the date of \nenactment . . . under the Act of January 26, 1915 (16 U.S.C. 191), \nrelating to the Alva B. Adams Tunnel or other Colorado-Big Thompson \nProject facilities located within the Park.''\n  The bill also includes in section 1953(g) an additional savings \nclause, which ensures that the Secretary of the Interior's authority to \nmanage lands and resources within the park is not diminished. It is my \nunderstanding that this type of general savings clause does not \nundermine or contradict the more specific provisions included in \nsection 1953(d) of the subtitle. That is, the savings clause included \nas section 1953(g) does not alter or affect the provisions in section \n1953(d), which make clear that the designation of the park as \nwilderness is not meant to affect the current and future operation and \nmaintenance activities for the tunnel nor to prohibit or restrict the \nconveyance of water through the Alva B. Adams Tunnel for any purpose.\n  Am I correct in my understanding of section 1953(g)?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator from Colorado is correct.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Chairman.\n  As with any wilderness legislation in a headwaters State, the water \nrights language in the Rocky Mountain National Park wilderness bill \nproved to be the most challenging. This legislation strikes a good \nbalance between protection of park wilderness resources and protection \nof existing water rights, ditch rights-of-way, and water \ninfrastructure, some of which predate the existence of the park.\n  The Water Supply and Storage Company--WSSC--owns and operates the \nGrand River Ditch, which is a water supply ditch located in the Never \nSummer Range in RMNP. The Grand River Ditch provides irrigation water \nto approximately 40,000 acres of land located in Larimer and Weld \nCounties in northern Colorado. WSSC owns, operates and maintains 11 \nreservoirs and 7 ditch systems, including the Grand River Ditch. WSSC's \nsystem of ditches, canals and laterals is more than 100 miles in total \nlength and provides approximately 60,000 acre-feet of water annually to \n173 shareholders. The Grand River Ditch is an integral component of \nWSSC's system. WSSC holds a right-of-way for the Grand River Ditch \nunder the Irrigation or General Right of Way Act of March 3, 1891--1891 \nAct--codified at 43 U.S.C Sec. Sec.  946-49.\n  The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act itself should not \ncause any change in land use, land management, or water rights within \nRocky Mountain National Park. Towards this end, section 1953(e) is \nintended to clarify that neither the Grand River Ditch nor its right-\nof-way will be adversely affected if the end use of water diverted by \nthe Grand River Ditch is for municipal purposes as opposed to irrigated \nagriculture. The Grand River Ditch diverts water high in the Colorado \nmountains and transports it some 50 miles downstream to its location of \nuse. At present, all of the water is used for agricultural irrigation; \nhowever, a portion of WSSC's stock is owned by Colorado municipalities \nand Grand River Ditch water will be used for this purpose in the \nfuture. No matter what the end use is, the existence of the Grand River \nDitch in RMNP imposes the same burden on the park. In other words, \nthere is no difference in land use, land management or water rights in \nthe park, whether the end use of water is agricultural irrigation or \nmunicipal use.\n  In 1921, the Supreme Court approved forfeiture of a right-of-way that \nhad never been used for its authorized purpose of irrigation, but \ninstead was used for developing electric power. See Kern River Co. v. \nUnited States, 257 U.S. 147, 1921. The case is distinguishable on \nseveral grounds from the Grand River Ditch, but the purpose of Section \n1953 (e) is to avoid any attempt to apply a Kern River-type theory to \nthe Grand River Ditch. Over 20 years ago the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture recognized this point when it said: ``The end use of water \noff the Federal lands, as it may change over time, casts no greater \nburden on the Federal property to carry the water to its place of \nuse.'' See letter dated October 1, 1986, from Douglas W. MacCleery, \nDeputy Assistant Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, \nDepartment of Agriculture, to Malcomb Wallop of the United States \nSenate, included in the legislative history of Public Law 99-545.\n  Conversion of agricultural water to municipal purposes is commonplace \nin Colorado, and the Grand River Ditch is no exception. In a mutual \nditch company such as WSSC, ownership of stock represents a pro rata \nshare of ownership in the water rights of the company. The language of \nsection 1953(e)\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\nensures that WSSC and the right-of-way of the Grand River Ditch will \nnot be adversely affected by the change in end use of GRD water.\n  The language of section 1953(e), ``primarily for domestic purposes or \nany purpose of a public nature,'' was not lightly chosen. It was taken \ndirectly from the act of May 11, 1898, which--in the words of the great \nJustice Van Devanter, who is considered the most knowledgeable \nauthority on public land law to ever sit on the Supreme Court--\n``permit[ted] rights of way obtained under the Act of 1891 [like the \nGrand River Ditch], the use of which was restricted to irrigation, to \nbe also used for the other purposes named in the section,'' namely \n``purposes of a public nature'' and ``domestic purposes.'' See Kern \nRiver Co. v. U.S., 257 U.S. 147, 152-153, 1921. After more than a \ncentury, the terms ``purposes of a public nature'' and ``domestic \npurposes'' seem to be fairly well understood. The phrases ``purposes of \na public nature'' and ``domestic purposes'' are especially broad, and \ninclude municipal uses following delivery, by a potable water provider, \nthrough the Grand River Ditch or by means of another conveyance \nstructure. We have agreed to exempt the Grand River Ditch from any \nrestriction that conditions the existence of the right-of-way on \nagricultural uses and instead to allow them to make ``purposes of a \npublic nature'' or ``domestic purposes'' the sole or predominate \npurpose.\n  The Grand River Ditch ``right of way . . . was granted on an implied \ncondition that it should revert to the United States in the event the \ngrantee ceased to use or retain it for the purpose indicated in the \n[1891 and 1898] statutes. That purpose--the main and controlling one--\nwas irrigation.'' See Kern River Co. v. U.S., 257 U.S. 147, 154 (1921). \nIn the future, the water transported in the ditch will be increasingly \nused for water supply and municipal purposes, not irrigation. This \ntransition may eventually ``entitle[] the United States to assert and \nenforce a forfeiture of the grant. . . .'' 257 U.S. at 154. To address \nthis concern, we have agreed to state in the bill that ``the right of \nway . . . shall not be terminated, forfeited, or otherwise affected as \na result'' of the change in purpose, ``unless the Secretary determines \nthat the change in main purpose or use adversely affects the park.'' If \nthe Secretary, in his discretion, makes that determination, he would \nthen have to assert and enforce a forfeiture of the grant in court.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I concur in the statements made by the \nSenator from Colorado and thank him for working carefully with me and \nmy staff to resolve these issues in a way that will ensure protection \nof park resources and provide for the continued operation of the Grand \nRiver Ditch and the Colorado-Big Thompson Projects.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, today I will vote to support final \npassage of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, S. 22. While \nI oppose two provisions in the bill, there are many other provisions \nthat I support.\n  Yesterday I voted to oppose bringing an end to debate on the bill \nsince the majority leader used a procedural tactic to prevent Senators \nfrom offering amendments. I had hoped that cloture would be defeated so \nthat we could reach agreement to allow a few amendments.\n  One such amendment was one I cosponsored to strike a troublesome \nprovision that would authorize the transfer of Federal land in Alaska's \nIzembek National Wildlife Refuge--a designated wilderness area and \ninternationally recognized Ramsar site--so that a road could be built. \nThe road is purportedly to allow travel between two Alaskan communities \nin cases of medical emergencies. However, Congress has already \nappropriated more than $36 million to provide a hovercraft, which I am \ntold crosses Cold Bay in about 20 minutes and to date has met every \nmedical evacuation need in all weather conditions, over 30. The road, \non the other hand, would need to avoid the numerous ponds and priority \nwetland areas--taking 1 to 2 hours to drive--and would not provide \nsafer, faster, or more cost-effective transportation than the \nhovercraft.\n  Another provision that troubles me was considered by neither the \nHouse nor the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, a \nprerequisite for all the other public lands bills in the package. The \nWashington County, UT, provision was air-dropped into this legislation. \nIt is unfortunate that the wilderness designations in the provision \nfall well short of the wilderness-quality land in the county that \nshould be protected. This public lands bill only proposes to designate \n44 percent of what is included in the America's Red Rock Wilderness \nAct, which I have been pleased to join Senator Durbin in supporting. \nFurthermore, this public lands package omits a wilderness unit, Dry \nCreek, that Senator Bennett has previously agreed to protect in his \nWashington County Growth and Conservation Act of 2008, S. 2834.\n  There are two provisions in the public lands bill that will impact \nWisconsin. The first is Section 5301, the ``National Trails System \nWilling Seller Authority.'' This section is based on a bill I \ncosponsored in the 110th Congress, S. 169, and will allow the Federal \nGovernment to purchase lands from willing sellers for two important \ntrails in Wisconsin: the North Country National Scenic Trail and the \nIce Age National Scenic Trail. I would like to acknowledge the efforts \nby the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation, North Country Trail \nAssociation, Partnership for the National Trail System, and the \nConservation Fund to help the National Park Service complete these \ntrails. This provision will establish willing seller authority as a \nuniform policy for the entire National Trail System, allowing these two \ntrails and seven others to benefit from this commonsense policy.\n  Section 7116 of the bill also makes a technical correction to the \nname of the wilderness area in the Apostle Islands, now to be called \nthe Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. Removing the ``A'' from the former \nname--Gaylord A. Nelson Wilderness--is supported by the National Park \nService and Nelson's family. Though this ia a small change, I do want \nto take the opportunity to again express my deep respect for the former \nU.S. Senator and Wisconsin Governor and my support for the Apostle \nIslands National Lakeshore and the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness. In August \n2005, I was deeply honored to participate in a ceremony marking the \ncreation of the Gaylord Nelson Wilderness and honoring the remarkable \nlife of Gaylord Nelson, father of Earth Day. I worked with \nRepresentative Obey to obtain the wilderness designation for 80 percent \nof the Apostle Islands, but it was Gaylord who was so essential in the \neffort to recognize the Apostle Islands as a national treasure and \nestablish the national lakeshore.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, passage of the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act of 2009 would wrap up one of the major pieces of \nunfinished business from last year. The majority leader promised he \nwould take up this legislation early in 2009, and indeed he has. The \nomnibus public land bill includes four provisions that will directly \nbenefit Michigan by preserving precious natural resources and improving \nour parks and trails.\n  The lands bill includes legislation I authored that would authorize \nthe Federal Government to purchase land from willing sellers for the \nNorth Country National Scenic Trail. The North Country Trail will be \nthe Nation's longest hiking trail, traversing seven States including \nMichigan, which has the longest trail segment of 1,150 miles. The \nFederal Government has land acquisition authority for the majority of \nits national scenic and historic trails, but for no good reason this \nauthority has not been available for the North Country Trail. Willing \nsellers should have the right to sell portions of their land, or grant \neasements for trail users across their land, should they choose to do \nso, and if it is in the public interest. This provision will allow for \nthe eventual completion of the North Country Trail, giving more users \nthe opportunity to enjoy scenic hiking in Michigan as well as the six \nother States along the planned route. For nearly 10 years, I have been \nworking on this willing seller authority, and I am delighted that \nCongress has finally approved this important legislation.\n  The omnibus lands bill also includes legislation I sponsored last \nCongress to improve the Keweenaw National Historical Park, located in \nMichigan's Upper Peninsula. By removing overly restrictive property \nacquisition requirements, changing unfair matching\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\nrequirements for Federal funds, and increasing the authorized level of \nfunds to be appropriated for the park, we can improve the visitors' \nexperience. Established in 1992, this unique park is a partnership with \nnearly 20 independently operated heritage sites, and preserves and \ninterprets the incredible story of the copper rush in Michigan's \nKeweenaw Peninsula during the Industrial Revolution. I am pleased that \nthis legislation is finally being acted upon so the park can more fully \ncarry out its statutory mission to preserve and bring to life the \nvibrant history of Michigan's ``copper country''--an essential part of \nthe Nation's history of industrial and technological development, \nimmigration, labor relations, and natural resources, and a key \ncomponent to the economic revitalization of this area.\n  The omnibus lands bill also provides important protections for 12,000 \nacres within the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, located in \nMichigan's Upper Peninsula along the south shore of majestic Lake \nSuperior. I introduced this wilderness bill during the last Congress, \nand I am pleased that one of the first actions the Senate has taken \nthis year is to pass this bill, which would protect the Beaver Basin \nfor future generations, while ensuring continued public enjoyment of \nthe land. The Beaver Basin wilderness comprises about 12,000 acres, or \n16 percent, of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, and was proposed \nafter 5 years of careful planning and extensive public consultation. \nThe wilderness designation is responsive to many of the concerns \nexpressed by citizens and ensures its continued recreational use. The \naccess road to the lakes and campground are not included in the \nwilderness designation, so vehicles would still have access to this \npopular recreation area. Also, all motor boats would still be able to \naccess the miles of the Lake Superior shoreline, as the wilderness area \ndoes not include the Lake Superior surface water. In addition, boats \nusing electric motors would still be allowed on Little Beaver and \nBeaver Lakes within the wilderness area. The Beaver Basin area has been \nmanaged as a backcountry and wilderness area since 1981, and this \nwilderness designation will ensure that the valuable habitat and \npristine natural features of the region remain the treasure they are \ntoday.\n  Finally, the omnibus lands bill includes legislation that I sponsored \nin the Senate last year as a companion bill to Representative Dingell's \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, which would designate land \nin Monroe and Wayne County, MI, related to the battles of the River \nRaisin fought during the War of 1812 as a unit of the National Park \nSystem. While there are currently eight War of 1812 battlefield sites \nthat are in the National Park System, none of these sites are located \nin areas that were once considered the ``Northwest,'' a key strategic \nfront in the War of 1812. The River Raisin battlefield sites were the \nplace of horrific events; yet these events became a turning point that \nspurred our troops to future victories, protected our lands, and \nculminated in a celebration of America's ``Second War of \nIndependence.'' With the approaching 200th anniversary of the War of \n1812, I am pleased that the Senate has this legislation before it, and \nI look forward to the bill becoming law in time for this national \ncelebration.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, S. 22, the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act, includes five bills vital for increasing our Nation's \nunderstanding of our oceans, Great Lakes, and coastal areas. The ocean \nbills included in this package are all strong bipartisan pieces of \nlegislation that were favorably reported by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee in the 110th Congress and passed the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet, yet we know little about \nwhat lies beneath them or how the changing climate is affecting marine \nresources. Millions of Americans depend directly and indirectly on \nhealthy and bountiful oceans. In 2007, our Nation's coastal economies \ncontributed nearly 50 percent, or $6.7 trillion, to the national gross \ndomestic product.\n  While our Nation relies on our ocean, Great Lakes, and coastal \nresources, tremendous gaps exist in our knowledge of these ecosystems. \nThe Senate Commerce Committee provisions included in S. 22 will \nstrengthen and improve our marine, coastal, and scientific programs, \nand will help us make the best possible decisions about how to manage, \nconserve, and protect these valuable resources.\n  The Ocean Exploration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, Undersea Research Program Act, included in this \npackage, will give us a better understanding of our marine ecosystems \nand resources. This legislation reflects a long history of bipartisan \ncollaboration in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent \nin the both the 108th and 109th Congresses and was reported favorably \nin the 110th Congress by the Commerce Committee. The provision \nestablishes an interdisciplinary ocean exploration program to gather \nobservations and data from areas in the ocean we have previously been \nunable to explore. In addition, this legislation would help strengthen \nand coordinate NOAA's National Undersea Research Program. The National \nUndersea Research Program seeks to increase scientific knowledge for \nthe management, use, and preservation of ocean, Great Lakes, and \ncoastal resources through undersea research, exploration, education, \nand technology development. These essential activities are imperative \ngiven that approximately 95 percent of the ocean floor remains \nunexplored. Ocean exploration and undersea research provides \nunprecedented opportunities to discover items of natural, cultural, and \neconomic value including new sources of minerals, drugs, habitats, \nspecies, artifacts, and shipwrecks.\n  The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act included in S. 22 would \nintegrate Federal and coastal mapping activities throughout the U.S. \nExclusive Economic Zone. Approximately 90 percent of our Nation's \nmaritime territory remains unmapped by modern technology. Improved \nmapping of our Nation's coastal and ocean waters will increase our \nunderstanding of the marine environment, thereby increasing the safety \nof navigation in our maritime domain, supporting national security \nmissions of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, and allowing for better \nmanagement of marine ecosystems and resources. This bill also has a \nlongstanding history of broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and \nHouse.\n  The Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act would build \non current regional systems to establish a national integrated ocean, \nGreat Lakes, and coastal observing system to collect, compile, and make \navailable data to support marine commerce; weather, climate, and marine \nforecasting; energy siting and production; navigation; ecosystem-based \nresource management; and public safety. The legislation passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. \nDuring the 110th Congress, the legislation passed the House and was \nreported favorably by the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act in S. 22 \nmandates that steps be taken to understand and address climate change \nand its impacts on our oceans, a much needed and important action. Over \nthe past 200 years, human activities have resulted in dramatic \nincreases in greenhouse gases that are altering the Earth's climate. \nThe oceans mitigate the effects of global warming by absorbing \napproximately half of all this atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, as \nthe oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, their chemistry is changing and \nthe oceans are becoming more acidic. The Federal Ocean Acidification \nResearch and Monitoring Act would establish an interagency committee to \ndevelop a strategic research plan on ocean acidification and establish \nan ocean acidification program within NOAA to conduct research and \nlong-term monitoring on our acidifying oceans and to develop adaptation \nstrategies and techniques for conserving marine ecosystems. This \nlegislation represents a bipartisan effort to promote climate change \nresearch and adaptation activities. The bill was reported favorably by \nthe Senate Commerce Committee and passed the House in the 110th \nCongress.\n  The final oceans bill included in S. 22 is the Coastal and Estuarine \nLand Conservation Program Act. As the U.S. population grows and more \npeople move to the coasts, our coastal lands and ecosystems are \nthreatened by\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nunsustainable development. This legislation authorizes NOAA to award \ncompetitive grants to coastal States, including the Great Lakes, to \nprotect coastal and estuarine areas which have significant \nconservation, recreation, ecological, historic, or watershed protection \nvalue and are threatened by conversion to other uses.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee during the 110th Congress, I \nwas pleased to favorably report these important ocean policy bills. \nUnfortunately, we were unable to pass these bills last Congress. I am \nglad that the Senate is considering their passage as one of the first \nmajor pieces of legislation in the 111th Congress. Our oceans, Great \nLakes, and coasts provide many environmental and economic benefits to \nour Nation, and their conservation must be one of our highest national \npriorities.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, today the Senate will pass a \ncomprehensive public lands bill that will protect our Nation's public \nlands and conserve our planet's oceans. I thank the majority leader and \nSenator Bingaman for including important bills from the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation in this package. I commend \nSenators Inouye, Stevens, Cantwell, Snowe, Lautenberg, and Gregg for \ntheir leadership in drafting these bills. Senator Inouye, in \nparticular, has aggressively advocated for improved stewardship of our \noceans and this package reflects his careful work as chairman of the \nCommerce Committee which has jurisdiction over our Nation's oceans. As \nthe incoming chair of the Commerce Committee, I will continue to work \nclosely with my dear friend and mentor Senator Inouye on these issues. \nAnd I look forward to collaborating closely with him on oceans policy \nand other areas in the committee's jurisdiction that are particularly \ncritical to the Hawaiian Islands. Our colleagues should know that the \nocean and coastal bills included in the Consolidated Natural Resources \nAct enjoy broad bipartisan and national support because they are sorely \nneeded and important to our Nation's environmental and economic future.\n  The Federal Government owns nearly 653 million acres of land in the \nUnited States. As the owner of these lands, the Federal Government has \na responsibility to protect this land for current and future \ngenerations. Likewise, and as importantly, the Federal Government has \nan equal responsibility to protect and manage our Nation's marine and \ncoastal resources. The oceans cover over two-thirds of our planet, yet \nwe know little about what lies beneath or how the changing climate is \naffecting marine resources. The United States' Exclusive Economic Zone, \ncovers 3.4 million square miles of the Earth's surface, an area greater \nthan the whole United States. Unfortunately, our efforts to sustainably \nmanage and conserve these submerged lands and living resources are \nhampered by our limited scientific research and understanding of our \nExclusive Economic Zone. That is irresponsible and must change. The \nfive ocean bills included in this legislation will authorize programs \nnecessary to increase our Nation's understanding about ocean and \ncoastal areas, which in turn will enable us to make the best possible \ndecisions about how to manage, preserve, and protect our oceans and \ntheir living marine resources for current and future generations\n  The Ocean and Coastal Exploration and National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration Act is critical to our ability to gather \nobservations and data from areas in the ocean that have never been \nexplored. The legislation would establish a national ocean exploration \nprogram within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nwhich would conduct interdisciplinary ocean exploration voyages to \nexplore and survey little known areas of the marine environment and \ninventory, observe, and assess living and nonliving marine resources. \nIn addition, this legislation would establish a coordinated national \nundersea research program, which would increase scientific knowledge \nfor the management, use, and preservation of oceanic, coastal, and \nGreat Lakes resources through undersea research, exploration, \neducation, and technology development.\n  These activities are vital given that approximately 95 percent of the \nocean floor remains unexplored. Increasing our knowledge of our oceans \nthrough exploration and undersea research provides unprecedented \nopportunities to discover new sources of minerals, drugs, habitats, \nspecies, artifacts, and shipwrecks. Expeditions could provide images of \nancient human artifacts, rare or previously undiscovered species, and \nexciting new ecosystems.\n  The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Act would direct the Federal Government \nto integrate Federal and coastal mapping activities throughout the U.S. \nExclusive Economic Zone. Approximately 90 percent of our Nation's \nmaritime territory remains unmapped by modern technology. Improving our \nmapping activities, the promotion of the development and dissemination \nof new technologies, and the coordination of efforts across the 10 \nfederal agencies currently involved in marine mapping are essential. \nBetter mapping of these waters will help to minimize maritime \naccidents, support the national security missions of the U.S. Navy and \nU.S. Coast Guard, and improve our knowledge of ocean and coastal \necosystems.\n  The Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act would \nestablish a national integrated ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes \nobserving system that would collect, compile, and make available data \nto support marine commerce; navigation safety; weather, climate and \nmarine forecasting; energy siting and production; ecosystem-based \nresource management; and public safety. This legislation represents an \nacknowledgement of our need as a country to improve our ability to \nmeasure, track, explain, and predict events related to weather and \nclimate change. It represents a consensus that our understanding of \nnatural climate variability and interactions between ocean and \natmospheric environments needs strengthening and improvement. \nInformation generated by the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation \nSystem would assist in providing advanced warning of hazardous coastal \nand ocean conditions to State managers and potentially affected \ncommunities and could help coastal communities prepare for and minimize \nlosses for a range of potentially harmful ocean conditions. \nAdditionally, this Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System has \nthe potential to provide economic and ecological benefits for other \ncoastal and ocean activities. For example, fisheries scientists and \nmanagers could use the data to predict biological productivity which \nwould facilitate ecosystem-based management. Fishermen and mariners \ncould better predict sea conditions for safe navigation and transport. \nOcean scientists and regulators could better understand, predict, and \nrapidly respond to the distribution and impacts of marine pollution, \nharmful algal blooms, or other hazardous conditions. Educators and \nstudents could learn more about basic functions and processes of the \nmarine environment.\n  Increasing carbon dioxide absorption in our oceans is acidifying \nwaters and could be threatening the foundation of the ocean's food web. \nThe Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act highlights \nthe need for action to be taken to understand and confront climate \nchange and its impacts on our oceans by authorizing a coordinated \nFederal research program on ocean acidification. Over the past 200 \nyears, human activities have resulted in dramatic increases in \ngreenhouse gases that are altering the Earth's climate. The oceans \nmitigate the effects of global warming by absorbing atmospheric carbon \ndioxide, which is changing ocean carbon chemistry and causing the \noceans to become more acidic. There is significant concern among the \nscientific community, resource managers, and policymakers that ocean \nacidification could adversely impact our Nation's marine ecosystems, \nthe food webs of many fish and marine mammals, and the economies of \nmany coastal States that rely upon the seafood industry and coastal and \nocean tourism. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring \nAct would establish an interagency committee, chaired by the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to develop and provide Congress \nwith a strategic research plan on ocean acidification. Additionally, it \nvests the authority within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration to establish an ocean acidification program\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nwithin the agency to conduct research and long-term monitoring, \neducation and outreach, and development of adaptation strategies and \ntechniques for conserving marine ecosystems.\n  The Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program Act would \nauthorize the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, to make grants to coastal States for the \npurposes of protecting important coastal and estuarine areas that have \nsignificant conservation, recreation, ecological, historical, or \naesthetic values, or that are threatened by conversion from their \nnatural, undeveloped, or recreational state to other uses, and it \nprovides grants for lands to be managed or restored to effectively \nconserve, improve, or restore ecological function. Estuaries, wetlands, \nand the watersheds that flow into them support fisheries and wildlife \nand substantially contribute to coastal economies. The pressures of \nurbanization and pollution in coastal areas threaten to impair \nwatersheds, undermine natural protections from coastal storms, impact \nwildlife habitat, and cause irreparable damage to coastal ecology. As \nour population grows, more and more people are moving to our coasts to \nenjoy their beauty and recreational opportunities. Coastal land \nprotection partnership programs can help our Nation meet a number of \ndiverse priorities such as promoting recreation, increasing wildlife, \nimproving or conserving ecological quality and diversity, and \npreserving historical or cultural resources. The legislation would \nfoster partnership programs among the Federal Government, State \nagencies, local governments, private landowners, and nonprofits to \neffectively conserve and manage coastal lands.\n  Over 50 percent of our population lives along our coasts and our \ncoastal economies generate one-half of our Nation's gross domestic \nproduct. The planet's oceans produce an untold amount of wealth, both \neconomic and ecological, for our Nation. What is good for the health of \nour coastal communities and oceans is good for the Nation. Given the \nreliance our citizens have on our marine and coastal resources and the \nlarge gaps exist in our knowledge regarding U.S. ocean and coastal \nareas, strengthening and improving our marine, coastal, and scientific \nprograms will enable us to make the best possible decisions about how \nto manage, preserve and protect our oceans.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, earlier today the Senate passed S. 22, \nthe Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009. As I said during the \ndebate, S. 22 includes over 160 bills from the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources and reflects many years of hard work.\n  This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work \nof our outstanding staff. Both our ranking member, Senator Murkowski, \nand I are very fortunate to have a very dedicated and experienced \nprofessional staff. They service the committee and the Senate well. \nThey deserve our thanks.\n  On the Democratic staff of the committee, I would like to thank the \ncommittee's staff director, Bob Simon, and chief counsel, Sam Fowler, \nfor all of their work on this legislation, as on all the legislation \nthat comes through our committee. I would also like to thank senior \ncounsel Patty Beneke; counsel Mike Connor, who worked on all of the \nwater issues included in the bill; counsels David Brooks, Kira Finkler, \nand Scott Miller, who coordinated all of the park and public lands \nbills; professional staff members Jorge Silva-Banuelos, who worked very \nhard on many of the New Mexico land bills; and Jonathan Epstein; and \ntwo National Park Service fellows, Karl Cordova, who worked on the \ncommittee last year, and Mike Gauthier, who is on the staff for the \ncurrent year.\n  I would also like to thank the committee's chief clerk, Mia Bennett; \nexecutive assistant Amanda Kelly; communications director Bill Wicker; \npress secretary David Marks; and staff assistants Rachel Pasternack, \nGina Weinstock, and Rosemarie Calabro.\n  On the Republican side, let me acknowledge Senator Murkowski's new \nstaff director, McKie Campbell, and chief counsel Karen Billups. I \nwould also like to note my thanks to former Senator Domenici's staff \ndirector during the previous Congress, Frank Macchiarola; and former \nminority chief counsel, Judy Pensabene. I would also like to recognize \ncounsel Kellie Donnelly; as well as professional staff members Frank \nGladics, Josh Johnson, and Tom Lillie, all of whom made significant \ncontributions to this bill.\n  In addition, I am very grateful to the committee's nondesignated \nstaff: Anna-Kristina Fox, Dawson Foard, Nancy Hall, Amber Passmore, \nMonica Chestnut, and Wanda Green.\n  S. 22 contains over 1,200 pages of text, and was the subject of \nnumerous revisions. I am grateful to the help of the Senate legislative \ncounsel office, and Gary Endicott, Heather Burnham, and Colin Campbell \nin particular.\n  I would also like to thank Cliff Isenberg from the Senate Budget \nCommittee for his help as well as Deb Reis from the Congressional \nBudget Office, and Tyler Kruzich, formerly with CBO.\n  Finally, let me acknowledge the great help in bringing the bill to \nthe floor we received from the majority leader and his staff: Neil \nKornze, Chris Miller, Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, and, as always, the \nsecretary for the majority, Lula Davis, as well as Tim Mitchell, the \nassistant secretary for the majority. I would also like to thank the \ncloakroom staff, Joe Lapia, Meredith Mellody, Brandon Durflinger, and \nEstaban Galvan, for all of their assistance.\n  All of these fine staff members had a hand in putting S. 22 together \nand moving it through the legislative process. We would not have been \nable to pass the bill without their hard work and their \nprofessionalism. I wish to thank each and every one of them for their \ngood work.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I rise to express my support for S. \n22, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. I commend Chairman \nBingaman and former Ranking Member Domenici of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources for their leadership and their staff for \ntheir dedication during the previous Congress to move this important \nlegislation forward. While we were unable to vote on this package last \nyear, it is time that we pass these bills. During these times of \neconomic downturn, our national parks and public lands are some of the \nfew affordable recreational opportunities available to the American \npeople.\n  This legislation is a bipartisan package of more than 160 individual \nbills, and incorporates a wide range of public land measures that \nimpact various regions of our Nation. All of the bills included in the \npackage have been thoroughly reviewed and favorably reported by the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 110th \nCongress. By utilizing, to the full extent, the committee vetting \nprocess that includes acquiring testimonies from Federal agencies, \nstakeholders, and members of the public, concerns were addressed and \nbills were amended, as needed. In addition to the Senate committee's \napproval, many of these measures were passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last Congress.\n  As chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, I had the opportunity \nto hold hearings on a number of the bills included in this package. \nThis legislation includes many important provisions for protecting and \npreserving America's national parks and enhancing the experiences to be \ngained by park visitors. Today, I wish to highlight four provisions \nthat I sponsored during the 110th Congress: H.R. 3332, the Kalaupapa \nMemorial Act; S. 1728, Na Hoa Pili O Kaloko-Honokohau Advisory \nCommission Reauthorization Act; S. 2220, Outdoor Recreation Act of 1963 \nAmendments Act; and S. 320, the Paleontological Resource Preservation \nAct. In addition, I appreciate the inclusion of S. 1680, the Izembek \nand Alaska Peninsula Refuge Enhancement Act of 2008. This provision \naddresses the needs of a rural and indigenous Alaska Native community.\n  The first three of these provisions are particularly meaningful as \nthey acknowledge the historical contributions and preserve Hawaii's \nunique heritage for future generations. The remembrance and \nrevitalization of our culture, heritage, and natural resources are an \nessential way to build upon the values and traditions of our past and \nmove forward into the future. I am proud that the people of Hawaii, \nthrough partnerships at the State and\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\nFederal levels, have embraced this opportunity. These efforts \nperpetuate a legacy to be embraced by not only the people of Hawaii, \nbut a legacy to be shared with people across this Nation. I am \nconfident that these measures which I sponsored will enable continued \ngood work and progress in promoting and protecting the natural and \ncultural resources of my home State.\n  The Kalaupapa Memorial Act would authorize a memorial to be \nestablished at Kalaupapa National Historical Park in Hawaii. This long \noverdue memorial will honor and perpetuate the memory of those Hansen's \ndisease patients who were forcibly relocated to the Kalaupapa \ncommunity, which is located on a remote peninsula on the Island of \nMolokai.\n  For over 100 years, from 1866 to 1969, Kalaupapa was a colony on the \nHawaiian island of Molokai where patients with Hansen's disease, also \nknown as leprosy, were forced to live. These individuals were directed \nto live there by the Hawaiian and, later, the American Governments in \nthe belief that leprosy was rampantly contagious and that isolation was \nthe only effective means of controlling the disease. In 1865, acting on \nthe counsel of his American and European advisers, Lot Kamehameha, the \nHawaiian King, signed into law ``An Act to Prevent the Spread of \nLeprosy,'' which criminalized the disease. In the ensuing 103 years, \nmen, women, and children of all ages--including those who were \nmistakenly believed to have leprosy--were captured and forcibly exiled \nto the brutal northern coast of Molokai, chosen due to its isolated and \ninaccessible location.\n  Ultimately, more than 8,000 people were sent to Kalaupapa, of which \nonly about 1,300 graves have been identified. Most of those patients \nwho were sent to Kalaupapa before 1900 have no marked graves. Others \nwere buried in places marked with a cross or a bare tombstone, but \nthose markers have seen great deterioration over time. As a result, \nthere are many family members and descendants of these residents who \ncannot find the graves of their loved ones and are unable to properly \nhonor and pay tribute to them.\n  This measure would authorize a nonprofit organization consisting of \nKalaupapa residents and their families and friends, and known as ``Ka \n`Ohana O Kalaupapa,'' to establish a memorial at a suitable location in \nthe park to honor the memory of the 8,000 residents who lived at the \nKalaupapa and Kalawao communities. This monument will provide closure \nand a sense of belonging to these many family members, who have no \nknowledge of their ancestors' whereabouts. Through this monument, the \nHansen's disease patients will forever be memorialized as having been a \npart of the history of Kalaupapa.\n  The Na Hoa Pili O Kaloko-Honokohau Advisory Commission Act would \nreauthorize the Advisory Commission for Kaloko-Honokohau National \nHistorical Park through 2018. Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical \nPark, located on the western coast of the Island of Hawaii, was \nestablished in 1978 to provide for the preservation, interpretation, \nand perpetuation of traditional Native Hawaiian activities and culture; \nto demonstrate historic land use patterns; and to provide for the \neducation, enjoyment, and appreciation of traditional Native Hawaiian \nactivities and culture. This Advisory Commission advises the National \nPark Service on historical, archaeological, cultural, and interpretive \nprograms for the park and serves as a living resource for the \neducation, enjoyment, and understanding of traditional Hawaiian culture \nand activities. This legislation would extend the Advisory Commission \nthrough the end of 2018.\n  The Outdoor Recreation Act of 1963 Amendments Act seeks to authorize \n$500,000 in funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2017 to the National \nTropical Botanical Gardens. The measure will authorize appropriations \nto the corporation governing the Botanical Gardens for operation and \nmaintenance expenses. These funds will contribute towards the private \ndonations that the Botanical Gardens already raises to support its \nannual operating budget of over $10 million.\n  The National Tropical Botanical Gardens is a private charitable \ncorporation, chartered by legislation that was enacted in 1964 to \nfoster horticultural research, education, and plant preservation. Its \ncongressional charter mandates the Botanical Gardens to preserve, for \nthe people of the United States, species of tropical plant life \nthreatened with extinction.\n\n  Conservation is one of the National Tropical Botanical Garden's key \nroles. This role has become even more critical as tropical plant \nspecies continue to become extinct at a disturbing rate. As many as \none-third of the remaining global plant species are considered at risk \nof extinction. Since 1976, the National Tropical Botanical Gardens has \nrecognized and worked with urgency to preserve and cultivate native \nHawaiian plants, and has made its program of preserving Hawaii's \nendangered and threatened flora a matter of the highest priority.\n  The unique flora of 1,300 species that has evolved over millions of \nyears in Hawaii represents a significant resource to the people of the \nUnited States in terms of the biodiversity it represents. Further, many \nof these botanic species serve as the foundation of entire ecosystems, \nserving as food sources or habitats for other larger species that are \neither threatened or endangered. These are species that are not \nrepresented in any of the other 49 States in our Nation. Each of these \nspecies contains unique genes that express themselves in a myriad of \nways. Each time we lose a species to extinction we lose an \nirreplaceable reservoir of unique genes and eliminate their usage as a \npossible benefit to humanity.\n  The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act incorporates many of \nthe recommendations on the subject issued by the Department of the \nInterior in 2000. This act would help protect and preserve the nation's \nimportant fossil resources that are found on Federal lands for the \nbenefit of our citizens. This provision will still allow the practice \nof casual collecting that is being enjoyed on Federal lands. While I \nrecognize the educational benefits and the major fossil discoveries \nmade by amateur collectors and curio hunters, fossil theft has become \nan increasing problem. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important \nnatural resources that have become increasingly endangered due to an \nincrease in the illegal collection of fossil specimens for commercial \nsale. However, at this time there is no unified policy regarding the \ntreatment of fossils by Federal lands management agencies which would \nhelp protect and conserve fossil specimens. We risk the deterioration \nor loss of these valuable scientific resources. This act will correct \nthat omission by providing uniformity to the patchwork of statutes and \nregulations that currently exist. It will create a comprehensive \nnational policy for preserving and managing fossils and other artifacts \nfound on Federal lands, and will prevent future illegal trade. I would \nlike to emphasize that this bill covers only paleontological remains on \nFederal lands and in no way affects archaeological or cultural \nresources under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 or \nthe Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n  Lastly, I express my support for a provision in the omnibus lands \nbill that I cosponsored in the 110th Congress, S. 1680, the Izembek and \nAlaska Peninsula Refuge and Wilderness Enhancement Act. This measure \npaves the way for a road that would provide dependable and safe year-\nround access for the residents of King Cove in Alaska to the nearby \nCold Bay Airport. I believe that the 800 residents of King Cove, most \nof whom are Native Aleut, have an absolute right to a means of \ntransport that is accessible under all weather conditions, including \ngale force winds and fog. This reliable means of getting to the airport \nwill help address many of the community's safety, health, and medical \nconcerns because the Cold Bay Airport is an all-weather airport.\n  In addition to providing an essential passageway, this provision will \nauthorize a land transfer in which nearly 56,000 acres of pristine land \nwill be classified as wildlife refuge wilderness. In contrast, only \nabout 2,000 acres of Federal land could potentially be exchanged for \nthe purpose of constructing a one-lane gravel road. This measure has \nbeen in the making for 10 years. I commend the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee for working across the aisle to modify and refine \nthe original language to be acceptable to all parties and stakeholders. \nNeither\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\nthe land exchange nor the construction of the road will occur without a \nstringent environmental impact statement required under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 and assurances by the Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior that the construction of the road and the \nland exchange are in the public interest and sufficient environmental \nsafeguards are in place.\n  I strongly support the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 and \nthose provisions that protect and preserve the historical contributions \nmade by Hawaii's environmental and cultural heritage. We must protect \nour legacies, and I encourage my colleagues to join in keeping our \nprecious national resources and historic sites available for future \ngenerations.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, today, the Senate can be very proud of \na very significant accomplishment for the enjoyment and protection of \nwilderness areas, historical sites, national parks, forests, trails and \nscenic rivers. Collectively, this is one of the most sweeping \nconservation bills the Senate has passed in many years.\n  This bill has been through many twists and turns over the last year. \nBut today's successful vote could not have been possible without the \ntenacity and dedication of the Majority Leader.\n  I thank the majority leader for his steadfast support and dedication \nto seeing that these important public land priorities become law.\n  There are a number my bills in this omnibus lands package that I \nwould like to speak to.\n  First, the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail Designation Act. \nThis bill will create a National Park Service trail to celebrate the \nremarkable geologic history of the Pacific Northwest region. This bill \nhas enjoyed regional, bipartisan support. I would like to thank \nSenators Murray, Wyden, Crapo, and my former colleagues Senators Smith \nand Craig for working with me on this legislation.\n  There are too many people to thank by name but I want to acknowledge \nthe dedication of the Ice Age Floods Institute, particularly its \nPresident, Gary Kleinknecht, who has worked tirelessly to educate our \ncountry on the significance of the Ice Age Floods Geologic Trail.\n  In many ways, the members of the Institute serve as the proteges of \npeople like University of Washington professor J. Harlan Bretz and USGS \ngeologist Joseph Pardee, who fought to make credible their hypothesis \nabout the historic existence of the Ice Age Floods.\n  This is a wonderful day for many communities, scientists, and Ice Age \nFloods enthusiasts throughout the Pacific Northwest, and for tourism \nand geologic education.\n  The Ice Age Floods Institute has promoted the development of an Ice \nAge Floods National Geologic Trail for over 12 years. With the growing \ninterest and enthusiasm for this concept, this Geologic Trail is a long \ntime coming. The story of the Ice Age Floods is a truly amazing story \nof the forces of nature and their impact on our lives.\n  When geologists first saw the vast Columbia Basin in eastern \nWashington, they recognized that glaciers and flowing water had played \na large part in shaping the extraordinary landscape, with its canyons, \nbuttes, dry cataracts, boulder fields, and gravel bars.\n  During the last Ice Age, some 13,000 to 18,000 years ago, an ice cap \ncovered almost all of Canada and extended down across much of the \nPacific Northwest. In Idaho, a 2,000-foot-high glacier backed water up \nin western Montana until it formed Glacial Lake Missoula, totaling 530 \ncubic miles or more than Lakes Erie and Ontario combined.\n\n  When Glacial Lake Missoula deepened enough, the sheer force of the \nbacked up water undermined the glacial ice dam, and the ice give way in \na cracking explosion. The huge lake was released all at once.\n  When the dam broke, a towering mass of water and ice was released and \nswept across parts of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon on its way to the \nocean.\n  The peak rate of flow was ten times the combined flow of all the \nrivers of the world. The huge lake may have emptied in as little as 2 \nor 3 days.\n  Geologists at the University of Washington counted 89 floods without \nreaching bottom, leading to present-day estimates of up to 100 \ncatastrophic water releases.\n  The glacial ice dam would break, sparking cataclysmic floods, fresh \nice would eventually flow from Canada to once more create an ice dam \nand Lake Missoula, and the cycle would be repeated every 50 years or \nso. It ended only with the melting of the continental ice cap.\n  These epic floods fundamentally changed the geography and way of life \nin the Pacific Northwest. The coulees, buttes, boulder fields, lakes, \nridges and gravel bars they left behind still define the unique \nlandscape of our State and our region today.\n  These floods are a remarkable part of our natural heritage. They have \nprofoundly affected the geography and ways of life in the region but \nhave remained largely unknown to the general public.\n  The legacy of the floods includes not only stark scabland and \ndramatic dry coulees and cataracts, but also exceptionally fertile, \nproductive farmland, and significant wetlands and aquifers.\n  Creating a National Park Service trail to recognize and celebrate how \nthese floods literally shaped the face of our state will provide an \nunparalleled educational resource for Washingtonians and visitors from \nacross the country.\n  It will also spur economic development and create jobs in local \ncommunities across eastern and central Washington.\n  I appreciate the Senate's attention to this bill that will help \neducate and interpret one of the largest flooding events known to \nscience.\n  To date, more than 30 entities spanning State and local governments, \nchambers of commerce, and other civic and community organization \nsupport creation of the trail concept.\n  This Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 also includes my \nSnoqualmie Pass Land Conveyance Act. This hill would transfer an acre \nand a half of Forest Service land to the Snoqualmie Pass fire district \nto help them build a new fire station.\n  I specifically thank the fire district commissioner Chris Caviezel \nfor working so hard on behalf of the people at Snoqualmie Pass and \nproviding top rate emergency services at one of the most traveled \nmountain passes in the country.\n  During our recent winter storms, which brought several feet of snow, \nfollowing by pounding rain and massive land slides at the Pass, Chris \nhas been on the front lines providing tireless and dedicated round the \nclock public service to keep Snoqualmie Pass safe.\n  The Snoqualmie Pass Fire Department serves a portion of two counties \non both sides of the Cascade Mountains along Interstate 90, a community \nof 350 full-time residents that peaks to 1,500 during the ski season.\n  Additionally, the ski area estimates 20,000 patrons on a busy \nweekend, and the Department of Transportation estimates that up to \n60,000 vehicles travel through the fire district on a busy day, making \nit the busiest mountain highway in the country.\n  This area is also the major transportation corridor for goods and \nservices between eastern and western Washington. The all-volunteer fire \ndepartment averages over 300 calls a year with about a 10 percent \nannual increase in call volumes, which is more than triple the amount \nof calls a typical all-volunteer fire department would respond to in a \nyear.\n  Eighty-four percent of those incidents are for nontax paying \nresidents. Consequently, the fire department has the characteristics of \na large city with the limited resources of a small community.\n  In recent years, this area has been the scene of major winter \nsnowstorms, multi-vehicle accidents, and even avalanches.\n  The fire district is often the first responder to incidents in the \narea, which is prone to rock slides and avalanches and it is not \nuncommon for this community to be isolated for hours or even days at a \ntime.\n  Several thousand people can be stranded at the pass during those \nperiods when the Pass is closed and while the Department of \nTransportation works quickly to get the roads back open, it can be very \ntaxing on local resources.\n  For decades, the fire district has been leasing its current site from \nthe Forest Service. They operate out of an aging building that was not \ndesigned to be a fire station.\n\n[[Page S428]]\n\n  Through their hard work and dedication, they have served their \ncommunity ably despite this building's many shortcomings. However, with \ntraffic on the rise and the need for emergency services in the area \ngrowing, the fire district needs to move to a true fire station.\n  The fire district has identified a nearby site that would better \nserve the public safety needs at the pass. This location would provide \neasy access to the interstate in either direction, reducing emergency \nresponse times.\n  The parcel is on Forest Service property, immediately adjacent to a \nfreeway interchange, between a frontage road and the interstate itself. \nThe parcel was formerly a disposal site during construction of the \nfreeway and is now a gravel lot.\n  It is my understanding that there are offers of support to construct \na new fire station from State and local officials, and to mitigate any \neffects of construction, and I support those efforts.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Murray and my colleagues on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to review this issue and bring \nthis bill forward. I look forward to continuing to work with the \ncommunity at the pass and my colleagues to improve public safety in the \narea.\n  This Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 also includes my \nPacific Northwest National Scenic Trail Act. This bill would designate \nthe Pacific Northwest trail a national scenic trail.\n  The Pacific Northwest is home to some of the most pristine and \nbreathtaking scenery this country has to offer--from vast patches of \nforest and steep, snow capped mountain ranges to sandy beaches, rocky \nocean coast, and green pastures.\n  The Pacific Northwest Trail, zigzagging from the Continental Divide \nto the Pacific Coast, offers all of these spectacular views. The \nPacific Northwest Trail, running from the Continental Divide to the \nPacific Coast, is 1,200 miles long and ranks among the most scenic \ntrails in the world.\n  This carefully chosen path runs through the Rocky Mountains, Selkirk \nMountains, Pasayten Wilderness, North Cascades, Olympic Mountains, and \nWilderness Coast. From beginning to end it passes through three States, \ncrosses three national parks, and winds through seven national forests.\n  And designating the Pacific Northwest trail a national scenic trail \nwill give it the proper recognition, bring benefits to neighboring \nrural communities, and promote its protection, development, and \nmaintenance.\n  In 1980, the National Park Service and the Forest Service completed a \nfeasibility study of the proposed Pacific Northwest trail. And the \nstudy concluded that the Pacific Northwest trail has the scenic and \nrecreational qualities needed for designation as a national scenic \ntrail.\n  Today, approximately 950 miles of the Pacific Northwest trail are \ncompleted and provide significant outdoor recreational experiences to \ncitizens and visitors of the United States.\n  With more recognition and more people from all over the country \n``putting on their hiking boots,'' the trail will receive more \neligibility for grants funding and increased attention, which in turn \nwill result in increased use and more economic activity in rural areas.\n  National scenic trails provide recreation, conservation, and \nenjoyment of significant scenic, historic, natural, and cultural \nqualities. The Pacific Northwest trail is a national prize and should \nbe recognized as such.\n  This Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 also includes my \nwildland firefighter safety legislation. This legislation will improve \naccountability and transparency in wildland firefighter safety training \nprograms. Wildland firefighting and the safety of wildland firefighters \nis vitally important to our brave men and women who battle these \nblazes, and for the communities that depend on them.\n  When wildfires do occur we rely on courageous men and women to \nprotect our communities and natural resources. Every summer, we send \nthousands of brave firefighters into harm's way to protect our Nation's \nrural communities and public lands.\n  Of course, fighting fires is inherently dangerous. But we must not \nabide preventable deaths: We must not lose firefighters simply because \nrules are broken, policies are ignored, and no one is held accountable.\n  Six years ago, Washington State suffered a horrible tragedy. On July \n10, 2001, near Winthrop in Okanogan County, during the second worst \ndrought in Washington history, the Thirtymile fire burned out of \ncontrol and four courageous firefighters died. Sadly, subsequent \ninvestigations revealed that they didn't have to die. The Forest \nService has said the tragedy ``could have been prevented.''\n  Since then, the courage of the Thirtymile families, standing up and \ndemanding change, has had a positive impact on the safety of our \nwildland firefighters. But we must do much more.\n  Through training and certification we can lower the risk to the brave \nmen and women who protect our forests and communities. It's critical \nthat Congress is actively engaged to ensure this happens.\n  An inspector general's report released in March 2006 found problems \nin the Forest Service's oversight of contracting firefighting crews. \nHundreds are contracted by the Forest Service and State agencies every \nyear to fight fires. Roughly one-third of the records it sampled showed \nthat fire fighters' qualification standards had not been met. Too many \nhave been dispatched to fight fires without the necessary preparation.\n  This is not new. A 2003 Seattle Times report cited an internal Forest \nService memo identifying the lack of accountability in the contract \nfirefighting program. A 2004 GAO report found that insufficiently \ntrained contract crews hampered firefighting efforts. And a 2004 IG \naudit found that at the time the Forest Service could not monitor the \ncertification of more than 80 percent of its own firefighters. That is \nunacceptable.\n  This legislation is a very modest yet important proposal. The Senate \nhas already passed it once as an amendment to the 2003 healthy forests \nlegislation, but sadly, it was not included in the conference version \nof the bill.\n  It is clear: this bill's provisions are still a necessary tool to \nensure that Congress and Federal wildland firefighting agencies are as \nproactive as possible in protecting the lives of wildland firefighters.\n  First, the Wildland Firefighter Safety and Transparency Act requires \nthe Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to track the funds they \nspend on firefighter safety and training. Congress and taxpayers \ndeserve to know whether and how Federal funds are being spent to ensure \nthe safety of firefighters.\n  Improved accountability means improved safety: I hope the Forest \nService will agree to track its funds as part of the administration's \nannual budget request.\n  Second, my legislation requires the Secretaries to report to Congress \nannually on their departments' safety and training programs. We need to \nmonitor Federal firefighting agencies and ensure commitments to reform \nare being acted upon. An annual check-in on safety programs from \nCongress is essential to making that happen.\n  Finally, my bill would require the Forest Service to ensure that \nprivate firefighting crews working under federal contracts receive \ntraining consistent with their Federal counterparts. This is critical \nnot only to protect those private crews but also to safeguard the \nFederal, State and tribal employees who stand shoulder-to-shoulder with \nthe contractors on the fire line.\n  And so we have an obligation to protect and prepare the brave \nfirefighters we send into harm's way. I look forward to working with my \nHouse colleagues on approving this legislation.\n  All of this could not have been accomplished without the strong \nsupport and hard work and dedication of the majority leader and I thank \nthe leader for successfully moving these priorities.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act \nof 2009 (S. 22) combines more than 160 individual bills to protect \nAmerica's wilderness and responsibly manage our natural resources. The \nindividual measures in this bill were originally introduced by nearly \nequal numbers of Democratic and Republican Senators and the vast \nmajority have broad bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page S429]]\n\n  S. 22 would protect over 2 million acres of land by designating it as \nwilderness, making it the largest expansion of the National Wilderness \nPreservation System in almost 15 years.\n  The new and expanded wilderness areas established by this bill would \nspan nine States and include such treasures as: Pictured Rocks National \nLakeshore in Michigan; Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia; \nOregon's Mount Hood; Idaho's Owyhee canyons; the Sierra Nevada \nMountains of California; the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado; \nZion National Park in Utah; as well as wilderness-quality lands in \nVirginia and New Mexico.\n  S. 22 would also protect more than 1,000 miles of free-flowing rivers \nby adding them to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. It would \nadd thousands of new miles of trails to the National Trails System, \nexpand the National Park System, and establish new National \nConservation Areas.\n  The Omnibus Public Land Management Act would create new National \nHeritage Areas and authorize additions to the National Park System to \npreserve historical sites, including the creation of the Abraham \nLincoln Birthplace National Historic Park in Kentucky.\n  The package also contains critical measures to responsibly manage our \nNation's water resources, including a provision to assess the impact of \nclimate change on our national water supply, authorizations to repair \nwater infrastructure, and the resolution of important water settlements \nin the West.\n  Other key provisions include the establishment of a 26-million-acre \nNational Landscape Conservation System and protecting more than 1 \nmillion acres of Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest from oil and \ngas development.\n  In its waning days, the current administration went forward with a \ncontroversial oil and gas lease sale in Utah that included wilderness \nquality lands near several national parks. This sale highlights the \nneed for Congress to come together and protect our public lands and \nprecious natural resources for future generations.\n  I support this package to protect our wilderness areas and preserve \nthe country's natural resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this package would not have been \npossible without the dedicated work of the majority leader over the \npast several months. I wish to particularly thank him for his \ncommitment to calling up this bill early in this Congress and \nproceeding with it. I wish to also acknowledge the excellent work and \nenergy of the Natural Resources Committee's new ranking minority member \nMs. Murkowski. We have been able to work together to develop a truly \nbipartisan combination of bills which is reflected in the broad support \nfor this package. Of course, I wish to acknowledge the role of Senator \nDomenici, who was the ranking member in the prior Congress, for his \nhard work that also is reflected in this legislation.\n  I wish to also recognize the work of three of our subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members: Senators Akaka and Burr on the National \nParks Subcommittee, Senators Wyden and Barrasso from the Public Lands \nand Forests Subcommittee, Senator Johnson and Senator Corker of the \nWater and Power Subcommittee. Most of the hearings for the bills in \nthis package were held in those subcommittees. These Senators laid much \nof the groundwork for today's vote. Of course, I wish to recognize \nChairman Rahall of the House Natural Resources Committee for all his \nwork and the work of his staff to resolve any differences that could \nhave existed with the other body.\n  We have had superb staff work in developing this legislation. Let me \nparticularly mention David Brooks, Kara Finkler and, of course, our \nstaff director, Bob Simon, as well as Sam Fowler, the counsel for our \nEnergy and Natural Resources staff; also, Mike Connor, who worked very \nhard on many of the water provisions contained in the legislation; \nScott Miller, who worked on many of the forest-related sections of this \nlegislation. I know Senator Murkowski and, prior to her, Senator \nDomenici, also had excellent staff work on the Republican side, which \nresulted in this legislation coming together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  So I will put a more complete statement acknowledging the great work \nof members of our committee staff in the Record and elaborate on that \nas the day proceeds, but I do wish to mention them now.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from Oklahoma is here to speak. \nHow much time remains on the two sides? I know he has 5 minutes. Is \nthere any time remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the majority \nside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, in thinking about where we are today, I \nasked myself what the average Oklahoman would ask of me about this \nbill, or the average person from Wyoming or California.\n  As I think about it, we have a bill that has 45 blatant earmarks in \nit. It is not a new day in Washington. Despite arguments to the \ncontrary, we are going to significantly alter our access to millions of \nbarrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas by what we \nare doing. We are going to create a further imbalance. We have almost \n107 million acres of wilderness area. We are going to add another 2.2 \nmillion acres to that today. We are going to trample on property rights \nas we haven't in decades, both directly and indirectly. I asked myself: \nWhy are we doing it? I believe we are doing it because we are thinking \nin the very short term. I also believe we are doing it because we pride \nourselves in the parochial benefits that we can return to our States at \nthe expense of the best judgment in terms of decisionmaking for our \nfuture.\n  As has been noted on this floor, there are many of these bills that I \ndon't approve that don't have an impact, that aren't earmarks, that \naren't going to take property rights away, that aren't going to limit \nour access to available oil and natural gas, proven reserves, but \nnevertheless we are going to do those things today, and there are going \nto be 20 or 25 votes against it. That doesn't mean the people who are \npromoting this are any more genuine or sincere than I am, but I think \nwhat it does mean is we have a short-term, myopic-focused leadership in \nthe Congress that does not weigh properly the benefits of pleasing the \nparochial interests at the expense of our future.\n  So I have fought very hard for many months to try to make sure a \nmajority of these bills don't become law--not because I am opposed to \nwilderness or heritage areas but because I am for constitutional right \nof property ownership, because I know the more and more we take away \nfrom our ability to fill the gap as we transition to alternative \nenergy, the more money we are going to fund to those people who would \nlike to see us nonexistent.\n  It is a privilege to serve in this body. It is a privilege to serve \nwith gentlemen such as the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of \nthis committee, and to benefit from his integrity and his demeanor and \ncooperation, but it is also a disappointment that, in my line of \nthinking, when you talk with the average American, we shouldn't be \ndoing anything to take away property rights. We should be doing \neverything to assure ourselves increased access to energy in the \nfuture. We should, for sure, eliminate this blatant, corrupt process of \nearmarking, not because it is corrupt in terms of at this time or at \nthat time; it is corrupt because it ignores the future and the costs \nand the lack of priority about how we should be spending what are going \nto be very limited resources in the future.\n  So I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to attempt to \nput forward what I think are important principles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I had a conversation with the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S430]]\n\nRepublican leader, and based on that conversation, I am going to \npropound the following unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 181, regardless \nof the outcome, the Senate proceed to the consideration of calendar No. \n16, S. J. Res. 5, the disapproval resolution relating to Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act, and that the vote on passage of the joint \nresolution occur at 4:30 p.m., notwithstanding rule XII, paragraph 4; \nthat the time be divided as provided for under the statute; that at 2 \np.m. the consideration and debate be interrupted for the swearing in of \nSenator-appointee Burris and that the time utilized be charged against \nthe majority; and that at 4:30 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote \non the joint resolution, with no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the \nsecond vote on cloture, there be 4 minutes equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Mikulski and Enzi or their designees, and \nthat the second vote in the sequence be 10 minutes in duration.\n  I suggest this is the so-called Lilly Ledbetter legislation about \nwhich we have been talking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the engrossment and \nthird reading of the bill, as amended.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill, S. 22, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), and the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 21, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 3 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--21\n\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Biden\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Kennedy\n  The bill (S. 22), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In the event that the final cost \n     allocation indicates that the costs properly assignable to \n     the contractor are less than what the contractor has paid, \n     the Secretary is authorized and directed to credit such \n     overpayment as an offset against any outstanding or future \n     obligation of the contractor.\n       (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's \n     compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment \n     of the construction costs as provided in subsection \n     (a)(3)(A), the provisions of section 213(a) and (b) of the \n     Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) shall apply to \n     lands in such district.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of subsection (a), or subsection \n     (b), upon a contractor's compliance with and discharge of the \n     obligation of repayment of the construction costs as provided \n     in paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall waive the pricing provisions of section \n     3405(d) of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \n     Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) for such \n     contractor, provided that such contractor shall continue to \n     pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and other \n     charges applicable to such repayment contracts pursuant to \n     the then-current rate-setting policy and applicable law.\n       (3) Provisions of the Settlement applying to Friant \n     Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term water \n     service contracts shall also apply to contracts executed \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (d) Reduction of Charge for Those Contracts Converted \n     Pursuant to Subsection (a)(1).--\n       (1) At the time all payments by the contractor required by \n     subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed, the Secretary shall \n     reduce the charge mandated in section 10007(1) of this part, \n     from 2020 through 2039, to offset the financing costs as \n     defined in section 10010(d)(3). The reduction shall be \n     calculated at the time all payments by the contractor \n     required by subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed. The \n     calculation shall remain fixed from 2020 through 2039 and \n     shall be based upon anticipated average annual water \n     deliveries, as mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the \n     contractor, for the period from 2020 through 2039, and the \n     amounts of such reductions shall be discounted using the\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\n     Treasury Rate; provided, that such charge shall not be \n     reduced to less than $4.00 per acre foot of project water \n     delivered; provided further, that such reduction shall be \n     implemented annually unless the Secretary determines, based \n     on the availability of other monies, that the charges \n     mandated in section 10007(1) are otherwise needed to cover \n     ongoing federal costs of the Settlement, including any \n     federal operation and maintenance costs of facilities that \n     the Secretary determines are needed to implement the \n     Settlement. If the Secretary determines that such charges are \n     necessary to cover such ongoing federal costs, the Secretary \n     shall, instead of making the reduction in such charges, \n     reduce the contractor's operation and maintenance obligation \n     by an equivalent amount, and such amount shall not be \n     recovered by the United States from any Central Valley \n     Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the \n     obligation of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a \n     transfer agreement with a non-federal operating entity.\n       (2) If the calculated reduction in paragraph (1), taking \n     into consideration the minimum amount required, does not \n     result in the contractor offsetting its financing costs, the \n     Secretary is authorized and directed to reduce, after October \n     1, 2019, any outstanding or future obligations of the \n     contractor to the Bureau of Reclamation, other than the \n     charge assessed and collected under section 3407(d) of Public \n     law 102-575, by the amount of such deficiency, with such \n     amount indexed to 2020 using the Treasury Rate and such \n     amount shall not be recovered by the United States from any \n     Central Valley Project contractor, provided nothing herein \n     shall affect the obligation of the contractor to make \n     payments pursuant to a transfer agreement with a non-Federal \n     operating entity.\n       (3) Financing costs, for the purposes of this subsection, \n     shall be computed as the difference of the net present value \n     of the construction cost identified in subsection (a)(3)(A) \n     using the full Treasury Rate as compared to using one half of \n     the Treasury Rate and applying those rates against a \n     calculated average annual capital repayment through 2030.\n       (4) Effective in 2040, the charge shall revert to the \n     amount called for in section 10007(1) of this part.\n       (5) For purposes of this section, ``Treasury Rate'' shall \n     be defined as the 20 year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) \n     rate published by the United States Department of the \n     Treasury as of October 1, 2010.\n       (e) Satisfaction of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the first release of Interim Flows or \n     Restoration Flows, pursuant to paragraphs 13 or 15 of the \n     Settlement, any short- or long-term agreement, to which 1 or \n     more long-term Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit \n     contractor that converts its contract pursuant to subsection \n     (a) is a party, providing for the transfer or exchange of \n     water not released as Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection \n     3405(a)(1)(A) and (I) of the Reclamation Projects \n     Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) \n     without the further concurrence of the Secretary as to \n     compliance with said subsections if the contractor provides, \n     not later than 90 days before commencement of any such \n     transfer or exchange for a period in excess of 1 year, and \n     not later than 30 days before commencement of any proposed \n     transfer or exchange with duration of less than 1 year, \n     written notice to the Secretary stating how the proposed \n     transfer or exchange is intended to reduce, avoid, or \n     mitigate impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim \n     Flows or Restoration Flows or is intended to otherwise \n     facilitate the Water Management Goal, as described in the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall promptly make such notice \n     publicly available.\n       (2) Determination of reductions to water deliveries.--Water \n     transferred or exchanged under an agreement that meets the \n     terms of this subsection shall not be counted as a \n     replacement or an offset for purposes of determining \n     reductions to water deliveries to any Friant Division long-\n     term contractor except as provided in paragraph 16(b) of the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall, at least annually, make \n     publicly available a compilation of the number of transfer or \n     exchange agreements exercising the provisions of this \n     subsection to reduce, avoid, or mitigate impacts to water \n     deliveries caused by the Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     or to facilitate the Water Management Goal, as well as the \n     volume of water transferred or exchanged under such \n     agreements.\n       (3) State law.--Nothing in this subsection alters State law \n     or permit conditions, including any applicable geographical \n     restrictions on the place of use of water transferred or \n     exchanged pursuant to this subsection.\n       (f) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--\n     Implementation of the provisions of this section shall not \n     alter the repayment obligation of any other long-term water \n     service or repayment contractor receiving water from the \n     Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would \n     otherwise have been properly assignable to the Friant \n     contractors absent this section, including operations and \n     maintenance costs, construction costs, or other capitalized \n     costs incurred after the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     other such contractors.\n       (g) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall \n     be construed to affect the right of any Friant Division, \n     Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit long-term contractor to use a \n     particular type of financing to make the payments required in \n     paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(A) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 10011. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK \n                   SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal laws and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for any \n     species listed pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the \n     reintroduced population of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon, including protections pursuant to \n     existing biological opinions or new biological opinions \n     issued by the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries; and\n       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the \n     reintroduction.\n       (e) FERC Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley \n     Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the \n     Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its \n     authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in \n     proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, \n     Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with \n     subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the \n     Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the \n     designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends \n     first.\n       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing \n     prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species \n     because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to \n     such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon.\n       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended \n     or shall be construed--\n       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.); or\n       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other \n     application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.).\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\n              PART II--STUDY TO DEVELOP WATER PLAN;

Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes \nequally divided between Senators Mikulski and Enzi.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, to vote for the legislation that is pending, which is \nthe cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the Lilly Ledbetter Act. \nThe reason we are advocating cloture on the motion to proceed is that \nwe do not have to filibuster this bill because we guarantee an open \nprocess, that Senators will be able to offer amendments. We will be \nable to debate with civility and comity, arrive at good ideas, consider \nall good ideas and so on, so we do not need to filibuster. Second, we \ndo not need to delay. We need to vote for the motion to proceed because \nthat is what the American people are telling us to do. Much is talked \nabout economic stimulus, but if you want to help women, let's start \npaying them equal pay for equal or comparable work. That is what the \nLilly Ledbetter bill will ensure. It will restore the law to the way it \nwas before the Supreme Court decision on Ledbetter v. Goodyear.\n  One of the objections to the bill is that the Ledbetter bill will \ntrigger lawsuits. Nothing could be further from the truth because it \ndid not trigger, open-ended, millions of lawsuits before the Supreme \nCourt decision.\n  We need to act. It is great to talk about a stimulus bill, but the \nreal stimulus is paying people for what they do. Madam President, you \nshould know.\n  This is a very serious bill. I know what my colleagues are talking \nabout is important, but women are waiting for us to act, so Senators, \nif they could wait a minute, we could move ahead.\n  The Supreme Court rule is that a pay discrimination lawsuit must be \nfiled with the EEOC within 180 days of the initial decision to pay her \nless than men performing similar acts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have spent my 12 years in the Senate \ntrying to work across the aisle, trying to get things to happen around \nhere. I found the way things happen is, if they go through the whole \nprocess--\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator, I am not done. I have not \ncompleted my statement.\n  Mr. ENZI. I think the Senator's time expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time had expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first of all, I, of course, want to \nproceed in the spirit of comity. I lost my time because this place was \nso noisy. I couldn't talk because everybody else was talking. Frankly, \nI will be happy for my colleague to speak, but I am going to ask \nunanimous consent for an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, reserving the right to object, our side \nwould like the additional 4 minutes, then, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Maryland \nhas asked for an additional 4 minutes. Is there objection to that \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, can we amend the request to allow \nboth sides to have an equal amount of added time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the request. Is there objection to \nboth sides receiving a total of 6 minutes on this matter.\n  Mr. CORKER. Reserving the right to object, what will happen to floor \ntime thereafter? Where many of us have time to talk about TARP later \non, will we still have that time set aside prior to the TARP vote at \n4:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This will take an additional 8 minutes from \nthe time that is allocated for the TARP discussion, prior to the vote \nthat is scheduled at 4:30.\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor at the \ncurrent time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. May I ask the Senator from Wyoming for the ability to \nask a unanimous consent request. I do not want to drag out the debate, \nbut I would like to make a few points. What I would like to be able to \ndo, with your concurrence, is just ask for 2 minutes and just have a \nlittle bit of say, but you have your 4 minutes.\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Maryland get an additional 2 minutes and I have 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to each side receiving a \ntotal of 4 minutes, an additional 4 minutes from the original? It is \nthe total of an additional 4 minutes on the debate on this matter. \nHearing no objection, the Senator from Maryland is recognized for an \nadditional 2 minutes and the Senator from Wyoming will receive 4 \nminutes at the conclusion of the Senator's remarks.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. That is the way we \nwill proceed on this bill.\n  Madam President, we want to be able to proceed to this bill. I assure \nmy colleagues we will have ample debate to consider any and all \namendments, but I wish to be very clear that it is time to pass the \nLilly Ledbetter bill itself. It is very important that we make sure we \nkeep the courthouse door open for people to be able to file their \nclaims where they believe wage discrimination exists.\n  Wage discrimination not only affects women, but it affects all who \nare discriminated against, and it is often minorities. We want to be \nsure we keep the courthouse door open. What we do is simply restore the \nlaw as it existed before the recent Supreme Court decision so that we \nmake sure the statute of limitations runs from the date of the actual \npayment of a discriminatory wage, not just from the time of hiring. \nThat means employees can sue employers based on each discriminatory \nact.\n  I will be yielding the floor, but before I do I am going to say once \nagain--this Senate is not in order. It has been very disturbing and \ndisrupting to stand up for something for which we have all been \nfighting so hard.\n  I yield the floor, but I am very frustrated about today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nconcern and her effort on the bill she has put together. I am going to \nexpress my strong support for S. 166, which is the Hutchison \nalternative. It is our understanding that if we are allowed to proceed, \nthere will be an open amendment process. I guess I am being asked by \nthe leader to allow that to happen once, so that we can see whether it \nis actually going to happen. But I still wish to register my objection \nto the process we appear to be going through. I worked for 12 years to \nmake this a more agreeable body, to work across the aisle.\n  We have moved, the HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee--from being the most contentious committee to being \nthe most productive committee.\n  This bill should have gone through the committee process. We solve a \nlot of things, we shorten the debate on the floor, and we eliminate the \nneed for all of these cloture motions which result in hours and hours \nof time with no productivity. I think the American people want the \nproductivity, and the reasoning that comes from the committee process \nthat winds up with a very good product. We can have that on the labor \nissues, but they have to go through committees.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I think it is very important that we deal with this issue on the \npromise that I will be able to offer my substitute because I believe it \nis a substitute that gives the right for an aggrieved employee to bring \nan action within a timeframe that is reasonable for the business to be \nable to plan.\n  I am a person who has known discrimination. I am also a former small \nbusiness owner, and I know the importance of knowing what your \nliabilities are and having clarity. That is why in the law, in every \ncause of action, we do have statutes of limitation.\n  I look forward to debating with my colleague and friend, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, to try to come to the right conclusion on a bipartisan \nbasis. I am going to vote for cloture on the promise that we will have \nan open debate on this issue and try to come to a conclusion.\n  The Senator from Wyoming makes a good point. For the future, I hope \nwe will listen to what he is saying. Committees work around here. \nCommittees are where you can do markups, where we work in a bipartisan \nway to make legislation better. We cannot write bills on the Senate \nfloor. In the future, I hope all of us will work toward allowing the \ncommittee process to work. Today, we are going to take a leap of faith \nthat we will have the amendments and that we will come to a good \nconclusion on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, the Senator from Texas and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming and all on the other side of the aisle have the assurance \nof both myself and the Democratic leadership that those amendments will \nbe offered, and we look forward to a spirited and enthusiastic debate \nin a quiet Chamber of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam Presdient, today, the Judiciary Committee is \nconducting the confirmation hearing of Mr. Eric Holder to be the next \nAttorney General of the United States. One of the Justice Department's \nessential roles in our Federal system of government is to protect the \ncivil rights of all Americans, including those that prohibit \ndiscrimination. The Bush administration's erosion of the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission's long held interpretation of our \ndiscrimination laws has created a new obstacle for victims of pay \ndiscrimination to receive justice. The Justice Department has advocated \na position that has set back the progress we had made toward \neliminating workplace discrimination. This was a mistake. \nUnfortunately, five Justices on the Supreme Court adopted the Justice \nDepartment's erroneous interpretation of congressional intent. That \ndecision necessitates our action here today. We must pass legislation \nso that employers are not rewarded for deceiving workers about their \nillegal conduct. Equal pay for equal work should be a given in this \ncountry.\n  I expect we will hear from some opponents of the bill that somehow \nthis legislation will encourage workers who are being paid less as a \nresult of discrimination to delay filing suit for equal pay. This \nargument defies logic. Anyone who heard Lilly Ledbetter's testimony \nlast year before either the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate \nHeath, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee knows that Ms. \nLedbetter, like other victims of pay discrimination, have no incentive \nto delay filing suit. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in \nLedbetter, their employers now have a great incentive to delay \nrevealing their discriminatory conduct--blanket immunity. The reality \nis that many employers do not allow their employees to learn how their \ncompensation compares to their coworkers. Workers like Ms. Ledbetter \nand their families are the ones hurt by reduced paychecks, not their \ncorporate employers. These victims have the burden of proving the \ndiscrimination occurred and that evidentiary task is only made more \ndifficult as time goes on. The bipartisan Ledbetter Fair Pay \nRestoration Act of 2009 does not disturb the protections built into \nexisting law for employers such as limiting back pay in most cases to 2 \nyears. The legislation does not eliminate the existing statute of \nlimitations. Instead, it reinstates the interpretation of when the 180 \nday time limit begins to run. In this way it allows workers who are \ncontinuing to be short-changed to challenge that ongoing discrimination \nwhen the employer conceals its initial discriminatory pay decision.\n  Opponents of the Fair Pay Restoration Act will no doubt raise even \nmore absurd reasons for opposing equal pay for equal work. They will no \ndoubt claim that somehow trial lawyers will benefit. The reality is \nthat the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision could actually lead to more \nlitigation because workers will feel the need to file premature claims \nso that time does not run out. The Congressional Budget Office has \nconcluded that this legislation ``would not establish a new cause of \naction for claims of pay discrimination'' and ``would not significantly \naffect the number of filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission'' or with the Federal courts.\n  Congress passed title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect \nemployees against discrimination with respect to compensation because \nof an individual's race, color, religion, sex or national origin but \nthe Supreme Court's\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\nLedbetter decision goes against both the spirit and clear intent of \ntitle VII of the Civil Rights Act. It also sends the message to \nemployers that wage discrimination cannot be punished as long as it is \nkept under wraps. At a time when one-third of private sector employers \nhave rules prohibiting employees from discussing their pay with each \nother, the Court's decision ignores a reality of the workplace--pay \ndiscrimination is often intentionally concealed.\n  As the executive director of the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce \nrecently noted, ``The Fair Pay Restoration Act rewards those who play \nfair--including women business owners--unlike the Supreme Court's \ndecision, which seems to give an unfair advantage to those who skirt \nthe rules.'' This legislation will encourage all corporations to treat \ntheir employees fairly.\n  Unfortunately, this bipartisan civil rights legislation was \nfilibustered in the last Congress. Considering how deeply the recent \neconomic downturn has affected American families, we cannot afford \nanother filibuster of this common sense legislation. I am pleased to \njoin Senators Mikulski, Snowe, Kennedy and others in pressing for the \nimmediate passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act of \n2009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Oregon Public Lands\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the outdoors is a great passion for the \npeople of Oregon, and it is truly a good day for Oregonians. The \nOmnibus Public Land Management Act contains protection for a number of \nour special places, our treasures; in the case of Mount Hood, an Oregon \nicon that is revered by our people.\n  I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests. \nI know how important these public lands bills are. The fact is, they \nare of special benefit from a moral perspective. What we are doing is \nguaranteeing that these beautiful lands can be passed on to future \ngenerations. But they also help fuel our economic engine. The reality \nis, the protection for the great outdoors boosts our effort to promote \nrecreation which is increasingly a major source of employment.\n  I want to take a few minutes to discuss the five pieces of wilderness \nlegislation I was heavily involved in. Many other Oregonians were as \nwell, countless Oregonians. I also give special thanks to Senator \nGordon Smith who contributed mightily to this effort, working with me \non this legislation and this package for many years.\n  The legislation passed includes seven key bills I sponsored. The five \nthat add wilderness include: the Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness \nAct of 2007; the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act; the Cascade Siskiyou \nNational Monument Voluntary and Equitable Grazing Conflict Resolution \nAct; the Oregon Badlands Wilderness Act of 2008; and the Spring Basin \nWilderness Act of 2008.\n  The Lewis and Clark Mount Hood Wilderness Act has been the product of \nyears and years of work to protect a cherished State treasure. More \npeople take pictures of Mount Hood than any other landmark in our \nState. That is saying something, because Oregon has a lot of \nbreathtaking nature to photograph.\n  Mount Hood is not just a symbol of our State. It is a monument to the \ndeep connection our people have to their land. This bill is a triumph \nof environmental protection that wouldn't have been possible without an \neffort to build a Statewide consensus bringing together thousands of \nconstituent community groups and elected officials who said: We are \ngoing to keep fighting for this until Mount Hood gets this added \nmeasure of protection.\n  Our legislation builds on the existing Mount Hood wilderness, adds \nmore Wild and Scenic rivers, and creates a recreation area to allow \ndiverse opportunities for recreation. We protect, under the bill, the \nlower elevation forests surrounding Mount Hood and our special Columbia \nRiver Gorge. The protected areas include scenic vistas, almost 127,000 \nacres of Wilderness and, in tribute to the great river-dependent \njourney of Lewis and Clark, the addition of 79 miles on 9 free-flowing \nstretches of river to the National Wild and Scenic River system.\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\n  I have a picture of the mountain that illustrates why we Oregonians \nfeel so strongly about wilderness and Mount Hood. Richard L. Kohnstamm, \nlong revered as the crusader who restored the jewel known as Timberline \nLodge, is shown here skiing under Illumination Rock. My friend Dick \nKohnstamm treasured the wildness of Mount Hood and had the vision of \nbringing national prominence to Alpine sports on the mountain. Under \nDick's guidance, Timberline Lodge was the first ski area in our country \nto become a National Historic Landmark and to have the Nation's first \nyear-round skiing. We are honored today to name the area in this \npicture the Richard L. Kohnstamm Memorial Area. It is a fitting legacy \nto an Oregonian who had remarkable foresight. In public meetings in our \nState and in letters and phone calls, we heard from over 100 community \ngroups and local governments, from members of our congressional \ndelegation, the Governor and the Bush administration. To say that this \nhas been a labor of love for many would be a gross understatement.\n  As I have indicated, countless organizations, agencies and interested \ngroups have met to discuss the development of this bill. I want to \nclarify that wilderness on Mount Hood is very important, it is also \nimportant to acknowledge that Highway 35 is an important transportation \ncorridor, connecting Interstate 84, the communities of Hood River \nCounty and the Columbia River Gorge to the recreation areas on Mount \nHood and US 26. It is part of the National Highway System and a \ndesignated freight route as well as a highway facility of statewide \nimportance--the highest designation in Oregon's highway classification \nsystem. Highway 35 runs adjacent to the East Fork of the Hood River, \nwhich will be protected as a Wild and Scenic Rivers. The Wild and \nScenic Rivers designation recognizes the outstanding scenery, \nrecreational opportunities and fish runs of the East Fork of the Hood \nRiver. During winter storms when events require emergency repairs to \nthe roads, the designation of the East Fork of Hood River is not \nintended to impair the ability of the State of Oregon to take necessary \nsteps to operate, maintain, or preserve the state highway in accordance \nto all environmental laws and processes. In particular, the State of \nOregon is considering a number of projects that will address problem \nlocations such as Polallie Creek, White River, and Newton and Clark \ncreeks where floods and debris flows have in the past resulted in \ntemporary closure of the highway. I hope the U.S. Forest Service and \nFederal Highway Administration will continue working with the State of \nOregon to find solutions that will address these problem locations in a \nmanner consistent with the designation of the East Fork as a Wild and \nScenic River.\n  It is my intention that efforts in this legislation to protect the \nWild and Scenic East and Middle Forks of the Hood River will not have \nany significant impact on the operation of the local irrigation \ndistricts, including the normal maintenance or repair of existing \ninfrastructure that is legally in use by the irrigation districts at \nthis time.\n  I am encouraged that the long standing dispute over the Cooper Spur \narea will near to a close with the passage of this legislation. \nHowever, I want to be clear that our intention is that the U.S. Forest \nService shall proceed in a timely manner in completing this land \nexchange. The land exchange should be completed within a total of 16 \nmonths. Protecting the clean drinking water in the Crystal Springs \nwatershed is of the utmost importance.\n  Two other bills in this legislation will protect two unique places on \nthe east side of the Cascades in our State. The Oregon Badlands \nWilderness Act of 2008 would designate as Wilderness almost 30,000 \nacres of the area just east of the Bend known as the Badlands. The \nlegislation will not only magnify the area's magnificent natural \nattributes, it will cement our region's well-earned reputation as a hub \nfor a wide diversity of outdoor recreation sports. In this economy, \nthat is a prospect that many central Oregon business leaders and \ncitizens enthusiastically support. In central Oregon, people can enjoy \nalmost any kind of outdoor activity--boating and biking and skiing and \nhorseback riding and hunting and riding off-road vehicles and a variety \nof sports. Environmental protection doesn't have to come at the expense \nof economic growth. This legislation is a textbook case of proving that \ntheory. It preserves the unique landscapes that bring visitors to the \nBadlands and will add to the growing value of Bend's brand as being one \nof the best places in the country to enjoy outdoor recreation, live, \nwork, and raise a family.\n\n  It also provides for two land exchanges that will benefit the new \nwilderness. I would like to specifically provide some background \nregarding the land exchange with the Central Oregon Irrigation \nDistrict. The district is an exemplary steward of natural resources in \nOregon. Established in 1918, COID provides irrigation water to over \n9,000 families across 45,000 acres of productive land in Central \nOregon's Deschutes Basin. The district's 700 miles of canals convey \nwater to farmers, ranchers, schools, parks and others in the cities of \nBend and Redmond.\n  The new wilderness area is adjacent to roughly 3.5 miles of canals \nand laterals owned and operated by the district under an 1891 Federal \nright of way. As I understand it, this right of way extends 50 feet \nfrom the toe of the canal levee to the north and south. This essential \nright of way provides the district with access to the canals and \nlaterals for routine inspection, maintenance improvements, and \nemergency repairs. The language in section 1704(e)(3) protects the \ndistrict's existing rights to the canal, including the rights provided \nunder the 1891 right of way. During our development of this \nlegislation, the boundary of the wilderness area was specifically set \nback to respect this historic and important right of way.\n  The Spring Basin Wilderness Act of 2008 would designate approximately \n8,600 acres as the Spring Basin Wilderness. Overlooking the John Day \nWild and Scenic River, the rolling hills of Spring Basin are famous for \ntheir burst of color during the spring wildflower bloom. It boasts \ncanyons and diverse geology that draws more hikers, horseback riders, \nhunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts.\n  Also among the bills in this comprehensive legislation is the Copper \nSalmon Wilderness Act. My bill on this issue protects the headwaters of \nthe north fork of the Elk River. It is a gem known as the Copper Salmon \narea. It adds 13,700 acres of new Wilderness and designates 9.3 miles \nof Wild and Scenic rivers. Copper Salmon is one of those places that \ncrystallizes Oregon's reputation as an outdoor paradise. This bill \ngives crucial protection to the area's wildlife and to the prized \nsalmon and steelhead that attract anglers from across the world. During \nthe last decade, a dedicated group of local conservationists, \nfishermen, and community leaders have worked passionately to protect \nthis area. It is one of the last intact watersheds on the southwest \nOregon coast. It is a very special treasure. Fishermen and hunters are \ngoing to come to the Copper Salmon area for generations to come. I am \nthrilled it has been protected.\n  Finally, I am pleased to join former Senator Smith on legislation to \nestablish a 23,000-acre Soda Mountain Wilderness in the Cascade \nSiskiyou National Monument Voluntary and Equitable Grazing Conflict \nResolution Act. The protections here help ensure that what we call the \nNoah's Ark of botanical diversity remains undisturbed and healthy. \nThere has been bipartisan leadership and dedicated work from people \nwithin the community. What folks of southern Oregon have shown is that \nit is possible to come up with a homegrown solution that serves the \npublic interest.\n  This legislation is a prime example of ranchers and environmentalists \nsitting down together to work out conflicts in a consensus-oriented \nfashion. They didn't look to some kind of Washington approach, a one-\nsize-fits-all approach. They said: As ranchers and conservationists, we \nare going to address this issue of grazing allotments in a thoughtful \nway. The bill enables conservation organizations to raise additional \nmoney they can use to compensate ranchers who voluntarily retire their \nFederal grazing leases. It also designates a significant amount of new \nWilderness within the monument.\n  Each one of these bills came about because Oregonians said: On the \nissue that we care so much about, the outdoors and protecting our \ntreasures, we\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\nare going to come to the table from every walk of life--urban and \nrural, environmentalist and rancher--to say that as a State it is \nextraordinarily important that we protect our treasures for future \ngenerations, and we can do it in a way that will also boost our \neconomic engine at a time when so many Oregonians are hurting and \nhaving difficulty paying the bills for the essentials.\n  I was very proud to have been the lead sponsor of these seven pieces \nof legislation. But the fact is, the real credit goes to thousands and \nthousands of Oregonians who pitched in from every corner of the State \nfor years and years, working with myself, with Congressman Walden, \nCongressman Blumenauer, and colleagues from the other body. Of course, \nI recognize Senator Smith's contribution this afternoon.\n  Today, Oregonians have something to enjoy, and they can particularly \nreflect on the fact that so many future generations of our citizens \nwill have something to be able to enjoy in the years ahead.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I would like to speak on the joint \nresolution that is before us. I would like the Presiding Officer to let \nme know how much time is available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. OK. Madam President, I wonder if the Chair might let me \nknow when 120 seconds is left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise today to talk about a very important vote that will take place \nthis afternoon. It is regarding the TARP funding. Many people in our \ncountry have come to know it as the financial rescue package, the \nbailout--a number of different terms. I was a supporter of TARP \nfunding, and based on the information we had at the time, I think that \nvote I made regarding supporting funding to credit markets was a good \nvote. This afternoon, we are going to vote on the next tranche of that \nfunding, the next level, another $350 billion in funding.\n  Let me just say that I have great respect for those who are coming in \nin this new administration. I have spent a great deal of time--based on \nthe time allotted--talking to Larry Summers. I appreciated the dialog \nwe had last night as a caucus with Rahm Emanuel and Mr. Summers. I \nspent time talking with Tim Geithner. It is my belief that should he \nmake it through the process of being confirmed, we have a team of \npeople here who I think will be very responsible and will serve our \ncountry well. I look forward to working with them in every way I can.\n  I believe the credit issue, along with the issue we have of housing, \nis the 90-percent issue our country is dealing with today economically. \nAs a matter of fact, as we look at economic stimulus issues, to me, \nmuch of that, candidly, is window dressing. Most of that is wasteful. \nMost of that is unnecessary. And most of that will do nothing \nwhatsoever to stimulate this economy based on the things that have been \nput forth today. The credit issue, though, is, in fact, in my opinion, \nthe 90-percent issue we need to solve as a country to really move us \nahead. That, combined with doing what is necessary so that housing is \nstabilized, is of utmost importance.\n  So that puts me in a very big dilemma today as it relates to this \nvote at 4:30. We have had several months now to understand what is \nhappening in the credit markets and to understand what the problem is. \nI know our Secretary today, the Secretary of Treasury, Mr. Paulson, \nhas, in many ways, had to go about this in an ad hoc way. I do not say \nthat to criticize. He was faced with a problem. He had to move through \nit. He had to make decisions and try to solve problems as he saw them.\n  But now, today, several months later, we have a more full \nunderstanding of the problem. The issue I have today with this vote--\nand I urge the incoming administration to solve this problem before the \n4:30 vote--is I would like for them to tell us, to diagnose the \nproblem, to tell the American people what the problem is in our credit \nmarkets and then to tell all of us what they are going to do with the \n$350 billion that is now being sought. I know they are not yet in \noffice. I have had very good conversations with them. But I do think it \nis incumbent upon them to tell us what the problem is and how they are \ngoing to solve it.\n  I think there are hundreds of billions of dollars of losses left in \nour banking system. My guess is it exceeds trillions, it exceeds $1 \ntrillion. The problem is that most banks in our country that hold whole \nloans--not the derivatives that are mark to market but whole loans--are \nsort of metering out their losses. Each quarter, they write down just a \nlittle bit more based on the loan losses they are seeing in a \nparticular category. They know hundreds of billions of dollars are \ncoming, and what they are doing is taking our U.S. taxpayer dollars--I \nmight say, intelligently for their self-interest--they are hoarding \nthose dollars because they know there are massive losses that are \ncoming down the road.\n  The best way to solve this problem would be for us to recognize that, \nto get down to that level today, which would mean serious \nrecapitalizations, and then build back from a base that is real. But \nright now, our banking system is operating almost like a zombie. There \nare losses that are coming that they know they have to recognize. They \nare not willing to do that. So we are in this period of time where \nbasically U.S. tax dollars are, in many ways, being frittered away \nbecause we are investing in these companies, and then they are using \nthose because they know of the losses that are coming. So I would like \nfor the administration to state that they know that, and I would like \nfor the administration to come forth with a plan that solves that \npredicament that is going to be with us for many years. I want to work \nwith them. Whether I vote this afternoon for TARP or not--and unless \nthey come forward publicly--it does not even have to be done \nlegislatively--if they will come forth publicly and define the problem \nand tell us how they are going to spend the money, it is possible I \nwill support this. I want to work with them in this regard. I hope that \nwill be forthcoming.\n  We spent a lot of time on the automotive debate. All of us came \ntogether, and we diagnosed the problem. We laid out what the problem \nwas, and we actually put forth a solution. We debated that, and \nunfortunately we did not get it done. But the fact is, the American \npublic and all of us in the Senate understood what that problem was, \nand then we talked about a precise and prescribed way of solving that \nproblem. That is exactly the thing that needs to take place as it \nrelates to this issue.\n  One of the things I think we have to understand as a country: There \nis going to be less lending. Trying to force people to make loans in a \nclimate when our society is overleveraged is not responsible. The fact \nis, there needs to be less lending, which brings me to the next point. \nWe have to acknowledge in this country that many banks are going to \nfail. Many banks are unnecessary. One of the greatest fallacies of what \nhas occurred over the last several months--and I say that with no \ncriticism but just as an observation--is that we are unwilling to let \nbad banks fail. Because of what we are doing today, we again are \nwasting taxpayer money, in combination with the fact that regulators \nare on the ground, both at the FDIC and the OCC--again, well-\nintentioned people who are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy in our \nStates by virtue of the fact that they are forcing banks to do things \nthat are not in the best interests of this economy.\n  So let me say, I want to support solving this credit problem. I want \nthe administration to come forth and explain to us as a country and us \nas a Senate their perception of what the problem is and their \nprescription for solving it; otherwise, what we are doing today, with \nhuge amounts of taxpayer money, is treating the symptoms, we are not \ntreating the core problem that exists in our credit markets. We are not \ndoing that.\n  I think today probably this TARP funding will pass. I hope the \nadministration will come forth.\n  There is 2 minutes remaining. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. One hundred twenty seconds. Thank you.\n  I think this probably will pass this afternoon. Again, I am hoping \nthat over the next 3 hours this administration will come forward and \nsay publicly the things I have asked to be said. I do not criticize \nthem if they do not. I just need to know what we are going to do on \nbehalf of the taxpayers I represent in the State of Tennessee.\n  But I want to say to them that even if this passes today and they \ncontinue on the route we have been, I know they are going to come back. \nThey are going to come back and they are going to ask for more money \nbecause on the route we are going right now, we are not going to solve \nthe problem and it is going to continue. This is what I think will \noccur.\n  What I want to say to them--to the new President, who will be sworn \nin next week, to Larry Summers, to Tim Geithner, to Rahm Emanuel, to \nall involved--I want to work with you when you come back. I want to \nwork with you with legislation that analyzes the problem and diagnoses \nit and puts in place a prescription to solve the problem.\n  I am hoping over the next few hours that will occur. If it does not, \nI am one Senator who stands ready to work with this administration that \nhas very capable people in place to solve what I believe is the most \nmajor issue affecting our economy, and that is credit and that is \nhousing.\n  Madam President, thank you for your courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am thankful Senator Corker is with \nus. He has involved himself in these matters. He said something I truly \nbelieve: that we have not been told what the problem is and what kind \nof plan really exists to fix the problem. That is the difficulty we are \nfacing. We have not had that kind of honest assessment from President \nBush's administration, and we have not had it under President-elect \nObama's administration. I think a lot of that is because they do not \nknow, and a lot of it is because they are things that cannot readily be \nfixed.\n  The credit problem is the No. 1 problem. Some people say that the \neconomy is like this big interstate, and the problem we had last \nOctober was 18-wheelers blocking the interstate, and if we could just \nget that aside and open the free markets again, everything would be OK. \nBut that was not the problem. The problem was, as Senator Corker \nindicates, much bigger than that. Fundamentally, there was a housing \nbubble, fueled by Government-sponsored programs and low-interest rates \nand a lack of discipline with respect to lenders and the sale of \nmortgage-backed assets. And this lack of discipline sort of hid the \ndanger in those transactions. That was the problem. So when these \nhouses started adjusting downward in value, because they were too \nhigh--how many people did you know who could not afford a house? They \nwere going up two and three times the rate of inflation, two and three \ntimes the increase in gross domestic product. Housing prices were going \nup. That was unsustainable, yet everybody acted as though it would \nnever fall. But it fell.\n  I remember in the early 1980s when President Reagan worked us through \nthat recession and we had to foreclose on farms and land, and savings \nand loans--which were a big part of our real estate lending market at \nthat time--failed right and left. But we took our hurts. We worked our \nway through it and created a foundation, with Mr. Volcker as the \nFederal Reserve Chairman, for 25 years of growth and progress. We did \ngo through a period in which the dot-com bubble burst, and a lot of \nthose markets have not yet recovered from that period in the late \n1990s.\n  So I guess what I am saying, first of all, is this is a very \ndifficult problem, but it is one we can work through. In the course of \nit, we have to ask ourselves exactly how it occurred, and we need our \ngovernmental leaders to tell us precisely how the legislation--and the \nmoney our American citizens allow them to utilize--will make it \nbetter. That has not been done. So we are talking today about another \nrelease of $350 billion in troubled asset funds.\n\n  This is the centerpiece of the Wall Street bailout. It was rushed \nthrough last fall in a season of panic. Many people didn't know what to \ndo. We had the Secretary of the Treasury telling us if we didn't pass \nthis and give him maximum flexibility, this economy could hit a \ndepression, and that terrified everybody. I think the fear engendered \nby all that rhetoric is still a factor in slowing the potential for our \nrecovery. But anyway, that is what happened.\n  I didn't vote for it last fall. I felt it wasn't properly presented. \nI didn't feel good about it. I didn't like buying these types of \nassets, these bad mortgages. Though it presented some plausible basis \nfor a good program, I wasn't sold. I didn't vote for it. I am glad I \ndidn't.\n  Now that it has been enacted, we have had a great amount of time to \nactually think it through and see how the program has worked so far. I \nthink we should have had more hearings. We should have called in more \nexperts. I think the new administration should have a more open \ndiscussion of the real problems out there--which I will admit the \npredecessor Bush administration didn't do either--and tell us what is \ngoing on and why we have to go forward with this.\n  I think it is pretty plain--and most people admit--we didn't see any \nprogress from the first $350 billion in this package. That is little \ndisputed, although the argument is difficult to contend with when they \nsay: Well, it might have gotten worse if we hadn't thrown $350 billion \nat it. Of course we don't know what might have happened. But I want to \nknow why we haven't had more congressional hearings, more public \ndiscussions of what is going on and how we need to fix it. Are we \nafraid of something? Why haven't we taken more time to discuss this?\n  An article in the Wall Street Journal talked about the difficulties \nwe are facing--actually, on the front page--and the article quoted one \nfinancier as saying, well, it may have helped some--this first bailout.\n  Then he said:\n\n       Nobody yet has any idea how much permanent damage may have \n     been done to the structural underpinnings of the U.S. and \n     global capitalism.\n\n  Well, I couldn't agree more. We don't know how much damage we have \ndone in this adventure.\n  The passage last fall of the TARP plan, which gave to a single, \nunelected official of the executive branch virtually complete authority \nto dispense $350 billion--maybe $700 billion, if he receives it--as he \nalone saw fit and sees fit, I think, has to be considered one of the, \nif not the, greatest abdications of congressional fiscal responsibility \nin our Nation's history. Seven hundred billion dollars is the largest \nexpenditure in the history of the Republic. I know we are going to get \nsome of that back; how much I don't know. Right now the Congressional \nBudget Office says we are going to lose about $200 billion of it--maybe \nmore--but we committed $700 billion without even knowing how it was \ngoing to be spent.\n  So if my colleagues will remember, we were told we were going to \nspend that money to buy bad mortgages, take them off the books of the \nbanks and make them able to lend money. At the House hearing, someone \nasked Secretary Paulson: What about buying stock in a bank? He said: \nOh, no. We don't want to buy stock. We have a plan. One thing he told \nus that was truthful: He wanted maximum flexibility. So when that bill \nwas written, it gave him the ability to do virtually anything with that \nmoney, including bailing out individual manufacturing companies such as \nthe Big Three, which he eventually approved out of that money. So \nwithin a week after flatly rejecting the idea that he would buy stock \nin private companies, private banks and insurance companies, the \nSecretary announced that is exactly what he was going to do.\n  He called them in and some didn't even want to participate with the \nGovernment program, but he thought if they didn't participate, it might \nlook as though they were a healthier bank than somebody else's bank, \nand he twisted their arms and virtually insisted they participate in \nthe program.\n  Then we put $100 billion into an insurance company--AIG, which is \ncompeting against other American insurance companies that operate on a \nsound basis--because they got involved\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\nin these speculative swaps, credit swaps, and buying these types of \nassets and using them as collateral. So it is a difficult thing to know \nwhere we are, but it showed two things. I don't think Secretary Paulson \ndeliberately misled Congress, although I believe he knew when he got \nthat maximum flexibility he might buy stock one day. I can't believe he \nwasn't aware he had the possibility of doing that. But I think, \nfundamentally, they don't know what to do with the money because there \nis no certain answer. I have a vision in my mind of the guy who flew \ninto the hurricane off the Gulf Coast where I live and he threw out dry \nice and he thought he could cool off the hurricane and stop the \nhurricane. So now we have the Secretary of the Treasury getting $700 \nbillion, and he thinks he can get in there and stop the financial \nhurricane by throwing money around. As steward of the taxpayers' money, \nwe need more than that. Yes, Congress has the power of the purse, but I \nwould suggest to my colleagues, that power is more than a power; it is \nfundamentally a responsibility. It is a duty to ensure that when we \nallocate money, we know where it is going and that we have a reasonable \nexpectation of success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair and ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will conclude by saying the buying \nof stock and the government's direct involvement in the economy has \nramifications. The Wall Street Journal had an editorial: ``Treasury to \nFord: Drop Dead.'' They loaned General Motors' financial arm, GMAC, \nbillions of dollars. The next day, GMAC is offering zero percent loans \nto encourage people to buy GM products, while poor Ford, who is getting \nby and not asking for any money, is losing competitive advantage. That \nis our problem.\n  There was an article in USA TODAY that said that a nation founded on \nexcessive personal debt, excessive Government debt, and a sustained, \nlarge trade deficit is not a healthy economy. We all know that. We are \ngoing to have to adjust. This economy is going to have to adjust. \nHousing prices may fall somewhat lower, but they will bottom out soon. \nWe will come out of this downturn. The projections I have seen by CBO \nand the Obama administration officials tell us that we are not going to \nhave a recession as steep and as deep as the one in the early 1980s.\n  I think we have to be far more responsible in ensuring that these \nhuge sums of money--$700 billion total, which exceeds the 5 years of \nthe Iraq war's $500 billion in expenditures--are wisely done, are \nnecessary, and will actually improve the situation we are in today. So, \ntherefore, I cannot support the further release of funds today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, in a few very short moments--I think \nwithin 5 minutes or so--we are going to be welcoming a new Member to \nthis Chamber, and we will certainly take time out to do that. I believe \nMr. Durbin, the senior Senator from Illinois, wishes to be heard to \nspeak about our new colleague as the swearing-in ceremony will take \nplace at 2. So we will take a little time out for that--I don't think \nmuch time--and then I know my friends on the other side have lined up a \nnumber of speakers on the TARP program, and we are certainly going to \naccommodate that. I think all their time has been accounted for \nalready, so we will have to make sure of the resources there. I have a \nnumber of requests on this side of the aisle as well to be heard on \nthis very important matter before the vote occurs at 4:30.\n  Let me say in the few moments before the leaders arrive to welcome \nour new colleague from Illinois, new Senator-elect Burris, that this is \nobviously a very important debate that we are having regarding these \nso-called TARP funds. I don't know of a single Member, regardless of \nhow they will vote on this matter, who likes being here for this debate \nor believes that this is something they wish they were doing at this \nhour. I certainly don't. I have been involved tirelessly with this now \nover the last number of weeks. As we all know, we are going through a \ndramatic situation in our country. To put it in numbers terms that are \nmore understandable, 17,000 people in our Nation are losing their jobs \nevery day. Nine thousand to ten thousand people are losing their homes \nevery day in America. We saw the numbers of unemployment in the months \nof November and December; I think some 500,000 jobs in that month \nalone. Every indication is that the coming months are going to give us \nequally bad news on that front. We hear more bad news about lending \ninstitutions, financial institutions that are in trouble. So, \nobviously, these are fragile times, to put it mildly, for our Nation.\n  Yet, at the same time, within a matter of hours, almost within a few \nfeet from where I speak, we are going to be inaugurating the 44th \nPresident of the United States, an individual who has given this \nNation--in fact, many beyond our borders and shores--a great sense of \nrenewed hope, a renewed sense of optimism about our country and its \nfuture. So the timing, in many ways, couldn't be better for this new \nPresident arriving, a new team coming to town, determined to do \neverything they can to get our Nation back on its feet again.\n  So this debate is not just any other debate. This is a debate that \nwill give this new President the chance all of us want him to have to \nget our country moving in the right direction. So at an appropriate \ntime, at the conclusion of the swearing-in ceremony of our new \ncolleague, I will take additional time to talk about this issue, the \nimportance of it, the regrets I have about why we ended up where we are \nbut also why I think it is critically important we move forward at this \nvery important moment.\n  With that, I see the distinguished majority leader is here and I will \nyield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are many paths to the Senate. It is \nfair to say the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us \nwas unique, and that is an understatement.\n  Whatever complications surrounded his appointment, we made it clear \nfrom the beginning, both publicly and privately, that our concern was \nnever with Mr. Burris. I did not have the pleasure of meeting Mr. \nBurris until last week. I found now-Senator Burris to be engaging, \ngracious, and he was very firm in his commitment to become a good and \neffective Senator.\n  Given the uncertainty around his appointment, all of his statements \nand actions, again both publicly and privately, reflected a strong \ncharacter that will serve him well as he begins his service for the \npeople of Illinois.\n  I also say to my friend, Dick Durbin, the senior Senator from \nIllinois, how much I appreciate working with him on this and the other \nmatters we have worked on over the years. We have been in Washington \ntogether going back a long time, 1982. The people of the State of \nIllinois have been so well served by so many different people. I am \nconfident that when the history books are written, even though Illinois \nhas had some of the best of the best, my friend Dick Durbin will be \nright there with them.\n  So to Senator Burris, on behalf of all Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, we welcome you as a colleague and as a friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I first thank the majority leader for his \nkind statements. He is, indeed, more than just a colleague. For 26 \nyears, we have worked on Capitol Hill together, and never more closely \nthan the last 6 when I have had the honor to serve as his assistant as \nthe Democratic whip. He is truly a great public servant, not only for \nthe State of Nevada but for the entire Nation.\n  This was a test for us because we were all absolutely stricken by the \nnews that the Governor of the State of Illinois was being arrested and \nunder the circumstances which all America knows.\n  The response by the Senate was to say to this Governor: No Senate \nseat is ever for sale, and we are going to uphold the integrity of this \ninstitution, even though some may try to sully that integrity.\n  Senator Reid is right, throughout the stormy weeks that followed, I \ndo not recall a single negative word spoken by anyone in the Senate or \nany of Roland Burris's former colleagues about him. You can search the \nrecord. Everything said about Roland Burris was positive. The \ncircumstances that led to his appointment were the issue, the source of \nthe controversy.\n  The controversy came to an end on Monday. The Secretary of State \nJesse White filed a new document after the Illinois Supreme Court \nruled. The Secretary of the Senate ruled that this new document \ncomplied with the rules of the U.S. Senate, and Senator Burris had \nappeared in Springfield, as we asked him, to answer all questions about \nhis appointment.\n  At that point, we were ready to move forward. I can recall phone \nconversations with him over the weekend telling him that things were \nmoving in the right direction, and if he could be patient because they \nwere coming to a good end; the ruling of the Secretary of the Senate \ncould make all the difference.\n  Now we have this glorious day when so many of his friends from \nIllinois are here to witness his being sworn in by Vice President \nCheney, and now he has left the floor for a few moments for the \nceremonial oath that is going to be given in the Old Senate Chamber.\n  While he is away, I want to say a word about my old friend, Roland \nBurris. He literally has been my friend for over 30 years. In 1978, \nwhen we were both brand new to this business, I ran for lieutenant \ngovernor for Illinois and he ran for comptroller. Nobody had ever heard \nof either of us or the offices we were running for. We were as obscure \nas possible, but we found kinship standing in the back of parade routes \nas the bigwigs in the front line went on. We struck up a friendship, a \nfriendship that has extended over three decades. And it is a friendship \nthat is based more on just that happenstance of running in the same \nyear. You see, Roland and I are from the same part of Illinois. Roland \nBurris was born in Centralia, Illinois, a few miles away from my \nhometown of East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\n  But there is more to the story. That is one of the central parts of \nour Nation when it comes to railroads. I come from a railroad family--\nmy mother, my father, my two brothers, and I all worked for the New \nYork Central Railroad. Roland Burris's family were railroad workers as \nwell. His father Earl ran a small grocery store to supplement his \nincome as a laborer for the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad. Earl \nBurris, Roland's father, had a strong sense of community and a low \ntolerance for injustice. On Memorial Day 1953, Earl Burris decided to \ntake a stand against injustice by defying Centralia's unofficial \n``whites only'' policy for the city's public swimming pool. So he hired \na lawyer and arranged for that lawyer to meet him and young Roland, \nthen 16. They were all going to go to the swimming pool. Well, guess \nwhat. The lawyer didn't show up.\n  Roland Burris later said that he remembered his father all summer \nlong saying that if segregation and injustice were ever going to end, \npeople needed to show up and be accountable. By the end of the summer, \n16-year-old Roland Burris had made up his mind he would show up. He \nwould pursue a career in politics and the law. So off he went to \nSouthern Illinois University, at Carbondale, which incidentally has a \nrecord of being one of the most productive colleges in America for the \ngraduates of African Americans. Roland Burris was one of those. He \nstudied political science and distinguished himself as a leader on \ncampus. He headed a group that exposed discriminatory practices among \nCarbondale merchants toward African-American students.\n  In 1963, he earned a law degree from Howard University. That same \nyear, he became a Federal bank examiner at the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment--the first African American ever to hold such a position. In \n1964, he was hired by Continental Illinois National Bank, where he rose \nto the post of vice president in less than a decade. He is a past \nnational executive director of Operation PUSH.\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\n  In Illinois, the land of Lincoln, we have elected more African \nAmericans statewide than any State in our Union, and we are proud of \nit. But it is Roland Burris who led the way in 1978, as our first \nAfrican-American State comptroller and later as the first African-\nAmerican attorney general in that land of Lincoln, State of Illinois. \nRoland Burris paved the way for so many to follow, including the man \nwho will be sworn in as President Tuesday--Barack Obama. He has held \ntwo of our State's highest elective offices. He was Illinois' first \nAfrican-American comptroller as well as our first African-American \nattorney general.\n  Roland Burris is a good man and a dedicated public servant, and that \nis why he has returned to public life. Now he is the 48th Senator from \nthe great State of Illinois, and the 1,907th person ever to be sworn \ninto this distinguished body.\n  Here is an interesting fact as well. Roland and his wife Berlean live \non the south side of Chicago in a home once owned by the great, the \nimmortal Mahalia Jackson, the original ``Queen of Gospel Music.'' In \n1948, Mahalia recorded a song that became so popular music stores \ncouldn't keep it in stock. It sold 8 million copies. The title of that \nsong was ``Move On Up A Little Higher.''\n  For more than 50 years, Roland Burris has sought to move on up a \nlittle higher--not for his sake alone but for the chance to help \nothers, including our great State of Illinois. I congratulate him. I \nknow this was a rocky road to this great day in his life, but it was a \nroad well traveled and one that I am sure will lead him to appreciate \nhow important this institution is, not just as part of our government \nbut as a part of our future.\n  He is going to have a chance to not only serve as my colleague but \nthe colleague of 99 other Senators who are going to be able to work \nwith him and learn the values and talents that he brings to the job. I \nam honored today, by his being sworn into office, to no longer be both \nthe senior and junior Senator from Illinois. We have a junior Senator--\nhis name is Roland Burris--and I look forward to serving with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Again I renew the request for a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, would the Chair be so kind as to advise me \nwhen I have used 7 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we have before us today a hallmark piece \nof legislation that is supposed to be about credit and liquidity and \nthe significant problems we ran into this last fall in this country \nwhen we no longer had a functioning, or barely had a functioning \nfinancial industry that allowed credit to flow which would allow \ncommerce to ensue.\n  It was my belief at the time, based on what I was told and what I \nsaw, that extraordinary measures were going to be required for us to \nhandle this significant problem. Consequently, I ended up voting for a \nfinancial recovery package that I must say has been handled in a way \ncompletely opposite of the way we were told it was going to be handled. \nThat is now water under the bridge. The question before us today is: \nAre we going to give another $350 billion--not through an oversight \nprocess, through an appropriating process--are we going to write a \nblank check to the Treasury Department to accomplish again what we are \nassured by the transition team and the incoming administration is for \nvery specific things?\n  I would like to believe that. As a matter of fact, in a meeting \nyesterday with some of the officials of the incoming administration, I \nasked in a closed room where they were giving us this reassurance that \nthis administration was not going to put more money into the auto \nindustry under the pretext it has been done using the TARP funds; that \nthis administration was not going to use this money for other \nindustrial segments of our society but in fact would use this money \nonly when and if it is necessary to keep liquidity rolling, to keep \nbanks' balance sheets to the point where we can accomplish what we need \nin order to have true commerce in this country. And I must say that I \nfelt somewhat reassured walking out of that meeting.\n  But one of the things I asked for in that meeting was a public \nstatement so that the rest of America could have that same assurance. \nWe find ourselves today, getting ready to vote on this--and that was \ncommunicated very directly, by the way, with some of the highest levels \nof the incoming administration--we are about to vote on it, yet there \nhas been no public statement whatsoever that would assure either \nMembers of this body or the American taxpayers that we are not going to \nbe using it to bail out companies that are not competitive and have not \nhad to do the hard things to maintain themselves to be competitive; we \nhave no assurance we are not going to go to other industries and do the \nsame thing; and we do not have, in fact, a public expression, an \nexplanation, or a letter of intent of the incoming administration that \nthey are going to use it in a very precise and direct manner to \nmaintain liquidity of the financial sector.\n\n  The other thing that we have not heard, along with maintaining that \nliquidity, is how the administration will handle the toxic assets, \nwhich is what we were told the money was for in the first place.\n  So I come to the floor this afternoon wanting to support our new \nPresident. I want to support him. I talked to him about this issue \nprior to his senior staff coming and talking to us. But I find myself \nin the predicament of having been fooled once by the present \nadministration not doing what they said they were going to do. They \nhave not been transparent as to where and how the money is being spent. \nThe American people haven't had access. We don't know the priorities \nunder which it was done. And now we are being told again: Trust us.\n  Well, I am willing to do that, provided we put out to the American \npeople exactly what that means. And the only thing that I can figure as \nto why it has not been forthcoming--that is what we asked for yesterday \nafternoon in the meeting with those representing President-elect \nObama--is that they do not want to commit. And I regret to say that if \nthe incoming administration won't commit on paper and publicly as to \nhow they are going to use this money, I am disinclined to vote to give \nit to them. That pains me, because I want our new administration to be \ntremendously successful in the face of all the problems we have.\n  To meet the goal of transparency and accountability--which is what \nthis new administration is all about, and I believe it will be far \ngreater than what we have seen in the past; I will give them credit for \nthat--it is required that they publicly tell the American people how, \nwhen, why, and what they are going to use this money for. And my only \nconclusion would be, in the face of that statement not being \nforthcoming, is that they either have the votes and believe they can \naccomplish this without being forthcoming--which again goes exactly the \nopposite direction of what my friend Barack Obama campaigned on--or \nthey weren't necessarily truthful in what they told us on how they were \ngoing to use the money.\n  So I stand ready to try to support them, if in fact we have \nassurances--public assurances and documented assurances--that they are \ngoing to follow\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\nthe intent of what we originally gave the money for. Absent that, I \nwould find him be unable to support that and would vote for the \nresolution of disapproval.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about TARP. The President \nhas submitted the request for the second half of the funds. This is not \nan easy decision for Members of Congress. We have lots of questions \nabout how the first $350 billion was spent. Questions came from my \nconstituents, financial and economic experts, the oversight body. \nAuditors have questions, and I have questions.\n  I said in December, the Treasury must account for the $350 billion \nand make the case that the action has aided our economic recovery \nefforts. Taxpayers were promised transparency. They deserve answers. \nBut after Congress authorized the funds, the Treasury Department \nabruptly changed course and instead provided billions of dollars in \ndirect capital injections into banks without any requirement that they \nwrite down bad debt. To date we do not have any answer why the change \nwas made. Perhaps the Treasury realized it could not operationally \nmanage it. Perhaps it was because the Europeans had adopted a direct \ncapital injection approach. But we do not know.\n  The change is not as important as is the explanation and \njustification. The change in strategy could have been more acceptable \nif Congress and the public understood what reasonable assurances there \nwere that there was a coherent structure. Unfortunately, the Treasury \nhas not provided concrete evidence that directly or indirectly linked \nthe capital injection to the marginal stabilization of the credit \nmarket and the funds are contributing to the necessary writedowns.\n  Some experts also question whether Treasury diagnosed the problem \ncorrectly and accordingly allocated the funds appropriately. Now, \nTreasury claims TARP has worked because we have not fallen into a Great \nDepression. But when they are not collecting data from the banks on how \nthe funds are used, it is kind of tough to point to that.\n  We need to focus on the real need for additional TARP funding and \nensure that the significant questions about management and oversight \nare adequately addressed. In terms of need, let's be clear. I do not \ndispute that further Government resources and actions will likely be \nneeded to address the ongoing economic downturn.\n  Unemployment is rising, double digits in some places. There are \ncontinuing credit difficulties. We must not be complacent about the \nprospect of an economic recovery.\n  I supported the initial passage of the act because we were assured it \nwould run with transparency, accountability, and oversight. \nUnfortunately, we have had independent assessments of the program that \ndo not provide any comfort. The U.S. Government Accountability Office \nand the congressional oversight panel have preliminary reports that are \nnot glowing and raise additional questions.\n  Now, the incoming administration has made statements that it \nsubstantially agrees with these independent assessments, and it will do \nthings differently. To date, however, all we have is a three-page \nletter that generally outlines how they will run it. While I appreciate \nthese statements, a three-page letter is a little thin for me to \napprove a $350 billion extra share.\n  Taxpayers have bailout fatigue, and I am troubled by Government \nintervention in the private market. We need the private market at some \npoint, however painful, to work itself out, and we must force the \nwritedown of bad debt to address the solvency of banks. We have not \nseen those assurances, and I am not going to be able to support this \nrelease before us.\n  Many experts have implored the Treasury to use TARP to address bad \ndebt that is still held by banks. I believe that should have been in \nthe initial provisions. We forced the auto companies to jump through \nhoops. Perhaps on the other hand, they can use a guarantee program for \na risk-share program.\n  Unfortunately, we still do not know how the second half of the funds \nis going to be used. We might have to have a subprime mortgage asset \nrestructure trust like the entity we set up to deal with the savings \nand loan crisis. It was painful in the late 1980s, but it worked.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, this is not the end of the need to address \nour financial system. Some estimates are that about $1.5 trillion is \npending, and we are likely to see more requests for funds. But before \nadditional requests are submitted, we look forward to the incoming \nadministration bringing some coherency and structure to the program and \nprovide for certainty and confidence to taxpayers and markets by \nproviding the transparency, accountability, and the oversight that is \ncurrently lacking.\n  There are too many unanswered questions about the current TARP. We do \nnot dismiss the real threats of more financial turmoil. We can clear \nthem up, but things likely will get worse before they get better. I am \ncommitted to help save the system, but we need a plan to show we are \ngoing to act responsibly and protect taxpayers while providing more \naccountability, transparency, and oversight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes today \nalso addressing this very troublesome issue of the next tranche of $350 \nbillion that is being asked for by the incoming administration. I, like \nmany people who supported the initial request on October 1, was very \ndisappointed with the differences in the current administration's \nimplementation of TARP as opposed to the logic that was presented to us \nasking for our support.\n  I would also say if there were a new proposal coming to us from the \ncurrent administration, given this experience, I would probably not \nsupport it. Given the administration's conduct since October, I would \nnot support it. There is, however, an incoming administration that is \nin a situation that was created by Congress's initial vote. It is in \nthe middle of this $700 billion proposal.\n  I have received concrete guarantees from the President-elect \nregarding TARP. I spoke to him at great length yesterday. I am going to \nsupport releasing this next tranche. I would like to take a few minutes \nto explain my support. I was one of the first people to originally \nquestion Secretary Paulson's request last September. I came to the \nSenate floor the Monday after the request was made. I laid out five \ndifferent points of concern we had with the proposal itself.\n  I worked with other Members of this body. We had nine Senators join \nin a letter to the majority leader saying that any proposal like this \nhad to, first of all, guarantee that it was not one individual in the \nexecutive branch who was able to make these kinds of decisions; that \nideally, from our perspective, there should have been a three-person \npanel of honest brokers; that the American taxpayer should be invested \nin the upside of a program like this; that there should be re-\nregulation of the financial markets; and that there should be concrete \nlimits on executive compensation. We had some movement on those issues \nduring the negotiating process led by the senior Senator from \nConnecticut. We did not get all of them, but we did get enough. Coupled \nwith the predictions of the catastrophic effect that might occur in the \nworld markets without action, I decided to vote for the program. Then \nSecretary Paulson went off and spent the money in a totally different \nway than he told us he was going to.\n\n  The situation now, in my view, is different. I spoke with the \nPresident-elect. He indicated he was totally comfortable with my coming \nto the Senate floor and saying that he personally guarantees closure on \nall of those issues: that there will be more than\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\none person in the administration, at least three people in the \nadministration, working together to find out the best place to put \nthese funds; that American taxpayers are invested; that there will be \nlimits on executive compensation; and that there clearly are going to \nbe strong proposals, to re-regulate the financial markets.\n  We are in a very difficult situation in this body because we cannot \namend this document. We cannot put these proposals into legislative \nlanguage. We can only vote up or down as to whether this money is made \navailable, and I am going to vote to release those funds.\n  The distinction for me is that, in the first instance, we had an \nadministration that was ending its tenure. It was on its way out the \ndoor as it implemented the first tranche in, I think, not a fully \nresponsible way.\n  In this instance, we have a new administration coming in. They are \nready to be held accountable. The President-elect indicated to me that \nhe wanted me to inform this body of the specific guarantees he is \ngiving. With respect to the valid concerns that were just laid out by \nthe Senator from Missouri, we have plenty of time for debate available \nto us for the larger stimulus package where we can truly sort out what \ntype of financial rescue plan we are going to put into place for the \ncountry.\n  So I have struggled with this like so many of my colleagues. I am \nvery comfortable with the guarantees that were given by the President-\nelect. I am going to vote in favor of this program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am rising to speak in favor of the \ndisapproval resolution. I think we should disapprove the use of the \nTARP funds, and I will outline why to my colleagues and point out the \nreasons and give a little bit of history on this as well.\n  I think it is interesting the Treasury Department came here on \nSaturday, September 22, and said: We have to do this. We have to have \n$700 billion to save the financial institutions across the United \nStates. We have to do it, and we have to do it now. There were zero \nhearings on the $700 billion. Now, normally, around here you would not \nspend $7 million, let alone $7 billion or $70 billion, without a \nhearing. We did $700 billion without a hearing, and in a rush and in a \npush and people saying: We have to do this now or we risk going into a \nGreat Depression.\n  This bill passed. Now, my phone was ringing during that period of \ntime. My guess is the Presiding Officer's phone was ringing during that \nperiod of time. Kansans were hot and mad and upset and strongly \nopposed. I think at one point in time we had 2,000 calls against and 40 \nfor the bill. There was strong opposition. They do not like the idea of \ngiving the money to the people who made the mistakes and did the \nwrongdoing in the first place, and it was our taxpayer money. Then, \nwhat is in the bill--the initial bill was a 30-page bill.\n  Now, it expanded some after that, but we did not have a hearing \nprocess. We did not have a review process. It was: We have to do this; \nwe have to do this now, period. It went on through the Congress, and it \npassed. We had two tranches: the first $350 billion and a second $350 \nbillion, which I argued at the time as well, the second $350 billion \nshould require an affirmative vote of Congress. I mean, this is $350 \nbillion we are talking about. Instead, all we could get was this \ndisapproval process which the President can veto. Then it has to come \nback here for a two-thirds vote. So you, in essence, have to get two-\nthirds of the Congress to disapprove. Nonetheless, I think we should \ndisapprove this proposal, this bill, this additional $350 billion in \nfunding.\n  Now, if the initial proposal was OK, look, we have to have it, we \nhave to have it now to support and to keep the financial institutions \ngoing and properly functioning in the country--that money has been \nspent and the financial institutions are operating. Certainly, there is \na lot of distress, but they are operating and they are operating \neffectively.\n  So the idea that you have to do it and you have to do it now to \nmaintain a fiscal financial system operating is no longer there. That \nis one reason.\n  The second one: We ought to spend some time thinking about this and \nwhether we want to do this because this has ended up being a rather \nlarge slush fund. It has been moving from various targets. Initially it \nwas said this was going to be used to buy troubled assets. Then that \nseemed like it was going to take too long, so it was put into stock, \ninto financial institutions to strengthen their bottom line.\n  So there was no real target given, and it was moved and sloshed \naround. Even on auto bailout, at the end of the day, do we want that \nloose of a design model on $350 billion? I would have to argue then, as \nI do now, no. We don't want that loose of a situation.\n\n  Then there is the matter of oversight on this particular issue. We \nhave an oversight panel that has reported that Treasury has ``failed to \naddress a number of questions asked by the panel itself,'' our panel, \nthe congressional panel, in its first report. I don't see enough \ntransparency in the manner in which TARP is being executed, and I \ncertainly don't see enough in terms of what contingency plans Treasury \nhas in mind to use these additional funds to grant carte blanche \nspending of $350 billion that could range from troubled assets, stock \nin banks, an auto bailout. And if that is your initial model of where \nyou can spend it, then where else could we spend the additional $350 \nbillion? Is this on credit card bailouts, on student loans, on another \nindustry? It looks as though we don't know.\n  Quoting from the oversight panel, they were saying that this money, \nas I mentioned earlier, has failed to address a number of the concerns \nthat were previously raised. Indeed, if anything, I think it could be \nargued that the haphazard manner in which these funds were spent has \nincreased the financial stress and has injected uncertainty into a \nfinancial system and an economy already gripped by fear. Almost the \nvery uncertainty and the moving back and forth said to the broader \neconomy and to the global community: We don't know what we need to do. \nIt helped to spread fear rather than to calm the market situation.\n  We need to have a calm discussion about this $350 billion. It is very \ndifficult for me to go back home and say to my constituents: We \napproved an additional $350 billion and we are not exactly sure where \nit is going to be spent, when they were flaming mad about this being \napproved in the first place.\n  While additional TARP funding is not necessarily $350 billion of \nGovernment spending, I am not convinced it represents a well planned \nand executed investment for taxpayers. Many will say this is an \ninvestment, not spending. I am not sure this has been well designed or \nthought through of what the investment is. Indeed, it seems as though \nit changes by the day. The Congressional Oversight Panel says it still \ndoes not know what banks are doing with TARP money already used. So \nhere is our own oversight panel saying that we don't know for sure what \nthe banks are doing with the TARP money they have already gotten, and \nwe are going to approve another $350 billion.\n  Without transparency about funding already committed to TARP and with \nonly vague notions about how additional TARP funding would be used, I \ncannot vote to allow additional TARP funds to be released. Without more \ntransparency and information on plans with a potentially large taxpayer \ncost, I do not see the merits in allowing additional TARP funds to move \nforward.\n  Those are not simply my thoughts. If you pick up the phone in my \noffice, if you travel across my State--and I would say across much of \nthe country--that is the sentiment you are going to get, that this just \nis not well planned. It is a lot of money, and we ought to calm down \nand take more prudent approaches, take the simple steps of holding \ncommittee hearings, looking at what sorts of distressed industries may \ncome up, looking in depth at where the TARP funding has already been \nspent and what it is doing, and get answers to those simple, direct, \nbut very important questions before we launch into another $350 \nbillion. I think if the people in this body would listen to their \nconstituents back home, they would say: Absolutely, don't just approve \nthis. Let's take more time now.\n  The financial institutions people, as far as the situation that was \nexisting last fall, are saying: This is getting much better than what \nit was at that point. Let's take our time to do it right. I am not \nsaying that there isn't stress in the system. There still is. But it \nisn't the situation it was last fall. Our constituents demand that more \ninformation be known.\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\n  I hope we can do that and take our time to get this right and get the \noversight right and get the answers to simple, direct, but very \nimportant questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise in support of the motion to \ndisapprove the expenditure of the additional $350 billion. I am one who \nsupported the original package back in September. I thought it was the \nright thing to do then. I still think it was the right thing to do at \nthat point in time. The reason I thought so then and still think so is \nthat we are certainly in a financial crunch. We were presented with a \nplan by the Treasury Department that laid out what we were going to do \nwith this $350 billion that was the initial amount authorized to be \naccessed, that that $350 billion would move us in a direction of \nloosening the contraction of the credit markets around the country so \nthat banks could borrow money in the credit market from each other, and \nthey would thus have money to loan out to businesses as well as to \nindividuals.\n  The fact is that the Treasury Department, after telling us the plan \nthey proposed to operate to do that, moved in a different direction and \nmoved in a direction of providing funding from this initial $250 \nbillion and now the second $100 billion to fund banks, to provide \ncapital to banks that was supposed to be used to buy toxic loans, not \nfrom individual banks but to buy toxic loans that were packaged at \nbanks because they bought the banks. The fact is, it didn't work. It \nhas not worked at all. We have not seen a loosening of the contraction \nof this credit market.\n  For us to come in today and be faced with a vote here today in the \nshort term relative to accessing the second half of the $700 billion \nwithout having a plan that we have some assurance is going to work I \nbelieve is the wrong direction to go. Not only that, but as a part of \nthe original $350 billion, there was some $20 billion or so that was \naccessed and given to the automobile industry, either through direct \nfunding to automobile companies that are domestic companies that are in \ntrouble as well as funding that went to GMAC, a financial arm of the \nautomobile industry. That was never intended when we debated and voted \non the original plan back in September of this year.\n  As my friend from Kansas said, it needs to be a written plan that is \nthoroughly thought through by folks who are certainly smarter than I am \non this issue, and it needs to be in place before we take taxpayer \nmoney and expose it. I use that term because I still think, on the \nfirst $350 billion, we have the opportunity to be paid back, but it is \nexposed. But for us to further expose an additional $350 billion \nwithout some strong assurance that we will get repaid this money and, \nmost importantly, unless we have some plan that gives us, while not a \nguarantee, a strong indication that accessing that additional $350 \nbillion will move us toward resolution of this crisis and a loosening \nup of the credit market, I just think is the wrong direction in which \nto go. Because of that, I intend to vote in favor of this motion and in \nopposition to accessing that second $350 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, while I was given, very generously, 10 \nminutes, I will not take that time because I have had occasion to stand \non the Senate floor since last October 10 on numerous occasions and \ntalk about the way this vote took place in the beginning. Sometimes we \nlose sight of the fact that this had to start somewhere, and this start \nwas when Secretary Paulson--and I to have say this is a Republican \nadministration; he was the Treasury Secretary--came out with this plan \non how to save the world. He said: We have to have $700 billion. It has \nto be spent to buy damaged assets. And even at that time, it didn't \nmake any sense because, if you read the document, it didn't say \nanything as to what was going to happen to this money. It just \ncompletely was a blank check. Never in the history of Oklahoma have we \nvoted to give anyone, elected or, in this case, unelected bureaucrat, \n$700 billion to do whatever he or she wants to do with it. It is mind-\nboggling that that could have happened, but it did happen.\n  The other thing that makes history out of this is, this is the \nlargest single vote on an authorization in the history of this country. \nThis amount is so big, I have tried to explain to people what this \nreally means: $700 billion, if you take all of the families in America \nwho file tax returns and do the math, is $5,000 a family. That is what \nwe are talking about.\n  I opposed it originally and said that we are going to regret that we \ndid this unprecedented thing. I hate to say it, even though I want to \nencourage as many Members to vote for this resolution, it doesn't make \nthat much difference because if it should pass both the House and the \nSenate--and, of course, the House will be voting on it later on--then \nthe new President would come in and would veto it. And all he would \nneed is 34 votes, in the case of the Senate, to sustain a veto. \nObviously, the votes are there. So it is going to happen. But I think \nit is important that as many people get on record recognizing it is not \nthe right thing to do for America, and to do that, this is their last \nchance.\n  In October, after this passed the House and the Senate, I introduced \nlegislation at that time, then reintroduced it with the new Congress, \nputting in accountability so that they would have to come to Congress. \nI don't care if it is the Bush administration or the Obama \nadministration, come to Congress, tell us what they want to spend the \nmoney on. Let's debate it, go through an appropriations process so we \nare in the curve. That is what the Constitution says we are supposed to \nbe able to do. But it didn't happen.\n  To name it TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program--this is no \ntroubled asset relief program. It was represented by Secretary Paulson \nto be the buying of damaged assets. I have renamed it the SOAP program, \nthe Spend On Any Program, because that is exactly what we have done. We \ndon't know today, and we are about to pass something or we are going to \nend up adopting something, and this resolution will not be able to stop \nit. That is going to change the behavior. It is the first time this has \nhappened in the history of this country. We are going to be saying to \nsomebody: You can have this big block of money. You can do anything you \nwant with it. That has not happened before. I think the historians, 30 \nand 40 years from now, will look back and say that the vote that took \nplace in October that allowed one unelected bureaucrat to have $700 \nbillion is going to be probably the most egregious vote in the history \nof this institution.\n  I look at this, and I see that this happened. I recall in October, \nwhen the majority--75 percent of the House and the Senate--voted for \nthis thing, I said at that time that there are going to be others lined \nup. As this is structured, you can't stop it. You can't blame the auto \nindustry for coming in, wanting to have a bailout. So they got a \nbailout. For those of you who think that is bad, I agree. But that was \nonly 2 percent of the total $700 billion.\n  So we need to put these things in perspective. This is something that \nshould not have happened. I think it is going to go down in history as \none of the dark moments of this institution.\n  Lastly, we have talked to a lot of people, a lot of economists, three \nof them from the Reagan era. They said we didn't really accomplish \nanything with the first $350 billion. Our western farmers in Oklahoma--\nI won't mention which bank it is, but it was a bank that initially got \n$20 billion. Now they are asking for more so that credit would be \nloosened up. They came to me way back in October and said they received \nthis money, but the credit has not loosened up at all. I am inclined to \nthink that the first $350 billion was pretty much wasted, and now we \nare going into another $350 billion.\n  I would encourage any of my colleagues who voted for the initial $700 \nbillion bailout to go ahead and vote for this resolution to stop this \nsecond $350 billion. That would be a redeeming feature in their \ncareers. I would encourage them to do that.\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Let me inquire of the Chair: There is no one else ready to speak \nright now. If I were to continue to speak, would that use up time on \nthis side? I do not want to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Madam President.\n  In about an hour or so we will be voting on this matter. I know there \nare several other Members who want to be heard on this discussion, \nalthough there has been a lot said about this matter since the problem \nfirst emerged, at least the request first emerged, back in mid-\nSeptember, September 18 of last year, when the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve came before the \nleadership of the Congress and announced that within a matter of days \nwe would be facing a meltdown of the financial sector of this country \nas well as, maybe, globally. From that time forward, we have found \nourselves in this situation.\n  As I said a little while ago in brief remarks, I do not know of a \nsingle Member--at least I do not believe there is any--who takes any \npleasure in being involved in this debate, involved in the vote we are \nabout to cast, knowing the problems that have created this situation \nwere avoidable, preventable, and had the administration paid more \nattention, when they were asked to more than 2 years ago, about the \nforeclosure crisis in this country--that is the root cause of the \nproblems we are now dealing with--then we would not have to be here \ntoday. That is not hyperbole. That is not speculation. That is a fact. \nBut the reality is there was denial after denial after denial: the \neconomy was sound and solid, and things were going to be in great shape \nno matter what happened.\n  Today, we find ourselves with 17,000 people a day losing their jobs \nin America. Between 9,000 and 10,000 homes are going into foreclosure \nevery day in the country. Retirement accounts are being dwindled down \nto almost nothing in too many cases. Costs and other matters are rising \nfor many people. We are in the most serious economic shape since the \nGreat Depression 80 years ago.\n  It is this Senate, this Congress, at this hour, with the transfer of \npower coming at the executive branch in a matter of hours, literally \nyards from where I am speaking today, that will hopefully provide a new \ndirection for our Nation. The outgoing President--in a unique moment, I \nsuppose, historically--along with the incoming President have jointly \nasked us to step up and provide a tool that might very well do \nsomething to make a difference in the lives of those 17,000 people \ntoday who will lose their jobs or maybe one of those families of the \n9,000 today who will lose their home.\n  We can say: Look, we are not going to do this. We can flyspeck this: \nI don't like this part; I don't like that part. I would like more \nspecificity here and there. We can twiddle our thumbs.\n  Well, explain that, if you will, to that person who might lose their \njob, when maybe taking action might make a difference or tell that to a \nfamily in Connecticut or Minnesota who is going to lose their house \ntoday: No, we ought to wait a week or two and maybe we will sort this \nout a little better somehow; like somehow the great wizards here, we \nare going to organize this in some fabulous way to serve the interests \nof the people.\n  This is a dreadful moment, it is a sad moment, that here in the first \nhours of the 111th Congress, instead of talking about resources that go \nto building bridges and roads or schools, making a difference in the \nhealth care of people, providing some decent retirement and hope for \nother Americans, we are talking about providing resources to stabilize \nour economy, to get our credit system working again, so you do not find \nthe squandering of resources, to see that we might make a difference in \nputting a tourniquet on the hemorrhaging of home foreclosures that is \noccurring from one end of this country to the other.\n  Now, it is more dire in some areas than others. Obviously, the States \nof California and Florida particularly are seeing the tremendous \neffects of this situation. Arizona and Nevada are also paying a very \nserious price. But I know in Minnesota, I know in Connecticut, as well, \nwhile it is not as bad as in some of these other States, it is getting \nworse. There is not an economist anyone has listened to over the last \nnumber of weeks who has not told us it is not going to get better \novernight.\n  But what do we do? Again, we have been asked to step up and provide \nsome resources here, some serious ones to try to stabilize the credit \nmarkets, to provide some assistance. I do not know if it is adequate \nenough. This much I can tell you: Like all of us, we have been terribly \ndisappointed over the management of the resources that were provided \nback at the end of September, early October. I honestly believe some of \nthose resources have actually worked to some degree. But today we had \nabout five different witnesses before the Senate Banking Committee--\nnominees for various posts, most of them very distinguished \neconomists--who have spent years in this field. To a person, everyone \nsaid, well, they could not predict with absolute certainty that had we \nnot acted in September, this economy would be in even worse shape \ntoday.\n  It is always difficult to prove a negative. But it is, obviously, \neasier for those who can stand here and say, well, I told you so or we \nshould not have done this because it is impossible to go back and say \nwhat would have happened with any great certainty had we not acted. I \nthink much can be said today when you have an outgoing Republican \nPresident and administration and an incoming Democratic administration, \nwith very different views about how our economy ought to be managed, \nasking us jointly to step up and make this decision. I think it is \nimportant we listen and we act. That is what I am urging my colleagues \nto do.\n  This is not going to win you any parades. You are not going to get a \nplaque or a medal for doing this. I have great respect for my friend \nfrom Oklahoma, but I would predict just the opposite of what he has \nsuggested. I think history will judge us, just as it judged two \ngenerations ago, what a new Congress did gathered in the winter of \n1933, after the election of 1932, when 5,000 banks closed their doors \nand 27 percent of the American people were out of work. There was no \nhope whatsoever.\n  People got together, infused capital into lending institutions--the \n5,000 of them--in the spring of 1933, and creative people sat down and \nworked to try to come up with imaginative ideas to get this country \nmoving again, and an American President stood on the east front of this \nCapitol and said to the American people: You have nothing to fear but \nfear itself. Hope began to spring in the hearts and minds of Americans \nall across this country because while they were suffering terribly, \nthey knew they needed a Government that was going to roll up its \nsleeves, keep an eye on them, and keep them in mind every single day to \ntry to get this country moving again.\n  I would say to my colleagues that I believe on next Tuesday, January \n20, the 44th President of the United States will remind the American \npeople once again that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, \nin his own words, and that there is a reason to be hopeful and \noptimistic. This is a great country, with great resources, talented, \nbright, energetic Americans, who want to see our country get back on \nits feet again. But you need to have the tools to do it. You cannot \nwish it well. You have to provide the resources in order to make it \npossible for us to get moving again. That is what this President has \nasked for--both the outgoing and incoming one--to give this incoming \nPresident the tools necessary to move forward.\n  Now, I know, as well, there is going to be far better accountability, \nfar more transparency. Foreclosure mitigation is going to be a part of \nthis effort. In fact, in a letter from Larry Summers to the majority \nleader--which I ask unanimous consent,\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\nMadam President, to be printed in the Record provides far greater \nspecificity than earlier communications, and I welcome that, detailing \nspecifically how this will work, how it will be monitored, how \nimportant the intervention on foreclosures will be, and focusing on the \nflow of credit, which is, obviously, critical if we are going to get \nback on our feet again.\n  I think the letter ought to provide some confidence to Members who \nare concerned about how this program will be managed and run, and that \nit will, in fact, be run differently than the present administration is \ndoing it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The Office of the President-Elect,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Leader Reid: Thank you for the extraordinary efforts \n     you have made this week to work with President-Elect Obama in \n     implementing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008. In addition to the commitments I made in my letter of \n     January 12, 2009, the President-Elect asked me to respond to \n     a number of valuable recommendations made by members of the \n     House and Senate as well as the Congressional Oversight \n     Panel. We completely agree that this program must promote the \n     stability of the financial system and increase lending, \n     preserve home ownership, promote jobs and economic recovery, \n     safeguard taxpayer interests, and have the maximum degree of \n     accountability and transparency possible.\n       As part of that approach, no substantial new investments \n     will be made under this program unless President-elect Obama \n     has reviewed the recommendation and agreed that it should \n     proceed. If the President-elect concludes that a substantial \n     new commitment of funds is necessary to forestall a serious \n     economic dislocation, he will certify that decision to \n     Congress before any final action is taken.\n       As the Obama Administration carries out the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act, our actions will reflect the \n     Act's original purpose of preventing systemic consequences in \n     the financial and housing markets. The incoming Obama \n     Administration has no intention of using any funds to \n     implement an industrial policy.\n       The Obama Administration will commit substantial resources \n     of fifty to one hundred billion to a sweeping effort to \n     address the foreclosure crisis. We will implement smart, \n     aggressive policies to reduce the number of preventable \n     foreclosures by helping to reduce mortgage payments for \n     economically stressed but responsible homeowners, while also \n     reforming our bankruptcy laws and strengthening existing \n     housing initiatives like Hope for Homeowners. Banks receiving \n     support under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act will \n     be required to implement mortgage foreclosure mitigation \n     programs. In addition to this action, the Federal Reserve has \n     announced a $500B program of support, which is already having \n     a significant beneficial impact in reducing the cost of new \n     conforming mortgages. Together these efforts will constitute \n     a major effort to address this critical problem.\n       In addition to these commitments, I would like to summarize \n     some of the additional reforms we will be implementing.\n       1. Provide a Clear and Transparent Explanation for \n     Investments:\n       For each investment, the Treasury will make public the \n     amount of assistance provided, the value of the investment, \n     the quantity and strike price of warrants received, and the \n     schedule of required payments to the government.\n       For each investment, the Treasury will report on the terms \n     or pricing of that investment compared to recent market \n     transactions.\n       The above information will be posted as quickly as possible \n     on the Treasury's website so that the American people readily \n     can monitor the status of each investment.\n       2. Measure, Monitor and Track the Impact on Lending:\n       As a condition of federal assistance, healthy banks without \n     major capital shortfalls will increase lending above baseline \n     levels.\n       The Treasury will require detailed and timely information \n     from recipients of government investments on their lending \n     patterns broken down by category. Public companies will \n     report this information quarterly in conjunction with the \n     release of their 10Q reports.\n       The Treasury will report quarterly on overall lending \n     activity and on the terms and availability of credit in the \n     economy.\n       3. Impose Clear Conditions on Firms Receiving Government \n     Support:\n       Require that executive compensation above a specified \n     threshold amount be paid in restricted stock or similar form \n     that cannot be liquidated or sold until the government has \n     been repaid.\n       Prevent shareholders from being unduly rewarded at taxpayer \n     expense. Payment of dividends by firms receiving support must \n     be approved by their primary federal regulator. For firms \n     receiving exceptional assistance, quarterly dividend payments \n     will be restricted to $0.01 until the government has been \n     repaid.\n       Preclude use of government funds to purchase healthy firms \n     rather than to boost lending.\n       Ensure terms of investments are appropriately designed to \n     promote early repayment and to encourage private capital to \n     replace public investments as soon as economic conditions \n     permit. Public assistance to the financial system will be \n     temporary, not permanent.\n       4. Focus Support on Increasing the Flow of Credit:\n       The President will certify to Congress that any substantial \n     new initiative under this program will contribute to \n     forestalling a significant economic dislocation.\n       Implement a sweeping foreclosure mitigation plan for \n     responsible families including helping to reduce mortgage \n     payment for economically stressed but responsible homeowners, \n     reforming our bankruptcy laws, and strengthening existing \n     housing initiatives like Hope for Homeowners.\n       Undertake special efforts to restart lending to the small \n     businesses responsible for over two-thirds of recent job \n     creation.\n       Ensure the soundness of community banks throughout the \n     country.\n       Limit assistance under the EESA to financial institutions \n     eligible under that Act. Firms in the auto industry, which \n     were provided assistance under the EESA, will only receive \n     additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive \n     restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability.\n       The incoming Obama Administration is committed to these \n     undertakings. With these safeguards, it should be possible to \n     improve the effectiveness of our financial stabilization \n     efforts. As I stressed in my letter the other day, we must \n     act with urgency to stabilize and repair the financial system \n     and maintain the flow of credit to families and businesses to \n     restore economic growth. While progress will take time, we \n     are confident that, working closely with the Congress, we can \n     secure America's future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Lawrence H. Summers,\n\n                                               Director-designate,\n                                        National Economic Council.\n\n  Mr. DODD. So this is a tough vote to cast, as it was in September, in \nOctober. I listened that night as the majority leader asked every \nsingle Member to vote from their desk, something we do not do with \ngreat frequency. I listened to several of our colleagues who are no \nlonger here, and I suspect that vote they cast in favor of that program \nhad something to do with the outcome of their elections. I am sorry \nthat happened to them, and it may have happened because of that vote.\n  But we are Senators. This is not a place just to come and give \nspeeches. We happen to be here at one of the most critical times in our \nNation's history. There are wars raging around the globe, and people \nare suffering at home. We have an obligation to them, and sometimes the \ndecisions we make are not always the most popular ones in the moment \nthey are given. We have learned that throughout history, too, that the \nCongresses in the past that have come before us, that have had the \ncourage to stand up and face the realities of their day, have enjoyed \nthe good judgement of history because they had the intestinal fortitude \nto do so.\n  There is not a single one of us in this Chamber who knows what is the \nright political vote. We all know we can gain favor overnight by \ncasting a vote against this bill. My hope is there will be at least 50 \nof us who will stand up and cast a better vote--for your children and \nyour grandchildren who will not know the outcome of your vote because \nthey probably are not alive yet or could not read it. But someday they \nare going to look back and ask what we did at this critical time to \nmake a difference in our Nation.\n  I believe we are in such a moment, we are in such a time. And it is \nnot just this moment; there will be a series of them in the coming \nweeks and months. That is why you sought this office, I presume, to be \na part of making history and making a difference.\n  I would urge my colleagues, no one is arguing perfection at all. No \none can speak with any certainty at all about the outcome of all of \nthis. We are actually in uncharted waters when it comes to these \nissues. But to sit back and do nothing--to do nothing--would be an \nindictment and a failure of responsibility.\n  So I am determined, as I know my colleagues will be, if this, in \nfact, goes forward, to monitor it, to insist upon accountability, to \ndemand that we see lenders do what they should be doing, insisting that \nthe leaders of these institutions not gouge or hoard and do\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\neverything possible to make sure our economy gets moving in the right \ndirection.\n  On that note, Madam President, I urge my colleagues to reject this \nmotion of disapproval and to give this new, young American President a \nchance to get our country back on its feet again, as he desperately \nwants to do, and to give America, once again, that sense of hope and \noptimism we deserve as a people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime in the quorum call be jointly charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Presiding Officer and I have discussed this issue \nthat is on the floor before us now, the next tranche of funds for the \nTARP program. All one has to do is listen to what TARP stands for: \nToxic Assets--T-A--and your first instinct is: I don't want to go near \nit; I don't want to touch it; I don't want to have anything to do with \nit. I can tell my colleagues from the bottom of my heart that on 99 \npercent of issues here, I know what I am going to do pretty much \nimmediately, because it is a clear path for me. I find it not that \ndifficult to make that decision. However, the first vote we had on TARP \nafter a phone call with Secretary Paulson and Ben Bernanke where they \nsaid: Our system is on the verge of economic collapse and if we don't \nget them the 700-plus billion dollars, our Nation would face economic \nruin--I remember I was on that phone call with about 30 other Senators, \nand we were asked for a blank check by Henry Paulson. He wanted 700-\nplus billion dollars, he wanted it then, that minute, that second. He \nwanted no strings. He didn't want to tell the bankers they couldn't \ntake a bonus payment. He didn't want to tell them executive pay had to \nbe reasonable. He didn't want to tell them they would have to lend. He \ndidn't want to use it for housing. It was a horrible conversation. We \nsaid: You are not getting a blank check and we are not going to do this \nuntil we put some strings on this.\n  Well, we put a few strings on it. We set up a commission to oversee \nit. I wish to say that Mr. Paulson, in my view, did not live up to the \nspirit of what this Senate and this Congress wanted him to live up to. \nWhat they did was not transparent. What they did did not ease the \ncredit crisis. What they did was to kind of ignore the problem of the \nhousing crisis which got us into this mess in the first place.\n  So let me be clear. Let me be clear to my constituents. If Henry \nPaulson was going to get this money, this second tranche of money, if \nthe Bush administration was going to continue to dole out this money, I \nwouldn't give them $3, let alone $350 billion. I wouldn't give them 30 \ncents. I wouldn't give them 3 cents. However, I have to say to all of \nthose within the sound of my voice, as someone who wound up voting for \nthe first tranche and feeling badly about it ever since: When \nPresident-elect Obama tells us that it would be irresponsible for him, \nin the face of this worst crisis since the Great Depression, to not \nhave the ability to tap into these funds; when he tells us that he is \nfearful that there could be a great crisis, that there could be an \nemergency; when he asks us to trust him on this and put our confidence \nin him and that he is going to use these funds in a different way, he \nis going to use these funds to address the housing crisis, and that he \nis going to be transparent; and to quote him, ``Every penny that they \nspend, the public will know about,'' I have a choice. I have a choice. \nI can say: Sorry, it was a horrible experience the first time and I am \nnot going to give you this chance. I could say that. That is the easy \nthing. That is the easy vote. Voting no is the easy vote. Then I can go \nhome and not worry about it. But how could I walk away from this \nPresident at this time? When he says to me and he says to us he needs a \nchance here, he needs this tool in his pocket to bring it out if he is \nin a crisis worse than the one now, I cannot walk away from that.\n  So I say to my constituents I will vote for this, and I will do it \nbecause of the assurances I have gotten from the President-elect \nhimself that it will be different, that he will use these funds \njudiciously, that he needs to make sure he has this tool in his pocket. \nI hope my constituents understand that after hearing that from this \nPresident, who got more than 60 percent of the vote in my State, that I \nfeel he deserves my trust at this time.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank Senator Dodd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, a number of us--many Americans--are \ndisappointed that the first act of this new Congress and this new \nPresident will be to add $350 billion more borrowing on the backs of \nour children and grandchildren. Madam President, $350 billion will be \nin addition to another $350 billion that we approved last year, as well \nas the nearly $1 trillion we are talking about in stimulus that will be \ncoming up next year. This is not the change that many Americans had \nhoped for as we enter a new administration. Many of us are very \ndisappointed in how the first round of troubled assets funds have been \nused.\n  It is clear that the intention of the incoming President and the new \nDemocratic majority in Congress is to spend and borrow our way out of \nthis recession. That doesn't work for families. It is not going to work \nfor our country. More spending and borrowing and printing money may \nhelp Washington to grow and prosper, but it is certainly not going to \nhelp American families and businesses grow and prosper.\n  In this context that we are here today talking about this $350 \nbillion in spending, with all respect to my colleague who just spoke, \nthe easy thing to do is vote for more spending here in Washington. We \nfind it is almost impossible to get people to vote for any cuts in \nspending. Yet, in spite of our calls for economic relief in an economic \nmeltdown situation, Congress refuses to make any sacrifices on what we \ndo here.\n  I am speaking to support this resolution of disapproval that has been \noffered by Senator Vitter, and I encourage all of my colleagues to take \nthis responsible step to slow down this avalanche of spending and debt \nin our country.\n  Some are trying to make us feel a little better about this incredible \namount of spending by saying: It is not real spending; the government \nis actually investing in debt of companies and intervening in companies \nand that we could get some of this money back. Frankly, it doesn't make \nme feel any better to know that this government is intervening in the \nprivate sector and every place it touches, it is going to bring new \nrules and regulations and make our economy less likely to operate as it \nshould.\n  As we know, many who voted for this TARP bill last October now regret \nthey did it. I didn't vote for it, but many who have, have issued press \nreleases and spoken on this floor being very critical of how it was \nused and the fact that it hasn't worked. The promises that were made of \nhow this money was going to be used were changed within a couple of \nweeks of the time the panic was issued here in Washington, and everyone \nwas told they needed to vote for it or there would be worldwide \neconomic calamity. Yet, almost before the ink was dry, they changed \nwhat they were going to do on the bill. I think for that reason, many \ndo not trust this whole process of creating a slush fund for an \nadministration, whether it be Republican or Democrat, to spend $700 \nbillion.\n  We know what happened last fall. In October there was a crisis \nmentality. We were told we had to act immediately. Since then, in spite \nof all of the promises, the stock market has fallen nearly 25 percent \nand we are in the same credit problem situation that we had then. It is \ntoo much money to be throwing at the wall in hopes that it might work. \nI still hear at home that all of this money we put into the system has \nnot worked its way into small business loans or loans for individuals, \nloans to buy cars, and we have no assurance at this point that an \nadditional $350 billion will do that.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to look at where we are as a\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\nNation and the amount of debt we have. The amount of debt we have is \nnow approaching a half a million dollars for every American family. It \nis very difficult to justify continuing to borrow money when all we are \ndoing is treating the symptoms of the problem.\n  It is amazing to me that we are talking about throwing more money at \na problem and we have yet to address the causes of the problem. We know \nthe government made many mistakes with government-sponsored entities \nsuch as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We have not corrected those \nproblems in a way that will show any results. We know we require banks \nto make loans to people who can't afford to pay them back and we have \nnot corrected those problems. If you talk to any businessman--and I \nhave been a businessman most of my life--they are not looking for a \nshort-term, knee-jerk solution; they need to have a predictable \nbusiness environment in order to take risks and make investments and \ngrow their business.\n  If we were looking at real solutions such as lowering our corporate \ntax rate, lowering capital gains that would encourage the nearly $11 \ntrillion of private money that is now sitting on the sidelines--we are \nnot talking about doing anything that is going to encourage this \nprivate money to get into the market, into the banking system that \nwould create more liquidity. All we are doing is treating the symptoms, \nand there is no discussion of solving the problem.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will take the telephone calls and the e-mails \nthey are getting from their constituents, as I am, seriously. Americans \nintuitively know that what we are doing here is wrong. Even if it \nworked for a few months, all of us know we have to pay it back, our \nchildren and our grandchildren for generations to come, with a lower \nstandard of living, incredibly high taxes, and a devalued currency.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak and I yield \nmy time, as I again encourage my colleagues to vote for this resolution \nof disapproval, and let's figure out how to solve the real problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I intend to vote against the resolution \ndisapproving the release of the so-called second tranche of funds for \nthe troubled asset relief program, or TARP, albeit with some \nreservations.\n  When I first decided to support the TARP last fall, I did so because \nI believed it was essential to preventing the collapse of our financial \nmarkets. I believed we were facing an emergency that would hurt every \nAmerican unless Congress stepped in to provide temporary assistance to \nour financial system. I continue to believe this today. The conditions \nthat called for the first one-half of the $700 billion authorized still \nexist today.\n  Last fall, credit stopped flowing. The root of the problem, and I \nthink we all agree, is that the banks didn't know if their mortgage-\nbacked securities had value. No one was willing to loan based upon that \nlack of knowledge. When they stopped lending to each other, they also \nstopped lending to businesses, large and small, and to ordinary \nAmericans. People couldn't even get a loan for a car or a major \nappliance, and that condition persists throughout the country today to \nsome degree. We learned very quickly that the dubious business model of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac to securitize more and more mortgages was \ncausing the entire system of credit and financing to seize up. Every \nAmerican has been hurt by this market failure.\n  So the Secretary of the Treasury recommended that a $700 billion \ninvestment program that was flexible enough to change with market \nconditions and that would be focused on addressing the underlying \nproblem in our financial market, namely, these mortgage-backed \nsecurities and the Treasury has deployed or committed the first half of \nthe money--$350 billion--and is now asking for the second half. \nUnfortunately, as I said, the same circumstances that called for the \ninitial $350 billion I believe pertain today.\n  For the most part, I have supported the Treasury's actions, although \nI wish that the conditions enabled the banks to be more aggressive in \ntheir lending. I don't view the program as a gift to the banking \nindustry because the funds must be paid back with interest.\n  I did not and do not support their decision to use TARP funds to bail \nout the automobile industry, a purpose for which it was clearly not \nintended. I wish to make it clear, I always understood and believe that \nthe full $700 billion would likely be needed to get our credit markets \nworking again. That is why I support giving the Treasury Department the \nauthorization for this second tranche of $350 billion, and it is why I \nwill vote against the resolution to disapprove releasing the funds.\n  I have had many conversations with officials of the incoming Obama \nadministration, and they promised me and all Republicans, for that \nmatter, that they intend to dedicate the fund to shoring up the \nfinancial markets. They promised they will not use the funds to prop up \nfailing companies outside of the remaining commitment to the automobile \nindustry made by the Bush administration, my understanding about $4 \nbillion, and the possibility of debtor possession financing under \ncertain circumstances.\n  They promised greater transparency and accountability, and I intend \nto stay in close contact with them to see that these commitments are \nkept. I know this is not a popular decision, but I believe, in the long \nrun, this program will help to keep our economy from collapsing. It \nwill eventually help it to recover, and that will benefit every \nArizonan and every American.\n  I wish to be clear that I am not asking any of my colleagues to join \nwith me on this vote unless they have concluded, as I have, that we \nsimply did not take a chance that we don't have the financial ability \nto deal with crises as they develop.\n  It is, unfortunately, my view that crises will continue to develop in \nthe finance and banking sector of our economy so we are going to need \nthe authority for the next $350 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to make it clear from the \nbeginning that no vote--well, there have been a few votes I have cast \nin my 24 years, now going on 25 years, that I have regretted. We are \nall human. We make mistakes. We try to get the best information we can, \nand then we vote.\n  Last fall, the information we got is we were on the verge of \ncollapse, we had to do something, we had to get this TARP bill through, \nso I voted for it.\n  Then I became more and more dismayed as the weeks went by and the \nmonths now to see how it was mishandled completely, not in accordance \nwith what we in Congress were told they were going to do. They said \nthey were going to purchase toxic assets. But then Secretary Paulson \nand his friends did the old bait and switch. Instead of doing that, \nthey pumped tens of billions of dollars into purchasing equity in major \nbanks.\n  I said many times it is sort of like Secretary Paulson and his \nbuddies doing all for whom I call the graduates of Goldman Sachs, sort \nof taking care of their buddies and bailing out their buddies in the \nbanking industry.\n  So when this new TARP came up, I must tell you I was adamantly \nopposed: no more of this, we are not going to put any more money out \nthere like this. Then I began discussions with the new administration \ncoming in. They have come up and talked with us a number of times. I \nhad about three phone calls last night with my good friend, Senator Joe \nBiden, who will be our next Vice President.\n  He said: What is troubling you?\n  I said: What is troubling me is that no one seems to be responsible \nfor what happened to the first 350. You have Paulson, but then there is \nPresident Bush, and somebody else seems to be responsible.\n  I said: Secondly, they didn't use the money for what we wanted and \nthere is no transparency. We don't know what happened to a lot of it. \nAnd I said: Third, there has to be more of this money put out there for \nmiddle-class America. It has to be put out there for them--not this \ntrickle down where you put it in investment banks--but put it down \nbelow so it can percolate up. He talked with the President-elect. We \nhad three phone calls last evening.\n  I see a letter from Lawrence Summers was sent up to us today which \nreiterates what soon-to-be Vice President\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\nBiden said to me last night. First, no substantial amount of money will \ngo out of this fund unless it is signed off by President Barack Obama. \nHe has to sign off on it. So we know where the buck stops.\n  Second, the way the system is set up, Vice President Joe Biden will \nbe in there, he will be a part of this process, and the President will \nrely on him for his input into this process. I know Joe Biden. There \nhas never been a stronger fighter for middle-class America and for \nworking families than Joe Biden. So that reassures me we have another \nsource of input into this effort.\n  And third, they are going to make it absolutely transparent and put \nit out for everyone to see where they are going.\n  Again, there were a couple of other things they agreed to do. No. 1, \nexecutive compensation cannot go above a certain threshold until the \nGovernment has been repaid. That is good.\n  No. 2, shareholders will not be rewarded until the Government has \nbeen repaid. For firms receiving exceptional assistance, quarterly \ndividend payments will be restricted to 1 penny per quarter until the \ntaxpayers are repaid. That is pretty darn reassuring to me.\n  And now this: preclude the use of Government funds to purchase \nhealthy firms rather than to boost lending. That is exactly what \nhappened with the last 350.\n  I find myself now in a position of saying: Look, we still have \nproblems out there, we have credit problems out there. We didn't answer \nthese problems. We have a new team. Barack Obama--and I served with him \nin the Senate as all of us have--said time and time again--and I know \nwhere he is coming from--that we have to help middle-class America, \nthat we can't just put the money in at the top anymore. Joe Biden has \nsaid the same things.\n  With these assurances that there is a new team down there, now I am \ngoing to be able to support the release of the next $350 billion.\n  I close with this: I felt a little bit, after the last one, like \nCharlie Brown and Lucy--she is always pulling the football out from \nunder Charlie Brown. I said: That is not going to happen to me again. \nWell, Lucy is not holding the ball now. We have someone new holding \nthat ball, someone by the name of Barack Obama and Joe Biden and their \nteam.\n  I am going to put my trust in them based on this letter that has been \nsent up, which I understand was made part of the Record earlier today. \nWith those assurances that we can get that money out, down to \nhomeowners, to help on foreclosures, to help out some of our smaller \nbanks with their credit problems, I see my way clear now to vote to \nmake sure we get this money released for the new administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise to support the joint resolution \nof disapproval which would prevent, as you know, the allocation of \nanother $350 billion to the Treasury's flawed Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram.\n  The Treasury Department's implementation of TARP has been a \nbureaucratic fiasco. In the years to come, I believe it will be \nconsidered a textbook case in our business schools on how not to \nconduct fiscal policy.\n  The Treasury Department has never had a clear plan on how to respond \nto the financial crisis or how TARP funds could best be utilized. It \ntold Congress just a few months ago that it would spend TARP funds one \nway and then spent them another. Rather than establish a clear plan and \nthen use TARP funds to implement it, Treasury has recklessly used TARP \nfunds to bail out big Wall Street firms threatened with bankruptcy.\n  TARP has proven to be helpful for rescuing Wall Street bondholders \nbut has done little for the U.S. economy, small business, and average \nAmericans.\n  Treasury's approach to TARP has been so undisciplined that its \ncommitments already exceed the $350 billion Congress authorized it to \nspend.\n  Further evidence of the erratic implementation of TARP is the fact \nthat Treasury has even failed to comply with the statutory requirements \nfor requesting the additional $350 billion in TARP funds. The statute \nclearly requires the Treasury Secretary to provide Congress with a \ndetailed plan on how it will spend the additional funds. There is no \nplan. There is nothing to review. There is no way we can say to the \nAmerican people this afternoon that we have conducted in the Senate a \nthoughtful, thorough examination of how this money is going to be spent \nbecause there is, quite literally, nothing to examine.\n  If Congress cannot hold Treasury accountable for providing a simple \nplan on how it will use an additional $350 billion, why should the \nAmerican people today have any confidence Congress can hold Treasury \naccountable on how it will spend it?\n  As you know, I opposed the original TARP legislation because I did \nnot believe the TARP program was based on a well-thought-out plan. \nDuring our consideration of that legislation in the Senate, I pointed \nout to some of my colleagues some clear and serious problems with \npurchasing troubled assets as Treasury proposed to do at that time.\n  The Treasury Department assured us--assured us--told us unequivocally \nit could address the financial crisis by establishing TARP to purchase \ntroubled assets from banks using a reverse mortgage auction.\n  Is that what the initial $350 billion was used for? The answer is no. \nAfter further examination, the Treasury Secretary decided that \npurchasing troubled assets was not a feasible plan.\n  It is now clear the Secretary of the Treasury did not have a real \nplan when he proposed TARP. Rather, he had a hastily conceived notion \nthat, it turned out, was impossible to implement. Because there was so \nlittle thought put into the original plan, we have spent $350 billion \nand the TARP has failed to stem the economic downturn and hundreds of \nthousands of people have lost their jobs.\n  We should not, this afternoon, repeat our mistake--but we will--by \ngranting the Treasury the additional $350 billion without first \ndetermining how to best use those funds.\n  I think it is time the Congress stop and think and take the time to \ndevise an effective solution. First, we should demand that the Treasury \nSecretary provide a plan on how the $350 billion will be used. That is \nthe least we can do. This is already required, as I said, under the \nTARP legislation, which directs the Secretary to submit ``a written \nreport detailing the plan of the Secretary.''\n  What the Secretary has submitted is not only legally insufficient, it \nis completely devoid of substance. This should not be acceptable to the \nSenate.\n  Second, the Banking Committee should hold extensive hearings on TARP \nand alternative ways of addressing our financial problems. It should \nalso hold hearings on how previously committed TARP funds have been \nspent, who benefited, who is accountable. The Treasury Secretary, \nwhoever it may be, should appear before Congress and tell us exactly \nhow he wants to use the funds. This is especially important now that a \nnew administration will be responsible for spending it.\n  Madam President, $350 billion is an enormous amount of money to me. I \nfind it hard to believe we would even consider granting any public \nofficial the authority to spend such an amount without, at the very \nleast, requiring him to appear before us and explain how he will use \nit. If the majority and the new administration wish to demonstrate that \nthere is a new climate of accountability in Washington, this would be \nan opportune place to start.\n  I believe the choice is clear. If you support accountability, \ntransparency, the only vote is to support the joint resolution to deny \nthe $350 billion to the Treasury.\n  The American people, I believe, are rightly outraged at the way \nCongress and the Treasury have recklessly spent billions of TARP \ndollars. It is time Congress looks at the financial crisis with the \nseriousness and diligence the American people demand, expect, and \nreserve.\n  The last time we considered how to respond to the financial crisis, \nwe panicked and passed the TARP bill. We now have a second chance--\nthough I believe we will throw it away--to fulfill our responsibilities \nto the American people. I hope we will support the motion to \ndisapprove. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the joint \nresolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, next week, we will inaugurate a new \nCommander in Chief. It is a time of hope and opportunity for people \nacross this country.\n  While many Americans are hopeful today, too many of them are hurting, \nand they cannot wait another day for the change they have been \npromised. People in my home State of Washington are feeling the pain.\n  When I held an economic roundtable in Everett, WA, earlier in \nDecember, the room was filled to overflowing with people who came out \nin the middle of the day to express their concerns and to listen to \nbusiness owners and families and community members talk about the \nstruggles they are facing.\n  Unemployment in my State, like States across the country, is at \nrecord highs. Businesses, big and small, are struggling to meet their \npayroll. And too many families are still wondering how they are going \nto stay in their homes or get a loan to pay for school for their kids.\n  We stood here on this floor almost 3 months ago debating whether to \napprove the President's request for economic rescue funds. At that \ntime, communities across my State were hurting. Families were \nstruggling to pay for their groceries, to afford health care, and \nwondering how they were going to pay for college.\n  My constituents were angry they were being asked to fork over their \ntax dollars to cover the consequences of years of reckless abandon on \nWall Street and the failure of this administration to regulate or rein \nin their folly.\n  Here we are today, 3 months later, and my communities and my families \nare still hurting. Many people are still struggling with health care \nand education and foreclosures. Just this week, the people of my State \nheard Boeing announce plans to lay off thousands of workers in the \nState of Washington. The Seattle PI--a newspaper that thousands have \nwelcomed into their homes every day--was put up for sale. And today we \nlearn that foreclosures in our most populated county have spiked by 88 \npercent over last year.\n  My constituents live 2,500 miles away from here, and they are \nlistening to our debate here today. They are asking why on Earth \nCongress would approve billions of dollars more after the way the last \nchunk was handled.\n  The rescue funds we approved in October prevented economic collapse, \nbut regular people are still struggling. They say they have not felt \nthe impact of these funds on their job security, on their incomes, or \ntheir ability to stay in their homes.\n  I have to say, I understand their frustration, and I share their \nconcerns. I am angry too. I am angry about the lack of transparency \ninto how banks are using these dollars. I, in fact, picked up the phone \nand called Secretary Paulson to express my outrage when I read stories \nof those lavish parties held by companies that received our precious \nrescue dollars.\n  There has not been enough accountability or transparency to date. \nThat must change. There has not been enough benefit to regular families \nand small business owners and homeowners. That must change. When I \nvoted in favor of these funds in October, I said it was not a cure-all \nbut an attempt to keep an already very bad situation from getting much \nworse.\n  It takes both investment and honesty to get our economy back on \ntrack. Unfortunately, we have not had much of either. The disbursement \nof these funds was the current administration's entire plan to improve \nthe economy. But their philosophy was like using a Band-Aid when the \neconomy needed surgery.\n  The administration will change next week, but the challenges facing \nour Nation will not. I spoke with President-elect Obama earlier this \nweek, and I expressed my concerns about how the economic rescue funds \nhad been used up to this point. He agreed.\n  Today, I met with Timothy Geithner, the President-elect's nominee to \nhead the Treasury Department. He gave me his assurances that \ntransparency and accountability will be improved and that there will be \nmore done to help responsible homeowners avoid foreclosure.\n  With those assurances, I believe the American people are finally \ngoing to get the investment and the honesty they deserve. President-\nelect Obama is inheriting an economic crisis. That is a very tough \nplace to start. But he told me, in order to move ahead and focus on \nAmerica's families and businesses, we have to ensure the stability of \nour financial markets. The President-elect has assured me that while he \nbelieves these funds are important, they are only one part of his plan \nto get America back on track.\n  So I said yes to those funds today because I believe we can move \nforward, and I want our new President to have the ability to focus on \nour economic recovery. The President-elect and Members of Congress are \ncommitted to ensuring a full and accurate accounting of how the \nTreasury Department has allocated the funds spent to date and going \nforward, and we will ensure that assistance does not just flow to large \nfinancial institutions, but will be available to our community banks \nand small businesses as well. We will take a hard look at the factors \nthat brought us to this point and address them.\n  Our new President has promised to work with Congress to pass and \nimplement new regulatory measures to better protect consumers and \nbusinesses and investors and to ensure that our taxpayers are never \nagain put in this terrible position. We will work with this new \nadministration to quickly implement aggressive policies to reduce \npreventable foreclosures for responsible homeowners.\n  This crisis started in the housing market, and we will not dig \nourselves out without overhauling the system. I will not be done with \nthis process until Americans who have lost their jobs and their homes \nare back on their feet.\n  People of my State know what it will take to get America working \nagain, and so do I. We have to value our workforce and find a way to \nmake health care affordable and accessible. We have to invest in \nresearch and development and reward American innovation. We have to \nimplement a smart forward-looking energy policy that ends our addiction \nto foreign oil once and for all. We have to invest in our roads and our \nbridges and our highways and the projects that will pave the way for \nfurther economic growth. We have to recognize that education is a \npriority. We cannot fill those great jobs of the future without an \neducated and skilled workforce.\n  It is time to put America's families first. It is time to restore \ntheir faith that government works for, not against, them. Americans who \nare hurting today will not see a change overnight. There is a long, \nhard path ahead of us, but the American dream of owning a home or \nrunning a business or going to college is still alive in communities \nacross this country. To pull back now and allow our credit markets to \nfreeze would tie the hands of an incoming administration with plans to \ninvest in America again and potentially cause lasting economic harm.\n  This is just one step in the process. We will provide these rescue \nfunds to stabilize our financial markets, but we will also implement \nstrict regulatory reforms and pass an economic recovery package that \ninvests in our communities and puts Americans back to work.\n  I grew up in a country that was there for my family in very hard \ntimes. When my father got sick and could no longer work while raising \nseven kids, there were Pell grants and student loans and food stamps \nwhen my family needed them. I will always remember that. That is why I \nwill always work to make sure our country is there now for today's \nAmerican families.\n  I supported this rescue package today because we have to keep our \ncountry moving forward, and our incoming President deserves the support \nof Congress to make that happen.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, to a certain extent I wish to follow up \nprecisely on the remarks the Senator from Washington made at the end of \nher speech.\n  I, too, have been disappointed with the deployment of the first half \nof the TARP money, and I supported that deployment in the hopes that it \nwould stabilize the marketplace, ease credit for our customers, and \nhelp the housing market. While it probably did stabilize the banking \nsystem, there has yet to be a loosening of credit and\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\nthere has yet to be a recovery of the housing market.\n  Looking ahead, we continue to look at suggestions that throw money at \nthe problem rather than getting to the root cause of the problem. In \nfact, with the best of intentions, I think people are struggling to \nmeet the symptoms of a serious illness rather than treat the illness. I \nwish to direct my remarks tonight to that illness.\n  The illness, as the Senator from Washington referred to, is the \ncollapse of the U.S. housing market which began in the last quarter of \n2007. In the first quarter of 2008, in January, I introduced a housing \ntax credit of up to $15,000 for the purchase of any house that was \nstanding vacant or in foreclosure. I did it for a couple of reasons. \nNo. 1, I was in the real estate business for 33 years, and I was in it \nin 1974, a year in which we had a housing collapse worse than the \ncurrent situation. While many people think this one is bad, it is not \nas bad as 1974.\n  In December of 1974, there was a 3-year supply of unsold, standing \nnew houses in the United States of America. That is a catastrophic \ninventory. We currently have a supply of about 11 to 13 months, \ndepending on the State. That is not a good market, but it is not 36 \nmonths, which is a horrible market.\n  President Gerald Ford, a Republican, and a Democratic Congress, came \ntogether and passed a $2,000 tax credit to any family who bought and \noccupied one of those standing homes. Within 1 year's time, which was \nthe limited time of the tax credit, two-thirds of the housing inventory \non the market was sold, values stopped declining and started improving, \nand we had a stabilization of our economy, the end of a recessionary \nperiod, and the beginning of prosperity.\n  I come here tonight because about an hour and a half ago I dropped a \nbill known as Fix Housing First, an effort for me and others in this \nbody to rekindle that debate of last January. Now, last year, we did \npass a housing tax credit, but it was a now-you-see-it/now-you-don't \napproach. It was a first-time home buyer credit of $7,500 that was a \nrefundable loan, interest free, because over 15 years you would pay the \ncredit back to the Government in the form of income taxes. It was an \nincentive, but it was weak. It was not bold.\n  The tax credit we introduced last year was scored by CBO at $11.4 \nbillion, and Finance believed at that time--and maybe rightfully so--\nthat was too big a price to pay and too expensive. Well, because we \ndidn't do it, in October of this year, we approved $750 billion to \naddress the symptoms of the problem, which is the failure of the \nhousing market.\n  I had the privilege yesterday of meeting with some of President-elect \nObama's team, including Rahm Emanuel, Dr. Summers, and others, and told \nthem precisely what I am saying on the floor of the Senate today; that \nis, I hope they will embrace this concept of incentivizing the housing \nmarket so we can stabilize values, stop the continuing erosion of \nequity, and begin to reflate--not inflate but reflate--the housing \nmarket.\n  In America today, 20 percent of the houses are underwater, meaning \nthere is more owed on them than they are worth. That means equity lines \nof credit with our banks are in default. It means students going to \ncollege are losing the money their parents had for tuition. It means \nthere is not enough liquidity in households anymore or credit \navailability to make purchases of durable goods that are important to \nour system, and our system is continuing to feed in a downward spiral \non the illiquidity, the lack of equity, and the lack of a marketplace \nfor housing.\n  I was in this business for a long time, and I called 10 people who \nworked for me a number of years ago last weekend in Atlanta. I asked \nthem, I said: What is going on in the market? Tell me what the buyers \nare saying or are there any buyers? I talked to a lady by the name of \nGlennis Beacham.\n  She said: Johnny, I had nine people come to my open house last \nweekend, and that is a good crowd for an open house in this \nmarketplace. Every one of them had the money and they wanted to buy, \nbut they were looking for two things: a short sale, which means \nsomebody selling their house for less than is owed on it and getting a \ndiscount from the lender, which means it is a downward price or they \nare looking for somebody whose house is going into foreclosure that \nthey think they can steal. They don't want to even make an offer on the \n80 percent of people's houses in this country who are making their \npayments, aren't in default, aren't in foreclosure, but might need to \nsell. So the marketplace has died.\n  Now, Fix Housing First proposes the following: Repeal the $7,500 tax \ncredit we passed last year, which is not being used, by the way. That \ncredit has not been used to any extent whatsoever. Replace it with a \ntax credit that will go from $10,000 to $22,000 depending on the \nformula. It would be a monetizeable tax credit. What that means is \nthis: you make the tax credit good for this year--January 1 through \nDecember 31 of 2009--but you allow the monetization or the claiming of \nthat credit against the 2008 income taxes of that family. The 2008 \nincome taxes come due in April of this year, the 15th. We all know \nthat. By allowing the credit to be taken against 2008 income taxes, you \ncan monetize that money at the closing, use it as a part of the \ndownpayment, and immediately incentivize the marketplace. Is that a \nlittle costly? Sure. Is it something we would rather not do? Probably. \nBut what are we going to do? Watch the marketplace go down to where \nfour out of every five houses are underwater? Watch sales go down to \nwhere there is no viable housing market in this country? It has not \nstopped spiraling. It is continuing, and everything feeds off of it.\n  I don't wish to belabor this point, but I wish to talk for the \nAmerican people, the people of Georgia. The community bankers are \nhamstrung right now. Most of their investments are in real estate, \nresidential construction, and acquisition and development loans. With \nno marketplace to buy the lots or buy the houses, they have no cashflow \ncoming in to service the loans. They are deteriorating in terms of \ntheir value. Americans who have been transferred who are making their \npayments, who have a viable house, who have to sell it to move to the \nnext city of choice, there is no marketplace to buy that house, so that \nis stagnating.\n  Consumer products, take carpets, for example. The State of Georgia, \nthe County of Whitfield, the City of Dalton produces about 85 percent \nof the domestic carpet in the United States of America. It is shut \ndown. The mills are shut down. Why? People aren't recarpeting. They \naren't redoing their houses. New houses aren't selling. The market is \ngone. I could go on and on with durable products made in the United \nStates of America whose industries are now in trouble because the \nhousing market has taken a severe hit over a protracted period of time.\n  So my plea to the President-elect, to my friends on both sides of the \naisle, to the Members of the United States House of Representatives, as \nwe are deploying countless billions of dollars to react to problems \nthat are manifesting because of a failed housing market and mistakes \nthat were made in the past, let's put some money out there to \nincentivize Mr. and Ms. America who want the American dream to buy a \nhome, to buy one for their family, occupy it as their residence, and \ngive them a tax credit for doing it. It is a small price for the \nGovernment to pay to begin to restore the industry that got us to where \nwe are and will lead us out of these dangerous and dark times.\n  So I come tonight on behalf of the homeowners of the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Florida and mine, the community bankers, the \nrealtors, the homebuilders, the fix-it people, the durable goods \nproducers, the building supply makers, the landscapers--every job that \nhas been lost and gone, in some cases forever, because the housing \nmarket in this country has collapsed.\n  We have learned our lesson for loose underwriting. We have learned \nour lesson from loaning money to people who weren't qualified to \nborrow. We have paid a terrible price for that lesson, both the country \nand the people. It is time for us to do what we know we should have \ndone: have quality underwriting, available credit, but have \naccountability in our lending system, make sure values are appraised \nright, underwriting is done right, and credit is available but people \nare qualified. If we can do that and incentivize people to come back \nbecause of the tax credit, we can solve this problem.\n  I don't want to oversimplify the gravity of the problem we face, but \nthe\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\nhousing market led us in; the housing market will lead us out. It is \ntime for us to fix housing first. Our failure to do so will cost us a \nlot more than $700 billion of our taxpayers' money, and countless \nAmericans who shouldn't will lose their homes, lose their jobs, and \nlose their faith in the greatest country on the face of this Earth.\n  I ask my colleagues to study this recommendation. I hope the \nPresident-elect will embrace it. I hope, quickly, we can fix housing \nfirst in the United States of America.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, for the past 2 weeks, I have been \npatiently waiting for what everyone in this chamber knew was \ninevitable. When the Senate passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization \nAct on October 1, 2008, we included a stipulation allowing the \ndisbursement of the final $350 billion only upon the President's \nrequest to Congress, and after Congress had been given an opportunity \nto pass a resolution of disapproval preventing release of the funds. We \ndid this to provide a chance to thoroughly assess the program, make \nchanges, and get our country's economy on the right track again.\n  Although I voted against the act that created the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, the TARP, I was pleased that this provision was added \ninto the final bill. Many of my colleagues and I thought, \noptimistically, that the TARP would work better than we had predicted. \nIt was even possible, some noted, that we would not have to spend the \nentire $350 billion final disbursement. Even if it was necessary to \napprove the additional funds, we would be provided the opportunity to \nevaluate the program and make it more effective in a rapidly changing \nmarket.\n  So in preparation for the President's request, I have been keeping \ntrack of the market conditions, following the headlines, and watching \nthe stock market. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed \ndown almost 250 points. This is the lowest the market has closed in \n2009, and the biggest drop since December 1, 2008.\n  Jobless claims have increased since the holiday slowdown. The U.S. \nDepartment of Labor statistics on unemployment released today indicate \nthat the recession is getting worse and that those companies we were \ntrying to save with the TARP program are cutting more workers than \npredicted in order to stay afloat. These are the same workers who have \nseen a lifetime of retirement earnings shrink to nothing. Others have \nlost their homes, their most stable financial asset in past years, due \nto rising unemployment and a frozen credit market. For those Americans \nwithout a job, they face dismal employment prospects as companies \ncontinue to cut their workforces to stay in the black.\n  The companies that employ them are not in any better shape. Headlines \nthis week warned that even the largest financial institutions were \nforced to take drastic measures to remain viable. For example: \n``Citigroup Ready to Shrink Itself by a Third.'' ``Bank of America to \nget Billions in U.S. Aid, Can't close deal for Ailing Merrill Lynch.'' \nThese developments occur despite $350 billion of taxpayer money already \nspent, and billions more guaranteed through the Federal Reserve.\n  After more than 3 months, it is time we take a detailed look at the \nTARP program and ask ourselves, ``Are American taxpayers getting what \nthey paid for?'' Based on my observations, it is clear that we are not. \nOur economy appears to be in no better shape than on October 1, 2008, \nwhen we passed this massive $700 billion emergency bailout, and today \nthe Senate is poised and seemingly eager to send more money out the \ndoor. We are throwing good money after bad money, and expecting \ndifferent results. But without substantial changes to the TARP and \nmeasurable, attainable goals, there is no chance of success for this \nprogram.\n  Let's be clear, this program has not worked. America is still in the \ngrips of a frozen credit market, and the U.S. Treasury continues to \noperate this program in a manner never intended by the Congress when we \ncreated the TARP. In fact, upon passage of the act, Treasury gave it a \ndifferent name. The TARP became the Capital Purchase Program and \ninstead of buying troubled assets, the Treasury began buying stock \ndirectly from the market. Yet when Congress has an opportunity to put \nthis program back on track, some of my colleagues would prefer to \nsimply give Treasury more money to operate a $700 billion slush fund as \nit pleases. This is not the time to encourage blind spending and ignore \nthe fundamental problems with our country's capital markets. Now is the \ntime to modernize the TARP, add accountability and transparency, and \nhold Treasury to its commitment to operate this program the way we \nintended.\n  It will take more than blind spending to get our economy back on \ntrack. That is why I support the resolution of disapproval. My \ncolleagues in the Senate must take a critical look at this program, \nmeasure its progress and setbacks, and make changes that will put this \nmoney where it is most needed. It is obvious that the first $350 \nbillion has not worked, so why are we rewarding this failure with more \nmoney? Instead, let's work on a reform package that will hold \nTreasury's feet to the fire and get credit flowing through our markets \nagain. We need a program that will put our money to work building \nconstruction projects, hiring employees, and operating small and large \nbusinesses across the country. We need a program that will bring \nconfidence back to the market. This program must be temporary, and \nprovide a reasonable chance of success for the businesses and the \ntaxpayers who are participating in it. It also must be accountable and \ntransparent. The American taxpayers should know what they are getting \nwith their investment, and to date, they do not.\n  I am willing to work with my colleagues on a reform package that will \ndo all of these things. However, the first step must be to put the \nbrakes on this reckless spending. Doing so will provide us with the \nopportunity to make the program better, and fulfill our obligation to \nthe taxpayers funding this program with their hard-earned money.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam. President, we are in a crisis unparalleled since \nthe Great Depression. We are on a deeply troubling path, marked by \ncredit freezes, foreclosures, rising unemployment, and declining \npurchasing power. And that path, in the autumn of last year, appeared \nto be heading toward a cliff. We were fearful of what might happen if \nwe stood idle and allowed our economy to fall off that cliff.\n  The initial Emergency Economic Stabilization Act proposal put forth \nby the White House and the Treasury Department was unacceptable. It was \nessentially a blank check for $700 billion to be spent however they \npleased. There were no provisions for oversight, no accountability, no \nmechanism to ensure that the funds were well-spent. Congress did \nsignificant work to create a more acceptable proposal, including \ndividing the recovery funds into two pieces, the second of which could \nbe disapproved by Congress.\n  In the months since we passed that legislation, I have been deeply \ndisappointed in the way the administration has handled the program. \nAlthough we required the Treasury Department to maximize assistance for \nhomeowners and work to minimize foreclosures, no systematic foreclosure \nmitigation program has been adopted, let alone implemented. Although \nthe goal of the legislation was to unfreeze credit markets, the \nTreasury Department did not take reasonable steps to ensure that a \nsignificant portion of the billions of dollars distributed to banks \nacross the country were used for this purpose.\n  Indeed, in one specific example, one bank that received over $2 \nbillion in TARP funding has been reducing the lines of credit for \nMichigan businesses that have been longtime customers of the bank \nwithout a single default. I am hearing similar accounts from across \nMichigan and throughout the Nation. This slashing of credit by banks \nreceiving federal funds is the opposite of what TARP was intended to \ndo.\n  Many may recall that the originally stated purpose of the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program was to focus on purchasing ``toxic'' assets from \nfinancial institutions. While Congress set significant disclosure and \noversight requirements to monitor these purchases, we also provided \nflexibility for the Treasury Department to respond rapidly to the \ndeveloping crisis. Treasury decided\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\nthat the originally conceived TARP program would not suffice to save \nour economy from the approaching cliff, so the administration turned to \ncapital injections. The administration does not know what this massive \ninfusion of capital has done to mitigate the economic crisis. They \nestablished no metrics to judge whether the program is working. \nRecipients of funds have not been required to set benchmarks as to how \nthe funds should be used, let alone track, report to regulators or \ndisclose to the public what they are doing with the funds.\n  Many of the financial institutions that have received TARP funds \ncontinue to give out annual performance bonuses, many of which are \nlarger than most hard-working Americans earn in decades of labor. And, \nas we have seen in the front pages of national papers this week, there \nare real concerns about the long-term viability of some of the banks \nreceiving funds, yet those funds have gone out the door without \nrequiring any written plan from the banks as to how they will continue \noperations or repay the taxpayers.\n  Even as the administration gave financial institutions carte blanche \nwith few, if any, questions asked, they first refused to provide TARP \nfunds to our domestic automakers and then did so only with significant \noversight and restructuring requirements. The double standard here is \ndramatic.\n  Because of all these shortcomings in the use and oversight of the \nfirst $350 billion of TARP funds, I would oppose the release of the \nsecond $350 billion if those funds were to be used as sloppily.\n  Yesterday I sent a letter to National Economic Council Director-\ndesignate Dr. Larry Summers seeking further and more detailed \nassurances. I will ask to have that letter printed in the Record. I \nbelieve the assurances I requested are commonsense positions that are \nessential to a well-run, effective stabilization plan that protects \ntaxpayers money. The assurances I requested are:\n  No. 1, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that \nTARP recipients will be required by the Treasury to track and report \ntheir use of TARP funds and that this information will be made \navailable to the Congress and the public?\n  No. 2, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that \nrecipients of ``exceptional assistance'' will be subject to at least \nthe same compensation limits as have been placed on recipients of funds \nunder the TARP's Automotive Industry Financing Program?\n\n  No. 3, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that \nTreasury will obtain agreements from TARP recipients on benchmarks the \nrecipient is required to meet so as to advance the purposes of TARP?\n  No. 4, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that it \nwill ensure that banks use a significant portion of TARP funds to \nextend credit?\n  No. 5, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that a \nsignificant portion of the remaining TARP funds will be used to carry \nout a comprehensive plan to prevent and mitigate foreclosures on \nresidential mortgages?\n  No. 6, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that \nbanks which receive ``exceptional assistance'' will be required to \nadopt a systematic residential mortgage mitigation program?\n  No. 7, does the incoming Obama administration assure Congress that \nrecipients of assistance under TARP and other Federal programs will be \nrequired to develop and submit a written financial viability plan just \nas was required of recipients of funds under the Automotive Industry \nFinancing Program?\n  Just a couple of hours ago, we received a response from Dr. Summers \naddressed to Senator Reid. The letter goes a long way to providing \npositive answers to most of my questions. To summarize a few of the \npoints:\n  No. 1, TARP recipients will have to track and report their lending \npatterns and report this information to the public.\n  No. 2, healthy banks without major capital shortfalls will have to \nincrease lending above baseline levels.\n  No. 3, they pledge to commit $50 to $100 billion of the TARP funds to \naddress the foreclosure crisis, and banks receiving TARP support will \nbe required to implement mortgage foreclosure mitigation programs.\n  I am disappointed that the letter did not provide assurances that \nbanks and other financial institutions receiving TARP funds will be \nsubject to the same rigorous standards with respect to executive \ncompensation and the submission of viability plans that Congress and \nthe Bush administration demanded of the auto companies. I have \nresponded to Dr. Summers letting him know I look forward to hearing his \nresponse to the balance of my suggestions. I will ask to have that \nletter printed in the Record.\n  On a related matter, in December, the Bush administration committed \nto provide $13.4 billion in funds from the TARP to facilitate the \nrestructuring of our American auto manufacturers and said that an \nadditional $4 billion would be available in February. Of necessity, \nthis additional $4 billion must come from the second $350 billion, and \nwe have been assured that will happen. In return for this much-needed \nbridge financing, the domestic auto manufacturers agreed in December to \nterms and conditions that went way beyond anything required of other \nrecipients of TARP funding. There was broad support for these loans for \nthe domestic auto industry because there was broad recognition that \nthis industry is the foundation of our Nation's manufacturing sector \nand industrial base and a recognition that its failure was simply \nunacceptable. We must complete the job started in December and ensure \nthat the additional funding necessary for the financial health of this \ncritical U.S. industry is provided in a timely manner. Support from the \nFederal Government is essential if the energy efficient green vehicles \nof the future will be produced by American companies and American \nworkers. Other auto-producing countries are acting to assure the \nsurvival of their industries. So must we.\n  Perhaps because of the current administration's poor record of \naccomplishment with the first $350 billion and the lack of \naccountability with which the distribution of those funds has been \ncarried out, our economic position today is not discernibly stronger \nthan it was 3 months ago. We are threatened by further bank failures, \ncreditworthy consumers and businesses are having trouble accessing \ncredit, and it appears that if we do not act our economy may decline \neven further.\n  As was the case 3 months ago, it would be irresponsible to stand by \nand do nothing as our economy heads toward a cliff. It would be \nnegligent to tie the hands of the incoming administration because of \nthe outgoing administration's deficiencies.\n  I am convinced by what we know of continuing bank losses and the \nhurting credit markets that it would be irresponsible to refuse the \nPresident this weapon for economic recovery. Bringing about economic \nstabilization and restoring a healthy economy will not be an easy task. \nWe are contracting from an unprecedented and irresponsible boom in \nlending over the past years, which led financial institutions to make \nloans to borrowers who could not repay them. Unfortunately, in the \naftermath, the pendulum is swinging the other way and many banks are \nfearful of making any loans at all, even to creditworthy borrowers. It \nis my hope that with more TARP funds available, reporting requirements, \nand established goals, banks will resume making responsible loans. Part \nof this will require that Treasury focus not just on the banks that \nmany deem ``too big to fail'' but also on community and independent \nbanks that are the financial backbone of many small towns through their \nsupport of local businesses and families.\n  Coupled with the stimulus package Congress will consider in the next \nmonth and then a much needed financial regulatory overhaul in the \nspring, we can begin to turn away from the deregulatory disaster of \nrecent years and return to a healthy economy with cops on the beat to \nhelp restore confidence in our financial system and prevent another \nfinancial disaster like the one we find ourselves in now.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letters to which \nI referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 2009.\n     Lawrence Summers,\n     Director-designate, National Economic Council, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Dr. Larry: Before Congress votes on whether to release \n     the second $350 billion in TARP funds, I would like to \n     receive the following assurances regarding federal assistance \n     under TARP and other programs to supplement the assurances \n     you provided in the letter to the Congressional leadership \n     dated January 12, 2009.\n       1. The second report of the Congressional Oversight Panel, \n     issued January 9, 2009, states: ``The Panel still does not \n     know what the banks are doing with taxpayer money. Treasury \n     places substantial emphasis in its December 30 letter on the \n     importance of restoring confidence in the marketplace. So \n     long as investors and customers are uncertain about how \n     taxpayer funds are being used, the question both the health \n     and the sound management of all financial institutions. The \n     recent refusal of certain private financial institutions to \n     provide any accounting of how they are using taxpayer money \n     undermines public confidence. For Treasury to advance funds \n     to these institutions without requiring more transparency \n     further erodes the very confidence Treasury seeks to \n     restore.''\n       Your letter states that the Treasury Department will \n     ``monitor, measure and track what is happening to lending by \n     recipients of our financial rescue assistance.''\n       Does the incoming Obama Administration assure Congress that \n     TARP recipients will be required by the Treasury to track and \n     report their use of TARP funds, and that this information \n     will be made available to the Congress and the public?\n       2. The Summers letter states that recipients of \n     ``exceptional assistance'' will be ''subject to tough but \n     sensible conditions that limit executive compensation until \n     taxpayer money is paid back, ban dividend payments beyond de \n     minimis amounts, and put limits on stock buybacks and the \n     acquisition of already financially strong companies.''\n       Does the incoming Obama Administration assure Congress that \n     recipients of ``exceptional assistance'' will be subject to \n     at least the same compensation limits as have been placed on \n     recipients of funds under the TARP's Automotive Industry \n     Financing Program?\n       3. Does the incoming Obama Administration assure Congress \n     that Treasury will obtain agreements from TARP recipients on \n     benchmarks the recipient is required to meet so as to advance \n     the purposes of TARP?\n       4. Does the incoming Obama Administration assure Congress \n     that it will ensure that banks use a significant portion of \n     TARP funds to extend credit?\n       5. Does the incoming Obama Administration assure Congress \n     that a significant portion of the remaining TARP funds will \n     be used to carry out a comprehensive plan to prevent and \n     mitigate foreclosures on residential mortgages?\n       6.

Summers,\n     Director-designate,\n     National Economic Council.\n       Dear Larry: Thank you for your letter to Senator Reid today \n     outlining additional reforms you will adopt in implementing \n     the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. These \n     reforms address many of the suggestions I made in my letter \n     to you of January 14. I look forward to hearing your response \n     to the balance of my suggestions.\n       I appreciated the assurances I received in Tuesday's \n     Democratic Caucus from the President-elect and you that the \n     new Administration will provide the additional $4 billion for \n     loans from TARP Tranche 2 to the U.S. auto industry in \n     February in accordance with the plan announced by the Bush \n     Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will support the resolution \ndisapproving the remaining $350 billion in funding for the financial \nbailout. While President-elect Obama's team has signaled some \nsignificant improvements in the actual administration of these funds, \nthe three fundamental issues that caused me to oppose the bailout \ninitially remain.\n  The bailout continues to be a huge strain on our budget, with no \nprovision for offsetting its cost to the Federal budget--a cost that \nwill be passed on to our children and grandchildren in the form of \nincreased debt. There is no requirement to help families facing \nforeclosures on their homes, one of the root causes of the housing \ncrisis. And finally it fails to reform the deeply flawed regulatory \nstructure that permitted the crisis to arise in the first place. While \nwe have heard promises of future legislation, the hammer we hold over \nthe financial sector is the bailout funding. Once that funding is \napproved, we have lost the leverage needed to enact the tough reforms \nthat will get the financial sector to clean up its act.\n  As I had hoped, a small portion of the financial bailout funds were \nused to provide temporary help for our automakers and help retain 3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs in this country. While I opposed the \nfinancial bailout for the reasons I have just spelled out, given that \nthose funds were approved I felt it only right that a tiny percentage \nof them be used to help millions of working families whose livelihoods \ndepend on a healthy automobile industry. Despite my concerns, I fully \nexpect this second $350 billion for the financial bailout to be \napproved, and if it is, I certainly expect that the promise of \nadditional financial backing for the automobile industry, and the \nmillions of jobs associated with it, will be forthcoming.\n  As I have noted before, while some of the troubles of the automobile \nindustry were of their own making, a great many of the problems facing \ndomestic automakers are the direct result of policies enacted or \nratified in Washington. The collapse of the housing and credit markets, \nthe result of two decades of the reckless disassembly of a sound \nregulatory system, clearly hit the credit-sensitive auto industry hard. \nIn addition, bipartisan majorities in Congress, led by Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents, approved deeply flawed trade policies that have \nfurther disadvantaged the domestic auto industry. Currency manipulation \nby foreign competitors that has not been adequately addressed by our \nnational leadership, too, has put our domestic producers at an enormous \ncompetitive disadvantage. Given Washington's policymaking complicity in \nthe problems facing our domestic automobile industry, should these \nadditional bailout funds for Wall Street move forward, a slice of them \nshould rightly be used to provide some assistance for an industry that \nmeans so much for millions of American families.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will support the resolution before us \ntoday and oppose releasing the remaining Troubled Asset Relief Plan, \nTARP, funds because I have seen no evidence that the additional and \nsubstantial taxpayers' money will be used for its intended purpose. \nTARP was created to allow the Treasury Department to purchase up to \n$700 billion in ``toxic assets'' from financial institutions in order \nto help homeowners facing foreclosure and to stimulate the economy. The \nmisuse of the first $350 billion of TARP funds combined with the lack \nof transparency promised by Secretary Paulson should be reason enough \nto oppose releasing additional funds. No further TARP funds should be \nreleased until we are able to impose strict standards of accountability \nand ensure that the money is spent only as intended by Congress--to \npurchase mortgage-backed securities and other troubled assets.\n  Today, in an open letter to Members of Congress, 26 public interest \norganizations wrote that ``(T)he stated purpose of the TARP was to \npurchase toxic mortgage assets. The TARP was also designed to \nreintroduce the flow of credit into the market and help stabilize Wall \nStreet. To date, neither has been accomplished.'' The letter also \nstates that the Treasury Department ``has invaded the free market, \npropping up some companies to the detriment of others and purchasing \nstock in banks without requiring accountability or transparency about \nthe use of taxpayer funds.'' The signatories included the American \nShareholders Association, Americans for Tax Reform, the Center for \nFiscal Accountability, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the \nCouncil for Citizens Against Government Waste, the Family Research \nCouncil, the National Center for Public Policy Research, and National \nTaxpayers Union. I will ask to have the full text of the letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There is no doubt that Congress intended that the Treasury Department \nuse the funds provided to assist only financial institutions. But that \nhas not\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\nbeen the case. The language authorizing the TARP program has been \ninterpreted to allow Treasury to change the game plan and use the funds \nfor things outside the scope of congressional intent. Less than 2 weeks \nafter enactment of the program, Secretary Paulson changed course and \ndecided instead to use TARP funds to recapitalize banks--a decision \nthat was made with little or no input from Congress and was an option \nthat was explicitly rejected by Paulson and Bernanke when they were \nselling the TARP plan to Congress.\n  In fact, just this morning the Wall Street Journal reported that Bank \nof America is close to finalizing a deal with the Government which will \ngive them billions of dollars in U.S. aid. The lead article on the \nJournal's front page states: ``(T)he commitment of the funds is further \nevidence of the banking system's delicate condition and its hunger for \nmore capital, despite billions of dollars already invested in financial \ninstitutions by the government. So far, the U.S. government has already \ninjected $25 billion into Bank of America.''\n  The Associated Press recently investigated how the TARP funds given \nto U.S. banks were being spent. An article published on December 22, \n2008, reported what they found. It was astonishing. The article, titled \n``Where'd the bailout money go? Shhhh, it's a secret'' reads partly:\n       Washington (AP)--Think you could borrow money from a bank \n     without saying what you were going to do with it? Well, \n     apparently when banks borrow from you they don't feel the \n     same need to say how the money is spent.\n       After receiving billions in aid from U.S. taxpayers, the \n     nation's largest banks say they can't track exactly how \n     they're spending it. Some won't even talk about it.\n       ``We're choosing not to disclose that,'' said Kevin Heine, \n     spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which received about \n     $3 billion.\n       Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, which \n     received $25 billion in emergency bailout money, said that \n     while some of the money was lent, some was not, and the bank \n     has not given any accounting of exactly how the money is \n     being used.\n       ``We have not disclosed that to the public. We're declining \n     to,'' Kelly said.\n       The Associated Press contacted 21 banks that received at \n     least $1 billion in government money and asked four \n     questions: How much has been spent? What was it spent on? How \n     much is being held in savings, and what's the plan for the \n     rest?\n       None of the banks provided specific answers.\n       ``We're not providing dollar-in, dollar-out tracking,'' \n     said Barry Koling, a spokesman for Atlanta, Ga.-based \n     SunTrust Banks Inc., which got $3.5 billion in taxpayer \n     dollars.\n       Some banks said they simply didn't know where the money was \n     going.\n       ``We manage our capital in its aggregate,'' said Regions \n     Financial Corp. spokesman Tim Deighton, who said the \n     Birmingham, Ala.-based company is not tracking how it is \n     spending the $3.5 billion it received as part of the \n     financial bailout.\n       There has been no accounting of how banks spend that money. \n     Lawmakers summoned bank executives to Capitol Hill last month \n     and implored them to lend the money--not to hoard it or spend \n     it on corporate bonuses, junkets or to buy other banks. But \n     there is no process in place to make sure that's happening \n     and there are no consequences for banks that don't comply.\n       Pressured by the Bush administration to approve the money \n     quickly, Congress attached nearly no strings to the $700 \n     billion bailout in October. And the Treasury Department, \n     which doles out the money, never asked banks how it would be \n     spent.\n\n  I will ask to have the full article printed in the Record.\n  With no regard for congressional intent, the Treasury Department has \nused TARP funds to prop up the banking industry and to guarantee \nsecurities backed by student loans and credit card debt. But most \ntroubling to me has been the use of TARP funds to help bail out the \ndomestic auto industry--in direct defiance of Congress. Last month, \nafter extensive discussion and debate, the Senate rejected a plan to \npump billions of Federal dollars into the domestic auto industry \nbecause we saw no evidence of serious concessions from the industry and \nno assurance of the domestic auto manufacturers' long-term viability.\n  At the time I said that, before they ask for assistance, the \nautomakers will need to change dramatically the way they do business if \nthey hope to be on course for long-term profitability. Rather than \nseeking an unconditional handout from the taxpayer, industry leaders \nmust first consider how they can restructure their business models in \norder to fix the problem themselves and build more competitive \nproducts--including changes in management, renegotiating labor \nagreements, and reorganizing under the bankruptcy process. And, that \nthey should have been doing so months, if not years, ago.\n  When I opposed the auto bailout plan last month it was mainly because \nI felt that the automakers needed to prove to Congress and the American \npeople that they were serious about making the changes necessary to \nensure their long-term success before they sought assistance from the \ntaxpayer. Unfortunately, those concerns were ignored by the President \nwhen he decided to give away over $17 billion in TARP funds to the \ndomestic automakers with no assurances that they would fundamentally \nchange the way they do business to ensure their viability. I continue \nto believe that this was a critical mistake.\n  In their first oversight report on TARP spending, the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, was very critical of Treasury stating that \nthey had ``failed to address a number of critical issues while \nimplementing the $700 billion financial bailout plan, including how to \nensure its efforts are successful.'' The report adds that Treasury \n``has no policies or procedures in place for ensuring the institutions \n. . . are using capital investments in a manner that helps meet the \npurposes of the act.'' Additionally, the GAO reported that ``Treasury \ncannot effectively hold participating institutions accountable for how \nthey use the capital injections or provide strong oversight of \ncompliance with the requirements under the act.''\n  In addition to the GAO, many of my colleagues have been very critical \nof Secretary Paulson and his handling of the first half of the TARP \nfunds, stating that he has ignored the intent of the bailout \nlegislation because he has done little to address the root cause of the \nfinancial meltdown--namely the mortgage market. I understand the anger \nof my colleagues, indeed, I share it.\n  It is abundantly clear that there has been a stunning lack of \ntransparency, accountability, and effective management of TARP funds to \ndate. Because of this, I will not support the release of another dime \nof these funds without first seeing a full and complete accounting of \nfunds already spent or committed as well as the imposition of very \nstrict conditions on the remaining funds as a way to ensure any \nexpenditures reflect the intent of Congress.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letters to which \nI referred printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                Requesting a TARP Disapproval Resolution\n\n                                                 January 15, 2009.\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the millions of \n     taxpaying citizens represented by the public interest \n     organizations below, we write to strongly encourage you to \n     swiftly pass a notice of disapproval on releasing the \n     remaining $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program \n     (TARP) funds.\n       From the beginning, the TARP plan was questionable, but a \n     number of Members nonetheless resolved to support it. It \n     should be clear now that this was a mistake.\n       The stated purpose of the TARP was to purchase toxic \n     mortgage assets. Secretary Paulson abandoned this concept \n     immediately after the signing ceremony. The TARP was also \n     designed to reintroduce the flow of credit into the market \n     and help stabilize Wall Street. To date, neither has been \n     accomplished.\n       In addition to misleading Congress about his intent on the \n     use of TARP funds, Secretary Paulson has invaded the free \n     market, propping up some companies to the detriment of others \n     and purchasing stock in banks without requiring \n     accountability or transparency about the use of taxpayer \n     funds.\n       The TARP legislation specifically requires that before the \n     second half of the $700 billion is released, the President \n     provide Congress with a written report detailing how the \n     additional funds are to be used. A request to spend the \n     second half of the funds without restraint does not meet the \n     requirements set forth in the bill. In addition to requiring \n     this detailed plan, Congress should require an accounting and \n     detailed explanation on how the initial TARP funds have been \n     used and the prospect of a taxpayer recovery of these funds.\n       Congress now has an opportunity to preserve some of the \n     taxpayers' assets and should spend the necessary time \n     studying the underlying causes of the economic down-\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n     turn by passing a TARP disapproval resolution.

Shhhh, It's a Secret\n\n                    (By Matt Apuzzo, Dec. 22, 2008)\n\n       Washington (AP).--Think you could borrow money from a bank \n     without saying what you were going to do with it? Well, \n     apparently when banks borrow from you they don't feel the \n     same need to say how the money is spent.\n       After receiving billions in aid from U.S. taxpayers, the \n     nation's largest banks say they can't track exactly how \n     they're spending it. Some won't even talk about it.\n       ``We're choosing not to disclose that,'' said Kevin Heine, \n     spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon, which received about \n     $3 billion.\n       Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, which \n     received $25 billion in emergency bailout money, said that \n     while some of the money was lent, some was not, and the bank \n     has not given any accounting of exactly how the money is \n     being used.\n       ``We have not disclosed that to the public. We're declining \n     to,'' Kelly said.\n       The Associated Press contacted 21 banks that received at \n     least $1 billion in government money and asked four \n     questions: How much has been spent? What was it spent on? How \n     much is being held in savings, and what's the plan for the \n     rest?\n       None of the banks provided specific answers.\n       ``We're not providing dollar-in, dollar-out tracking,'' \n     said Barry Koling, a spokesman for Atlanta, Ga.-based \n     SunTrust Banks Inc., which got $3.5 billion in taxpayer \n     dollars.\n       Some banks said they simply didn't know where the money was \n     going.\n       ``We manage our capital in its aggregate,'' said Regions \n     Financial Corp. spokesman Tim Deighton, who said the \n     Birmingham, Ala.-based company is not tracking how it is \n     spending the $3.5 billion it received as part of the \n     financial bailout.\n       The answers highlight the secrecy surrounding the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program, which earmarked $700 billion--about the \n     size of the Netherlands' economy--to help rescue the \n     financial industry. The Treasury Department has been using \n     the money to buy stock in U.S. banks, hoping that the sudden \n     inflow of cash will get banks to start lending money.\n       There has been no accounting of how banks spend that money. \n     Lawmakers summoned bank executives to Capitol Hill last month \n     and implored them to lend the money--not to hoard it or spend \n     it on corporate bonuses, junkets or to buy other banks. But \n     there is no process in place to make sure that's happening \n     and there are no consequences for banks that don't comply.\n       ``It is entirely appropriate for the American people to \n     know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent in private \n     industry,'' said Elizabeth Warren, the top congressional \n     watchdog overseeing the financial bailout.\n       But, at least for now, there's no way for taxpayers to find \n     that out.\n       Pressured by the Bush administration to approve the money \n     quickly, Congress attached nearly no strings to the $700 \n     billion bailout in October. And the Treasury Department, \n     which doles out the money, never asked banks how it would be \n     spent.\n       ``Those are legitimate questions that should have been \n     asked on Day One,'' said Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., a House \n     Financial Services Committee member who opposed the bailout \n     as it was rushed through Congress. ``Where is the money going \n     to go to? How is it going to be spent? When are we going to \n     get a record on it?''\n       Nearly every bank AP questioned--including Citibank and \n     Bank of America, two of the largest recipients of bailout \n     money--responded with generic public relations statements \n     explaining that the money was being used to strengthen \n     balance sheets and continue making loans to ease the credit \n     crisis.\n       A few banks described company-specific programs, such as \n     JPMorgan Chase's plan to lend $5 billion to nonprofit and \n     health care companies next year. Richard Becker, senior vice \n     president of Wisconsin-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp., said \n     the $1.75 billion in bailout money allowed the bank to \n     temporarily stop foreclosing on homes.\n       But no bank provided even the most basic accounting for the \n     federal money.\n       Some said the money couldn't be tracked. Bob Denham, a \n     spokesman for North Carolina-based BB Corp., said the \n     bailout money ``doesn't have its own bucket.'' But he said \n     taxpayer money wasn't used in the bank's recent purchase of a \n     Florida insurance company. Asked how he could be sure, since \n     the money wasn't being tracked, Denham said the bank would \n     have made that deal regardless.\n       Others, such as Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Carissa Ramirez, \n     offered to discuss the matter with reporters on condition of \n     anonymity. When AP refused, Ramirez sent an e-mail saying: \n     ``We are going to decline to comment on your story.''\n       Most banks wouldn't say why they were keeping the details \n     secret.\n       ``We're not sharing any other details. We're just not at \n     this time,'' said Wendy Walker, a spokeswoman for Dallas-\n     based Comerica Inc., which received $2.25 billion from the \n     government.\n       One didn't even want to say they wouldn't say.\n       Heine, the New York Mellon Corp. spokesman who said he \n     wouldn't share spending specifics, added: ``I just would \n     prefer if you wouldn't say that we're not going to discuss \n     those details.''\n       The banks which came closest to answering the questions \n     were those, such as U.S. Bancorp and Huntington Bancshares \n     Inc., that only recently received the money and have yet to \n     spend it. But neither provided anything more than a generic \n     summary of how the money would be spent.\n       Lawmakers say they want to tighten restrictions on the \n     remaining, yet-to-be-released $350 billion block of bailout \n     money before more cash is handed out. Treasury Secretary \n     Henry Paulson said the Department is trying to step up its \n     monitoring of bank spending.\n       ``What we've been doing here is moving, I think, with \n     lightning speed to put necessary programs in place, to \n     develop them, implement them, and then we need to monitor \n     them while we're doing this,'' Paulson said at a recent forum \n     in New York. ``So we're building this organization as we're \n     going.''\n       Warren, the congressional watchdog appointed by Democrats, \n     said her oversight panel will try to force the banks to say \n     where they've spent the money.\n       ``It would take a lot of nerve not to give answers,'' she \n     said.\n       But Warren said she's surprised she even has to ask.\n       ``If the appropriate restrictions were put on the money to \n     begin with, if the appropriate transparency was in place, \n     then we wouldn't be in a position where you're trying to call \n     every recipient and get the basic information that should \n     already be in public documents,'' she said.\n       Garrett, the New Jersey congressman, said the nation might \n     never get a clear answer on where hundreds of billions of \n     dollars went.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, the Senate is voting to release the final \n$350 billion of funds to the Department of Treasury for the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, TARP, a move I reluctantly supported.\n  Since Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008, the public and elected officials have become increasingly \nfrustrated with how the Treasury Department implemented the TARP. The \nTreasury has implemented little to no oversight, required no \ntransparency from banks receiving funds and has done very little to \nstem the rising foreclosure problem. A total of 87 financial \ninstitutions have received funds from the Treasury Department, \nincluding four from Wisconsin. When I asked the Wisconsin banks to show \nme how they used the Treasury funds they were happy to share how they \nwere combating the financial crisis. For example, Associated Banc-Corp \nincreased their mortgage loan activity by 20 percent. Marshall and \nIlsey implemented a 90-day foreclosure moratorium in order to provide \nassistance to at-risk homeowners. These banks are an example of how the \nTARP program is injecting credit back into the market. Unfortunately, \nnot every bank is following their example.\n  The current administration has failed to create regulations to \nmonitor the funds and ensure that the taxpayer dollars are being used \nappropriately to unfreeze the credit markets and assist at-risk \nhomeowners. I was very concerned about extending the incoming \nadministration the additional funds\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nwithout any assurances or clear plans on how to increase transparency, \noversight and lending. Thankfully, the President-elect and his advisors \nhave sent Senator Reid a letter clearly laying out new measures \ncreating transparency, refocusing the funds on foreclosures, and \nprotecting taxpayer investments. As we move forward, I am confident \nthat Congress and the new administration will work together to continue \nto promote economic stability, preserve homeownership, and protect \ntaxpayer interests.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nthe resolution of disapproval on the release of the final $350 billion \nof the economic rescue package.\n  At the outset, I am dissatisfied with the way the first $350 billion \nhas been spent because of failure to deal with the home mortgage issue, \nthe ineffectiveness in restoring normal lending to consumers and \nbusinesses, and the lack of transparency. The Treasury Department \nstarted off by stating that it would purchase toxic securities backed \nby troubled home mortgages but has since shifted to providing funds for \nthe banks, some of which didn't want them. That didn't loosen up the \ncredit market. One of the key problems has been foreclosures, which the \nfirst $350 billion hasn't begun to deal with. Good ideas like FDIC \nChairwoman Bair's have been rejected.\n  As a matter of public policy, I am opposed to bailouts. In our free \nenterprise system, the market, not the Government, should determine \nwinners and losers. However, there is a necessary exception when the \npotential consequences of failing to provide Federal economic aid could \nproduce a devastating effect on the economy. That was the basis for the \nvery tough vote which I cast in supporting the $700 billion economic \nstabilization package because I felt that the failure of Congress to \ntake some decisive, substantial action would run the risk of dire \nconsequences to the U.S. economy.\n  I objected to the process used to consider the $700 billion package. \nInsufficient consideration by the Treasury Department and the Federal \nReserve followed by a rush to judgement by Congress resulted in \nlegislation that had not been given appropriate consideration. I wrote \na series of letters and advocated for the Senate to follow regular \norder, which starts with the introduction of legislation, committee \nhearings and markup, debate and amendment by individual Members, and \nthe House-Senate conference. The President then reviews the final bill.\n  Ultimately, Congress did not follow regular order. Instead, Senators \nwere only given a chance to vote yes or no on what started as a 4-page \nmemorandum from the Treasury Department and quickly grew to 414 pages. \nAs a result, the bill included undesirable pork provisions. Had there \nbeen an opportunity to offer amendments, these undesirable provisions \ncould have been removed. In a series of town meetings in October, I \nfound the temperature of my constituents at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  We are now confronted with a decision of whether to release the final \n$350 billion installment of the program. The authorizing legislation \npassed by Congress in October did not release the entire $700 billion \nimmediately, but instead there have been installments of $250 billion, \n$100 billion at the request of the President and $350 billion more \nsubject to congressional objection. At the time, I raised concerns that \na resolution of disapproval by Congress on the final $350 billion may \nbe unconstitutional under the Supreme Court decision in INS v. Chadha. \nThe resolution of disapproval requires a majority vote in both Houses \nfor adoption and is subject to a veto by the President.\n  In coming to a determination of how to vote on the resolution of \ndisapproval, I felt it important to evaluate the effectiveness of the \nprogram to date, whether the outgoing administration has carried out \nits responsibilities as intended by Congress, the intentions of the \nincoming administration to utilize the program, and the necessity for \nfurther market stabilization based on current economic conditions.\n  The $700 billion economic rescue was requested by the administration \nin September as major financial institutions were threatened with \nfailure as a result of toxic assets on their balance sheets. Treasury \nSecretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned of an \nimminent meltdown in financial markets which would threaten retirement \nfunds, jeopardize the jobs of millions of Americans, and subject \nhomeowners to more evictions. Major institutions such as Bear Stearns, \nLehman Brothers, and AIG had already reached a tipping point, and the \nFederal Government began making decisions on a case-by-case basis of \nwhether to extend assistance. The stock market followed each move \nclosely. It was argued that unless financial institutions were able to \nsell off securities backed by souring assets such as subprime mortgages \nthere would be additional failures that would jeopardize the worldwide \nmarkets in an irreversible manner.\n  After enactment in early October, the Treasury Department quickly \nbegan implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP as \nit came to be known. In what was widely seen as a reversal of position, \non October 14, 2008, the Treasury Department announced that $250 \nbillion would be devoted to purchasing senior preferred shares in \nfinancial institutions as part of the Capital Purchase Program, CPP, to \n``encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase \nthe flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support \nthe U.S. economy.'' According to a January 14, 2009, article in the New \nYork Times, 257 financial institutions in 42 states had received $192 \nbillion in capital injections from the CPP, with 7 of those firms \nreceiving 62 percent of the funds. Additional funds have been devoted \nto AIG, $40 billion; Citigroup, $25 billion; the auto industry $19 \nbillion, and to backstop a Federal Reserve program to boost consumer \nlending, $20 billion.\n  While these initial investments may be viewed as a success in fending \noff an outright collapse of our financial markets, there has been \nlittle evidence thus far that there has been a loosening of the credit \nmarkets resulting in increased lending by banks to consumers and \nbusinesses. Instead, there has been widespread dissatisfaction among my \nconstituents that the funds given to banks have been used for global \nbuyouts, as exemplified by Bank of America seeking a larger stake in \nChina Constuction Bank, PNC Financial Services Group taking over \nNational City Corp., and USB acquiring several California lending \nfirms. All three firms received TARP funds. There have even been press \nreports of participating firms using TARP funds for corporate \nsponsorships, as exemplified by CitiBank completing a 20-year contract \nto pay the New York Mets $400 million to name the team's new stadium \n``Citi Field'' and by AIG paying the British soccer team Manchester \nUnited $125 million for the privilege of having its logo appear on its \nuniforms.\n  There has also been inadequate transparency and accountability thus \nfar, which was demanded by the taxpayer when Congress enacted the \nauthorizing legislation. My constituents have been frustrated to learn \nso little about how their money is being used by these financial \ninstitutions and about the amount of lending that is taking place. I \nsupported the $700 billion economic rescue package because I felt that \nthe failure of Congress to take some decisive, substantial action would \nrun the risk of dire consequences to the U.S. economy. However, I was \nalso led to believe that there would be significant oversight and \ntransparency to accompany the broad powers that have been granted.\n  This lack of transparency presents a serious challenge to the \noversight panels created as part of the authorizing legislation. \nAccording to a December 2, 2008, Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nreport, the Treasury Department has not yet imposed reporting \nrequirements on the participating financial institutions. Doing so \nwould enable Treasury to monitor how the infusions were being used and \nwhether they are meeting the goals of increasing the flow of financing \nto U.S. businesses and consumers and encouraging the modification of \nexisting residential mortgages for those in need. The GAO report also \nraised questions about Treasury efforts in achieving its intended goals \nand monitoring compliance with limitations on executive compensation \nand dividend payments.\n  The five-member Congressional Oversight Panel, COP, created to \noversee the implementation of the economic\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\nrescue program has been very critical thus far, suggesting that more \naccountability should be in place before the final $350 billion is \nreleased. The panel is chaired by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, \nand its other members are Representative Jeb Hensarling, NY State \nsuperintendent of banks Richard Neiman, AFL-CIO associate counsel Damon \nSilvers, and former Senator John Sununu. On December 10, the panel \nreleased its first report which contained 10 questions for the Treasury \nDepartment. Its second report, released on January 9, 2009, analyzed \nTreasury's answers and stated that its ``initial concerns about the \nTARP have only grown, exacerbated by the shifting explanations of its \npurpose and the tools used by the Treasury.'' It reported that Treasury \nstill has not adequately explained how it is selecting banks for its \ncapital injection program or its strategy for stabilizing the financial \nmarkets. It acknowledged that the TARP has forestalled a financial \ncollapse, but with ``no demonstrable effects on lending.'' Also, it \nsaid that Treasury has no ability to ensure banks lend the money they \nhave received and no standards for measuring the success of the \nprogram. It also noted that Treasury ignored or offered incomplete \nanswers to some questions.\n  The authorizing legislation also created a Special Inspector General \nwith authority to track and investigate how the Government spends the \nTARP funds. The President selected, and the Senate confirmed, Neil M. \nBarofsky, a former New York assistant U.S. attorney, for this position. \nAccording to a January 7, 2009, letter to Finance Committee Chairman \nBaucus, Mr. Barofsky has had some success in pushing Treasury to \ninclude more restrictions on any funds given out in future \ntransactions. As a result, the letter said, Treasury had included new \nstandards that will force companies to establish new internal controls \nand account for the Government funds they receive. Mr. Barofsky's first \nformal report is due to the Finance Committee on February 6, 2009.\n  There is further frustration from an investigation conducted by the \nAssociated Press, AP, showing that there has been insufficient \ntransparency into the operations of the banks that have received TARP \nfunds. The AP contacted 21 banks that received at least $1 billion in \nGovernment money and asked four basic questions: How much has been \nspent? What was it spent on? How much is being held in savings? And, \nwhat is the plan for the rest? According to the AP, none of the banks \nprovided specific answers. If the oversight panels are unable to get \nanswers to these very basic questions posed by the AP, they will be \nunable to adequately determine the effectiveness of the TARP program.\n  I believe that the onus is on the Treasury Department and the Federal \nReserve to impose reporting requirements on the participating financial \ninstitutions. It is imperative that the American public have a full \nunderstanding of how their hard earned tax dollars are being used. In \nthe absence of action by the Treasury Department to impose satisfactory \nreporting requirements by participating financial institutions, \nCongress has been forced to consider taking additional legislative \naction. I cosponsored legislation--S. 133, the Troubled Asset Recovery \nProgram Transparency Reporting Act--introduced on January 6, 2009, by \nSenators Dianne Feinstein and Olympia Snowe that would require \nparticipating financial institutions to provide detailed, publically \navailable quarterly reports to the Treasury outlining how the funds \nhave been used. This legislation further requires that TARP funds not \nbe used for lobbying expenditures or political contributions. \nAdditionally, this legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury \nto develop and publish corporate governance principles and ethical \nguidelines for recipients of such funds, including but not limited to \nrestrictions governing the hosting, sponsorship, or payments for \nconferences and event, and expenses relating to entertainment or \nsimilar ancillary corporate expenses. Violators of this legislation \nwould be subject to civil penalties including fines and may become \nineligible for future emergency economic assistance.\n  I have additional concerns that there has been little emphasis on \nforeclosure mitigation assistance in the TARP program. On November 14, \n2008, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair proposed a plan to forestall \nforeclosures by offering banks an incentive to modify mortgages by \nhaving the Government agree to share in the loss of a loan that fell \ninto default. Specifically, mortgage payments for homeowners that are \nat least 2 months delinquent would be reduced to between 31 and 38 \npercent of monthly income by modifying the interest rate, extending the \nrepayment period, and deferring principle. To encourage servicers to \nparticipate, the Government would share up to 50 percent of the losses \nif a homeowner who had received a modification later defaulted, and the \nFDIC would pay servicers who process mortgages $1,000 for each modified \nloan. The plan was expected to initially help 2.2 million borrowers get \nnew loans, and after some borrowers redefaulted, 1.5 million would \nultimately keep their homes. The plan was estimated to cost \napproximately $24 billion.\n  The FDIC plan was rejected as the Treasury Department looked at other \nstrategies, including ways to reduce interest rates on distressed \nloans. However, in the end, neither approach has been implemented. They \nhave instead relied on industry-led efforts by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, \nand others to voluntarily modify troubled loans.\n  In the December 2008 GAO report, it was noted that Treasury had \ninitially intended to purchase mortgage backed securities and use its \nownership position to influence loan servicers and to achieve more \naggressive mortgage modification standards. The Treasury changed its \nstrategy within weeks and, instead, decided to make capital injections \ninto financial institutions. It also noted that despite language in the \nlending agreements with these financial institutions to work under \nexisting programs to modify the terms of residential mortgages, ``it \nremains unclear how [the Treasury's Office of Financial Stability] and \nthe banking regulators will monitor how these institutions are using \nthe capital injections to advance the purposes of this act . . .'' The \nCongressional Oversight Panel chair Elizabeth Warren echoed this \nsentiment, ``The bailout money doesn't require a specific approach . . \n. It entrusts Treasury with developing an approach, and that's what \nTreasury should be doing.''\n  The incoming administration has sought to assure Congress that it \nwould make a number of changes to the TARP program, including a \n``sweeping effort'' to address foreclosures and reduce mortgage \npayments for ``responsible homeowners.'' It has promised efforts to \nboost consumer and business lending. It has also said it will improve \ntransparency and accountability for participating firms. However, there \nhave been few details on exactly how they plan to move forward.\n  It has been argued that further deterioration in the economy will \nrequire additional intervention. Lawrence Summers, who has been chosen \nto head the National Economic Council by President-elect Obama, has \ncalled the need for the second round of funds ``imminent and urgent.'' \nIn addition, it has been argued that a failure to release the second \nhalf of the TARP funding could once again frighten the markets and lead \nto a sharp drop in the Dow. The 777-point plunge in the Dow plunge on \nSeptember 29, 2008, in the wake of the House's rejection of the \nlegislation, demonstrated the potential for even greater problems if \nCongress did not act.\n  Amidst the various criticisms that have been raised against the TARP \nprogram and its implementation by the outgoing administration, many \neconomists remain concerned about the state of the financial system. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has expressed concern about the world \neconomy and the financial markets and suggested that foreclosure \nprevention and purchases of troubled assets might be useful tools to \nhelp the economy in the near term. Bernanke also commented that fiscal \nstimulus would not be enough to support the economy. With respect to \nthe TARP program, Chairman Bernanke said on January 13, 2009, ``. . . \nTreasury's injection of about $250 billion of capital into banking \norganizations, a substantial expansion of guarantees for bank \nliabilities by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Fed's \nvarious liquidity programs . . . likely prevented a\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nglobal financial meltdown in the fall . . . with the worsening of the \neconomy's growth prospects . . . more capital injections and guarantees \nmay become necessary to ensure stability and the normalization of \ncredit markets.'' He also said, ``Responsible policymakers must \ntherefore do what they can to communicate to their constituencies why \nfinancial stabilization is essential for economic recovery.''\n  Also on January 13, 2009, the Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said, \n``The remaining TARP funds will play an essential role in further \nstrengthening the financial system and restoring normal credit flows . \n. . An important use of these [TARP] funds will be to step up efforts \nto avoid preventable foreclosures . . . more needs to be done . . . A \ncontinuing barrier to private investment in financial institutions is \nthe large quantity of troubled, hard-to-value assets that remain on \ninstitutions' balance sheets. The presence of these assets \nsignificantly increases uncertainty about the underlying value of these \ninstitutions and may inhibit private investment and new lending.''\n  According to a January 14, 2009, article in the New York Times--\nmentioned earlier--\"Some banking experts are even questioning if the \nbailout may be doing more harm than good.'' It cited a struggling small \nbank in Michigan that had made a series of bad loans but had been given \na ``cushion'' instead of allowing it to ``sink or swim'' on its own. \nThe articled suggested that by doing so, ``It could also delay mergers \nof weaker banks with healthier ones.''\n  With a projected deficit of $1.2 trillion for 2009 and a possible \n$800 billion expenditure on a stimulus package in the next few weeks, \nCongress must be vigilant in its use of the taxpayer's dollars. At the \ncurrent time, there appears to be no immediate threat to our financial \nsystem, which raises the question of whether the additional \nauthorization is needed at this time, especially in light of the \nfailures with the program so far.\n  Based on a comprehensive evaluation of these issues, I am reluctant \nto support an additional authorization of $350 billion at this time. To \ndate, I have seen little evidence that the TARP program has been \neffective in increasing lending by the institutions who have received \nbillions in taxpayer dollars. I also have serious questions about the \neffectiveness of existing programs to help troubled homeowners and \nwhether additional steps should be taken. Further, unless steps are \ntaken to significantly improve oversight and transparency of the TARP \nprogram, my constituents and I will not feel confident that we are not \nsimply throwing good money after bad by releasing the final $350 \nbillion. On the current state of the record, I cannot continue to \nsupport this program and intend to vote for the resolution of \ndisapproval. In the future, I stand ready to act if it appears that a \nfailure to take decisive, substantial action would run the risk of dire \nconsequences to the U.S. economy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, many Senators, including this one, \nreluctantly supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program last year \nbecause we were told by the so-called experts that our financial \nmarkets were on the verge of collapse.\n  We were told that we had to deal with the toxic mortgages that were \nclogging up our financial markets by having the government purchase \nthem at an auction and hold them until the markets stabilized. The \ntheory was to get these troubled assets off the banks' balance sheets \nand provide them with additional funds to lend to credit worthy \nborrowers.\n  I had serious doubts about the original plan, but it has never been \nimplemented. Instead, the money has been used to invest directly in \nselect financial institutions. Essentially, it has become a slush fund \nfor the Secretary of Treasury to engage in an erratic industrial policy \nof picking winners and losers among any company directly, or \nindirectly, connected to our financial markets.\n  I am deeply troubled by this outcome. I believe Congress was mislead \nwith respect to the financial crisis as well and the intended use of \nthe funds. Moreover, the administration's decision to use funds to \nprovide assistance to the U.S. auto industry was contrary to \ncongressional intent.\n  The ever-changing nature of the TARP program has introduced a new \nlevel of uncertainty into our financial markets. Market participants no \nlonger know when or where the Federal Government will intervene. This \nunpredictability has a chilling effect on investors and undermines the \nability to raise capital and make new loans.\n  The outgoing administration has misused these funds and failed to \nprovide adequate accountability. But, the vote today is about the use \nof the remaining funds by the incoming administration. Unfortunately, \nthey have expressed a desire to pursue an even more vigorous policy of \npicking winners and losers, with an extra dose of micro-management \nthrown in for good measure.\n  The efficient allocation of credit is vital to the successful \noperation of our economy. Without saving and investment, there can be \nno long-term economic growth. Banks and other financial institutions \nserve a critical role in bringing savers and investors together and \nallocating credit to its most productive use.\n  To operate successfully, credit markets need transparency and \naccountability. Transparency is achieved through the reporting and \ndisclosure of assets and liabilities. Accountability is achieved \nthrough the proper alignment of risk and reward. Those who accept risk \nshould profit from their success and pay for their losses.\n  Unfortunately, we have allowed ourselves to undermine the very \nfoundation of our credit markets through a series of well-meaning, but \nultimately misguided actions. The continuation of the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program will not address these fundamental problems. We need a \nnew approach. I'm hopeful Congress will be able to work with the new \nAdministration in the coming months to improve our financial markets \nand revitalize our economy.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, before I voted for the bailout I said, \nregrettably, a bailout is needed. I voted to get credit flowing again \nto the distressed homeowner, to families and to small businesses. I \ndidn't vote to give the money to banks to enable them to continue their \nflawed policies, their hubris and their high handedness. And I didn't \ndo it so they could be ungrateful, buy other banks, or give out \ndividends, and to take executives on spa treatments. I was mad as hell \nthat the Wall Street Master of the Universe took us into a black hole. \nAnd I am mad as hell now that they didn't thank the taxpayer.\n  The Bush administration misled us about what they would do with the \nmoney. Now we're finding both they and the banks misused the funds, \nabused the taxpayer and squandered both the money and the opportunity. \nI said if we were going to have a bailout we needed three things, \nrescue, reform, and retribution. I said, no blank checks and no checks \nwithout balances, help homeowners, and guarantee no golden parachutes \nfor the people who got us into this mess. Did the Bush administration \nlisten? No. Paulson dodged and ducked, and the taxpayers got duped. \nDistressed homeowners were left in the lurch. Bernie Madoff is in his \nluxurious penthouse and homeowners are being foreclosed and evicted. \nWhat's wrong with this picture?\n  We have already given $350 billion to the big banks, who said they \nwere going to lend it, and said they were going to have transparency. \nBut instead, we have gotten hoarding, and resistance. Banks don't want \nto tell us what they are doing with our money. When I voted for the \nrescue plan, I thought I was voting for dealing with the credit crisis, \nand bringing the financial system to some form of stability. But what \nhas happened is, instead of helping with jobs, we have been helping \nwith banks.\n  The banks said we want taxpayer money and we want it our way or the \nhighway. But thankfully, on Tuesday it's going to be a new day and a \nnew way. Obama met with us this week on his economic agenda. We had a \nrobust give and take. The number one priority we agreed upon is job \ncreation. We need to make sure that for people who have jobs, they get \nto keep them and feel more economic security. And for people who are \nout of work, not only to provide a safety net on unemployment benefits, \nbut create opportunities for returning to work or even new jobs. We \nneed to give President Obama the tools he needs to get our economy \ngoing again. We shouldn't hold the misdeeds\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\nof the Bush administration against him.\n  We need to work together. People don't want to talk about butting \nheads, they want to talk about kicking butt with the banks. And the \nPresident-elect and I agree on that. I see myself helping President-\nelect Obama kicking butt, to work with people who are in danger of \nlosing their homes, not with a bailout but with a workout. The banks \nhave to get off the bailout shtick, and start to get on the workout \nshtick with homeowners.\n  This week, the President-elect huddled with us, to talk about how his \nplan is different than the previous administration. We need vigilance \nand responsibility that's what President Obama has pledged. Three major \nareas that we will work with the Obama administration are number one, \noversight and regulation. We will put real financial cops on the beat \nto make sure money goes where it is supposed to. Number two, a \nsweeping, comprehensive effort to address the foreclosure crisis, we \nwill use TARP money to get to the root of the crisis, keep people in \ntheir homes, and save neighborhoods. Number three, get tough and insist \non transparency. Banks cannot just take the money and run. The new plan \nwill make them tell us what they are doing, no dividends, no giving \nmoney to banks to buy other banks, no golden parachutes, and no spa \ntreatments.\n  I will vote for the additional TARP money. Not because I support the \nbanks and Wall Street, but because I support our new President, and \nbecause I support giving him the tools to get our economy rolling \nagain. But we need a major attitude adjustment. It is not only what we \nhear from the banks, it is what we do not hear from them. There is no \nsense of gratitude. There is no sense of gratitude that the waitress, \nthe single mother, the farmer, the firefighter, is willing to help. \nThere is no gratitude, no remorse, no promise to sin no more, no \n``let's make amends.'' Instead, they pay themselves lavish salaries, \nbonuses and perks, like lavish spa retreats.\n  At $350 billion, I don't want to be a passive investor. Congress and \nthe new President must tell Wall Street, ``You need to go to work and \ndig out of this mess. Help rescue the economy, not the Wall Street \nmanagers.'' Work for America, it is America that is paying your \nsalaries. Give us your best thinking. Give us your energy. It is time \nto restore our economy and restore our national honor. So pull up your \npants and your pantsuits, and go to work and let's rebuild this \neconomy!\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I will oppose the joint resolution of \ndisapproval and vote to release these funds, but I do so adding my \nvoice to those putting the incoming administration on notice.\n  This is an enormous sum of money and authority being given to the \nTreasury Department, and it is especially worrisome because the \nAmerican public has little confidence in this program. Its transactions \nare opaque. Its potential for abuse is enormous. Its effect on the \neconomy remains uncertain.\n  According to the public letter sent this week to the House and Senate \nleadership, the incoming Obama administration's economic team has \ncommitted to a ``full and accurate accounting'' of how these monies are \ninvested and ensuring that these resources are not ``enriching \nshareholders or executives.'' The House of Representatives today is \nconsidering legislation to hold the new administration to its \ncommitments, and I hope the Senate will do the same.\n  Other promises and commitments are being made, at private briefings \nand closed-door caucuses, as the new administration tries to cajole \nSenators to oppose this disapproval resolution. That is unfortunate \nbecause I believe it further undermines an already questionable \nprogram, which could use more transparency, and not less. I realize \nthat the new administration inherited this financial mess and that it \nis trying to do the best with the hand that it has been dealt. But I \nhope that it will learn from the mistakes of the outgoing \nadministration and, instead, have faith in the wisdom of an informed \npublic.\n  Having authorized this program only 15 weeks ago, I think the \nCongress should give it time to work. By any objective measure, the \neconomy is getting worse. West Virginia's unemployment rate is rising, \nand it has lost hundreds of manufacturing jobs in recent months. In the \nlast 2 months, Toyota announced that it would lay off 120 workers at \nits plant in Buffalo. An Ohio-based packaging manufacturer announced it \nwould close its plant in Culloden, laying off 41 workers. The Bayer \nMaterialScience plant in New Martinsville, which makes polymers that \nare used in the automobile and housing industries, announced it would \nlay off 70 workers. Columbian Chemical Company announced that it would \nclose its plant near Moundsville, laying off 55 workers.\n  If the new administration says it needs these tools, then I am \nwilling to give it some latitude. But I caution this administration, \nthe American people must have transparency. They must see effective \noversight. They must have confidence that this is not another Ponzi \nscheme, concocted by Madoff-type, money-hungry, Wall Street fat cats, \nwho don't care about anything except lining their own pockets.\n  If the new administration gets this money, it must do better than its \npredecessor. We have just lived through one failed administration. We \ncannot afford to live through another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there are moments in the Senate that are \nmemorable, but the most memorable moment for me in the last several \nmonths occurred in the conference room of Speaker Nancy Pelosi when we \nwere called in, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate leaders, \nand sat around a large conference table facing the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Hank Paulson, and the head of the Federal Reserve, Ben \nBernanke. They opened the meeting by saying that America is facing an \neconomic crisis that no one in this room has ever seen, which will spin \nout of control, reaching across the world, creating economic \nconsequences you cannot even envision, unless we act and act now. You \ncould have heard a pin drop in that room. They said we need hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to put into the banking system for credit, and we \nhave to do it as quickly as possible or you are going to see major \ncorporations in America fail, thousands of jobs lost, and an economic \nrecession bordering on a recession. The choice was clear at the end of \nthe day. In light of that circumstance and the clear failure of these \nmajor institutions, we had two choices: do something or do nothing.\n  I chose to do something. I voted for this TARP plan--a strong \nbipartisan vote, Democrats and Republicans--and said we have to do \nsomething, we can't let this happen to our economy and businesses and \nlet families and individuals suffer for a long time to come.\n  We put in conditions and said: We will split it. Of the $700 billion, \nyou can spend the first $350 billion, but you have to come back and ask \nus for the second half, and we will decide whether you have spent it \nwell.\n  Time passed, and here we are. There is a request from President Bush \nfor the remaining $350 billion, but we clearly know he won't spend it. \nIt is money that can be spent, may be spent by the new President, \nBarack Obama--by the new administration. Do we need it? Are we still \nfacing an economic crisis? Today in America, 17,000 Americans lost \ntheir jobs, 11,000 lost their health insurance, and 9,000 saw their \nhomes go into mortgage foreclosure. Oh, it isn't just another bad day \nin America, it is a pattern that has developed since we were told last \nSeptember what was happening to our economy.\n  There are those on the other side who say the best thing, in light of \nthis economic situation, is to do nothing. I am not one of them. As \nbadly and poorly managed as those funds were--the first $350 billion--I \nhappen to be one of those people, one of those voters, and one of those \nSenators who said to America: Give us a new leader, give a new team a \nchance to change this country. A majority of the American people said \nthat is the right thing to do, and they elected Barack Obama and Joe \nBiden. They are asking for this money not to use it the wrong way, the \nold way, an imperfect way, but to use it with transparency so that the \nAmerican people can see what is being done to stabilize this economy, \nto stop this hemorrhaging of jobs, to create some credit\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\nso that businesses can survive, and to inject perhaps hundreds of \nbillions of dollars into mortgage foreclosure so that people can stay \nin their homes and the real estate market bottoms out.\n  Listen, if we don't do that, this is going to go from bad to worse, \nand 17,000 jobs a day lost in America could double--yes, it could--by \ndoing nothing. And those who vote yes on this are standing for that \npremise: Do nothing. Don't trust this new President. Don't trust this \nnew administration. Just wait, things are bound to get better.\n  I am not one of them. I want to give President Obama the tools he \nneeds to breathe life back into this economy, to give working families \na fighting chance, to create good-paying jobs in this country, to give \nsmall businesses a chance to survive, to provide a decent income and \nsome benefits for their workers, and maybe to preserve some basic \nindustry in this country so there still are manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica. We can't achieve that by doing nothing.\n  As badly as this money has been managed--the first $350 billion--we \nhave to look forward. Some of the people who managed the first $350 \nbillion could not imagine an America without the giants, such as \nGoldman Sachs. I can't imagine America without our middle class, \nwithout working families, who really form the basis, the bedrock, the \nfoundation for the growth of our economy and the growth of our \ndemocracy.\n  I am going to be voting with the faith that this new administration, \nwith new leadership and new eyes and new vision and new values, will \ninvest this money properly so that we can turn this economy around and \nbuild a strong American future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, as the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois said, this election was supposed to be about change. Yet his \nspeech is eerily reminiscent. It is exactly the same speech that was \ngiven on behalf of giving the Bush Administration a blank check a few \nmonths ago. It seems to me absolutely nothing has changed.\n  A few months ago, we were told we are in a crisis, you need to act, \nyou can't wait. You need to act immediately, and you need to give us \nunfettered discretion. The times demand that. Trust us.\n  Well, several months later, we have seen the result of that open \ncheckbook, that unfettered discretion, that broad-based trust without \nany parameters, without any meaningful protection in writing. There has \nbeen mistake after mistake and embarrassment after embarrassment and a \ncomplete lack of accountability in the TARP. Yet here we are again \ntoday debating the second half of this huge $700 billion program.\n  Even though we supposedly conducted a historic election based on the \ntheme of change, it is exactly the same speech: We are in a crisis; we \ncan't wait; we need to rush to judgment; give us an open checkbook; \ngive us unfettered discretion; and trust us. Well, there is an old \nexpression: Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The \nAmerican people are not going to be fooled twice. The question is, Is \nthe Senate going to be fooled twice?\n  An open checkbook, unfettered discretion, and ``trust us'' simply \nisn't good enough. I am not questioning the sincerity of anyone either \nin the Bush Administration or the incoming Obama Administration. But it \nisn't good enough with $700 billion of taxpayer funds, particularly \ngiven the history of the last several months.\n  One of the major protections that was put in the original legislation \nthat was much ballyhooed was the Congressional Oversight Panel. That \nCongressional Oversight Panel was supposed to track what was done in \nthe TARP, issue reports, and demand accountability. Well, they have \ndone their job and they have issued a significant report. The problem \nis, the report makes crystal clear there is no accountability.\n  The first main issue the Congressional Oversight Panel examined was \nbank accountability: What are banks doing with the money? Are they \nusing the money in a way that was intended, particularly to increase \ncredit availability to citizens and businesses? The Congressional \nOversight Panel's bottom-line conclusion on that is pretty simply \nstated:\n\n       The panel still does not know what the banks are doing with \n     taxpayer money.\n\n  It couldn't be stated more clearly. The Treasury doesn't know, the \noversight panel doesn't know, nobody knows.\n  The Associated Press, on December 22, issued a report about an \ninvestigation of 21 banks and what they were doing. They mostly didn't \nget any answers, but Morgan Chase, which received $25 billion, gave \nthis detailed, sophisticated answer:\n\n       We have lent some of it, we have not lent some of it. We \n     have not given any accounting of saying here is how we are \n     doing it.\n\n  Period. In fact, Treasury has the authority to require banks to \nreport on their use of funds as a condition for the receiving of funds. \nGuess what. Treasury declined to make that requirement.\n  Point No. 2 of the report: transparency and asset evaluation. TARP \nwas, in large part, to shore up healthy banks. Yet there is no metric, \nthere is no rule written anywhere about how Treasury is determining \nwhat a healthy bank is.\n  Point No. 3: general strategy. TARP has been a moving target. The \nwhole model has changed week to week. In fact, we still call it TARP--\nthe Troubled Asset Relief Program--but that idea was thrown out the \nwindow 2 weeks after Congress originally passed the program. So the \nCongressional Oversight Panel had another basic question: What is the \ngeneral strategy as to how you are going to stabilize the economy? What \nare you focused on? Why should that be the focus? And rather than \nproviding any detailed explanation, Treasury's explanation was that \nthey are working to ``stabilize the economy.'' Well, that is a lot of \ndetail. That is accountability. That makes me feel better.\n  This has been the history of the TARP, and the question is, Are we \ngoing to allow it to remain the history and move on to the second $350 \nbillion of taxpayer funds?\n  I am not a banking or financial expert and I do not own a crystal \nball. I can't see into the future. I can't predict what crises will or \nwill not occur in the economy. And I am not saying this economy is \nturning the corner and is improving and we don't have many challenges \nahead. But I can predict this: If we don't pass this resolution of \ndisapproval, nothing will change in the TARP. There will continue to be \nno accountability, the whole program will change its focus from week to \nweek, and we will waste a huge amount of that $700 billion of taxpayer \nfunds.\n  Again, we come back to where we were just a few months ago: We are in \na crisis; you have to act; you can't even wait until tomorrow; you have \nto pass this blank check; unfettered authority; trust us.\n  Even with an intervening election that was supposed to be about \nchange, the question remains: Are we going to change or not? Are we \ngoing to go down precisely the same path? The American people had \nserious questions and concerns the first time around. If we accept that \nspeech again--oh, we are in a crisis; you need to act immediately; open \ncheckbook; unfettered discretion; trust us--if we buy that the second \ntime around, they are not going to be perturbed, they are going to go \nthrough the roof, and so they should because they have good old-\nfashioned American common sense. They will say, ``Fool me once, shame \non you; fool me twice, shame on me.''\n  That is what we face here in the Senate. We must demand a clearly \ndefined program. We must demand real accountability. We must demand \nreal protections for the taxpayer. And the only way we will get any of \nthat, any of it, is to pass this disapproval resolution and demand that \nbe put in statute, in law, and not simply be a passing promise.\n  I urge all my colleagues not to be fooled again, to stand up for real \naccountability, to stand up for the taxpayer, and, yes, to be ready to \nact in uncertain times but to say no to an open checkbook, to \nunfettered discretion, and to mere promises that things will be better \nand mere pleas to trust us.\n  Madam President, I understand the majority leader is coming to speak \nfor\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nthe other side, so I will retain the floor until then.\n  Madam President, again, to me, that is the question. It is not about \nwhether you think the economy is healthy--put me down for an unhealthy \neconomy. It is not about whether we think there are rosy times ahead or \nthere may be serious problems. Put me down for there may well be very \nserious problems. In fact, put me down for there are going to be, we \njust don't know precisely what they are going to be.\n\n  But that does not justify what we have before us. That does not \njustify an open checkbook, unfettered discretion, and mere acceptance \nof promises and pleas to trust us.\n  The American people are demanding something far more than that, and \nthey deserve something far more than that. The question is, Is anything \ngoing to change? After 2 years of debates about change, the question \nis, Is anything going to change? Continuing down this path to the \nsecond half of the TARP program would represent a complete lack of \nchange. It would represent complete continuity between one \nadministration and the next. It would represent complete continuity \nbetween one Wall Street Treasury Secretary and the next, complete \ncontinuity between mere promises and pleas to trust us, and nothing \nmore than that.\n  Put me down for wanting change. Put me down for demanding change. \nThis is the time and the place to do it. Obviously, change in this \nprogram can only occur if we pass this disapproval resolution. Change \nwill never occur if we defeat it because then the new administration \nwill have a blank check, it will have unfettered discretion, it will \nhave our answer to ``trust us''--Sure, why not? When any administration \nhas that, they are not going to restrict themselves, they are not going \nto put more rules in place, they are not going to tie their own hands. \nBy definition, any administration wants to maximize that unfettered \ndiscretion, that open checkbook. The question is, Are we going to not \ndemand change and give them that? Or make change happen right here, \nright now, with regard to this central new program, in terms of our \nstruggling economy?\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this two-page letter from 26 broad-based economic, financial, \nand other citizen groups from around the country, requesting in very \nclear, strong terms our passage of the TARP disapproval resolution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    An Open Letter to the United States Congress Requesting a TARP \n                         Disapproval Resolution\n\n                                                 January 15, 2009.\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the millions of \n     taxpaying citizens represented by the public interest \n     organizations below, we write to strongly encourage you to \n     swiftly pass a notice of disapproval on releasing the \n     remaining $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program \n     (TARP) funds.\n       From the beginning, the TARP plan was questionable, but a \n     number of Members nonetheless resolved to support it. It \n     should be clear now that this was a mistake.\n       The stated purpose of the TARP was to purchase toxic \n     mortgage assets. Secretary Paulson abandoned this concept \n     immediately after the signing ceremony. The TARP was also \n     designed to reintroduce the flow of credit into the market \n     and help stabilize Wall Street. To date, neither has been \n     accomplished.\n       In addition to misleading Congress about his intent on the \n     use of TARP funds, Secretary Paulson has invaded the free \n     market, propping up some companies to the detriment of others \n     and purchasing stock in banks without requiring \n     accountability or transparency about the use of taxpayer \n     funds.\n       The TARP legislation specifically requires that before the \n     second half of the $700 billion is released, the President \n     provide Congress with a written report detailing how the \n     additional funds are to be used. A request to spend the \n     second half of the funds without restraint does not meet the \n     requirements set forth in the bill. In addition to requiring \n     this detailed plan, Congress should require an accounting and \n     detailed explanation on how the initial TARP funds have been \n     used and the prospect of a taxpayer recovery of these funds.\n       Congress now has an opportunity to preserve some of the \n     taxpayers' assets and should spend the necessary time \n     studying the underlying causes of the economic down-turn by \n     passing a TARP disapproval resolution. We encourage you to \n     take such action.\n           Sincerely,\n         African American Republican Leadership Council, Alex-St. \n           James, Chairman; American Shareholders Association, \n           Ryan Ellis, Executive Director; Americans for Limited \n           Government, William Wilson, President; Americans for \n           Tax Reform, Grover Norquist, President; Americans for \n           the Preservation of Liberty, Mark Chmura, Executive \n           Director; America's Survival, Inc., Cliff Kincaid, \n           President; Center for Fiscal Accountability, Sandra \n           Fabry, Executive Director; Center for Investors and \n           Entrepreneurs, John Berlau, Director; Citizens United, \n           David N.

Madam President, with the arrival of the majority leader, \nI yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is in times of unusual strain and \nchallenge that we are called upon to prove ourselves, as people, as \nSenators, as a country. With our economy struggling and the American \npeople suffering, most Senators have risen to the challenge.\n  I would like to take a minute, though, to particularly speak of \nSenator Chris Dodd, Chairman Dodd of the Banking Committee. He and his \nstaff spent seemingly endless days and nights, working on the rescue \nplan we passed last year. We thought that would be all for a while. But \nnow that we are in this state of crisis again, Senator Dodd is the face \nand voice of our response to this financial crisis. I have such \nadmiration and respect for Senator Dodd as one of the fine orators of \nthe Senate, and that is something everyone sees. But what we do not see \nis his skill as a legislator, behind doors, in his committee and \nworking with us. And he has done a great job working with Senator \nShelby. They don't always also agree, but they treat each other \ncivilly, and they set the standard for the rest of us. Senator Dodd is \nto be recognized, as I do, for yeoman's work on this legislation.\n  On the Republican side, it is important to focus on Senator Judd \nGregg. He deserves enormous credit as well during these last few weeks, \nworking on this extension of Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n  I have been tremendously impressed with President-elect Obama. As his \ncampaign wore on--and it was a long campaign--the American people came \nto realize this was a unique individual, somebody extremely brilliant \nacademically, someone who could communicate very well, and someone who \nworked hard and developed the trust of the American people. I have been \nimpressed with his campaign but also with his team and their efforts to \nsecure the second half of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. \nIf the actions of the President-elect on TARP are any indication, a new \nday is dawning in Washington, DC, and a good day, a bright day.\n  President-elect Obama didn't have to take the step he did. This was a \ntest of leadership at a time when leadership is desperately needed in \nour country. In this early test whether our new President will stand \nfor what is right, not just for what is easy, President-elect Obama \npassed with flying colors. He and his economic team came to Capitol \nHill repeatedly these past weeks, not just for a photo opportunity but \nto engage in real negotiations. The Obama administration generally \nsought the involvement of Democrats and Republicans, treating them not \nas adversaries or roadblocks to progress but as partners in the \nlegislative process.\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\n  I appreciate the willingness of Republicans to work with him and to \nwork with us to pass this legislation. I do not know how many votes we \nare going to get from the Republicans, but we will get some votes and \nevery one of them is needed and I appreciate that.\n  I understand the legitimate concerns of Members over the way the \nfirst half of the Troubled Asset Relief Program funds have been spent. \nWe in Congress must never forget the funds we allocate to this program \nbelong to the American taxpayers. It is not our money, it is their \nmoney, and we must wisely spend and carefully account for every penny, \nas every family would, to plan their budget to make the current \npaycheck last until the next paycheck that they hope comes in.\n  We need transparency, we need openness, we need oversight. With our \neconomy battered and further damage possibly still to come, we must \ngive our new President every tool to try to fix this economy. Barack \nObama has made it clear that he understands the mistakes of the prior \nadministration and will not repeat them. President-elect Obama has, in \nperson and in written communications, agreed to commit substantial \nresources to foreclosure mitigation, as he should.\n  Barack Obama has also said there will be transparency, there will be \noversight, and Barack Obama has said the disbursal of TARP funds will \nrequire his signoff; not a Secretary, not somebody in some clerk's \noffice, not a group of people, but every penny will require Barack \nObama's personal signoff.\n  This vote is going to be close. As many of my colleagues decide how \nto vote, I ask them to think about the challenges our freezing \nfinancial markets are causing their constituents. It doesn't matter if \nit is Minnesota or Nevada or Arizona or New Hampshire, without \nfinancial markets that are functional, families cannot buy a home, \nborrow to pay for college tuition, replace the family car or simply \ndecide what they are going to do this weekend, because they have no \nmoney. Businesses of all sizes cannot make payroll for employees or \ninvest in expansion to create new jobs. That is what this vote is all \nabout. This vote is about local governments not being able to build \nschools but, instead, lay off teachers, lay off police officers. They \nare trying to pave roads and protect the public health of their \ncitizens.\n  We should all be angry at the titans of Wall Street, angry because of \ntheir excesses. But inaction now would not punish the wrongdoer, it \nwould punish the American people who are already suffering.\n  None of us, me included, are happy we have to take this vote. I wish \nwe didn't have to. But given the potentially devastating alternative, I \ntrust my colleagues will act with sound judgment and for the long-term \ngood of our country and in this moment of crisis.\n  This is one of those rare times. I voted thousands and thousands of \ntimes, but over the years I have been here since 1982, there are \nprobably only 15 or 20 votes that are memorable. This is a memorable \nvote. I believe this is the road to recovery for our country.\n  Let's trust Barack Obama. I look back at a book I read called ``The \nMaster of the Senate.'' It was about Lyndon Johnson. There is a chapter \nin that book that I think is so revealing as to today. Lyndon Johnson \nbecame the Democratic leader. The President of the United States at \nthat time was Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower was the most popular \nPresident in the history of the country. Over an 8-year period of time, \nhis popularity averaged 65 percent--over 8 years. So Lyndon Johnson \nsaid: I think what the guy is trying to do is the right thing so I am \ngoing to get as many of my Senators as I can, all my Democratic \nSenators, to join with Dwight Eisenhower to accomplish what he thinks \nshould be accomplished.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues, look at Barack Obama since he has \nbeen elected. Has he set a pattern for moderation? Has he set a pattern \nfor people coming into his Cabinet who are good no matter their party? \nThe answer is yes. The American people are impressed with what he has \ntried to do to move this country forward. I ask my friends to reflect \nback to Dwight Eisenhower, to look now to Barack Obama. This is the \ntime we need to move forward as Democrats and Republicans, as \nAmericans, and do what is right. I believe this is one of those votes \nhistorians are going to record as important. I think, when some of \nthose chapters are written in that book, they are going to say this is \nthe beginning of the economic recovery for our country.\n  Madam President, is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield that back and start the vote now. We will extend \nit, if necessary.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will read the joint resolution for the third time.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 5) was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall it pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. (After his name was called) Mr. President, on this vote, \nSenator Kennedy is absent. If he were present, he would have voted nay. \nIf I were to vote, I would vote yea. Therefore, I withhold my vote.\n  Mr. TESTER. (After his name was called) Mr. President, on this vote, \nI have a pair with the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown. If he were present \nand voting, he would vote nay. If I were permitted to vote, I would \nvote yea. I, therefore, withhold my vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I voted today the same way I did in \nOctober because both the current President and the incoming President \nhave said this is an essential insurance policy against financial \ncatastrophe. This is not spending; this is lending money with interest \nthat taxpayers should get back. I would not have voted this way if \nPresident-elect Obama had not assured us that he will use this money as \nit was intended: to keep credit flowing by strengthening financial \ninstitutions and housing markets, and not for new industry-by-industry \nbailouts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                 (Purpose: In the nature of substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Title VII Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Filing limitations periods serve important functions. \n     They ensure that all claims are promptly raised and \n     investigated, and, when remediation is warranted, that the \n     violations involved are promptly remediated.\n       (2) Limitations periods are particularly important in \n     employment situations, where unresolved grievances have a \n     singularly corrosive and disruptive effect.\n       (3) Limitations periods are also particularly important for \n     a statutory process that favors the voluntary resolution of \n     claims through mediation and conciliation. Promptly raised \n     issues are invariably more susceptible to such forms of \n     voluntary resolution.\n       (4) In instances in which that voluntary resolution is not \n     possible, a limitations period ensures that claims will be \n     adjudicated on the basis of evidence that is available, \n     reliable, and from a date that is proximate in time to the \n     adjudication.\n       (5) Limitations periods, however, should not be construed \n     to foreclose the filing of a claim by a reasonable person who \n     exercises due diligence regarding the person's rights but who \n     did not have, and should not have been expected to have, a \n     reasonable suspicion that the person was the object of \n     unlawful discrimination. Such a person should be afforded the \n     full applicable limitation period to commence a claim from \n     the time the person has, or should be expected to have, a \n     reasonable suspicion of discrimination.\n\n     SEC. 3. FILING PERIOD FOR CHARGES ALLEGING UNLAWFUL \n                   EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000e-5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) This paragraph shall apply to a charge if--\n       ``(i) the charge alleges an unlawful employment practice \n     involving discrimination in violation of this title; and\n       ``(ii) the person aggrieved demonstrates that the person \n     did not have, and should not have been expected to have, \n     enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of such \n     discrimination, on the date on which the alleged unlawful \n     employment practice occurred.\n       ``(B) In the case of such a charge, the applicable 180-day \n     or 300-day filing period described in paragraph (1) shall \n     commence on the date when the person aggrieved has, or should \n     be expected to have, enough information to support a \n     reasonable suspicion of such discrimination.\n       ``(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \n     change or modify the provisions of subsection (g)(1).\n       ``(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to apply \n     to a charge alleging an unlawful employment practice relating \n     to the provision of a pension or a pension benefit.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. FILING PERIOD FOR CHARGES ALLEGING UNLAWFUL PRACTICES \n                   BASED ON AGE.\n\n       Section 7(d) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (29 U.S.C. 626(d)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;\n       (2) by striking ``(d)'' and inserting ``(d)(1)'';\n       (3) in the third sentence, by striking ``Upon'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Upon''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) This paragraph shall apply to a charge if--\n       ``(i) the charge alleges an unlawful practice involving \n     discrimination in violation of this Act; and\n       ``(ii) the person aggrieved demonstrates that the person \n     did not have, and should not have been expected to have, \n     enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of such \n     discrimination, on the date on which the alleged unlawful \n     practice occurred.\n       ``(B) In the case of such a charge, the applicable 180-day \n     or 300-day filing period described in paragraph (1) shall \n     commence on the date when the person aggrieved has, or should \n     be expected to have, enough information to support a \n     reasonable suspicion of such discrimination.\n       ``(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \n     change or modify any remedial provision of this Act.\n       ``(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to apply \n     to a charge alleging an unlawful practice relating to the \n     provision of a pension or a pension benefit.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. APPLICATION TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.--Section \n     706(e)(3) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-\n     5(e)(3)) shall apply (in the same manner as such section \n     applies to a charge described in subparagraph (A)(i) of such \n     section) to claims of discrimination brought under title I \n     and section 503 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq., 12203), pursuant to section \n     107(a) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 12117(a)), which adopts the \n     powers, remedies, and procedures set forth in section 706 of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5).\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) Civil rights act of 1964.--Section 717 of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(f)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), section 706(e)(3) shall \n     apply (in the same manner as such section applies to a charge \n     described in subparagraph (A)(i) of such section) to \n     complaints of discrimination under this section.\n       ``(2) For purposes of applying section 706(e)(3) to a \n     complaint under this section, a reference in section \n     706(e)(3)(B) to a filing period shall be considered to be a \n     reference to the applicable filing period under this \n     section.''.\n       (2) Age discrimination in employment act of 1967.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 15(f) of the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 633a(f)) is amended by \n     striking ``of section'' and inserting ``of sections 7(d)(3) \n     and''.\n       (B) Application.--For purposes of applying section 7(d)(3) \n     of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 \n     U.S.C. 626(d)(3)) to a complaint under section 15 of that Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 633a), a reference in section 7(d)(3)(B) of that \n     Act to a filing period shall be considered to be a reference \n     to the applicable filing period under section 15 of that Act.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, my amendment, which I offer along \nwith Senators Voinovich, Martinez, Grassley, Enzi, Corker, Alexander, \nCornyn, Burr, Murkowski, and Thune, is a substitute for the underlying \nbill that is before us, S. 181. I hope we will, now that we have taken \nup the bill, fully discuss and hopefully have some amendments that will \nmake the Fair Pay Act a bill that will serve all of the needs of our \ncountry. Paramount is the right of an employee to have redress, if that \nemployee is experiencing discrimination. We also need to make sure that \nour small businesses and medium-sized businesses know what their \nunderlying liabilities might be. That is part of business planning.\n  I have certainly been a person who has known discrimination. I want \neveryone who believes they have a cause of action to have that right.\n  I have also been a business owner. I know how important it is that \nour businesses know what their potential liabilities are. That is why \nstatutes of limitation were put into the laws of the country, so that \none could have a defense, so that there would be timely filings of \nclaims, so that there would be witnesses who would have the memory or \nthe records or the documents to defend against a claim.\n  My substitute amendment allows the person who is aggrieved, when that \nperson knows or should have known that there was discrimination, to \nhave 180 days, approximately 6 months, to file that claim so that there \nwill be records, there will be notice, and there will be the ability \nfor a defense and for the person to have the fair trial with the people \nwho would be relevant to her or his case.\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\n  To do that, we have to have that time limit that the Supreme Court \nhas said is a reasonable time limit, if it is 6 months after the person \nknew or should have known. We are putting back in or we are actually \ncodifying for all of the districts of the country that standard.\n  It is also important that we have the ability for that person to get \ninto court, because that is the person who has the grievance. It is \nthat person who should be testifying rather than someone who might have \nhad an effect but is not the person who knows if they believe they were \ndiscriminated against. These are the things that my amendment \naddresses.\n  We are not going to debate, although I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maryland is going to rebut, but I hope to have the time for us to \nfully debate this amendment when we take it up and when all of our \nMembers are here.\n  There will be Members on my side who want to speak, I am sure Members \non her side who want to speak, so I wanted to lay the amendment down so \neveryone is on notice and has the document and can read the amendment. \nThen I look forward to discussing it when the majority leader decides \nwe will take this bill up, hopefully, next week.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to acknowledge that we will not \nbe debating this amendment this evening. Senator Hutchison has laid \ndown her substitute. What I am so excited about is that we are actually \ngoing to be debating the Lilly Ledbetter Act and also amendments and \nsubstitutes therein.\n  I know the Senator from Texas has a plane she is going to try to \nmake; otherwise, we would have had a more amplified debate tonight. But \nI am so excited this moment has finally come, that we are actually \ngoing to debate what is the most effective way we can end wage \ndiscrimination in our country and keep the courthouse door open to \nlegitimate claimants.\n  I am also excited that, once again, the Senate will return to a \nregular order. What do I mean by ``a regular order''? We are actually \ngoing to bring up bills. We are not going to get lost in some quagmire \nof parliamentary procedure where we entangle ourselves and strangle \nourselves. This debate, that actually begins tonight, is the signal of \na new day returning to some of the old ways the Senate operated, which \nwas a regular order where we could offer amendments, debate amendments, \nand vote on amendments.\n  This is what doing legislation is all about. Before I actually, \nbriefly, comment on the merits, to affirm the process: We said to our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are going to give you the \nopportunity to offer amendments and to debate them. We are keeping that \npromise. In the way Hutchison and Mikulski are kicking it off now, we \nare showing we are keeping our promise.\n  Second, this affirms the way we, the women of the Senate, want to \noperate. Senator Hutchison and I agree on the goal: ending wage \ndiscrimination and keeping the courthouse door open. Senator Hutchison \nand I absolutely disagree on what is the best way to achieve that goal. \nI have our legislation. She has her substitute. But though we disagree, \nyou will see on Wednesday, as we pick up an amplified discussion, we \ncan disagree without being disagreeable.\n  It is time to return to civility. It is time to show that good \nmanners produce good legislation. We look forward to a robust and \namplified way of discussing this issue.\n  So we are going to debate Lilly Ledbetter and also the Hutchison \nsubstitute and other amendments. We will do it, if there is more \ntonight, and we will also do it tomorrow, if there are Senators who \nwish to offer it. I will be here. But we will be able to do it.\n  We strongly disagree with the Hutchison amendment. But rather than \ndebate it, without her being here, I am going to reserve my remarks for \nwhen she is here, and we are going to show that good politics starts \nwith good manners and a good process.\n  I thank the Republican leader for being so cooperative to help us set \nthe stage for doing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Republican leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to proceed for a few minutes as \nin morning business. I know Senator Murray is then anxious to be \nrecognized. I ask unanimous consent that she be recognized at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              TARP Funding\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to the TARP issue we just \ndealt with on the floor, I voted for the disapproval resolution.\n  Three months ago, I voted in favor of Government action to rescue the \nNation's financial system. The early indications suggest that our \nactions did have a stabilizing effect. But the problems persist. And \nbased on what we know about our current financial situation, it is \nclear the full $700 billion we voted for in October is still needed.\n  Republicans have insisted from the beginning that the outgoing \nadministration agree to strict oversight and taxpayer protections \nrelated to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the TARP. And we asked \nfor similar assurances from the incoming administration this week when \nit requested the second round of TARP funds.\n  In response, the incoming administration graciously agreed to meet \nwith Senators, and spent a good deal of time explaining to Republicans \nlast night how they plan to use these funds. I want to express publicly \nour appreciation for their time and for their efforts.\n  After last night's conversation, Republicans asked for one more \nthing: a public assurance from the incoming administration that these \nfunds would be used in a manner consistent with the original purpose of \nthe TARP. And, today, the incoming administration again graciously \nresponded to our request by providing a letter of intent for the second \nround of TARP funds.\n  I want to be very clear that I appreciate the incoming \nadministration's assurance in that letter that these funds for the \noriginal purpose of stabilizing the economy and preventing a systemic \neconomic collapse--they agree that is what the funds were for. However, \nthe incoming administration also indicated it would use the money in \nways I cannot support.\n  The letter explicitly states that they will pursue a policy of ``cram \ndown,'' both by amending the bankruptcy laws and by forcing banks that \nreceive TARP funds to write down mortgages. This will result in higher \nmortgage rates for everyone who seeks a home loan.\n  The letter states that the Federal Government will require banks that \nreceive TARP funds to make loans--require banks to make loans. And \nwhile we want banks to resume lending, forcing them to make loans is \nexactly how this crisis started in the first place. We need to show \nthat we have learned from past mistakes.\n  The letter also states that participating firms will need Federal \napproval before issuing dividends. I fear this will hamstring their \nability to raise capital and thus perpetuate their dependence on \nFederal funds. We should encourage firms to raise private money, but \nthat will be impossible if they cannot promise investors a return on \ninvestment.\n  Again, I do want to express my appreciation to the incoming \nadministration for its responsiveness to Republican concerns. Every \ntime we asked a question, it was promptly answered. So far, Republican \ninteractions with the incoming administration have been quite \nencouraging and appreciated. While I voted on the losing side, I hope \nthe new administration will consider some of my concerns and our \nconcerns on this side. We hope their stewardship of these funds is \nsuccessful in stabilizing the markets according to the original purpose \nof the TARP, and we will continue to work with them to strengthen our \nNation's economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the course of the past several months, \nwe have been working to complete negotiations on making our committee \nassignments so that all the new members will be able to attend \ncommittee meetings and be active participants. In some instances, I \nunderstand that chairmen have invited new Members to attend meetings \nand be involved in the process.\n  I am happy to report that earlier this week, the Republican leader \nand I agreed to what the committee ratios will be for the 111th \nCongress. This process of give and take is tedious, and the giver \nalways feels that they have given more, while the taker believes that \nthey deserve more. We had to increase the size of some of the \ncommittees during these deliberations. In any event we have reached \nagreement on ratios, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that \nagreement be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                       Committee Ratio Agreement\n\nAgriculture........................................................12/9\nJudiciary..........................................................11/8\nAppropriations....................................................17/13\nIntel...............................................................8/7\nArmed Services....................................................15/11\nAging..............................................................12/9\nBanking............................................................12/9\nBudget............................................................13/10\nCommerce..........................................................14/11\nIndian Aff..........................................................9/6\nEnergy............................................................13/10\nJEC.................................................................6/4\nEPW................................................................11/8\nRules..............................................................11/8\nFinance...........................................................13/10\nSmall Bus..........................................................11/8\nFor.

With respect to the Democratic membership, we have had a \nmeeting of our Democratic Steering Committee and they have ratified the \nproposed membership slate. Additionally, the Democratic Caucus has also \ngiven its stamp of approval to the slate.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, the majority is ready to proceed ahead with \nSenate action on considering an organizational resolution which \nappoints committee membership. However, I understand from the \nRepublican leader that they still need to complete their process. So, I \nfully expect that when we return after the inauguration, the Senate \nwill act on an organizational resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S590-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COMMITTEE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL Mr. President. We have included language for the 111th \nCongress which keeps Republican Committee budgets from going below the \nfunding allocation for fiscal year 2008.\n  Upon enactment of a full year appropriation for the legislative \nbranch, the Rules Committee has agreed to authorize $100,000,000 \nannually for comittee majority and minority staff salary baselines to \nbe allocated at a 60 percent to 40 percent ratio, majority/minority \nrespectively, during the 111th Congress.\n  Additionally, upon the enactment of a full year appropriation for the \nlegislative branch, the authorization will provide for salary baselines \nto be adjusted by future cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, increases as \napproved by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. Further, the \nmajority leader and the chairman of the Rules Committee have agreed \nthat 89 percent of special reserves is available to each chair/ranking \nmember for administrative expenses, if requested, to be allocated at a \n60 percent to 40 percent ratio, majority/minority respectively. Special \nreserves, which have been available to committees since 2001, shall not \nexceed historic levels.\n  While fiscal constraints have made this process very difficult, I \nappreciate the good faith effort made by the majority leader to fulfill \nthe commitment we entered into at the beginning of the 110th Congress \nto keep minority staff salary baselines from going below funding levels \nallocated to the Republicans in the 109th Congress. The agreement we \nhave reached provides the ability for minority committee budgets to be \nfunded no less than the allocation in the 110th Congress.\n  Mr REID. I concur with the remarks of the Republican leader. The \nbaseline was not reduced for Democratic staff in the 108th Congress and \nthis agreement allows for a similar accommodation for the Republicans \nin the 111th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a joint leadership letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We mutually commit to the following for the 111th Congress:\n       Upon enactment of a full year appropriation for the \n     legislative branch, the majority and minority staff salary \n     baselines for the committees of the Senate, including Joint \n     and Special Committees, and all other subgroups, shall be \n     apportioned at a 60 percent to 40 percent ratio, majority/\n     minority respectively, based on an authorization of \n     $100,000,000 annually. Additionally, upon enactment of a full \n     year appropriation for the legislative branch, the \n     authorization will provide for salary baselines to be \n     adjusted by future cost of living adjustment, COLA, increases \n     as approved by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. \n     Further, the majority leader and the chairman of the Rules \n     Committee have agreed that 89 percent of special reserves is \n     available to each chair/ranking member for administrative \n     expenses, if requested, to be allocated at a 60 percent to 40 \n     percent ratio, majority/minority respectively.\n       This will allow individual minority committee funding \n     levels to remain unchanged, if special reserves are \n     requested. Therefore, no committee budget shall be allocated \n     to reduce the minority committee budget below that of fiscal \n     year 2008.\n       Funds for committee expenses shall be available to each \n     chairman consistent with the Senate rules and practices of \n     the 110th Congress.\n       The chairman and ranking member of any committee, may, by \n     mutual agreement, modify the apportionment of committee \n     funding, and/or space.\n       The division of committee office space shall be \n     commensurate with the 60 percent to 40 percent ratio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S590-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for its \npassage of the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage \nCorridor Amendments Act, which was included as part of S. 22, the \nOmnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. First, I would like to \nthank Senators Lieberman, Kerry, and Kennedy, who joined me in \nintroducing a standalone version of this bill last week and have worked \nwith me for many years to preserve this beautiful part of New England. \nI would also like to thank the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, Senator Bingaman, for his tireless work to pass \nall of the critically important public lands bills included in S. 22. \nBecause of his efforts, hundreds of thousands of acres of pristine \nwilderness will be added to the National Wilderness Preservation \nSystem, and many new ecologically unique and culturally significant \nsites will receive Federal protection under the National Wild and \nScenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, and the National \nHeritage Area program.\n  I have long felt that as Senators, one of our most important \nobligations is to ensure that our Nation's vast array of\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nnatural treasures is managed in an environmentally responsible and \nsustainable way. With the passage of S. 22, and in particular, with the \nextension of Congress's authorization of the Quinebaug and Shetucket \nRivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, I believe that we have taken \nan important step toward achieving that goal.\n  The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, \nQSHC, was established in 1994 as the fifth National Heritage Corridor. \nNational Heritage Areas are designated by Congress to preserve \ndistinctive landscapes of historic, cultural, natural, and recreational \nresources. The QSHC is commonly known as ``The Last Green Valley,'' a \nrare and beautiful rural landscape in the populous Northeast. In fact, \nthe Valley stands out in night images from space for its absence of \nlights. It contains aboriginal and colonial archaeological sites, mills \nand mill villages that preserve the history of the early industrial \nrevolution, and traditional farming communities. The QSHC nonprofit \nmanagement entity has restored architecturally and historically \nimportant buildings, developed conservation and open space plans, and \nfostered cooperation among businesses in the region that rely on the \nnatural resources and beauty of the land. It has consistently leveraged \nan average of $19 for every $1 of appropriated Federal money.\n  The QSHC has developed a plan to become a self-sustaining entity by \n2015, as laid out in ``The Trail to 2015: A Sustainability Plan for the \nLast Green Valley.'' The plan calls for replacing Federal funds with \nfees for services, private and corporate support, and income from a \npermanent fund. In the interim, Federal funds are necessary for \ncapacity-building, awareness programs, and ongoing education of land-\nuse decision-makers.\n  The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor \nhas created a collaboration of 35 municipalities dedicated to \npreserving a unique slice of our American heritage. With the extension \nof its authorization, this preserve will be able to exist in \nperpetuity. Again, I would like to thank my Senate colleagues for their \nsupport of the QSHC and the numerous other sites of great natural and \ncultural significance that will be protected as a result of the passage \nof this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S591-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my vote \nagainst final passage of S. 22, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act \nof 2009. I would like to be clear that I do not oppose every aspect of \nthis bill, nor do I oppose the notion that our Nation's most unique and \nprecious natural features should be protected for the use and enjoyment \nof future generations. As with many large omnibus bills, there are a \nnumber of provisions that enjoy strong support in the Senate. However, \ntaken as a whole, this bill represents an enormous commitment of \nfederal resources in perpetuity that we simply cannot afford at this \ntime. For years, our existing national parks, wildlife refuges, and \nother public lands have been faced with a backlog of much-needed \nmaintenance projects because we have not had the resources to do \neverything that needs to be done along with competing budget \npriorities. Now, in the midst of an economic downturn and on the eve of \nconsidering an historically large economic stimulus package, the strain \non Federal budgets has rarely been greater. In light of this fact, it \nis intellectually dishonest to promise to the American people that the \nFederal Government will protect and maintain additional Federal lands \nwhen we know that we are not even able to fully keep our current \ncommitments. For that reason, I felt it necessary to vote no on this \nbill at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S591-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S591-S593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMITTEE ON FINANCE, RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for \n     open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with \n     the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally \n     observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or \n     disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness \n     are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions \n     or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing \n     shall be expelled from the hearing.\n       Rule 16.

Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the \n     approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative \n     subcommittees. The ranking minority member shall recommend to \n     the chairman appointment of minority members to the \n     subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full \n     committee calendar unless a majority of the members present \n     and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an \n     appropriate subcommittee.\n       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-\n     passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph \n     (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that \n     period, the legislation will be restored to the full \n     committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding \n     sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event \n     that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present dis- charge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from \n     passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate, \n     subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the \n     Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop \n     specific proposals for full committee consideration but may \n     not report such legislation to the full committee. The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that----\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18.

Mr. Presdient, I have really enjoyed working with \nJohn Sununu.\n  John Sununu grew up in Salem, NH, and is one of eight children. He \nwas first introduced to public service at a young age, when his mother \nserved as chairman of the local school board.\n  John attended public schools, graduated from Salem High School, and \nreceived bachelor's and master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  John also earned a master's degree in business administration from \nthe Harvard Graduate School of Business.\n  John Sununu first ran for public office in 1996, winning election in \nNew Hampshire's 1st District and serving 3 terms in the U.S. House.\n  In 2002, John defeated both an incumbent Senator and the sitting \nGovernor to become the youngest Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  As a Senator, John distinguished himself as an innovative legislator, \nbringing his extensive background in science, engineering, and small \nbusiness to his work in Washington.\n  Senator Sununu has been a staunch advocate for low taxes, smarter \nregulation, and civil liberties.\n  Since he is still a young man at the age of 44, I suspect that we \nwill be hearing a lot more from John Sununu in the years to come.\n  I wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              Gordon Smith\n\n  Mr. President, Gordon Smith has served the people of Oregon extremely \nwell.\n  Before coming to the U.S. Senate, he served as director of the family \nowned Smith frozen foods company in Weston, OR, where he created jobs \nand spurred economic growth.\n  Gordon Smith entered politics with his election to the Oregon State \nSenate in 1992, and he became president of that body in 1995.\n  Since winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1996, Senator Smith has \nworked with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle on critical \nissues.\n  Senator Smith chaired the Special Committee on Aging, and he also \nserved on the following Senate committees: Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, Energy and Natural Resources, Finance, and Indian \nAffairs.\n  Senator Smith has also courageously led the effort to educate \nAmericans on ways to prevent the tragedy of suicide of young men and \nwomen.\n  In 2004, I was so proud when President Bush signed the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act, authorizing $82 million for suicide prevention and \nawareness programs at colleges.\n  Because of his business experience, he was a Senate leader on issues \nand regulations that impede economic growth.\n  Senator Smith also distinguished himself by championing rural \nOregonians, including the many farmers and ranchers throughout the \nmountains and lake areas of his beautiful State.\n  I thank Gordon Smith for his dedication and service, and I wish him \nwell.\n\n\n                              Ted Stevens\n\n  Mr. Presdient, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska has served in the U.S. \nSenate for 40 years, and is the longest-serving Republican Senator in \nhistory.\n  On a personal note, I have enjoyed working with Senator Stevens, and \nit has been a true privilege to collaborate with him on some of the \nmost important issues facing our great Nation--including energy, health \ncare, and national defense.\n  Senator Stevens' service to the United States didn't begin when he \nstepped inside this chamber. Rather, his service began decades \nearlier--during some of the most harrowing days of World War Two.\n  Senator Stevens was part of the Greatest Generation who fought and \nwon that global struggle for freedom--flying a C-47 in the China Burma \nIndia Theater.\n  Incredibly, over 1,000 of Senator Stevens' fellow airmen died \n``flying the hump'' and elsewhere in the Chinese Burma India Theater--a \nsobering reminder of the high price of freedom.\n  For his heroic efforts, Senator Stevens later received two \nDistinguished Flying Crosses and two Air Medals, as well as the Yuan \nHai medal awarded by the Republic of China.\n  After the war, Senator Stevens completed his education at UCLA and \nHarvard Law School, and then moved to Alaska, which was then a U.S. \nterritory.\n  In the city of Fairbanks, Senator Stevens practiced law for several \nyears, until he came to Washington, DC, to serve in the Eisenhower \nadministration, and also to lobby for Alaska's admittance into the \nUnion--a mission that succeeded in 1959.\n  When Senator Stevens returned to Alaska, he ran for--and won a seat \nin the Alaska House of Representatives, and later became House majority \nleader.\n  Then, in December 1968, Governor Walter J. Hickel appointed him to \nfill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate.\n  In 1970, the voters of Alaska ratified that choice by electing \nSenator Stevens to finish that term in a special election, and then re-\nelecting him six more times.\n  Senator Stevens' achievements are legendary in this chamber--\nincluding chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Commerce Committee and President pro tempore of the U.S. \nSenate--from January 2003 to January 2007.\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\n  For his many decades of service, Senator Stevens has received and \naccepted numerous honors--including having the Anchorage International \nAirport named after him.\n  Back in 1993, when I first arrived in the U.S. Senate, I was one of \nonly seven female Senators, and if the Senate was a men's club, then \nthe Appropriations Committee was its inner sanctum.\n  There was not a single woman on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, but that is where I wanted to serve.\n  I explained to Senator Stevens--who was then the ranking member of \nthe committee--that Texas has more Army soldiers than any other State, \nmore Air Force airmen and women stationed in Texas than any other \nState, and our defense industry builds everything from fighter aircraft \nto Army trucks to artillery systems to sophisticated electronics \nequipment for the Pentagon.\n  Therefore, I hoped to be able to serve on that committee.\n  After some careful thought, Senator Stevens agreed, and welcomed me \nto the Committee.\n  Senator Stevens has been known to show dramatic performances on the \nSenate floor, keeping wandering eyes focused on the urgent issues that \nneed to be addressed.\n  One day, during a mark-up in the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, who chaired the committee at the time, grew very \nanimated and laid down the law.\n  When a frustrated senior Senator told Senator Stevens that ``there \nwas no reason to lose your temper,'' Senator Stevens glared back and \nresponded, ``I never lose my temper. I always know exactly where I left \nit.''\n  Senator Stevens acknowledges his quick temper; but those who know him \nsee the other side--a compassionate heart.\n  I will never forget when a group of protestors gathered outside of \nthe Appropriations Committee conference to demand increased funding for \nbreast cancer research.\n  One particularly agitated advocate got in Senator Stevens' face and \nsaid, ``If men were dying of breast cancer, you wouldn't think twice \nabout increasing the funding.''\n  Needless to say, those words made quite an impact on Senator Stevens, \nbut probably not what this advocate anticipated.\n  When Senator Stevens walked back into the conference, he repeated the \ncharge and then looked around at his mostly male colleagues.\n  He knew that at least 6 of them suffered from prostate cancer.\n  He also noticed that the bill they were considering didn't fund \nprostate cancer research.\n  But thanks to the excellent suggestion of the woman in the hallway, \nhe became an advocate for breast cancer research and prostate cancer \nresearch. Senator Stevens became a leader on these issues.\n  He has been a champion of a strong national defense and of the men \nand women who serve in the military.\n  I wish him and his family the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S594-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CRISIS IN GAZA\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, when President Obama is sworn into office \nnext week, he will inherit an extremely complex and challenging crisis \nin the Middle East. Since Israel commenced military operations in Gaza \nto defend its citizens against rocket attacks more than 1,000 have died \nin Gaza, many of them civilians, while 13 Israelis have died. In spite \nof this carnage, Hamas refuses to surrender and continues to fire \nrockets into Israel. No clear resolution is in sight.\n  As a practicing physician, I find this conflict heartbreaking. \nIsraelis live in constant fear that a rocket attack will snuff out an \ninnocent life. Families in Israel go to bed at night wondering if a \nrocket will slam into their home. At the same time, Palestinians have \nnowhere to run from a terrorist organization that uses its own \ncivilians as human shields.\n  While we all mourn the loss of innocent life, the world must \nrecognize that Hamas deliberately created a situation in which Israel \nwas forced to respond as any sovereign nation would while under attack. \nIsrael, and every nation, has the right to self-defense.\n  What makes Hamas's actions particularly abhorrent and barbaric is the \nfact that they are making decisions, I believe, based on a perverse \npolitical calculation. While publically condemning Israel, Hamas's \nleaders and sympathizers in Iran and elsewhere privately welcome the \nsuffering of the Palestinian people as a political opportunity. Hamas \nknows better than anyone that virtually every area of the densely \npopulated Gaza strip is a civilian area. In Gaza, refugees have no \nplace to seek refuge. The terrible unintended consequences and loss of \ncivilian life we've seen in Gaza is part of Hamas's design and goal.\n  The United States and the next administration can play an important \nrole in preventing Hamas from achieving its goals. What many on both \nsides long for is not just the cessation of violence but a real, \nlasting and durable peace. Some believe this is impossible, but it is \nin the interest of all sides to work toward this goal.\n  I trust President-elect Obama will avoid the false choice between \nunapologetically defending Israel's security and creating hope and \nopportunity for people on both sides of the conflict who want the same \ndegree of freedom, peace and opportunity for themselves and their \nchildren. As Israel's most important ally, the United States should \nnever waver in our commitment to Israel's security. The strength of \nthat assurance is itself one of our most important contributions in the \nregion because it creates the security and stability that are a \nprerequisite for meaningful negotiations.\n  At the same time, we enhance security in the region by assuring \nPalestinians in Gaza with our words and actions that they are not \nforgotten and that we hear their calls for peace and an end to \nviolence. I've delivered 4,000 babies and I grieve with the pregnant \nwomen in Gaza who are being turned away at hospitals because their own \nleaders have held their lives and the lives of their children in \ncontempt. The next administration can legitimize and support those \nmothers' pleas for peace while condemning and marginalizing Hamas's \ntactics of terror.\n  I believe President-elect Obama has the judgment and temperament to \nnot only maintain our vital support of Israel, but to also create hope \nin the region and help Palestinians embrace alternatives to Hamas's \nbrand of violence and despair. He will have my prayers and support and \nI hope he can have the prayers and support of the American people as he \nconfronts this difficult challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S594-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S594-S596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses \nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Well, gas prices have a direct impact on my driving habits. \n     I have been trying to use the public bus at least twice a \n     week to get to work. It takes me about 35 minutes more each \n     way, but if I plan my after work errands needing a car for \n     one day, then I can bank that extra time for the bus ride. \n     I'm lucky to live in Boise where there is some type of public \n     transportation. My husband works the night shift in Meridian, \n     so he is forced to use the car. The cost of food is a \n     shocker, but again, fuel costs have contributed to that also. \n     There are more of the basic and less of the goodies at the \n     checkout. I do not think our family will be flying anytime \n     soon, and if we vacation somewhere besides home, it will \n     still be within a short day's drive. All in all, I worry more \n     about those families who were barely surviving before, what \n     will become of them now?\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\n       I think it is important to give tax breaks to companies, \n     small or large, who want to develop alternative energy \n     technologies. There are a great number of really smart people \n     out there, I saw a man who could burn salt water and create \n     enough energy to light a bulb. And how about the farmer who \n     did something to his engine (in his garage workshop) to get \n     80 MPG. It is especially important to keep this technology \n     and the subsequent jobs it brings here in the United States. \n     If congress won't address these issues in a timely way, \n     countless other countries will once again, get the jobs. And \n     continue to give taxpayers incentives through tax breaks for \n     purchasing fuel efficient cars, energy saving appliances, \n     solar heating, etc. My family would purchase these products, \n     but the cost is often prohibitive. There are hungry buyers \n     just waiting and the cost will come down as more products are \n     sold. It just needs a jumpstart with federal funding, then it \n     will take off on its own. Do not do anything to lessen the \n     impact of gas prices. Only with higher prices will habits \n     change and new technologies emerge. The lesson is hard, but \n     the end result will be worth it. Get rid of government \n     supported Ethanol--it takes as much energy to make the stuff \n     compared to what it saves.\n       And, let us build those super fast trains to at least run \n     along the cities on the Eastern and Western coasts. Again, \n     more jobs building trains, maintaining equipment, \n     contributing to a better economy. We can either spend tax \n     money on more roads for more gas eating cars or supplementing \n     energy efficient systems, good for the environment, the \n     economy and the pocketbook.\n       We took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle, it was $29, but \n     again it took 3 hours! What if it took 45 minutes? There were \n     many business people on board, I think more people would be \n     willing to use this type of transportation if it was timely. \n     Time is money these days. And please give more money to small \n     urban cities like Boise to develop light rail systems. The \n     intercounty van ridership from Caldwell and Nampa to Boise \n     has become so popular. ValleyBUS is adding more vans to the \n     routes. A light rail system would work in the Boise Valley. \n     And replace the aging buses. In the month I have ridden the \n     bus, I have experienced at least two breakdowns. The buses \n     are purchased used and these are so old, parts are very hard \n     to come by. And allow some drilling and mining, I heard it \n     will be 7-10 years before a domestic supply will be \n     available, so it will not be the cure some think it will be. \n     Do not allow exemptions which were originally for farm \n     vehicles to be expanded to include cars with a like build, \n     like Hummers. That is cheating. Make the car companies raise \n     the MPG even higher. I read that China has tougher rules \n     for gas mileage than we do. And, the American people are \n     going to have to make hard choices. Cheap fuel is never \n     going to happen again, at least not for years. We ignored \n     the warnings during the Carter years, when gas prices were \n     high; we need to change our enormous appetites for \n     oversized everything, from cars to houses to McDonalds. We \n     would all be better off to bike, walk and move to smaller \n     houses where families actually live in the ``living'' room \n     and see each other. I grew up with one car for our entire \n     family! Could that happen in American society today? I \n     doubt it. Maybe it is time we Americans face the \n     consequences of our greed. It could be a humbling lesson, \n     something we might just need.\n       And, to pay for all this? Get out of Iraq and rebuild the \n     United States of America. You cannot make a democracy with \n     just an election. Our own great country functioned without a \n     strong federal government or President for some 10 years \n     after defeating the British. I think it was luck we became \n     the greatest democracy ever, but lots of hard work to stay \n     that way. Is Iraq able and willing to do the hard work? I do \n     not think it is possible. We destroyed the stability in the \n     Middle East and now it is a worse mess for our meddling. Do \n     not allow another son or daughter or sister or brother or \n     husband or wife to be killed, let them come home.\n     Donna Lam, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello Senator Mike Crapo, I am a 29 year old, single woman \n     that is trying to do things right.

I am afraid that \n     if something is not done soon, that I am going to start \n     loosing everything I have worked for. I used to spend about \n     $30.00 for gas a week now it is almost $70.00. I live in \n     Emmett in the city limits and the water is horrible, so I \n     have to buy water just to drink (it turned my cat dish \n     black). I have complained to the city but it is going on 1 \n     year of having to buy water. Everything cost, what are the \n     citizens expose to do?\n       Thank you for your time,\n     Alyssa Quenzer.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is in response to your request for citizens to ``share \n     your energy stories.''\n       Here are some of the results I am observing, of gas being \n     more expensive: Traffic is (slightly) down on the overcrowded \n     roads in and around Boise. People are getting rid of their \n     gas-guzzlers and getting more economical modes of \n     transportation. People are making more responsible \n     transportation choices. (Dare I say it? Might they even \n     consider car-pooling, or utilizing public transportation?) \n     Air pollution is down. There is some real market-driven \n     innovation going on, in the automotive world.\n       In other words, the results of higher fuel prices are not \n     all negative! Please think long and hard before getting the \n     government more involved! (In the past, it has not always had \n     the desired effect.)\n       If you could figure out some way to give the freight \n     industry some relief, that would be a good thing. But let the \n     free market run its course with regards to personal \n     transportation, I say. If our economy is based on every \n     citizen 16 and over having a private motor vehicle and \n     unlimited access to cheap fuel . . . it is a house of cards.\n       Like everybody else, we in my family are affected by rising \n     fuel prices, and are needing to be more responsible with our \n     transportation. Is that a bad thing?\n       (Full disclosure: I've been a dedicated user of bicycle \n     transportation since 1986. Gas was 97 cents back then. It \n     makes even more sense in 2008 for my fellow citizens to \n     seriously consider their own transportation choices, than it \n     did back in 1986.)\n       Thanks for your attention.\n                                       Steve Hulme, 4th-generation\n     Taxpaying Idaho Citizen, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My biggest concern is the lack of balance with the cost of \n     living and the working wages. Cost of living is increasing \n     faster than employers/corporations are able (or willing) to \n     keep up with. I am very worried about the near future. With \n     two kids to raise, trying to keep them involved in sports and \n     other extra-curricular activities is becoming more of a \n     challenge. I do not want to be forced to make a decision of \n     gas in the car to get my kids to and from or my children's \n     well-being.\n       What Americans want are politicians who do what they say \n     they will do. Not empty promises to get into office. At what \n     cost does it come? Our children, our future.\n       Why do these power companies continue to get approvals for \n     price increases? Who is benefiting from this? If the \n     Government doesn't think we are in a recession now, just \n     wait, it is just around the corner. I know for my family as \n     well as many other families, spending is no longer frivolous, \n     let us-treat-ourselves-for-our-hard-work spending, it is \n     thought through heavily. We have no choice.\n       With the wealth of our country, there should not be the \n     amount of homeless (or soon-to-be) people due to lack of \n     money/resources to keep a roof over their heads and food on \n     the table. I am ashamed at the direction our country has \n     taken. Now I see it only getting worse.\n       I was visiting with a fellow co-worker today who helps feed \n     those not necessarily homeless but left with little to no \n     money left after paying bills at the end of the month for \n     food. She collects food like a shelter, from local \n     businesses, then disburses the food accordingly. In just two \n     weeks time, the number of people she serves/helps went from \n     92 to 120. Unfortunately she was unable to help them all, not \n     enough food due to a decrease in donations.\n       Something has got to give and it should no longer be the \n     American people/families! Instead, we need to be at the \n     receiving end. Help our own in this country to survive.\n     A very concerned Mom.\n                                  ____\n\n       Good day Mike, my story is: I am a 50 year old disabled \n     woman; my income is social security of 671.00 plus an arrears \n     child support order from 1992 in which I receive 201.00 a \n     month in 50.34 weekly payments. I am almost over the limit \n     for Idaho Medicaid and am what is called the QM plan. I have \n     no dental and no vision. Part D helps with prescriptions and \n     Medicare pays some. I am eligible for about 10.00 in food \n     stamps which I do not collect because at my last \n     recertification, I just could not justify the gas and time \n     for the 10.00 that really is not that helpful. It has been a \n     very cold winter; my energy cost in the trailer I own and \n     only pay lot rent for [cheap housing], have made my life very \n     hard; I have had to choose between power and food for months \n     since October to be exact, my electric and gas have been \n     between 250.00 & 300.00, finally my energy due on the 20th of \n     June is 107.00, last year it was 65.00 or so this time of \n     year. I have a 20 year old daughter that lives at home and \n     goes to LCSC full time thank you Lord for grants and loans. I \n     cannot remember the last time I went to the grocery store and \n     bought food, we live out of food banks and milk has become a \n     luxury, from Walmart. Our 2 dogs' food comes from the humane \n     society. My car is always on empty; 2.5 gallons of gas is \n     10.00. Please help us up the food stamp limit; disabled \n     people should not have to worry about food, how about a fixed \n     amount for disabled people comparable to their income, lower \n     energy prices, fixed prices for energy to heat disabled \n     people's homes. I do not mind paying my own power but up to \n     or over \\1/2\\ of my monthly income. Help. Thank You:\n     Deb.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a solution to today's obscene fuel prices, a lot of \n     people talk about expanding domestic production. What nobody \n     realizes is that the same people who would be drilling for \n     and producing this oil are the same people who are currently \n     holding us up at the pump. Think about it: If Chevron/Texaco \n     can sell us gasoline at $4.00 a gallon, does it\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n     make sense for them to invest millions (probably billions) of \n     dollars in the exploration and production of increased oil \n     supplies so in order to sell us gasoline at $2.50 a gallon? \n     Spend money to reduce profits? If Ford were selling all the \n     new F-150 pickups they could produce for $30,000 each, would \n     they spend billions to expand their assembly line so they \n     could sell 25 percent more trucks for $22,500 each? Of course \n     not, they would keep the price at $30,000 and enjoy the \n     increased profits. And the oil companies will do the same \n     thing. Increasing oil supplies will only give the big oil \n     companies more oil to sell at $120 a barrel and will not \n     drive the price at the pump down one bit.\n       There's no competition in the oil industry, the regulating \n     bodies have allowed too many mergers resulting in a few \n     super-companies that are all in bed together. The only way \n     you could make an idea like dramatically expanding domestic \n     production work is if you started a completely new, \n     independent company to find and extract the new oil, then \n     build new refineries to turn it into a usable product, then \n     build an entirely new distribution infrastructure to get the \n     product to the consumers. That would cost trillions of \n     dollars and it will never happen.\n       Gasoline costs $4.00 a gallon because we are still buying \n     it at $4.00 a gallon. That is the simple truth. Our country's \n     entire infrastructure depends on gas and diesel engines in \n     cars, trucks, planes, and ships to get products and people \n     from Point A to Point B. And I will be the first one to \n     admit, I am not prepared to quit driving my car, so I am as \n     much a part of the problem as anyone. But short of a federal \n     cap on consumer gasoline and diesel fuel prices, competition \n     and reduced demand are the only things that will drive down \n     the price of retail gasoline. Until that happens, we are just \n     hosed.\n     Carl Bloomquist, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       First I would like to thank you for taking the time to \n     listen to the people on this subject.\n       Our brief story: 6 months ago we had two cars and a truck. \n     We could not afford to drive the truck any longer so we sold \n     it and paid off one of our cars. That helped for a while but \n     the gas prices kept creeping up. I work downtown and we are \n     fortunate enough to live close to a bus route. Now I pay \n     $36.00 for a monthly Valley Ride pass and I ride the bus \n     every day. That takes an additional hour of time a day but \n     now we save close to $100.00 a month in gas by doing that. \n     But the gas prices are still climbing and might reach $5.00 \n     per gallon. Now we have two cars and one sits in the \n     driveway. So now we are thinking seriously about selling the \n     car that is paid off and paying down the loan on the other \n     car. I am also thinking seriously of buying a bicycle and \n     gearing up to commute on a bicycle to work. This will help me \n     get in shape as well as help keep the environment clean.\n       So . . . In a matter of a few months we went from three \n     vehicles down to (most likely) one vehicle and riding \n     bicycles. We are sick and tired of the prices (fuel and food) \n     continuing to creep up and refuse to put up with it anymore.\n       We want to make a trip to Bend Oregon to visit our \n     grandchildren but we cannot afford to do that this month. We \n     will have to save another $100 and do that at the end of next \n     month. We all work too hard to ``try'' and make ends meet to \n     have to make decisions between gasoline and grandchildren.\n       So maybe someone will hear our story and something can be \n     done about this.\n       Thank you again for listening.\n     Michael Viscetto.\n                                  ____\n\n       I strongly disagree with your stand on the climate change \n     bill that recently was defeated in filibuster action \n     recently. I was very disappointed in your vote. These are \n     measures that need to be made for our environment, and for \n     our economy.\n       Trying to open federal wildlife reserves to more drilling \n     is not the answer. There is not enough oil there to make a \n     difference in the world price of oil and gas. (And I say this \n     as someone who owns lots of stock in oil, gas, and oil \n     service industry companies.) We instead need to focus on \n     making alternative, non-CO2 emitting fuels. I do \n     agree with your support for nuclear energy, solar and wind \n     power. With the coming development of electric powered \n     vehicles, these will greatly decrease the use of gasoline, \n     which is the best way to bring about a price drop--which will \n     make a climate change bill that much more important.\n     Mitch Long, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Not sure where to begin. It is very hard for us to live \n     right now with both the cost of fuel rising, and the cost of \n     food rising. My husband served this country for 22 years in \n     the Military until he became injured, and was unable to do \n     his duties anymore as a military man. He went back to school, \n     thanks to the VA, and is now a board certified respiratory \n     therapist. He is still looking for a job at this point and \n     time. I have faith he will find one soon because we live \n     payday to payday, and there are times when we do not have \n     enough to pay the bills we have because I went to the store, \n     or put gas in my car. So I also have to make a choice as to \n     put gas in the car, or go to the grocery store. But you have \n     to have gas in the car to get to the store. Living off of \n     potatoes, and macaroni cheese is getting old. And every where \n     you look there are commercials telling you to eat right. How \n     can a person eat right when you can't afford the food in the \n     first place? Plus with all of my doctor bills and the amount \n     of medication I am on does not help either. I struggle \n     everyday wondering what am I going to feed my family today, \n     and I wonder what is really going to happen to us.\n     Tammy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Rather than a story I would like to offer a suggestion. My \n     suggestion is that Congress should put in place requirements \n     for oil companies to begin placing hydrogen fueling options \n     at their stations nationwide. Consumers should be offered \n     incentives for purchasing H cell cars.

ROBERT J. SMITHDAS\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \ninspirational New Yorker, Dr. Robert J. Smithdas, on the occasion of \nhis retirement as Director of Community Education at the Helen Keller \nNational Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults, HKNC, in Sands Point, \nLI.\n  At the age of four, Dr. Robert J. Smithdas contracted meningitis, \nwhich resulted in the total loss of his vision and, over a short period \nof time, the total loss of his hearing. After graduating Perkins School \nfor the Blind in Watertown, MA, in 1945, he was accepted for training \nat the Industrial Home for the Blind, IHB, located in Brooklyn, NY, and \nreceived a fellowship to attend St. John's University in New York. He \nreceived his BA degree cum laude in 1950, and 3 years later became the \nfirst person who is deaf-blind to earn a master's degree, receiving \nthis distinction at New York University where he specialized in \nvocational guidance and rehabilitation for people with disabilities. \nDr. Smithdas is also the recipient of four honorary Doctoral degrees \nfrom: Gallaudet University, Western Michigan University, Mount Aloysius \nCollege and, his alma mater, St. John's.\n  Dr. Smithdas continued his work with important and significant \ncontributions in the field of rehabilitation, having successively \noccupied important management positions at the IHB, including that of \nassociate director of services for the deaf-blind in charge of overall \nclient services.\n  Along with Helen Keller and Peter Salmon, Dr. Smithdas played a vital \nrole in the development of legislation enacted as part of the \nVocational Rehabilitation Act. The act authorized the establishment of \nthe Helen Keller National Center, which is operated by Helen Keller \nServices for the Blind under an agreement with the U.S. Department of \nEducation's Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services.\n  A true ``Renaissance man,'' Dr. Smithdas' numerous national awards \ninclude being named the Poetry Society of America's ``Poet of the \nYear,'' 1960-61, ``The Handicapped American of the Year,'' 1965, by the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nCommittee on Employment of People Who Are Disabled and inducted into \nthe National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities, 1988. He has \nserved on many national committees and boards whose emphasis is \ndirected towards rehabilitation services. He and his wife, the former \nMichelle Craig, an instructor at the Helen Keller National Center and \nalso deaf-blind, have appeared on nationally broadcast television and \nradio programs.\n  Dr. Smithdas has lectured widely and fascinated countless audiences \nwith the recounting of his own adjustment to deaf-blindness while \nworking to improve opportunities for others to lead full and productive \nlives. On behalf of all New Yorkers, I feel privileged to have the \nopportunity to commend the outstanding achievements of Dr. \nSmithdas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S597-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S597-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/15/senate-section/article/S597-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n   ORIGINALLY DECLARED ON JANUARY 23, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN \n TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS--PM 3\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

As we \nprepare to pass this noble charge to a new team of leaders, we can look \nback with satisfaction on what we have achieved together as a Nation. \nFrom community coalitions to our international partnerships, we pursued \na balanced strategy that emphasized stopping initiation, reducing drug \nabuse and addiction, and disrupting drug markets.\n  The results of our efforts are clear. Together we have helped reduce \nteenage drug use by 25 percent since 2001. This means 900,000 fewer \nAmerican teens are using drugs. The Access to Recovery program alone \nhas extended treatment services to more than 260,000 Americans. Through \nlaw enforcement cooperation and international partnerships, the United \nStates has caused serious disruptions in the availability of drugs such \nas cocaine and methamphetamine, reducing the threat such drugs pose to \nthe American people, while also denying profits to drug traffickers and \nterrorists.\n  Our work is by no means complete--we must build on these efforts both \nto further reduce drug use and to rise to new challenges.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 252. a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance the \ncapacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain \nnurses and other critical health-care professionals, to improve the \nprovision of health care veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which is \ndrawn in large measure from S. 2969, the proposed Veterans' Health Care \nAuthorization Act, as reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nlast Congress.\n  VA faces a looming shortage of health care personnel. Without \nconcerted and timely action, this situation will only worsen in the \nyears ahead. This is especially true as more Iraq and Afghanistan \nveterans return home injured and in need of new and specialized care. \nIn order to avert this problem, VA must be able to offer competitive \nsalaries, work schedules, and benefits. The provisions in the bill I am \nintroducing will allow VA to recruit and retain nurses, home health \naides, and specialty care providers.\n  This bill also contains measures that would improve the efficiency of \nhealth care delivery to veterans, including a number of pilot programs \ndesigned to help VA find new and innovative ways to deliver better, \nfaster, and more comprehensive treatment.\n  Women make up an ever growing percentage of the Armed Forces. As \nsuch, they are also making up an ever growing percentage of the veteran \npopulation. While there have been efforts over the years to address the \nunique needs of women veterans, there is much more that VA might do. To \nthat end, there are provisions in this bill to address current \nshortcomings and help VA better respond to the increased demand for \ncare from women veterans. I particularly thank Senator Murray for her \nleadership on this issue.\n  One of the most troubling and difficult challenges of warfare, which \ncan be seen particularly in the current conflicts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, is diagnosing and treating those who suffer from the \ninvisible wounds of war. The lack of understanding of these injuries, \nthe stigma associated with them, and many other factors make effective \ntreatment difficult. Last Congress, legislation I authored, the \nVeterans Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act, was enacted as \nPublic Law 110-387. This Congress, I seek to improve upon those \nadvances, and to continue to provide accessible, cutting-edge care for \nthose afflicted with invisible wounds. This bill would expand \neligibility and authority for the Vet Centers to provide needed \nservices, and would commission a comprehensive study on suicides among \nveterans so that we can improve efforts to prevent such tragedies.\n  This bill will also provide support for homeless veterans through a \nproposed series of innovative pilot programs. These programs are \ndesigned to significantly improve VA outreach to these veterans, in \norder to help them access the benefits and services provided by VA.\n  I look forward to working with all of our colleagues to bring this \nlegislation to the full Senate for consideration early in this Session. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of home infusion therapy under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Lincoln of Arkansas, to introduce the Medicare Home Infusion \nCoverage Act. As we do so, we recognize that Medicare has serious \nfiscal challenges. Currently, the Part A, Hospital, Trust Fund faces \ninsolvency in 2019, when expenditures will exceed projected \ncontributions and require additional taxpayer support to maintain the \ncare required by our seniors and so many disabled Americans. At the \nsame time, today Medicare beneficiaries struggle under the burden of \npaying nearly half of their health care costs. So the legislation we \nare re-introducing is vital to addressing the fiscal issues affecting \nMedicare.\n  Many serious conditions--including some cancers and drug-resistant \ninfections--require the use of infusion therapy. Such treatment \ninvolves the administration of medication directly into the bloodstream \nvia a needle or catheter. Specialized equipment, supplies, and \nprofessional services--such as sterile drug compounding, care \ncoordination, and patient education and monitoring--are components of \nsuch therapy. Infusion treatment is an extensive medical treatment \noften lasting for several hours per day over a 6-to-8 week period.\n  The unfortunate fact is that under current Medicare rules, patients \nrequiring infusion therapy must either bear that cost themselves or \nendure costly and unnecessary hospitalization in order to receive \ncoverage--raising costs for both beneficiaries and Medicare alike. \nCurrent Medicare regulations authorize payment for infusion drugs, but \ndo not pay for the services, equipment, and supplies necessary to \nsafely provide infusion therapy in the home. Not surprisingly, even \nthough home infusion therapy may cost as little as $100 a day, too few \nseniors can bear that cost.\n  The result is that patients are excessively hospitalized, producing \ncosts of treatment as much as 10-20 times higher than treatment in the \nhome. The process may even place the patient's health in jeopardy \nbecause unnecessary hospitalization places individuals at risk of \nexposure to a health care-acquired infection--which may be drug \nresistant and life-threatening.\n  Private health plans have long understood that home infusion therapy \nis not only less costly, but safer as well. Thus, private insurance \ncoverage for home infusion therapy is common. Private plans also \nrecognize that patients benefit from avoiding hospitalization. At home \nthey have a familiar, comfortable environment with their family \nconveniently at hand--no small concerns when fighting a serious \nillness.\n  It is clear we must change the status quo, and achieve safer, more \ncost-effective treatment. By extending coverage of infusion therapy to \nthe home, we will correct this inappropriate and unnecessary gap in \nMedicare coverage and take a significant step in reducing Medicare \ncosts. This legislation offers an alternative to allowing our Medicare \nbeneficiaries to be overcome with health care costs that are rising \nfaster than inflation by reforming care delivery to emphasize high \nquality, lower cost services.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in support of this legislation so \nwe may further the goals of improving patient safety and reducing our \nescalating health care costs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the ability to combat methamphetamine; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenators Kyl, Reid, Durbin, McConnell, Bingaman, Ensign, Schumer, \nInhofe, McCaskill, Kerry, Bayh, Alexander, Grassley, Nelson of Florida, \nJohnson, and Cantwell the Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of \n2009.\n  This Act is designed to address problems that the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, has identified in the implementation of the Combat \nMethamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. I was pleased to join former \nSenator Talent in drafting, introducing, and securing the passage of \nthe original bill. I am pleased to introduce this legislation today to \nensure that it operates as Congress intended.\n  The bill that I introduce today would clarify that all retailers, \nincluding mail order retailers, who sell products that contain \nchemicals often used to make methamphetamine--like ephedrine, \npseudoepedrine and phenylpropanolamine--must self-certify that they \nhave trained their personnel and will comply with the Combat Meth Act's \nrequirements; require distributors to sell these products only to \nretailers who have certified that they will comply with the law; \nrequire the DEA to publish the list of all retailers who have filed \nself-certifications, on the DEA's website; and clarify that any \nretailer who negligently fails to file self-certification as required, \nmay be subject to civil fines and penalties.\n  The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act that we passed in 2006 has \nbeen a resounding success. The number of methamphetamine labs in the \nUnited States has declined dramatically now that the ingredients used \nto make methamphetamine are harder to get.\n  The Combat Meth Act that became effective in September 2006 included \nimportant new provisions for retailer self-certification, employee \ntraining, requiring products to be placed behind counters, packaging \nrequirements, required sales logbooks, and limits on the amounts that a \nperson can purchase in a given day and over a 30-day period.\n  Now, because of that law's implementation, the number of \nmethamphetamine labs decreased from about 12,000 labs to about 7,300 \nlabs a 41 percent decrease in just 1 year. Once the bill was enacted \ninto law, the number of meth ``super labs'' in my home State of \nCalifornia declined from 30 in 2005 to only 17 in 2006.\n  Fewer meth labs means more than just less illegal drug production. \nAccording to the Fresno Bee, the DEA has noted that in 2003, 3,663 \nchildren were reported exposed to toxic meth labs nationwide but that \nnumber had been reduced to 319 in 2006.\n  So things are moving in the right direction, and that is good news. \nBut with more thousands of methamphetamine labs still operating in the \nU.S., and children still being exposed to their toxins, it is also \nclear that there is still work to be done.\n  After the Combat Meth Act became law, DEA examined how the retailer \nself-certification process was working. On May 16, 2007, DEA sent \nletters to the 1,600 distributors who they believed were selling \nproducts that contained ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, asking them to \nturn over lists of the retail stores that they sell to, so that DEA \ncould check to see how many of those retailers had self-certified as \nthat law requires.\n  Rather than actively assisting the DEA in its efforts, about \\3/4\\ of \nthe distributors failed or declined to provide any information about \nthe retail stores.\n  The distributors who did cooperate provided DEA with the names of \n12,375 retail customers. When DEA checked those out, it found that \nabout 8,300 of those retail stores had never self-certified as the law \nrequires.\n  Based on these findings, the DEA estimates that nationwide, as many \nas 30,000 additional retail sellers of products are not complying with \nthe law.\n  In short, retailers' non-compliance with the self-certification \nrequirement appears to be widespread, and undercuts the effectiveness \nof the Combat Meth Act.\n  Unfortunately, there is no effective way for law enforcement to \ndetermine the universe of who is, and who is not, obeying the law. \nCurrently, there is no requirement that retailers notify the DEA before \nthey start selling products with these listed chemicals.\n  Retailers can likely avoid negative consequences if they are ever \nconfronted with their failure to self-certify. Currently, the law \nimposes sanctions only for willful and reckless refusals to self-\ncertify. There is no punishment available if a retailer negligently \nfails to self-certify as required. Not even civil sanctions are \navailable.\n  In short, without distributors restricting the supply of these \nproducts to retailers who have self-certified, retailers may simply \ntake their chances, rather than self-certifying as the law intended, \nfiguring that they'll never get caught, or if they do get caught, that \nthey will never be punished.\n  It is unacceptable that, over two years after the Combat Meth Act \nimposed this requirement and became fully effective, tens of thousands \nof retailers still are not following the law. It is unacceptable that \ndistributors of these products can continue to profit off of their \nsales to retailers who are not complying, or are even refusing to \ncomply with the law.\n  So this bill is designed to make the Combat Meth Act more effective, \nby putting in place a process that will ensure that every retailer who \norders these products that can be used to make methamphetamine must \ncomply with the law before they can get and resell the products.\n  First, it will require that all retail sellers of products with these \nlisted chemicals must file self-certifications, closing a loophole that \nnow exists for mail-order retailers.\n  Second, the DEA will be required to post all self-certified retailers \non its\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\nwebsite, so that advocacy groups and others who are concerned about \nmethamphetamine in their communities can identify retailers who are \nselling these products without complying with the law, and can notify \nthe authorities.\n  Third, distributors of these products will only be allowed to sell to \nretailers who have self-certified, which they will be able to verify by \nchecking the DEA's public website. Once recalcitrant retailers are \nfaced with the real and immediate economic consequence of a possible \ncut-off of their desire to purchase these products, I am confident that \nmost will file self-certifications as the law requires.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies that even a negligent failure to self-\ncertify, if proven, can give rise to civil sanctions.\n  This is a common-sense bill, designed to strengthen the \nimplementation of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act. This bill \nwould create incentives to ensure that the self-certification process \nof the law is made both effective and enforceable.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide \nenhanced penalties for marketing controlled substances to minors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenators Grassley and Bayh, the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of \n2009.\n  Over the last 2 years, Federal, State, and local law enforcement have \nincreasingly seen drug dealers flavoring and marketing their illegal \ndrugs to appeal to minors, using techniques like combing drugs with \ncandy and other flavorings to entice younger users. This bill would \nincrease the criminal penalties that apply when criminals do this. This \nbill will ensure these appalling tactics are criminalized and severely \npunished.\n  The problem of flavoring illegal drugs to entice minors is well \ndocumented. A 2007 USA Today Article entitled ``Flavored Meth Use on \nthe Rise'' stated that ``reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are \nemerging around the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse \nprevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger \npeople.''\n  The flavoring of meth to appeal to minors is widespread across the \nNation. In California, police have made repeated seizures of \nstrawberry-flavored meth and local drug counselors warn that it also \ncomes in cola, cherry, and orange flavors.\n  Strawberry flavoring packets were found in a meth lab raid in \nArkansas in May of 2007. Similar seizures of flavored meth have been \nmade in Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, \nOregon, and Virginia. Two people were arrested for manufacturing cotton \ncandy flavored meth in Colorado in March of 2008.\n  The candying and flavoring of controlled substances is not limited to \nmethamphetamine. As recently as March of this year, the DEA seized 1\\1/\n2\\ pounds of strawberry flavored powdered cocaine in Modesto, CA.\n  DEA agents in California have also purchased cocaine with lemon, \ncoconut, and cinnamon flavoring. It has also documented other \ncontrolled substances like marijuana and hash oil infused into candy \nbars and soda pop.\n  Drug dealers are even selling boxes of ``Pot Tarts'' that look \nexactly like commercial available Pop Tarts.\n  Federal, State and local law enforcement all agree that such \nflavoring is done to entice more minors to use these illegal drugs.\n  This bill would help address this growing problem by criminalizing \nthe flavoring, coloring and marketing of such drugs and would impose \nenhanced penalties for these offenses.\n  Under current law, there is already an enhanced penalty if someone \ndistributes drugs to a minor. The maximum sentence is doubled, and \ntripled for a repeat offense, and there is a minimum of at least a year \nin prison. But this enhancement only applies if there is an actual \ndistribution of the drug to a minor. Even possession with intent to \ndistribute flavored or candied drugs doesn't qualify.\n  This bill would fix this loophole. If someone manufactures, creates, \ndistributes, or possesses with intent to distribute a schedule I or II \ncontrolled substance that is combined with a candy, marketed or \npackaged to appear similar to a candy product, or modified by flavoring \nor coloring with the intent to sell to a minor, they would face \nenhanced penalties.\n  The bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you \nflavor or candy up your drugs to make them more appealing to our \nchildren, there will be a very heavy price to pay. It will make drug \ndealers think twice before flavoring up their drugs, and punish them \nappropriately if they don't.\n  The bill is supported by the National Narcotics Officers Association \nCoalition, which is comprised of 44 State narcotics officers' \nassociations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 258\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

OFFENSES INVOLVING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES MARKETED TO \n                   MINORS.\n\n       Section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     841) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Offenses Involving Controlled Substances Marketed to \n     Minors.--\n       ``(1) Unlawful acts.--Except as authorized under this \n     title, including paragraph (3), it shall be unlawful for any \n     person at least 18 years of age to knowingly or intentionally \n     manufacture, create, distribute, dispense, or possess with \n     intent to manufacture, create, distribute, or dispense, a \n     controlled substance listed in schedule I or II that is--\n       ``(A) combined with a candy product;\n       ``(B) marketed or packaged to appear similar to a candy \n     product; or\n       ``(C) modified by flavoring or coloring the controlled \n     substance with the intent to distribute, dispense, or sell \n     the controlled substance to a person under 21 years of age.\n       ``(2) Penalties.--Except as provided in section 418, 419, \n     or 420, any person who violates paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall be subject to--\n       ``(A) 2 times the maximum punishment and at least 2 times \n     any term of supervised release authorized by subsection (b) \n     of this section for a first offense involving the same \n     controlled substance and schedule; and\n       ``(B) 3 times the maximum punishment and at least 3 times \n     any term of supervised release authorized by subsection (b) \n     of this section for a second or subsequent offense involving \n     the same controlled substance and schedule.\n       ``(3) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any \n     controlled substance that--\n       ``(A) has been approved by the Secretary under section 505 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), \n     if the contents, marketing, and packaging of the controlled \n     substance have not been altered from the form approved by the \n     Secretary; or\n       ``(B) has been altered at the direction of a practitioner \n     who is acting for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual \n     course of professional practice.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Brown, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Stabenow, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 260. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the taxation of income of controlled foreign corporations \nattributable to imported property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenator Mikulski and 10 of our colleagues that I hope will be added to \nany economic stimulus package considered by Congress in the coming \nweeks. This bill will put the brakes on a tax break granted to U.S. \ncompanies that move U.S. jobs offshore.\n  The U.S. economy is facing its most serious financial challenge since \nthe Great Depression, and we must respond aggressively. I think a new \neconomic stimulus plan is urgently needed to help prevent the economy \nfrom sliding deeper into a long-term recession. I agree with those who \nsay that a major goal of the stimulus package should be to create more \njobs, but I think we also have an opportunity to make a change to \nensure that we keep the jobs we already have.\n  Employers have been slashing jobs at an alarming rate--2.6 million \njobs last year--to reduce operating costs. The manufacturing and \nconstruction sectors have been particularly hard hit during this \ndownturn. The manufacturing sector laid off 791,000 workers in 2008, \ncontinuing the disturbing loss of more than 4 million U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs since the end of 2000. Federal tax laws have \ncontributed to this problem.\n  There is one thing that Congress can do immediately to stem the loss \nof more manufacturing jobs: repeal the perverse tax subsidy in the \nFederal Tax Code for U.S. companies that move manufacturing operations \nand American jobs overseas. Not only will this help keep good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs here at home, it will save American taxpayers more \nthan $15 billion in revenue over the next decade.\n  Unbelievably, there is an insidious tax subsidy that rewards U.S. \nfirms that move their production overseas and then turn around and \nimport those now foreign-made products back to the United States for \nsale. When a U.S. company closes down a U.S. manufacturing plant such \nas Huffy bicycles or Radio Flyer little red wagons, fires its American \nworkers and moves those good-paying jobs to China or other locations \nabroad, U.S. tax law actually provide those companies with a large tax \nbreak called deferral--allowing them to avoid paying any U.S. income \ntaxes on their foreign earnings until those profits are returned, if \never, to this country. If a company making the same product decides to \nstay in this country, on the other hand, it is required to pay \nimmediate U.S. taxes on the profits it earns here.\n  Repealing this jobs export tax subsidy will not hinder the ability of \nU.S. firms to compete against foreign competitors in foreign markets, \nas some special interests have claimed. It is targeted only to U.S. \nfirms that move production abroad and then turn around and ship those \nproducts back to this country for sale.\n  If there was ever a tax policy change that would help save U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs and should be part of a robust economic stimulus \nplan, this is it. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. \nWith a new Congress and administration in place, now is the time to \nkill this ill-advised tax subsidy once and for all. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this important tax policy matter in the \ncoming weeks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 264. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nencourage the use of certified health information technology by \nproviders in the Medicaid program and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the E-Centives \nAct, which will help ensure safety-net providers serving our most \nvulnerable citizens can acquire Health Information Technology, HIT.\n  As I have spoken about many times, HIT promises to transform the \ndelivery of health care in the United States, improving the overall \nefficiency and effectiveness of healthcare. Some specific quality \nimprovements that result from HIT include reduction in errors that come \nfrom illegible handwriting; electronic systems that prompt prescription \nof generic rather than brand-name drugs; reduction in duplicate \ndiagnostic tests; physician reminders regarding appropriate preventive \ncare; clinical decision support systems that encourage use of evidence-\nbased medicine; identification of drug interactions and patient \nallergies; and assistance to physicians to manage patients with \ncomplex, chronic conditions.\n  While HIT holds great promise for transforming health care, \nunfortunately not all providers have the financial means to adopt and \nuse this technology. In fact, the cost of acquiring technology is a \nmajor barrier to adoption among health care providers. Cost is \nparticularly burdensome to small practices and safety-net providers \nthat often operate with low financial margins.\n  Several organizations, including the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid \nand the Uninsured and the Healthcare Information and Management Systems \nSociety, recognize the essential role that the Federal Government must \nplay to assist providers in the Medicaid and Children's Health \nInsurance Program, CHIP, to acquire HIT. But absent Federal funding, we \ncould see a ``digital divide'' in health care.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will help accelerate investment \nin certified HIT by providers predominantly serving Medicaid and CHIP \nbeneficiaries. The bill accomplishes this by providing authority to \nState Medicaid programs to reimburse providers at the enhanced SCHIP \nFMAP rate for the costs associated with the meaningful use of a \ncertified electronic medical record. This bill also helps streamline \nthe administration and enrollment process for the Medicaid program by \nmodifying the current regulation that governs the Medicaid Management \nInformation System to include funding for electronic information and \neligibility systems, patient registries for disease screening, and \noffice staff training on electronic information and eligibility \nsystems.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that all \nhealth\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\ncare providers and all Americans can see the benefit of health \ninformation technology. Widespread diffusion of HIT is a critical step \nin health care reform and making sure every American has the most \nefficient, optimal quality care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 267.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer and Year-Round Jobs \n     for Youth Stimulus Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUMMER AND YEAR-ROUND YOUTH JOBS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a $1,000,000,000 investment in summer and year-round \n     employment for youth, through the program supported under \n     this section, can create up to 1,000,000 jobs for \n     economically disadvantaged youth and stimulate local \n     economies;\n       (2) there is a serious and growing need for employment \n     opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth (including \n     young adults), as demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics stating that, in December 2008--\n       (A) the unemployment rate increased to 7.2 percent, as \n     compared to 4.9 percent in December 2007;\n       (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose to \n     20.8 percent, as compared to 16.9 percent in December 2007; \n     and\n       (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- to 19-\n     year-olds increased to 33.7 percent, as compared to 28 \n     percent in December 2007;\n       (3) research from Northwestern University has shown that \n     every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the \n     local economy;\n       (4) summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement \n     the income of families living in poverty;\n       (5) summer and year-round jobs for youth provide valuable \n     work experience for economically disadvantaged youth;\n       (6) often, a summer job provided under the Workforce \n     Investment Act of 1998 is an economically disadvantaged \n     youth's introduction to the world of work;\n       (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at \n     Northeastern University, early work experience is a very \n     powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor \n     market, and early work experience raises earnings over a \n     lifetime by 10 to 20 percent;\n       (8) participation in a youth jobs program can contribute to \n     a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior for youth; and\n       (9)(A) youth jobs programs benefit both youth and \n     communities when designed around principles that promote \n     mutually beneficial programs;\n       (B) youth benefit from jobs that provide them with work \n     readiness skills and that help them make the connection \n     between responsibility on the job and success in adulthood; \n     and\n       (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged \n     productively, providing much-needed services that meet real \n     community needs.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``green-collar \n     industries'' means industries throughout the economy of the \n     United States--\n       (1) that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation, \n     and environmental protection, including promoting renewable \n     energy and clean technology;\n       (2) that offer jobs with substantial pay and benefits;

A bill to provide funding for unemployment and training \nactivities for dislocated workers and adults, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Retooling America's Workers \n     for a Green Economy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In October 2008, the numbers of mass layoffs (involving \n     over 50 workers at one time) and initial unemployment claims \n     reached their highest levels since 2001. According to the \n     National Renewable Energy Laboratory, however, a major \n     barrier to more rapid adoption of clean and renewable energy \n     and energy efficiency measures is the lack of sufficient \n     workers skilled in green technology.\n       (2) In December 2008, unemployment figures showed a sharp \n     deterioration in the economy. The unemployment rate rose from \n     6.8 percent in November, to 7.2 percent in December, of 2008. \n     Employers shed 524,000 jobs in December 2008, and 1,900,000 \n     jobs were lost over just the last 4 months of 2008. These job \n     losses were widespread across most major industry sectors.\n       (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 11,100,000 \n     people were unemployed in December 2008, an increase of \n     3,600,000 people since the recession started in December \n     2007. In December 2008, the number of workers who wanted to \n     work full-time but worked part-time because their hours were \n     cut or they could not find full-time jobs reached 8,000,000, \n     up 3,400,000 since December 2007.\n       (4) Analysts say that the Nation has yet to see the worst \n     of the economic fallout. The latest prediction from HIS \n     Global Insight forecasts that unemployment will be an \n     estimated 8.6 percent by the end of 2009.\n       (5) The reality of climate change and a shared desire to \n     protect the environment for future generations have the \n     potential to spur economic growth in green-collar jobs across \n     the industrial spectrum. In order to prepare United States \n     workers to build greener communities in both urban and rural \n     settings, the Nation will need to make an investment in \n     skills development for jobs in the current and future \n     economies.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to retool America's workers--\n     including dislocated workers, those who are long-term \n     unemployed individuals, and those who are low-skilled \n     individuals, limited English proficient individuals, \n     individuals with disabilities, or older workers--for green-\n     collar industries, for existing viable industries, and for \n     new and emerging industries so that the workers described in \n     this section can contribute to the long-term competitiveness \n     of the United States and its quality of life.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for programs that reduce the need for \nabortion, help women bear healthy children, and support new parents; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n   Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a member of \nthe American family for whom we all care, but for whom we don't do \nnearly enough to support: pregnant women.\n  I remember the times my wife Terese learned she was pregnant, and \neven though I can never experience it directly, I know through her and \nmy sisters that there is one indelible and unforgettable moment when a \nwoman finds out she is pregnant. For many women, this is a moment of \ngreat joy, the miracle of pregnancy. Perhaps it has been long awaited \nor perhaps it is something of a surprise, but it is welcome. Many of \nthese women don't need help beyond what their families provide and \nothers may receive adequate support within our existing framework of \nprograms and services.\n  But there is another circumstance that a pregnant woman may face. For \nthat woman, the moment of discovery is not a moment of joy. For her, it \nis a moment of terror, or panic or even shame. She may be in a doctor's \noffice or clinic or she may be at home. For her, that moment begins a \ncrisis in which she feels overwhelmingly and perhaps almost unbearably \nalone. She could be wealthy, middle income or poor, but most likely \npoor. Whatever her income, she feels, very simply, all alone.\n  A pregnant woman may have an abusive spouse or boyfriend who is \ntormenting her. She is all alone.\n  Another pregnant woman may believe that she cannot support or care \nfor a new baby at this point in her life. She is all alone.\n  Another woman might believe that her financial situation is so \nprecarious that she cannot care for and raise a child. She may feel \nalone and helpless.\n  We know that 48 percent of all pregnancies are unintended and, \nexcluding miscarriages, 54 percent of unintended pregnancies end in \nabortion. The response ``cannot afford a baby'' is the second most \nfrequently cited reason why women choose to have an abortion and 73 \npercent of women having abortions cited this reason as a contributing \nfactor.\n  A woman who is facing the challenges of an unplanned pregnancy that \nmay be a crisis for her does not need a lecture from a politician or a \nclinical reminder that she has a simple choice to make. The choice is \nnever simple. Never. This woman needs support and love and \nunderstanding. She needs to be embraced in her time of crisis, not sent \non her way to deal with it on her own. She needs our help to walk with \nher, not only throughout the nine months of her pregnancy, but also for \nthe early months and years of her child's life.\n  We in the Congress, in both the House and Senate and both parties, \nneed to address this issue in a comprehensive way that meets these \nneeds. Some members have initiated good efforts and we should applaud \nand support those efforts, but I believe that neither political party \nis doing enough for pregnant women in America today. While there is \ntremendous disagreement on how we can best do this, there is one \nsignificant area of common ground--one thing we all agree upon. We all \nwant to reduce the number of abortions.\n  Many women who have abortions do so very reluctantly, and while \n``choice'' is a term that is widely used in this debate, many women who \nface unplanned pregnancies do not feel they have a genuine choice. That \nis why I am introducing the Pregnant Women Support Act. With this bill, \nit is my fervent hope that a new dialogue--a common ground--will emerge \non how we can reduce abortions by offering pregnant women real choices:\n  This bill will: assist pregnant and parenting teens to finish high \nschool and prepare for college or vocational training; help pregnant \ncollege students stay in school, offering them counseling as well as \nassistance with continuing their education, parenting support and \nclasses, and child care assistance.\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\n  It will provide counseling and shelter to pregnant women in abusive \nrelationships who may be fearful of continuing a (pregnancy in a crisis \nsituation; establish a national toll-free number and public awareness \ncampaign to offer women support and knowledge about options and \nresources available to them when they face an unplanned pregnancy; give \nwomen free sonogram examinations by providing grants for the purchase \nof ultrasound equipment; provide parents with information about genetic \ndisability testing, including support for parents who receive a \ndiagnosis of Down Syndrome; ensure that pregnant women receive prenatal \nand postnatal care by eliminating pregnancy as a pre-existing condition \nin the individual healthcare market and also eliminating waiting \nperiods for women with prior coverage; increase funding for nurse home \nvisitation for pregnant and first time mothers. One example of this is \nthe Nurse-Family Partnership, an evidence-based program and national \nmodel in which nurses mentor young first-time and primarily low-income \nmothers, establishing a supportive relationship with both mother and \nchild.\n  Studies have shown this program to be both cost effective and hugely \nsuccessful in terms of life outcomes for both mothers and children; \nincrease funding for the Women, Infants and Children Program, providing \nnutrition assessment, counseling and education, obesity prevention, \nbreastfeeding support, prenatal and pediatric health care referrals, \nimmunization screening and referral, and a host of other services for \nmothers and children; expand nutritional support for low-income parents \nby increasing the income eligibility level for food stamps; increase \nfunding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, the primary \nsource of federal funding for child care assistance for low-income \nparents.\n   I introduce this bill with the deepest conviction that we can find \ncommon ground. I believe that we can transform this debate by focusing \nupon the issues that unite us, not the issues that divide us. It's well \nknown where I stand on these issues. I am a pro-life Democrat. I \nbelieve that life begins at conception and ends when we draw our last \nbreath. I believe that the role of government is to protect, enrich, \nand value life for everyone, at every moment, from beginning to end. \nAnd I believe that we as a nation have to do more to support women and \ntheir children when they are most vulnerable--during pregnancy and \nearly childhood.\n  I support family planning programs because they avoid what can be a \ndark moment, when a woman, often alone, faces a pregnancy she feels she \ncan't handle. I support family planning programs precisely because they \nreduce abortions. But that is not the issue I address today. Today, \nwith this bill, I am focused on the woman who is pregnant and I am \nasking a question we should all be asking: ``What more can I do?'' \n``What more can we do for pregnant women who need our help?''\n  I believe there is more common ground in America than we might \nrealize--if only we focus on how we can truly help and support women \nwho wish to carry their pregnancies to term and how we can give them \nand their babies what they really need to begin healthy and productive \nlives together.\n  For the past 35 years, the abortion issue has been used mostly as a \nway to divide people, even as the number of abortions remains \nunacceptably high. We have to find a better way. I believe the Pregnant \nWomen Support Act is part of that better way. We must work toward real \nsolutions to the issue of abortion by targeting the underlying factors \nthat often lead women to have abortions. This is precisely what the \nPregnant Women Support Act will do.\n  We need to walk in solidarity with pregnant women who face unplanned \npregnancies and who need our support and help, not our judgment. That \nis exactly what this bill does for that woman who finds herself alone \nas she faces what may be the most difficult experience of her entire \nlife: the woman who has no one to turn to for advice, for counsel, for \nsupport. I truly believe there are few things more terrifying than the \nprospect of supporting another human being when you have no support of \nyour own.\n  Reducing the number of abortions should not be a partisan issue. It \nshould not pit Democrats against Republicans. I seek. common ground. I \nask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in seeking real \nsolutions that will unite us in providing life with dignity, before and \nafter birth, for pregnant women, mothers and children. Surely we must \nall agree that no woman should ever have to face the crisis of an \nunplanned pregnancy alone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 270\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to ensure that all \nagreements, contracts, and transactions with respect to commodities are \ncarried out on a regulated exchange, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation--the \nDerivatives Trading Integrity Act--which calls for establishing \nstronger standards of openness, transparency and integrity in the \ntrading of financial swaps and other over-the-counter derivative \ncontracts as a critical step toward rebuilding and restoring confidence \nin the financial system. Over the years, the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission and laws enacted by Congress have allowed instruments that \nare in form and function futures contracts to be privately negotiated \nwithout the safeguards provided through trading on exchanges regulated \nby the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC.\n  The economic downturn in this country is forcing us to examine all \ncontributing factors to the crisis in our financial markets. By \nrestoring reasonable safeguards and regulation of swaps, including \ncredit default swaps, along with all other futures contracts, this \nlegislation will go a long way to restore confidence in the markets and \nreestablish soundness and integrity in the financial system. My bill \nwill end the unregulated ``casino capitalism'' that has engendered \ngreat risks in swaps trading. And it will bring these transactions out \ninto the sunlight where they can be monitored and appropriately and \nresponsibly regulated. This legislation will establish authority and \nsafeguards to ensure that parties can meet their obligations to manage \nand reduce danger and risk to the entire financial system and economy.\n  Virtually all contracts now commonly referred to as swaps fall under \nthe definition of futures contracts and function basically in the same \nmanner as futures contracts. This bill amends the Commodity Exchange \nAct to eliminate the distinctions in the regulatory treatment of \nfutures contracts among ``excluded'' and ``exempt'' commodities, and \nthe transactions in them, and regulated, exchange-traded commodities \nand transactions in them. Futures contracts for all commodities would \nbe treated the same in the law and regulations.\n  In addition, the bill eliminates the statutory exclusion of swap \ntransactions from regulation, and it ends the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission's authority to exempt such transactions from the general \nrequirement that a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for \nfuture delivery can only trade on a regulated board of trade. In \neffect, this proposed change\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\nin the law means that all futures contracts must trade on a designated \ncontract market or a derivatives transaction execution facility. The \nrequirement for exchange trading would thus include over-the-counter \ntrading of financial derivatives just as it does for futures contracts \nin physical commodities such as corn, soybeans and petroleum.\n  We have seen large negative consequences from the lack of price \ntransparency and the failure to properly measure and collateralize the \nrisk in trading over-the-counter derivatives. The problems have not \nbeen seen in the trading of financial futures on regulated futures \nmarkets, subject to the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  This legislation I am introducing will establish the standard that \nall futures contracts trade on regulated exchanges. The regulated \nexchanges will work with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \nensure that trading on the exchange is fair and equitable and not \nsubject to abuses. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has the \nexperience and expertise to oversee these matters.\n  Bringing necessary openness, transparency, soundness, and integrity \nto trading in contracts which are now unregulated over-the-counter \nswaps and related derivatives is a key element in restoring trust and \nconfidence in the financial system so that we can rebuild our economy \non a solid foundation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Thune, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Corker) proposed an amendment to the bill \nS. 181, to amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and to modify the operation \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, to clarify that a discriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice that is unlawful under such Acts occurs each time \ncompensation is paid pursuant to the discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Title VII Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Filing limitations periods serve important functions. \n     They ensure that all claims are promptly raised and \n     investigated, and, when remediation is warranted, that the \n     violations involved are promptly remediated.\n       (2) Limitations periods are particularly important in \n     employment situations, where unresolved grievances have a \n     singularly corrosive and disruptive effect.\n       (3) Limitations periods are also particularly important for \n     a statutory process that favors the voluntary resolution of \n     claims through mediation and conciliation. Promptly raised \n     issues are invariably more susceptible to such forms of \n     voluntary resolution.\n       (4) In instances in which that voluntary resolution is not \n     possible, a limitations period ensures that claims will be \n     adjudicated on the basis of evidence that is available, \n     reliable, and from a date that is proximate in time to the \n     adjudication.\n       (5) Limitations periods, however, should not be construed \n     to foreclose the filing of a claim by a reasonable person who \n     exercises\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n     due diligence regarding the person's rights but who did not \n     have, and should not have been expected to have, a reasonable \n     suspicion that the person was the object of unlawful \n     discrimination. Such a person should be afforded the full \n     applicable limitation period to commence a claim from the \n     time the person has, or should be expected to have, a \n     reasonable suspicion of discrimination.\n\n     SEC. 3. FILING PERIOD FOR CHARGES ALLEGING UNLAWFUL \n                   EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 706(e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \n     2000e-5(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) This paragraph shall apply to a charge if--\n       ``(i) the charge alleges an unlawful employment practice \n     involving discrimination in violation of this title; and\n       ``(ii) the person aggrieved demonstrates that the person \n     did not have, and should not have been expected to have, \n     enough information to support a reasonable suspicion of such \n     discrimination, on the date on which the alleged unlawful \n     employment practice occurred.\n       ``(B) In the case of such a charge, the applicable 180-day \n     or 300-day filing period described in paragraph (1) shall \n     commence on the date when the person aggrieved has, or should \n     be expected to have, enough information to support a \n     reasonable suspicion of such discrimination.\n       ``(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \n     change or modify the provisions of subsection (g)(1).\n       ``(D) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to apply \n     to a charge alleging an unlawful employment practice relating \n     to the provision of a pension or a pension benefit.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.
