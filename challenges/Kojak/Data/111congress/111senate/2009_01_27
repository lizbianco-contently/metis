Following the \nswearing in of that Senator, the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m. to \nallow for the weekly caucus luncheons to meet.\n  This week, we are going to legislate. There will be no morning \nbusiness. We want to have all the time that is necessary to work on \nthis important legislation dealing with children's health. I hope \npeople will be ready to offer amendments. We have worked with staff on \nthe Republican side of the aisle, and we have it set up that we have \nthree amendments that will be laid down very quickly. By that time, we \nshould be able to even schedule some votes for this afternoon.\n  I want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to offer any \namendment they want to offer. What we are going to try to do is not \nhave a bunch of them stacked up. I think that can sometimes be very \ntroublesome. But we will work, as we proceed through the legislation, \nas to what amendments need to be pending. We are here to legislate. We \nhope that if people have concerns about this important legislation and \nthey think it can be made better by taking something out or putting \nsomething in, that is what they should do. We want everyone, when they \noffer their amendments, to have ample time to debate them, as we did \nwith the first piece of legislation we dealt with, the Lilly Ledbetter \nlegislation. After there has been ample time for debate, there can be \nmotions to table. There are some Senators who may, for various reasons, \nagree to have up-or-down votes. We are here to legislate.\n  This morning is a little difficult because we have the Finance \nCommittee meeting to complete their work on the recovery package. There \nare 200 amendments that have been filed in the committee, and they have \nto work their way through those amendments. That should take the better \npart of the day, at least many hours. It is estimated from 4 to 8 hours \nto complete the markup.\n  The Appropriations Committee markup is at 10:30 a.m. also. There are \npeople from the Finance Committee who will be coming here on a rotating \nhour-by-hour basis so there will be floor coverage. So there is no \nreason not to be able to legislate and talk about this legislation in \nany way Senators feel is appropriate. Rollcall votes are expected to \noccur throughout the day. There will not be any votes before we \ncomplete our caucus luncheons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S851-7", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 40 to Amendment No. 39\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I support the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I think virtually every Member of the Senate does. I \nvoted to create the program and believe we need to responsibly \nreauthorize it.\n  In its original form, the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nwas meant to provide insurance to children from families who earn too \nmuch to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private \ninsurance.\n  There is no doubt, as I indicated earlier, we all support providing \ninsurance to low-income children. I am sure that is 100 Members of the \nSenate. In fact, this program originally passed on a broad bipartisan \nbasis with 43 Republicans and 42 Democrats supporting it. It was \nenacted by a Republican Congress, signed by a Democratic President, and \nwas a model of bipartisanship. Two of my colleagues, Senator Grassley \nand Senator Hatch, reached across the aisle to craft a bipartisan \ncompromise in the last Congress. Unfortunately, our Democratic \ncolleagues have gone back on many of the prior agreements that were \nreached in creating that bill last year, making this issue more \ncontentious than it ought to be and setting a troubling precedent for \nfuture discussions on health care reform.\n  The original purpose of the State Children's Health Insurance Program \nwas to serve low-income, uninsured children. The bill we are being \nasked to consider sanctions a loophole that allows a few select States, \nsuch as New York, to provide insurance to children and families earning \nmore than $80,000 a year--$80,000 a year--instead of insuring low-\nincome children first. This is more than double the median household \nincome in many States, including my State of Kentucky. It is grossly \nunfair that a family in Kentucky making $40,000 must pay for the health \ninsurance of a family making double that, especially if the Kentuckian \ncannot afford it for his own family.\n  The bill before the Senate is not limited to children either. It \npreserves loopholes that allow adults to enroll in a program that is \nintended for children.\n  Earlier estimates of similar legislation found that nearly half of \nthe new children added by this bill already have private health \ninsurance. Let me say that again. Earlier estimates of similar \nlegislation found that nearly half of the new children added by this \nbill already have private health insurance. Republicans, on the other \nhand, believe we ought to target scarce resources to uninsured \nchildren, not those who already have coverage.\n  Republicans will offer amendments to fix the shortcomings of this \nbill and to provide a responsible alternative that will return SCHIP to \nits intended purpose: serving the kids in struggling families who need \nthe help most. That is whom we ought to be helping.\n  Our bill, the Kids First Act, will provide funding increases to State \nSCHIP programs and help them find those eligible children who are not \nyet enrolled, and our Kids First idea is better because it closes the \nloophole that allows some States to extend their program to higher \nincome families, even while they have thousands of lower income \nchildren who still are not covered. The Kids First Act truly puts kids \nfirst, eliminating nearly all adults from a program designed for \nchildren so that more children can be covered. Finally, by responsibly \nallocating scarce resources, our bill increases funding for SCHIP \nwithout raising new taxes. We believe Republicans have a better \nalternative.\n  Madam President, I now send that alternative to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 40 to amendment No. 39.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we are now commencing debate on the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I wish to speak to the amendment \nthat has been offered by Senator McConnell, as well as the pending \nlegislation.\n  It is a grim reality in America that each day, 17,000 Americans are \nlosing their jobs. Each day, 9,000 Americans are facing new mortgage \nforeclosure notices. Madam President, 17,000 lost jobs and 9,000 have \nlost homes. In the process, some 11,000 Americans are losing their \nhealth insurance every single day. So the issue that was before us when \nwe created the Children's Health Insurance Program has become gravely \nworse, and we are finding more and more Americans who are being \nsqueezed out of health insurance coverage--46 million uninsured \nAmericans today, including 9 million children.\n  We decided to make children a priority in terms of providing health \ninsurance. What the Federal Government said to the States was: We will \ncome up with a program, but we will give you more than the normal \nMedicaid share; we are going to give you a share that is enhanced so \nthat you will consider covering these uninsured children. In that \nsituation, many States took advantage of it.\n  I might just say, Madam President, that I understand Senator Grassley \nis in the Chamber and has a 10:30 a.m. Finance Committee meeting and I \nhave a 10:30 a.m. Appropriations Committee meeting. Let me do my best \nto share the time so I can leave him with the remaining 10 minutes or \nso. Is that fair? I want to make sure Senator Grassley has a chance \nbecause we have to go to important meetings.\n  The difficulty we face today, the reality is we wanted this program \nprimarily to help families making up to 200 percent of what we call \nmedian family income. That would basically mean they would be making \nroughly up to $42,000 a year. So if you are making $42,000 or less, we \nwant those kids covered.\n  Then we said to the States: You can go as high as 300 percent, and \nthat would take it up to $63,000. You would have to pay more for that \nout of State funds if you think that group of kids of families making \nbetween $42,000 and $63,000 need the help. And some States took \nadvantage of it.\n  Then there were two exceptions, as I understand it. High cost of \nliving States--New York and New Jersey--asked for permission to go even \nhigher, up to $77,000 to $83,000 I think was the annual income. When \nmany of the critics of this legislation, including the Republican \nleader, who just spoke, talk about what is wrong with it, they point to \nNew York and New Jersey. I can tell you those are rare exceptions to \nthe rule across America. By and large, this program is geared for \npeople with incomes below $42,000 a year, and in some\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\ncases below $63,000, with only two exceptions that I know, New York and \nNew Jersey. And I will stand corrected if there is another State.\n  But the point is, to argue that this is a program that is for the \nwealthiest among us is to ignore the obvious. Those two States \nnotwithstanding, people making $63,000 a year I do not put in the \ncategory of wealthy. Certainly, those making $42,000 I wouldn't at all. \nIn fact, they are almost smack dab in the middle of the middle-income \nfamilies in America. When they face the cost of insurance not covered \nby their employer, it can be an extraordinarily high expense. That is \nwhy many of them opt out of coverage for the family, which means \nmothers, fathers, and children go without health insurance. Imagine \nmaking $42,000 a year and seeing a third or 40 percent of your income \ngoing into FICA and taxes. What does that leave you with, about $2,000 \na month? And with $2,000 a month, how many families can realistically \nturn around and buy a health insurance plan on the private market?\n\n  I also worry about this argument that we want to trap people into \nprivate health insurance that could be a bad policy that is very \nexpensive, instead of giving them an option of coming into the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. If our goal is to give these \nfamilies affordable health insurance, then why do we want to trap them \nin a private plan? Some will stay with the private plan because they \nare happy with it; others have a plan that, frankly, has a high \ndeductible, high copay, limited coverage, and high cost. We want to \ntrap those families in that plan?\n  Sadly, the amendment that is offered by Senator McConnell has a \nmandatory 6-month waiting period between leaving private health \ninsurance and enrolling in CHIP. What kind of benefit is that for the \nfamilies of Illinois or Kentucky who are in a bad private health \ninsurance plan--the only one they can afford? We want to give them real \ninsurance that can be there when they need it.\n  We know there are families who desperately will need help. I have \nhere the photograph of a family from Illinois. It is a classic story. \nThis is a family, Steve and Katie Avalos and their son Manolo. In 2005, \nKatie became pregnant while Steve was still in law school, and because \nof Federal programs such as CHIP and Medicaid, the State of Illinois \nwas able to provide health coverage for Katie through the All Kids \nProgram. With help from St. Joe's Hospital, Katie was enrolled in the \nIllinois Moms & Babies Program. She received excellent prenatal care. \nIn February 2006, her beautiful little baby boy Manolo was born with a \nrare neurologic condition that affects his balance, coordination, and \nspeech. He was living with something called Dandy Walker Syndrome and \nas a result has had slow motor development and progressive enlargement \nof his skull.\n  Because Manolo has a preexisting condition, his options for health \ninsurance are very limited. Yet with All Kids, our version of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program in Illinois, Katie can give her \nchild the services that are important building blocks for his future \nsuccess. Katie is grateful for reliable health insurance. Without it, \nManolo would not have experienced his many successes. He was able to \nwalk at age 2\\1/2\\, and the family is so happy. Without that helping \nhand, without the rehab and the special medical care, that might never \nhave happened. Manolo turns 3 in a few days, on February 2, and he has \nhis whole life in front of him.\n  Was this a bad investment, investing in this family, investing in \nthis child, giving them a chance for the medical care they needed so \nthis little boy has a normal life? When I hear from critics who argue \nthat this is something we can't afford, or unfortunately it is going to \ncrowd out private health insurance, I wonder if they know what a \nprivate health insurance plan would have cost this family with a child \nwith a preexisting condition. They would have been lucky to find one \nthey could afford, and it would have had many exclusions and many \nriders.\n  Now Senator McConnell says to this poor family, stick with it for 6 \nmonths no matter what it is costing, no matter the fact that it doesn't \ncover what your child needs. I don't think that is the way to go. I \nthink what we have to understand is that many people came together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to pass this bill initially--to pass it \ntwice, though it ended up with President Bush's veto--and in all of \nthese instances we were affirming the bottom line. And the bottom line, \nas President Obama and others have said, is health insurance is \ncritically important for all of us.\n  President Obama said:\n\n       People don't expect government to solve all their problems. \n     But they sense deep in their bones that with just a slight \n     change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in \n     America has a decent shot at life and that the doors of \n     opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better.\n\n  Those are the words of President Obama in his speech to the 2004 \nDemocratic convention. I know deep in our bones the Senate will stand \ntogether to give an additional 4 million kids coverage with health \ninsurance. A bill that had been vetoed twice by President Bush can \nbecome the law of the land so this family--this loving family with a \nbeautiful little boy--and thousands of others like them have a chance \nat quality health insurance.\n  I might conclude by saying that this debate is important for the \ncourse of the Senate, because all of us understand we have had some \ntough times on the Senate floor over the last couple of years--95 \nfilibusters, a record-breaking number. What we want to do this week is \nto prove, as we did last week, that we can have amendments offered \nconstructively; that we can debate them, deliberate them, and vote on \nthem in an expeditious way. We can have a fair hearing on these \namendments and come to a vote and not face a cloture vote and 30 hours \nof the Senate sitting in quorum calls with nothing happening. But it \ntakes a cooperative effort on both sides. I think we can reach that \nagain, and I hope we will prove it this week and by the end of the week \npass this critical legislation to give 4 million kids, such as Manolo \nhere, a chance for a better life.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, our goal is to cover 4 million kids, \nas was spoken by the majority whip. Our goal is to do it in a way so \nthat we actually have the resources to cover children who do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  There are some aspects of the underlying bill before us that would \nlead families to drop private health insurance, and I am cognizant of \nwhat Senator Durbin said, that if you have a bad policy, maybe you \nought to be on SCHIP. I don't dispute that. But we have found that when \nyou crowd people out of private health insurance, it is more apt to \nhappen at the highest income levels than at the levels he was talking \nabout, where we ought to be helping people under $42,000.\n  Then there is another category where they want to help people that \nsponsors have already assumed the responsibility of making sure their \nhealth care would be covered. In that category, we find $1.3 billion \nbeing wasted that we can take and use on children who don't have \ncoverage.\n  So there is no dispute about covering 4 million people. There is a \ndispute about whether we ought to encourage people who are of higher \nincome to drop out of private policies and to go on the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. If you talk to people in the Congressional \nBudget Office--the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--you will \nfind that is a fact. Then when we have people sign a contractual \nrelationship with the Federal Government that they are going to provide \nfor the needs of the people they bring into this country, we feel--at \nleast for a period of 5 years, and that is present law--that they \nshould maintain that contractual relationship they have with the \ngovernment; otherwise, those people would not be here in the first \nplace. So we want to cover 4 million people. We want to cover people \nwho don't have insurance. We don't want to encourage higher income \npeople who do have insurance to go into the State health insurance \nprogram, and we want to make sure that people maintain their \ncontractual obligations.\n  We are going to offer a series of amendments today and tomorrow to \nbring out these differences between the two approaches, but I am not \ngoing to stand by and let anybody on the other side of the aisle say \nthere is a dispute\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nabout covering 4 million people. I will make the point on this side of \nthe aisle that we want to make sure we put emphasis upon covering \npeople who don't have insurance, where they are willing to look at \nencouraging people to leave private insurance and go into a State-run \nprogram or encouraging people to avoid their contractual obligations \nwith the Federal Government. Using our approach, it seems to me, the \ngoal then can be reached so we actually reach more people who don't \nhave insurance.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 39\n\n  Now, the first amendment I am going to offer deals with this issue I \nreferred to as a contractual obligation. The amendment I am offering \ntoday is very simple. It increases the coverage of low-income American \nchildren currently eligible for Medicaid but who are uninsured relative \nto the bill before this Senate. My amendment does this by striking the \nFederal dollars for coverage of legal immigrants and uses those funds \nto cover more low-income American kids instead.\n  Let me make it very clear: Whichever bill passes, we are talking \nabout 4 million more kids, but we are still talking about a lot of kids \nwho still aren't going to have coverage that we ought to be concerned \nabout. So this is all about priorities. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas reviewed my amendment and it indeed does the job of covering more \nlow-income American kids. In fact, my amendment will get as many or \nmore low-income American kids health coverage than the majority's bill \ndoes with the coverage of legal immigrants.\n\n  Does that sound right? It is right. It does not reduce the number of \nkids covered. It covers as many low-income kids, and maybe even more. \nThe difference is that the additional low-income kids who get health \ncoverage with my amendment are U.S. citizens. It does a better job of \nenrolling these low-income children than the bill before the Senate. I \nthought that covering children who were eligible for Medicaid but who \nwere insured was a bipartisan goal shared by my Democratic colleagues. \nThis amendment does exactly that.\n  I want to get back to the background on the amendment. In other \nwords, there are people who are legally in the country--no dispute \nabout that, legally in the country--who have sponsors. Without the \nsponsors, they would not be here. Those sponsors have signed an \nagreement with the Federal Government for these people to come into \nthis country, that they will take care of them for 5 years, that they \nwill not become a public charge. So those sponsors promised for their \nneeds so that they would not be on programs that come out of the \nFederal Treasury, or else they would not be here. That is a cost of \n$1.3 billion when you are going to let those people not honor their \ncontractual relationships and allow them to go on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. And are they any better off? No, because the people \nwho brought them here promised they were going to fulfill those needs \nand not become a public charge. But we would take that $1.3 billion and \nspend it on people who were not promised any coverage but qualify for \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and cover more kids in the \nprocess.\n  Madam President, I am going to send my amendment to the desk, and I \nask that it be read.\n  Before I do that, I am sorry, I have to ask unanimous consent to set \nthe pending amendment aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is in order at this \ntime, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Vitter, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 41 to amendment No. 39.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading thus far constitute the reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the option to provide coverage to legal immigrants \n and increase the enrollment of uninsured low income American children)\n\n       Strike section 214 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 214. INCREASED FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT OF UNINSURED LOW \n                   INCOME AMERICAN CHILDREN.\n\n       Section 2105(a)(3)(E) (42 U.S.C. 1397ee(a)(3)(E)), as added \n     by section 104, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(iv) Increase in bonus payments for fiscal years 2012 \n     through 2019.--With respect to each of fiscal years 2012 \n     through 2019:\n\n       ``(I) Clause (i) of subparagraph (B) shall be applied by \n     substituting `38 percent' for `15 percent'.\n       ``(II) Clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) shall be applied by \n     substituting `70 percent' for `62.5 percent'.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, did I make a mistake, that I was not \nsupposed to set the amendment aside? I apologize if I made a mistake.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator can proceed at this \ntime without consent.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have said all I am going to say, and from that \nstandpoint, we will be debating this amendment throughout the day. We \ndo not object to what the majority leader said, that he would like to \nvote on these amendments today. I think it is our intention to do that \nsometime during the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as someone who considers the creation of \nthe CHIP program one of my happiest legislative accomplishments as a \nSenator, this is a very difficult and disappointing week for me. Like \nthe rest of the Nation, after this historic election, I was so hopeful \nwe would mark this new era with the passage of bipartisan CHIP \nlegislation. However, the partisan process engineered by the other side \nof the aisle so far on this issue of great importance, has only \nreinforced the American people's cynicism about Washington's partisan \npolitical games. Americans are tired of this, and I am tired of this. \nChange is not just a slogan on a campaign poster, it is about real \naction.\n\n  I began this year with great hope that we would all come together to \ncomplete our work from 2007 and have a bill signed into law that would \nhave overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle. But that hope has \nturned quickly into disappointment and the promise of change into a \ncommitment to remain the same.\n  It appears that decisions were already made without those of us who \nworked morning, noon and night for several months in 2007 to create a \nbipartisan CHIP bill not once, but twice at the consternation of many \ncolleagues on my own side. And I want to make one point perfectly clear \nto my colleagues in this chamber--Senator Grassley and I were willing \nto roll up our sleeves and do it again this year. That is because we \nremain committed to those 6 million low-income, uninsured children who \nare eligible for CHIP and Medicaid coverage.\n  I am bitterly disappointed by the outcome of this bill. CHIP is a \nprogram I deeply love and built with my friends and colleagues who \nshare my concern about the welfare of uninsured children of the working \npoor--the only ones who were left out of this process.\n  Again, in the Senate, we could have had a bill that would have \nbrought the vast majority of members together once and for all to help \nthese children. But that was not to be.\n  When our new President was campaigning across the country, he made a \npromise to the American people that he would invoke change and end the \nbitter partisanship on Capitol Hill. I find it ironic that he will be \nmeeting with GOP members to talk about bipartisan efforts in the \neconomic stimulus package the same week that the Senate is about to \npass the very first partisan CHIP bill. The other three bills that this \nbody has passed on the CHIP program were approved with overwhelming \nbipartisan support--69 votes for; both parties.\n  When President Obama was elected, I truly believed his promise of \nbipartisan change. And at risk of sounding overly sarcastic, I believe \nthat if this bill and the process so far on the stimulus legislation \nare any indicator of what the future will bring, the American people \nwill demand to know exactly what kind of change the Democrats pledge to \nbring to Washington.\n  I know my colleagues will agree that we put our hearts and souls into \nnegotiating the reauthorization of the CHIP program in 2007. We stuck \ntogether through some very tough decisions--whether or not to allow \ncoverage of pregnant women through CHIP, whether or not to continue \ncoverage of childless adults and parents, whether\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\nor not to allow States to expand CHIP income eligibility levels, how to \neliminate crowd-out and, most important, how to get more low-income, \nuninsured children covered through CHIP. We had some tough discussions, \nbut in the end, we ended up with two bills, CHIP I and CHIP II, that \ncovered almost 4 million low-income, uninsured children. Unfortunately, \nneither version of the bill was signed into law and, in the end, we \nsimply extended the CHIP program through March 2009.\n  Back then, we knew that we needed to prepare, once again, for another \ndebate on the reauthorization of the CHIP program in early 2009. But we \nall felt that the outcome would be different and that the legislation \nthat I developed with Senators Grassley, Rockefeller and Baucus which I \nbelieve greatly improved the CHIP program, would be signed into law.\n  While the CHIP legislation that we passed in the Senate was not \nperfect, which we fondly refer to as CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II, it \nrepresented a compromise and laid the foundation for bipartisanship and \ntrust that was integral to getting the legislation not once but twice \nto the President's desk.\n  The bill being considered this week is not that bill because it \nincludes provisions that I feel were not part of our bipartisan \nagreement such as the inclusion of a State option to cover legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women. Amendments will be offered to \nimprove this legislation but if they are not accepted, I will not be \nable to support this bill. And I deeply regret it.\n  I started putting together ideas regarding the CHIP program after I \nmet with two Provo, UT, families in which both parents worked. Each \nfamily had six children. Neither family, with both incomes, had more \nthan $20,000 a year in total gross income. They clearly could not \nafford health insurance for their children. CHIP was the only answer to \ntheir plight. They were the only people left out of the process. They \nworked. They did the best they could.\n  When Senators Kennedy, Rockefeller, Chafee and I wrote this program \nin 1997, we wrote it with the intent of helping the children of those \nProvo families and others like them. Our intent was to help the \nchildren of the working poor, the only children who did not have access \nto health coverage back then. These children's families made too much \nmoney to qualify for Medicaid and not enough money to buy private \nhealth insurance.\n  In addition, it came to light that both the Clinton and Bush \nadministrations permitted individuals to be covered by CHIP who did not \nfit the definition that we had in mind for children of the working \npoor. In fact, they were not even children. They were childless adults \nand parents of CHIP eligible children. My good friend Senator Grassley \nlikes to remind us that there is no ``A'' in the CHIP program. There is \nonly a ``C'' and we all know what that ``C'' stands for and it is not \nadults.\n  I believe that having adults on this program caused the price tag of \nCHIP to escalate and even led to some States running out of their CHIP \nallotments prematurely. To add insult to injury, because States receive \na higher Federal matching rate for covering individuals in the CHIP \nprogram, States were given financial incentives to continue covering \nadults.\n  As part of our compromise in 2007, childless adults would have been \nphased off CHIP and transitioned to their States' Medicaid programs. \nParents would have been covered in a capped program and within a set \ntimeframe, States would have either received the Medicaid matching rate \nor the matching rate half way between the State's Medicaid matching \nrate and the CHIP matching rate. This was called RE-MAP. States would \nhave only gotten the RE-MAP Federal match if they covered a certain \nnumber of low-income children.\n  Our two bills from 2007, CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II, brought this \nsituation to light and put a stop to covering future adults once and \nfor all. In fact, States will no longer be allowed to submit waivers to \ncover adults through the CHIP program once the bill before the Senate \nbecomes law. That seems right.\n  We have also seen some States cover children whose family income is \nwell above 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Typically, these \nhigher income families have access to private health insurance so they \nend up having a choice between private health insurance, paid for in \npart by their employers, or CHIP coverage, almost fully paid for by the \nFederal and State governments.\n  Unfortunately, many of these families end up choosing CHIP over \nprivate health coverage, thus contributing to higher costs incurred by \nthe CHIP program. Adding higher income families to State CHIP programs \nalso affects the Federal taxpayer who ends up paying for a significant \npart of the CHIP program.\n  And, once again, States currently receive the higher CHIP Federal \nmatching rate for covering these higher income children. This is \nsomething that really bothers me because it is so contrary to the \noriginal goal of the CHIP program.\n  There are other issues as well--the crowd-out policy that we worked \nout to address the serious crowd-out concerns raised by Members was not \nincluded in this mark.\n  This policy, section 116 of CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II called for the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, to study what States are doing \nto eliminate crowd-out in the CHIP program. In addition, the Institute \nof Medicine, the IOM, was directed to come up with the best way for \nmeasuring, on a State-by-State basis, the number of low-income children \nwho do not have health coverage and the best way to collect this data \nin a uniform manner across the country. Today, there is no standard for \nStates to collect data on the uninsured, including uninsured, low-\nincome children.\n  So right now, it is a guessing game for States to figure out how many \nlow-income, uninsured children reside in their States. To me, it is a \nno brainer that we should incorporate a standard way to collect this \nimportant information to help us figure out how many low-income, \nuninsured children still need health coverage.\n  The deleted section also required the Health and Human Services \nSecretary to develop recommendations on best practices to address CHIP \ncrowd-out. It also directed the Secretary to develop recommendations on \nhow to create uniform standards to measure and report on both CHIP \ncrowd-out and health coverage of children from families below 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n  I simply do not understand why on earth the majority would drop such \nan important provision. I don't understand that since we worked so hard \nto solve these problems. Don't we want to eliminate crowd-out to ensure \nthat the children in the most need are the top priority? Don't we want \nto make sure that the data collected in Utah on uninsured, low-income \nchildren is collected the same way across the country? Don't we want to \ncompare apples to apples? Or is it possible that some in this body \nsimply want to continue the guessing game and never truly know how many \nlow-income, uninsured children live in their States?\n  We will have a vote on this provision during this debate and it is my \nhope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will want to have answers \non crowd-out and appropriate data collection. I cannot believe that \nMembers subscribe to the irresponsible, anything goes policy which is \nexactly what they are advocating if they vote against the amendment to \nadd this provision back into the bill.\n  Another issue that is very important to me is the coverage of high-\nincome children through the CHIP program. When we were negotiating \nCHIPRA I and CHIPRA II in 2007, we agreed 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level for CHIP was high enough. CHIPRA I provided States with \nthe lower Medicaid matching rate, FMAP, for covering children over 300 \npercent of FPL. CHIPRA II, the second bill vetoed by the President, \nwent one step further and stopped all Federal matching rates for CHIP \nchildren over 300 percent of FPL. That is the policy that I support--\nthere is no reason on earth that a family making $63,000 per year \nshould be covered by CHIP and that a State should be rewarded with any \nFederal matching dollars for covering these high-income children.\n  In fact, there is one State that provides CHIP coverage up to 350 \npercent of FPL and another State that is trying to cover children up to \n400 percent\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\nof FPL. In my opinion, when States start moving in that direction, they \nare taking a block grant program, one that we felt should be operated \nby the States to help children of the working poor, to push towards a \nsingle payer health system. That is what they are pushing for. That is \nnot what we agreed to in 1997 when we created CHIP.\n  However, the legislation before us today allows States that had \nsubmitted State plan amendments or had their waiver approved to \nincrease their income eligibility levels to over 300 percent of FPL to \nreceive the higher Federal matching rate for the CHIP program. These \nStates are New Jersey, a State that now covers children up to 350 \npercent of the Federal poverty level and New York, a State that \nsubmitted a plan to CMS to cover children up to 400 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. I do not support this provision and will be \nsupporting an amendment to prevent these two States from receiving the \nhigher CHIP matching rate. that are willing to work within the limits \nwe set and have worked well under the original CHIP bill.\n\n  Another issue that deeply troubles me is the insistence to include a \nState option to cover legal immigrant children and pregnant women, who \nare not citizens of our country, through the CHIP program.\n  In 2007, we made agreements that our legislation would not include \nthe coverage of legal immigrant children and pregnant women. I have \nconsistently voted against adding that new category, even if it is at \nthe State option, because I believed then, as I believe now, that \nbefore we even consider expanding the CHIP program to legal immigrant \nchildren, we need to do the best job we can to cover the children of \nthe working poor who are U.S. citizens.\n  While we have improved, we still have at least 6 million other \nchildren to cover, maybe more, with the dire economic conditions \ncurrently facing our country.\n  Now, before we even started drafting our first CHIP bill in 2007, we \nagreed that legal immigrant children would not be added to the CHIP \nprogram. That agreement was very important to me and to other \nRepublicans who eventually supported the two CHIP bills that we \nnegotiated in 2007.\n  In addition, we have always struggled to find sufficient dollars to \nreauthorize the CHIP program. The bill before the Senate is only a 4\\1/\n2\\ year reauthorization due to limited funds. I understand there is \nsome extra money in the bill for the legal immigrant provision. I \nbelieve that we should be using that money to cover low-income \nuninsured children who are U.S. citizens first. How many children who \nare U.S. citizens will be without health care because we have decided \nto cover legal immigrants through CHIP?\n  I wish to know the answer to that question before this bill becomes \nlaw. Now, ordinarily I support helping legal immigrants in almost every \nway. But we do not have enough money to take care of our own citizens' \nchildren. That is a matter of great concern to me and it is of great \nconcern to a significant number of Members of both bodies who probably \nwill vote against this bill because of that provision. In fact, there \nare plenty of reasons to vote against this bill because it was written \nin such a partisan fashion.\n  I might add, the legal immigrant provision is now in this \nlegislation, and, as a result, there are many Members in both Houses of \nCongress who now oppose the bill. We simply do not understand why we \nare not taking care of our children who are U.S. citizens first. Once \nthat goal is accomplished, I would be willing to make a commitment to \nthe work on resolving all of the issues regarding legal immigrants once \nand for all.\n  But now is not the time. There is not enough money even in this bill \nto take care of our children who are citizens. This is especially true \nwhen our country is in economic crisis and there are more children who \nare U.S. citizens who need health insurance coverage because their \nparents may have lost their jobs or may have lower paying jobs. I do \nnot believe this is an unreasonable request. For the life of me, I \ncannot understand why those who support the coverage of legal immigrant \nchildren cannot work with us to resolve this issue, especially if they \nwant a bill that has broad bipartisan support.\n  But without a doubt, the issue that broke down negotiations between \nthe Senate and House Republicans at the end of 2007 involved Medicaid \neligibility. Section 115 of the legislation would allow States to \ncreate higher income eligibility levels for Medicaid. When are we going \nto quit throwing money at programs?\n  Simply put, a State could establish one income level for Medicaid, a \nhigher income eligibility level for CHIP, and then cover more kids at \nan even higher income eligibility level through Medicaid. In other \nwords, a State could cover higher income children through Medicaid at \nan even higher income level than children covered by CHIP.\n  This provision sets no limits on the income eligibility level for \nMedicaid. Now, that is ridiculous. It is irresponsible. It is fiscally \nunsound. Everybody here knows it. In 2007, the House Republicans wanted \nto put a hard cap of 300 percent of Federal poverty level on State \nMedicaid programs. I agreed with them, but others did not. I am quite \ndisturbed that the legislation before the Senate still allows States to \ncover high-income children under their State Medicaid plans. \nTechnically speaking, section 115 of this bill would allow a State to \ncover children under Medicaid whose family income is over 300 percent, \nover $63,000 for a family of four.\n  During this debate, I intend to support and speak in favor of \namendments to address this very serious concern of mine. It ought to be \na serious concern of everyone here, since there a limited amount of \nmoney that may be used.\n  Additionally, section 104 of the legislation creates a bonus \nstructure for States that enroll Medicaid-eligible children in their \nState Medicaid programs. The idea is to reward States for covering \ntheir poorest children. If a State increases its Medicaid income \neligibility levels, using the language in section 115, additional \nchildren added to Medicaid would not be eligible for a bonus during the \nfirst 3 fiscal years. However, at the beginning of the fourth fiscal \nyear, it is possible that States could receive a bonus for enrolling \nhigher income children in their State Medicaid programs.\n  Now, this provision simply does not make any sense. I urge my \ncolleagues to drop it once and for all. A State should not be rewarded \nfor covering a high-income child in its State Medicaid program, \nespecially when it is not going to be covering those who need to be \ncovered and should be covered.\n  Well, I have to admit, Senator Grassley and I went through a lot of \npain on this side, and in the House of Representatives, bringing people \ntogether for the overwhelming votes that we did have in both the Senate \nand the House, but especially here in the Senate on both CHIPRA I and \nCHIPRA II.\n  Then, all of a sudden we find that since the Democrats have taken \nover and now have a significant majority, they do not need Senator \nGrassley and me anymore.\n  Now, my feelings are not hurt, I want you all to know that. But I am \ndisgusted with this process that is so partisan. I am particularly \nupset because everybody in this body knows that I fought my guts out to \nget the original CHIP program through to begin with in 1997. And it \nwould not have happened had I not brought it up in the Finance \nCommittee markup on the Balanced Budget Act. In fact, it became the \nglue that put the first balanced budget together in over 40 years.\n  So you can imagine why I feel the way I do. I know how badly Senator \nGrassley feels. We are both conservatives, but we both worked our guts \nout trying to bring about an effective approach, and it was effective \nin CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II.\n  Unfortunately, in 2007, neither bill did not have enough votes to \noverride a veto. I think our President had very poor advice, and \nanybody who looks at the mess this legislation is in right now, and the \nlack of bipartisanship, will have to agree that we should have signed \ninto law either CHIPRA I or CHIPRA II. But then that is the past.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will recognize that some of us \nworked hard to try and bring about effective legislation, taking on our \nown administration, taking on wonderful friends on our own side, to \nbring about legislation that would work a lot better than the bill \nbefore us today. This bill, in my opinion, is going to lead to higher \ncosts and less coverage of children.\n  Why? What is the reasoning behind it? Well, unless there are \nessential\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nchanges made to this legislation during the floor debate, I will be \nvoting against my own bill, and against the program I helped create in \n1997. It is sufficient to say that I am not only disappointed, but I am \nangry. This entire debate has personally been grievous to me, because \nit has now become a partisan exercise instead of being about covering \nlow-income, uninsured children, where we could have had a wonderful \nbipartisan vote. We could have made this third reauthorization bill a \ntremendous victory for the President.\n\n  Well, he may feel tremendous victory anyway, even though it is a \npartisan one. But I do not look at it that way. To start out the year \non this note does not bode well for future health care discussions, \nincluding health reform and the Medicare bill that we will be \nconsidering this fall. In fact, one of the very first bills that the \nPresident, who ran on a platform of bipartisanship and change, will \nsign into law is going to be a partisan CHIP bill, produced as a result \nof the same old Washington gamesmanship. That is pathetic when you \nthink about it, because we should be together on this bill, and a large \nmajority would have voted again for legislation similar to either \nCHIPRA I or CHIPRA II.\n  I want to encourage the President and his colleagues to seriously \nconsider what they are doing. We were so close to working out a \nbipartisan CHIP agreement and, in my opinion, I believe they are \nmissing an incredible bipartisan health care victory by making this a \npartisan product. So I urge the President and my friends on the other \nside--they are my friends--I urge them to reconsider this strategy. I \nthink we still have time to turn this around and make it the bipartisan \nbill many of us would like it to be. Ensuring access to quality and \naffordable care for Americans is not a Republican or Democratic issue, \nit is an American issue. Our citizens expect nothing less than a \nbipartisan, open, and inclusive process to address a challenge that \nmakes up 17 percent of our economy and will increase to 20 percent \nwithin the next decade. A bipartisan CHIP bill would have been an \nincredible step in that direction.\n  However, once again politics has triumphed over policy, Washington \nover Main Street.\n  The famous novelist Alphonse Karr once said, ``The more things \nchange, the more they remain the same.'' There is no better proof of \nthis statement than this CHIP legislation. I continue to hope that the \nchange promised in this election did not have an expiration date of \nJanuary 20, 2009, but rather was a real and accountable promise to our \ncitizens. There is no better place to start this change than on this \nCHIP bill by making it truly bipartisan.\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 45 to Amendment No. 39\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 45 to amendment No. \n     39.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit any Federal matching payment for Medicaid or CHIP \n    coverage of noncitizen children or pregnant women until a State \n demonstrates that it has enrolled 95 percent of the children eligible \n for Medicaid or CHIP who reside in the State and whose family income \n            does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line)\n\n       On page 136, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       (c) Condition for Federal Matching Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1903(i) (42 U.S.C. 1396b(i)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (23), by striking ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in paragraph (24)(C), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (24)(C), the following:\n       ``(25) with respect to amounts expended for medical \n     assistance for an immigrant child or pregnant woman under an \n     election made pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (v) for \n     any fiscal year quarter occurring before the first fiscal \n     year quarter for which the State demonstrates to the \n     Secretary (on the basis of the best data reasonably available \n     to the Secretary and in accordance with such techniques for \n     sampling and estimating as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate) that the State has enrolled in the State plan \n     under this title, the State child health plan under title \n     XXI, or under a waiver of either such plan, at least 95 \n     percent of the children who reside in the State, whose family \n     income (as determined without regard to the application of \n     any general exclusion or disregard of a block of income that \n     is not determined by type of expense or type of income \n     (regardless of whether such an exclusion or disregard is \n     permitted under section 1902(r))) does not exceed 200 percent \n     of the poverty line (as defined in section 2110(c)(5)), and \n     who are eligible for medical assistance under the State plan \n     under this title or child health assistance or health \n     benefits coverage under the State child health plan under \n     title XXI.''.\n       (2) Application to chip.--Section 2107(e)(1)(E) (42 U.S.C. \n     1397gg(e)(1)(E)) (as amended by section 503(a)(1)) is amended \n     by striking ``and (17)'' and inserting ``(17), and (25)''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. My amendment simply says that before a State may exercise \nan option to provide CHIP and Medicare to legal immigrant children and \npregnant women, that State must demonstrate to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services that 95 percent of its children under 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level have been enrolled in either the State's \nMedicaid program or the CHIP program.\n  The Secretary may make this determination based on the best data \navailable, and may use any technique necessary for sampling and \nestimating the number of low-income, uninsured children in that State.\n  When legal immigrants enter this country, their sponsors agree, the \npeople who bring them in agree, to be responsible for their expenses \nfor the first 5 years they live in the United States.\n  The CHIP bill contains a provision which was added during the Finance \nCommittee consideration of the bill that negates that agreement by \nallowing immediate health coverage of legal children and pregnant \nwomen. This is the first reason I am offering this amendment.\n  The second reason is that there are U.S. children who are citizens of \nthis country who are low income and uninsured. They do not have health \ninsurance coverage. They qualify for Medicaid and CHIP too. I believe \nthese children should be our first priority as far as CHIP and Medicaid \ncoverage is concerned. They should be the priority. Once these children \nhave health coverage, then we can talk about expansions to other \npopulations.\n  I worked very closely with my Democratic colleagues on creating not \none but two bipartisan CHIP bills in 2007, CHIPRA I and CHIPRA II.\n  As I have explained, I voted against my President because I wanted \nthe CHIP program to be reauthorized in the bill we wrote. One of the \nfirst agreements that Senator Grassley and I made with Senators Baucus \nand Rockefeller was that legal immigrant children would not be covered \nunder the CHIP program because their sponsors made a commitment to be \nfinancially responsible for them for 5 years. That was even before we \nstarted drafting CHIPRA I.\n  I simply cannot support a CHIP bill that allows States to cover legal \nimmigrant children while there are at least 6 million low-income \nuninsured children, 200 percent of poverty and below, who do not have \nhealth coverage and are eligible for CHIP and Medicare.\n  These children ought to be our first priority. My amendment ensures \nthe majority of these children have health coverage before we expand \nCHIP and Medicaid eligibility to legal immigrants. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment. It is a reasonable approach. It might have \nthe capacity of helping to bring some of us together in a more \nbipartisan manner. I hope our colleagues will pay strict attention to \nsome of the things I have said because I believe I have earned the \nright to be listened to on all aspects of the CHIP bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me compliment my friend, Senator \nHatch, for his longstanding work on behalf of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. He points out--and rightly so--that this legislation \nwas developed in a bipartisan manner, where Democrats and Republicans \nworked together to establish a Federal program that allowed our States \nto use their mechanism to cover children. That is where our difference \nmight be now. We are looking\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nat reauthorization legislation. We are looking at how we can make this \nprogram more effective, covering more children, giving States the tools \nthey need so children can be covered under the CHIP program. The \nconcerns my friend from Utah raises basically would impede on State \ndiscretion. We have a national program that is built upon allowing the \nStates to implement and cover children. Each State is different. The \npriorities among States are certainly different. We need to give the \nStates the tools they need so children actually are covered effectively \nby this program.\n  The amendment my friend from Utah has offered would prohibit States \nfrom covering legal immigrants and pregnant women. These are, in many \ncases, people who have been here for a long time, hard-working, tax-\npaying families, and they are playing according to the rules.\n  This restriction was imposed in 1996 by Congress. Since that time, \nmany of the restrictions that have been placed upon legal immigrants \nhave been removed. In this instance, what the committee is recommending \nis to give the States the option of covering legal immigrants without \nthe 5-year wait period. It is not mandating it. It gives all States the \noption, if they so desire, to cover. Currently, 23 States want to cover \nthese children.\n  The last time an amendment was offered and we tried to do away with \nthe prohibition on States, our Republican colleagues said: This \nshouldn't be done as an independent issue. Why don't we take it up when \nwe reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. That is where \nit should come up. It should not come up on an unrelated bill. That is \nexactly what we are doing.\n  This is the reauthorization bill for the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. This is the time to correct what was done in 1996, in haste, \nthat in many other Federal programs we have already changed. This \nallows the States to do it.\n  Many other issues my friend from Utah raised, I assume, will have \nindividual amendments to deal with them. But in most cases, it is the \nissue of whether we are going to trust our States to run the program. \nThat was the compromise reached between Democrats and Republicans. \nQuite frankly, there are more people on the Democratic side of the \naisle who wanted a stronger Federal presence. But our Republican \ncolleagues said: Let's build upon the State programs. That is what we \ndid in the compromise. That is why the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram has truly been a bipartisan bill.\n  The bill reported out by the committee is a bipartisan bill. So let \nme talk for a few minutes about the importance of S. 275, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. For \nmillions of children across America who are waiting for the \ncomprehensive health care coverage they need, this week could not have \ncome soon enough. There is a crisis in health care in this country. The \nUnited States spends far more per capita than any other nation on \nhealth care services. Yet our health status lags in many areas, \nespecially in preventable diseases. This is primarily because we have \nso many Americans who lack coverage and a fragmented, inefficient \nhealth care system that shifts costs onto those who are covered. This \nis no longer a matter of whether we take action to achieve universal \nhealth insurance but how.\n  We can begin, in the 111th Congress, by guaranteeing children access \nto the care they need to grow into healthy adults. We can make great \nstrides by reauthorizing CHIP and covering millions of uninsured \nchildren now.\n  Most uninsured Americans belong to working families. It is the CHIP \nprogram, first established 12 years ago, that can provide children in \nthese families with affordable health insurance. As a Member of the \nHouse, I voted for the bill that created CHIP. At the time, 37 million \nAmericans were uninsured. At the time, I did so with the hope that CHIP \nwould be the first step toward universal health coverage. Although we \ndid not reach the goal then, I believe we are on track to achieve it \nthis year. In the years since, more employers have dropped their \ncoverage. The number of uninsured has increased. Today the number \nstands at 46 million and growing. I say ``growing'' because today's \nheadlines contain more grim news for our workforce. The New York Times \nreported a staggering list of companies that announced job cuts on \nMonday: Caterpillar, 20,000 jobs; Sprint-Nextel, 8,000 jobs; Home \nDepot, 7,000 jobs; General Motors, 2,000 jobs; Texas Instruments, 3,400 \njobs; Philips Electronics, 6,000 jobs.\n  Over the past year, more than 12.5 million Americans have lost their \njobs. Our unemployment rate is now 7.2 percent, the highest in 16 \nyears. As President Obama said yesterday:\n\n       These are not just numbers. These are working men and women \n     whose families have been disrupted and whose dreams have been \n     put on hold.\n\n  Whenever we have a family who loses their job, in many cases, they \nlose their health insurance. If they lose their health insurance, in \nmany cases, they lose their access to quality health care. The numbers \nare increasing. In many cases, we have two working families. One person \nloses their job which may cover the family, the other spouse has only \nsingle coverage and can't get family coverage or doesn't have the money \nto afford family coverage. This disrupts a family's ability to take \ncare of their own health care needs. We know CHIP works. Studies have \nshown and proved that enrollment in CHIP improves the health care of \nchildren. When previously uninsured children sign up for CHIP, they are \nfar more likely to get regular primary medical and dental care. They \nare less likely to visit the emergency room for services that could be \nrendered in a doctor's office. That saves us health care dollars. They \nare more likely to receive immunizations and other services they need \nto stay healthy and lead to healthier schools and communities. They are \nmore likely to get the prescription drugs they need to recover from \nillness.\n  The best evidence of the program's success doesn't rest in studies or \nsurveys. It rests in the families themselves. The Bedford family from \nBaltimore is a success story, one of millions of families in CHIP. \nCraig and Kim Lee Bedford and their five children have testified on \nCapitol Hill about the difference the Maryland CHIP program has made in \ntheir lives. Mrs. Bedford said:\n\n       Perhaps the greatest impact the Maryland Children's Health \n     Insurance Program has had on our family is that we no longer \n     have to make impossible health choices based on a financial \n     perspective. We no longer have to decide whether a child is \n     really sick enough to warrant a doctor's visit. We no longer \n     have to decide whether a child really needs a certain \n     medication prescribed by his pediatrician.\n\n  Mr. Bedford said:\n\n       The face of CHIP is families such as ours, families that \n     work hard, play by the rules, trying to live the American \n     dream.\n\n  So for the Bedford family and millions more, CHIP has been a success. \nBut there are still millions of children who have not enrolled in the \nprogram offered by their States. Our State is making progress, \nsimplifying their enrollment procedures, expanding outreach efforts and \nusing joint applications for Medicaid and CHIP so families can enroll \ntogether. The States are making progress, but as we reauthorize the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, let's make sure we make real \nprogress.\n  Our bill will extend the program for 4.5 years and allow an \nadditional 4.1 million children nationwide to enroll. We have to get \nthis bill done.\n  I wish to talk about the MCHIP program, the Maryland State program. \nIt has one of the highest income eligibility thresholds in the Nation. \nI know my colleagues have talked about this. This is needed because of \nthe high cost of living in our State. Eligibility is 300 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, not because our Governor wants to move people \nfrom private insurance to public insurance plans. It is at 300 percent \nbecause working families at this income level do not have access to \naffordable health insurance. That is the statistics in my State. Those \nfamilies need CHIP. This is a State option.\n  As to one point my friend from Utah mentioned, I don't think the \nFederal Government should be prescriptive. Allow the States to figure \nout what program works best. There are incentives to cover low-income \nfamilies. There are higher matches from the Federal Government, as it \nshould be. We should make sure the lower income families are covered \nfirst, and we do under CHIP. Children under the age of 19 may be \neligible for MCHIP, if their\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\nfamily income is at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level \nor up to $34,000 for a family of three. Our program has been a true \nsuccess. Enrollment has grown from about 38,000 enrollees in 1999 to \nmore than 100,000 today. In Maryland, the need has always exceeded \navailable funds. We actually spend more money than the Federal \nGovernment will give us. The Federal match through the CHIP formula \nestablished in 1997 is not enough to meet all the costs of the MCHIP \nprogram. Some States do not use their entire allotment, while other \nStates, such as Maryland, have expenditures that exceed their \nallotment. Congress has addressed this problem by redistributing the \nexcesses of the States that have them to States that have shortfalls. \nNow we must move forward for future years.\n  This is what we are doing on the floor of the Senate today. I thank \nChairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller for their efforts on this bill. \nThis bill will allow us to continue to cover children and families with \nincomes up to 300 percent of poverty. Maryland would also have access \nto contingent funds, if a shortfall arises, and additional funds based \non enrollment gains. With this new money, Maryland can cover an \nestimated 42,800 children who are currently uninsured over the next 5 \nyears.\n  There is another important part of this bill I wish to talk about for \na moment, section 501. It hasn't gotten much attention, but it \ncertainly has received a lot of attention around the country. Section \n501 ensures that dental care is a guaranteed benefit under CHIP. I \nagree with my friend from Utah, we need to set standards at the \nnational level. Dental benefits must be included. According to the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, dental decay is the most \ncommon chronic childhood disease among children. It affects 1 in 5 \nchildren between the ages of 2 and 4 and half of those between the ages \nof 6 and 8. Children living in poverty suffer twice as much tooth decay \nas middle- and upper-income children. Nearly 40 percent of Black \nchildren have untreated tooth decay in their permanent teeth. More than \n10 percent of the Nation's rural population has never visited a \ndentist. More than 25 million people live in areas that lack adequate \ndental services.\n  Next month will mark 2 years since a young man from suburban Maryland \nnamed Deamonte Driver passed away. He was 12 years old, when he died in \nFebruary of 2007 from an untreated tooth abscess. His mother tried to \naccess the system, tried to get him to a dentist. What was needed was \nan $80 tooth extraction. Because of the failure of the system to cover \nhis services, an inability to get to a dentist, Deamonte ended up in an \nemergency room. A quarter of a million dollars was spent in emergency \nsurgeries. He lost his life in the United States in 2007.\n  This bill will do something about it by covering oral health care, as \nit should. Deamonte's death has shown us that, as C. Everett Koop once \nsaid, ``There is no health without oral health.'' No children should \never go without dental care. I have said before, I hoped that Deamonte \nDriver's death will serve as a wake-up call for Congress. Section 501 \nof this bill shows that it has. We must never forget that behind all \nthe data about enrollment and behind every CBO estimate, there are real \nchildren who need care.\n  When I spoke about Deamonte Driver after his death, I urged my \ncolleagues to ensure that the CHIP reauthorization bill we send to the \nPresident includes guaranteed dental coverage. This bill does include \nguaranteed dental coverage. It also provides ways in which families \nwill have a better understanding of the need for oral health care. It \nalso provides ways in which families can access dentists who will treat \nthem under either the CHIP program or the Medicaid Program.\n  This legislation is a major step forward on dental care. We need to \ndo more. I want to acknowledge the work particularly of Senators \nBingaman and Snowe on oral health care. They have been real champions \nin this body in moving forward on these types of legislation.\n  This bill will also require GAO to study and report on access to \ndental services by children in underserved areas, access to oral health \ncare through Medicaid and CHIP, and how we can use midlevel dental \nhealth providers in coordination with dentists to improve access to \ndental care for children. The results of this study will give us the \ninformation we need to further improve coverage.\n  We still have to raise reimbursement for dental providers, and send \ngrants to the States to allow them to offer wraparound coverage for \nthose who have basic health insurance but no dental insurance. But \nthese provisions are an excellent start.\n  After two vetoes of a bipartisan CHIP bill by the former President, I \nam so pleased to stand here today on the floor of the Senate and \nexpress my strong support for S. 275. This is the week in which we can \nmake progress in covering people in this country, particularly our \nchildren, with health insurance. One week after the inauguration of \nPresident Obama, we are poised to move this bill through the Congress \nand to his desk so it can finally become law.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation, as we \nstart down the path to universal health coverage for all Americans.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 43 to Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendments Nos. 42, 43, and 44, \nand ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I do object. The reason, quite frankly, is \nthat we have worked out with the Republican leader that we would have \nthree amendments pending. We have those three amendments pending. I \nthink it is important we have an opportunity to act on those three \namendments. We certainly look forward to other opportunities where my \ncolleague will be able to offer the amendment, but at this point I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina retains the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President. I do not intend to speak on \nthem, so we would not use any time. I think it is important we have \namendments pending so our colleagues will have ample time to review \nthem.\n  I would ask the Senator to reconsider. Again, I am not going to speak \non them. I only want them pending so we can distribute them and people \ncan begin to see what is in them.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We would be pleased to allow the Senator to call up \namendment No. 43 but not the entire list of amendments the Senator \nsought.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I appreciate the benevolence, and I would hope the \nSenator would agree that all of these amendments at some point can be \nmade pending in the debate.\n  But I will call up only amendment No. 43 right now.\n  Mr. CARDIN. To point out to my friend, we already have three \namendments that are pending, and we are hoping to make progress, and we \nwant to get votes on these amendments. I will not raise an objection to \nsetting aside the amendment for the sole purpose of offering amendment \nNo. 43.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 43 to amendment No. 39.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require States to impose cost-sharing for any individual \nenrolled in a State child health plan whose income exceeds 200 percent \n                          of the poverty line)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REQUIRED COST-SHARING FOR HIGHER INCOME INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       Section 2103(e) (42 U.S.C. 1397cc(e)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3)(B), by striking ``and (2)'' and \n     inserting ``, (2), and (5)'';\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``Nothing'' and inserting \n     ``Except as provided in paragraph (5), nothing''; and\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Required cost-sharing for higher income \n     individuals.--Subject to paragraphs (1)(B) and (2), a State \n     child health plan shall impose premiums, deductibles, \n     coinsurance, and other cost-sharing (regardless of whether \n     such plan is implemented under this title, title XIX, or \n     both) for any targeted low-income child or other individual \n     enrolled in the plan whose family income exceeds 200 percent \n     of the poverty line in a manner that is consistent with the \n     authority and limitations for imposing cost-sharing under \n     section 1916A.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Obviously, I am disappointed in the process. It is important we let \nour colleagues know what amendments will be offered so we can begin to \ndiscuss them; and many times we have the opportunity to work these \nthings out, improve them before debate. Unfortunately, many times in \nthe past we have seen where the majority pushes the bringing up of \nthese amendments to the very end and then says we do not have time to \ndebate them. I hope that will not occur this time.\n  I have three good amendments. The one I just brought up I will not \nspeak on at this point but will mention the subject of that amendment. \nIt is a cost-sharing arrangement with the States that for all \nrecipients of SCHIP over 200 percent of poverty the States are required \nto ask for some small cost-sharing with people who use this insurance. \nIt is important that we look at this as a program that, hopefully, will \nmove people from a Government-sponsored plan to eventually a private \nplan, with our goal being every American is eventually insured with a \npolicy they can own and afford and keep.\n  So this would work with the States to require a small cost-sharing \narrangement with the beneficiaries who are 200 percent of poverty or \nmore, and it would not be more than 5 percent of income, and States can \ncharge as little as they would like. But the whole point is to begin to \nencourage personal responsibility and to let people know this is not a \npermanent giveaway but something they need to participate in.\n  I look forward to discussing this amendment in more detail along with \nmy other amendments sometime in the future. But right now, Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to review, in a \nsummary form, pertinent aspects of the legislation. I know we are going \nto be having a debate on various parts of this bill that have been the \nsubject of a lot of conflict in the last couple of days. But I think it \nis very important we kind of get back to the basics to talk about why \nwe are here.\n  We are not here to only debate several provisions of this \nlegislation. We are here to debate, in a larger sense, whether we are \ngoing to pass a children's health insurance bill this year, this month, \nor not. That is the fundamental debate we are having. We had the \nopportunity, in 2007, in a bipartisan way, here in the Senate to \nachieve a rare and, frankly, unprecedented bipartisan agreement on a \nsignificant piece of legislation, the result of which would have been, \nover a 5-year period of time, to insure 10 million American children.\n  I am not sure any other generation of Americans has had that \nopportunity. We had a bipartisan consensus in the Senate. It approached \n70 votes--in the high sixties--every time it was voted on; a veto-proof \nnumber of votes, a majority. It went to the House, of course. The House \ndebated it, and they had an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House. \nIt went to President Bush, and he vetoed it twice. Then it came back \nfor an override, and we were able to override it in the Senate, but in \nthe House they fell short. That is where we are. So because of the \nactions of President Bush, that bill never became law.\n  Now we are back to debating whether this Congress is going to provide \nhealth insurance to not just 10 million--it is now 10.6 million--\nAmerican children. We are either going to do it or we are not. All this \nother stuff is interesting to debate, and we will continue to debate \nit, but we are either going to do it or we are not.\n  Let me give you one example of what this means. Forget all the \nnumbers for a second and all the programs and all the quibbling about \nsome point of conflict. We will address those issues today, and I will \nas well. But let's get back to the basics: what this legislation means \nto a family.\n  For example, as a result of this legislation, if we do our job here \nand get this legislation passed, and if the House does its job and \npasses this legislation, millions of American children will have the \nopportunity for all kinds of good health care provisions, a lot of them \npreventive in nature.\n  We have a lot of discussions in this body where people talk about the \nworkforce and growing the economy and building a stronger skilled \nworkforce in the future. None of that means much unless you are going \nto do this, OK. A child will not develop, they will not achieve in \nschool, and they will not be productive members of our workforce unless \nwe pass legislation such as the children's health insurance bill.\n  I will give you one example: well-child visits. Anyone who knows \nanything about child development--I do not consider myself in any way \nan expert on this issue; others may--but we all know, as parents--\nforget legislators or experts--it is as parents we know how important \nit is to have a child go to the doctor a couple times, at a minimum, \nseveral times in their first year of life. It is a key time for parent \nand physician to communicate. Doctors recommend six visits in the first \nyear of a child's life.\n  Now, with this legislation we have an opportunity to guarantee that \nmillions more children will see a doctor six times in their first year \nof life. That is something we ought to do.\n  They get a complete physical exam. Height, weight, and other \ndevelopmental milestones are mentioned. Hearing and vision are checked. \nImportant topics, such as normal development, nutrition, sleep, safety, \ninfectious diseases, and all kinds of other issues, are discussed; \ngeneral preventive care.\n  Now, if we allow some of these discussions and debates today to bog \nthis down and not get it passed in a bipartisan way, what we are \npreventing is, among other things, millions of children getting this \ncare. It is as simple as that. So those who are going to use these \nother things to put them in the way as impediments or obstacles, to \nblock this legislation, should be reminded and the American people \nshould be reminded what they are stopping. This is not complicated. It \nis whether millions of children are going to have health insurance; and \none aspect of that care or that health insurance is a well-child visit.\n  The other point I want to make in the early going today is there is a \ngood bit of mythology that surrounds this legislation, and sometimes \nfacts are not put on the table. This is mostly a question of whether \nworking families are going to have health insurance. There is a \nfrustration now that so many families are living with the loss of a \njob, the loss of a home, the loss of their livelihood and, therefore, \ntheir hopes and their dreams.\n  The least the Senate should do, in the midst of what is arguably the \nworst economic circumstance in more than a generation--maybe the worst \neconomy we have faced since the 1930s; we can debate all that, but it \nis bad out there, it is real bad for families--the least we could do is \nto say, we may not have solved the larger health care challenge, we may \nnot have fully debated all the aspects of health care we are going to \ndebate and I hope we can vote on, but at least we can take an existing \nprogram that we know works, that is battle tested, that has results for \n15 years now--my home State of Pennsylvania; when my father served as \nGovernor, he signed this into law, which was the first big State to do \nit. He knew it worked. He knew it worked then, and he supported it \nstrongly. It has worked in Pennsylvania. We have over 180,000 kids \ncovered. This legislation would increase that to the point we could \nalmost cover every child in the State, for example.\n  But in the midst of this economy, the least the Senate should do is \nsay: We may not have solved all of our economic trouble, we may not \nhave even solved significant aspects of our health care challenge, but \nthe minimum--the minimum--this Senate and this Congress and this \nadministration should do is get this done, and get it done now.\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\n  All these other debates are interesting and important, but, frankly, \nsome of them are academic in nature. I know they have risen to the \nlevel of conflict, and I know the media likes to report on conflict. \nThat is their job. But a lot of them, compared to the gravity of what \nis at stake here, are academic, in my judgment. And I think for some--\nnot everyone but for some--they are deliberately calculated to stop \nthis legislation, deliberately so. I hate to say that, but it is the \nway I feel. We are getting down to the details now of getting this \ndone, and we have to be blunt and direct.\n  So we are going to have debates about parts of this legislation, but \nat the end of the day the question is whether the Senate is going to \nprovide millions more children with health care. That is the question. \nAll this other stuff does not amount to or does not rise to that level. \nThey may be important debates, but they do not rise to that level.\n  One more point, and I will yield because I know we have colleagues \nwaiting.\n  Seventy-eight percent of children covered by CHIP are from working \nfamilies--working families. I will get into some of the other aspects \nas well. But at this time I will yield the floor because I know we have \ncolleagues waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania a couple questions, if he might be so kind as to respond.\n  Your earlier statement was without this, children will not develop, \nchildren will not become productive members of our society.\n  Having taken care of 4,000 infants and done well child exams on them, \nwhat is the number of children out there who are not getting vision and \nhearing screens right now?\n  Mr. CASEY. Well, I don't have a number on them.\n  Mr. COBURN. The number is zero because every one of them is tested.\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me finish.\n  Mr. COBURN. I control the time.\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me finish the answer. If we do not pass this--if we \ndon't pass this, those children won't get that preventive care. It is \nas simple as that.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is simply not true.\n  Mr. CASEY. How are they going to get preventive care?\n  Mr. COBURN. They are going to get preventive care, and let me tell my \ncolleagues how. What is the number of children who are not getting \npreventive care in the first 6 months of life right now? We don't know \nthat number, and that is exactly the problem.\n  Here is the point: Every one of us wants children to get health care. \nIt is not about wanting children to get health care.\n  Mr. CASEY. This is the way to do it.\n  Mr. COBURN. The fact is, we have an SCHIP program now and a Medicaid \nProgram right now where we have 5.4 million kids who are eligible and \nwho are not enrolled.\n  What we are doing is exactly the opposite of what President Obama \nstated we should be doing. He stated that we should be being \nresponsible. I would contend that one of the areas of being responsible \nis to make sure programs work. When we have a program where last year, \non average, 5.5 million kids were covered and another 5.4 million kids \nwho were eligible weren't covered, I would tell my colleagues that \nprogram isn't working very well. It is not working. So what have we \ndone? We have expanded the eligibility with this bill.\n  The debate over how we cover all the rest of Americans--we will have \nthat debate, and I am sure we are going to have that debate this year. \nBut the fact that 51 percent of the eligible children under the \nprograms we have now, under the requirements we have now, are covered \nmeans 49 percent aren't. In this bill is a measly little $100 million \nto try to expand the enrollment of those kids who are already eligible.\n  I would think the average American out there who does have insurance \nor who may not have insurance might say: Well, why don't you make the \nprogram you have today work? We would have more kids covered than this \nbill will totally cover if we just made the requirements that the \nStates and Medicaid directors throughout do the outreach to get the \nkids who are eligible.\n  The fact is, most of the poor women in this country--up to 300 \npercent right now--deliver under either title XIX or Medicaid. Their \nchildren are covered the first year of life. They are not going to miss \nthe first well child visit. As a matter of fact, they are the ones--the \nbiggest problem we have is getting the people who have coverage to be \nresponsible and to bring their kids in. It is not about coverage; it is \nabout responsibility--the very thing our new President said we need to \nreach up to and grab.\n  The other point that has to be brought forward in this debate is \nthere is a lack of integrity with this bill. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhat it is. I do not doubt this Senator's integrity whatsoever. He is a \nfriend of mine. When he speaks, he speaks from the heart. But when we \nmanipulate the numbers and we drop a program from $13 billion to $8 \nbillion in the last year of the first 5 years of its authorization so \nwe don't have to meet the requirements of living within our means, and \nthen we transfer $13.2 billion so we lower the baseline--this is all \ninside baseball--what, in fact, we are doing is we are lying to the \nAmerican people to the tune of $41.3 billion. That is what CBO says. \nThat is what CBO says in a letter to Paul Ryan, the ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee in the House, that, in fact, because we \nmanipulated the numbers, because we cheated with the numbers, that it \nis actually going to cost $41.2 billion or $41.3 billion more than what \nwe are saying it is going to cost.\n  Why is that important? Because we have decided to pay for this with \none of the most regressive taxes toward poor people that we can. The \nconsequence is that we are going to tax them and then we are going to \nwink and nod to the rest of the American public to say: This $41.2 \nbillion, oh, don't worry about it; we are going to fudge the rules; we \nare not going to play the game honestly and with integrity. There is \nnot going to be change you can believe in because the Senate's bill \nwinks and nods at $41 billion. We all know that is there. We all know \nthat is the only way they can do it to where it is scored in terms of \npay-go.\n  So what we did is we paid attention to the numbers but not to the \nintegrity behind the numbers. So the American taxpayer in some way or \nanother will take on, from 2014 to 2019, an additional $41 billion. \nThat is not change, folks, regardless of how good our goal is, \nregardless that every Member of this body wants to see kids who don't \nhave care covered. Every Member wants to see that. We don't want the \nfirst child, we want every American covered--every American covered. \nBut to do that under the guise of ``integrity in our numbers'' puts us \nright back into the same problems that got us into the deep financial \nproblems we have today.\n  Let's be honest. Let's talk about what this bill really costs, what \nwe know it would cost if we didn't play a game with the numbers, and \nwhat we could do to offset some of the programs President Obama says \nneed to be eliminated so we can do the things that are good. There is \nnot one attempt in this bill to do that. As a matter of fact, there is \nan attempt to cover non-U.S. citizens at the expense of U.S. citizens \nin this bill.\n  So basically we are going to keep a 9-percent approval rating because \nwe are not going to earn the trust of the American people about being \nhonest about what something really costs. I want to tell my colleagues, \nthat undermines the whole debate. It sends us on a track to where we \nare going to be a Third World country because we won't even be honest \nabout what things really cost. There is nothing wrong with having an \nhonest debate about what this bill really costs, but to deceive the \nAmerican people on what this bill actually costs--actually costs and \nwill actually cost them--it is not going to cost us; it is going to \nactually cost them. It is going to cost them in terms of a lower \nstandard of living and less opportunity.\n  Let's get honest about what it really costs, and it really costs \n$41.2 billion more than what we say it is going to cost. Let's do the \nhard work. If the bill is such that the Senator from Pennsylvania \nthinks it is absolutely necessary so children will develop, so children \nwill become productive, isn't it worth getting rid of things that don't \nmake\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nkids develop and don't make them productive? Isn't it worth us taking \nthe heat to get rid of programs that aren't effective so we can \nactually pay for this? Instead, we are in essence lying to the American \npublic about the true cost of this bill. That is what has to stop.\n  The integrity of those who want to do this is fine. The integrity of \nthe numbers stinks. For us to say we are for children and have that \nhonorable position that we are for children, but at the same time we \nwant to undermine the faith in this place so they can't believe us in \nthe future because we are going to charge them $41.2 billion more than \nit actually costs says a whole lot about us.\n  Every child should have an opportunity for health care. Every child \nshould have prevention. Every child should get a hearing screen and a \nvision screen as we do now at every newborn nursery in this country. \nEvery child should get their immunizations at every opportunity when \nthey encounter--first at 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and a \nyear, their first year of life. The whole purpose for that screening is \nto see if development is not normal.\n  The Senator from Maryland talked about the mandated oral health care \nin this bill. The mandated oral health care in this bill is a direct \nconsequence of one of our other programs to help people. It is called \nfood stamps. When we look at the mix of food stamps, what do we see? We \nsee a high predilection for high-fructose corn syrup in the foods that \nwe use food stamps to buy which causes the very dental caries we are \nfighting. So do we fix the real problem or do we treat the symptoms? We \nought to be about fixing the real problems. So if we want to do and \nmandate oral health care in this bill, why don't we put a limitation on \nthe high-fructose corn syrup products and high-glucose products that \nare the No. 1 cause of the dental caries the kids are having? An ounce \nof prevention is worth a pound of cure. But we didn't do that.\n\n  We didn't come forward with a total plan on health care, which is the \nwhole problem as we try to expand this bill to meet a need. What we \nneed to do--and I think the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees--is we \nneed to reform all of health care. It needs to be based on prevention. \nIt needs to be based on prevention. It needs to be based on teaching \nand preventing disease rather than treating disease.\n  My hope is that when we come through this, whatever we do, win or \nlose--whether my side wins or the other side wins--what should happen \nis Americans should win. The American people should win. What that \nmeans is an honest debate about the numbers--not a game with the \nnumbers, an honest debate about the numbers--and what it really means \nis an honest debate about what the real problems are and not about \nthings that aren't the real problems.\n  We have plenty of money in health care. We don't need to increase \nspending in health care. What we need to do is redirect the spending \nthat is there. We spent $2.28 trillion last year on health care. Thirty \npercent of that money didn't go to help anybody get well or prevent \nanybody from getting sick. That is $600 billion. If we would look at it \nand say prevention is going to be No. 1, and No. 2 is going to be every \nAmerican insured, we could go a long way toward solving this problem.\n  Unfortunately, however, we have chosen to start off the new SCHIP by \ntrying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American taxpayer, by \nplaying funny numbers. Why would we leave that out there? Why would we \ndo that? It lessens the integrity of the debate. It lessens the quality \nof the work product we put forward. It undermines the very thing we \nneed most from the American people, which is their confidence that we \nare doing what is in the best long-term interests of the country. This \nbill isn't in the best long-term interests of the country. The bill \ndoesn't address the needs of the Medicaid populations out there today \nwho aren't served who could be served if, in fact, we should mandate \nthat the States go and do it. But we have chosen not to do that. We \nhave chosen to expand up the chain before we fix the problems down the \nchain. We have chosen to take dollars and give them to those who are \nmore fortunate instead of spending dollars on the people who are the \nleast fortunate in this country, all in the name of a movement to close \nin ultimately on a single-payer health system. Let's have the debate \nabout single-payer health system.\n  One final point I will make before I yield to my friend from North \nCarolina, and that is this: The most important thing after access is \nchoice. We know what. Medicaid offers little choice. SCHIP offers \nlittle choice. The reason is because we have a payment system that \nrewards specialty and doesn't reward primary care. It started with \nMedicare, and it has worked its way through Medicaid. So our average \npediatrician in this country makes about a fourth of what the average \nsurgeon does or about a fourth of what the average gastroenterologist \nmakes, and we ask ourselves: Why can't we get more pediatricians? Our \naverage family practitioner makes a little bit more than that, but not \nmuch, and we ask ourselves: Why can't we get people out there into \nprimary care? Our average internist makes just a little bit more but \nstill about a fourth of what the specialists make because we have \ndecided to pay it. Who is going to take care of them? Let me tell you \nwho is going to take care of them: PAs and nurse practitioners. Some \nare excellent, some are great, but none of them have the training of a \nphysician. We are slowly walking to a health care area where we are \ngoing to tell people you have coverage, but the coverage is you do not \nhave choice and you do not have the same level of care because we have \nnot chosen the priorities of compensating primary care, compensating \npediatricians, compensating pediatric dentistry, compensating \ninternists to care for these kids.\n\n  Choice is the most important thing, and the reason is because if a \nmother is taking her child to a health care professional in which she \ndoes not have confidence, do you know what happens? She does do what \nthey say.\n  As we eliminate choice, which is what happens in SCHIP and Medicaid \nbecause so few physicians take it because the reimbursement rate is so \nlow, we eliminate the doctor-patient relationship in establishing the \nconfidence necessary to make sure, as the Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaid, that these kids will develop, that they will become productive.\n  The idea behind this whole program is we have taken away the most \nimportant attribute of consequences of care, and that is confidence in \nthe provider.\n  I yield to my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I know our colleague from North Carolina \nhas been waiting. I wish to make a couple brief points and come back to \nthem. Our colleague has been waiting.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma makes a number of interesting points. Some \nof them are going to be the subject of even more debate. I will make a \ncouple brief points about the question of enrollment and, therefore, \noutreach.\n  One of the biggest problems with the veto and the blockage of the \nchildren's health insurance legislation in 2007 was we did not have the \nresources to do the kind of outreach, to enroll those who are eligible \nbut not enrolled. We would have gotten as many as 3.3 million more \neligible kids had the 2007 bill not been blocked. Point No. 1 on \noutreach.\n  This bill, in fact, has steps to improve enrollment. In fact, it \nprovides bonuses if States do a better job of enrolling children. We \nwill get back to that in a moment.\n  The point about single payer that the Senator made, we are going to \nhave a lot of debate about philosophy on health care overall and where \nthis whole health care debate is going to go. That statement is \npremature or unrelated to what we are doing today.\n  What we are doing today is talking about whether we are going to pass \nthe children's health insurance bill, not some new program but a \nprogram that has been tested. We want to add millions more children to \nthat program.\n  The final point--and I know our colleague has been waiting--is the \nquestion of choice. The Senator from Oklahoma made a point about what \nchoices people will have if they are enrolled, if families are enrolled \nin SCHIP, Medicaid or any other program of its kind. The problem for a \nlot of families right now is not that they are lacking in choice of \noptions; the problem for a lot\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nof families, if their children are not enrolled, is they have no \nchoice, they have no health insurance at all, except if they want to go \nto the emergency room, which is bad for the economy and bad for that \nfamily because it is usually too late in the game, so to speak, to get \nthe kind of preventive care or to mitigate a problem.\n  For a lot of families right now, this is not a question of choices. \nThey have no choice because they have no health insurance. I will come \nback to this point, but I wish to yield for my colleague from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I do \nnot wish to dwell on what he said, but let me make this point. He said \nwe are not here to talk about the bigger health care piece. From the \nstandpoint of the bill, he is exactly right. This is another attempt to \ngrow the size of a Federal Government program to include more Americans \nin it without taking on the tough task of debating how we fix health \ncare in this country; and what are the reforms that have to take place \nso every American has the opportunity to be insured.\n  Let me cite some facts about the Baucus bill. The Baucus bill spends \n$34 billion over 5 years. Actually, it might spend more than that based \non CBO. It increases the number of enrollees in SCHIP by 5.7 million \nchildren. By the way, 2 million of those children are currently covered \nunder their parents' insurance. Let me say that again. We are spending \n$34 billion over 5 years to increase enrollment in SCHIP by 5.7 million \nchildren, and 2 million of them are already covered under their \nparents' health care insurance.\n  When our benefit gets bigger, when it becomes even more inclusive, \nwhat happens? We say to the American people: Why should you pay for it? \nWe have a government program to cover your children instead.\n  There is an alternative, and it has already been offered in one of \nthe first three amendments. It is the McConnell amendment, Kids First. \nIt spends $19.3 billion over the same 5 years. It enrolls 3.1 million \nnew kids. For $19.3 billion, we get 3.1 million kids, and for $34 \nbillion over 5 years, we only get 3.7 million new kids when you \nconsider the 2 million that are already insured. The American taxpayers \nought to ask us: For the additional 600,000 kids who are uninsured \ntoday whom we would be pulling in under the Baucus bill, what does it \ncost them per child? The answer is $4,000.\n  Having just had a son who reached an age in college that he can no \nlonger be under my insurance, I was amazed when I tried to get this \ncollege senior insurance. Naturally, I turned to the Federal Government \nI work for and said: Surely you have a plan already in place for my \nchild and the other 2 million Government workers who might fall into \nthis classification.\n  They said: We certainly do. We have negotiated with the same \ninsurance company for the same coverage that your son was under when he \nwas covered by you.\n  What is the annual cost of that? I said to the Office of Personnel \nManagement.\n  They said: $5,400 a year. Mr. President, $5,400 a year. The \nGovernment negotiated for my 22-year-old, healthy-as-a-bull son to be \ncovered under the same insurance plan he had before.\n  What did I do? I picked up the phone. I called the university. I \nsaid: Surely you have plans for kids whose insurance runs out. They \nsaid: We certainly do. We have it with this company, it is this plan. \nIt was the exact same coverage I had as a Federal employee. I asked the \nmagical question I would ask anybody: How much does it cost per year? \nThe answer: $1,500. One phone call and I saved $3,000 for a 22-year-\nold, healthy-as-a-bull college senior because I no longer let the \nFederal Government be a part of his health care decisions. I took him \nout. For $1,500, my son was covered. For every year under that 22 years \nof age, an amazing thing happens. Children get cheaper to cover. They \nget cheaper to cover because they are less likely to have serious \nillnesses.\n  The most likely period of illness for somebody under 18 is what Dr. \nCoburn referred to, the first year of life. That is why we make sure \nthat in that first year of life, every kid gets the exams they need to \nmake sure they are on the path to not only a successful life but a \nhealthy life.\n  One should not be amazed to find out that the average cost for \ninsuring someone under 18 years old is about $1,200 a year for full \nhealth coverage, compared to $4,000 under the Baucus bill. But what are \nwe debating here today? This was the part, from my colleague's earlier \nstatement: If we allow discussions and debates to bog us down, then \nthis is a huge mistake. That is what he said.\n\n  We are having a discussion and a debate about what the American \ntaxpayers are willing to pay for a benefit. We all agree the SCHIP \nprogram should be expanded. But some of us believe we ought to have the \nbigger debate now about how we fix the American health care system. How \ndo we walk away from the Senate Chamber confident that every American \nhas the opportunity to have a health insurance policy?\n  But, no, we have decided not to do that. We have decided to take one \nlittle piece--kids. Why? Because every American wants to do something \nfor children. I want to do it. But I am also inclined to do the right \nthing for kids, not just anything for kids.\n  It was said earlier that this was a bipartisan bill. Let me point out \nfor my colleagues and for those paying attention to this debate, when \nthis legislation passed the Finance Committee, it got one Republican \nvote. I am not sure that is the bipartisan measurement tool President \nObama said he needed when he was sworn in as our 44th President. As a \nmatter of fact, he is aggressively coming to the Hill in about 1 hour \nto meet with Republicans to talk about the stimulus package because he \ndoes not want a stimulus package to just barely pass. He wants \noverwhelming bipartisan support. But bipartisan support was just \ndefined here as when one Republican votes with every Democrat to pass a \nbill.\n  An amazing thing, if you look back to 2007--excuse me, 2008, I think \nit was--when a bipartisan SCHIP bill did come out of the Finance \nCommittee. The ranking member voted for it, and the second highest \nranking Republican in seniority voted for it. They came to the floor \nand spoke on it. Chairman Baucus--it was his bill. There was bipartisan \nsupport. So, what happened this year? Why didn't we start with the \nbipartisan bill we had last year? They took everything Senator \nGrassley, everything Senator Hatch incorporated into the bipartisan \nbill, and they ran right over them. They threw it out. If you see \nsomething on the floor in the Senate today, it is road kill. That is \nwhere Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch were thrown aside. Not in an \neffort to reach bipartisanship, but in an effort to be prescriptive as \nto exactly what SCHIP said and who it covered.\n  Make no mistake about it, when Senator Chuck Grassley comes to the \nfloor--and every Senator in this Chamber understands it--and says that \nwhen you strike the 5-year waiting period before legal immigrants can \nget benefits, you have now opened the insurance program to new legal \nimmigrants to America who have a responsibility, which is accepted by \ntheir sponsor, to make sure they do not accept Federal Government \nbenefits. In other words, they are not at the taxpayer trough for at \nleast 5 years.\n  What did we do with that important legal safeguard in this bill? We \ndiscarded it. We said: No, we will let you at the taxpayer trough. We \nwill let you there on day one, even though when you came into the \ncountry you and your sponsor said: I will not do that for 5 years.\n  Not only did we do that, we actually threw away the verification that \nthey are legal. We no longer under SCHIP will require a photo ID of \nsomebody who walks in to be enrolled in SCHIP. All we say is you have \nto have a name and you have to have a Social Security number, one of \nwhich can be made up, the other of which can be bought. It is an \namazing thing. We see it every day.\n  We have had every sort of immigration debate on this Senate floor. We \nare building a wall along the border today because there is an \nimmigration problem. Yet we have now said: You know what, let's forget \nabout that part about sponsorship when you come to this country \nlegally. Let's forget about the obligation that your sponsor had to \nmake sure that for 5 years they were there for the financial assistance \nyou\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nneeded. And, oh, by the way, in case there are folks out there who \nmight not be here legally, let's not require them to show a photo ID to \nmake sure the person who is in line matches the name they gave us and \nmatches the Social Security number that was provided.\n  What we have done is we have opened a tremendous loophole. I am all \nfor making sure, as I said earlier and Dr. Coburn has said, we want to \nmake sure every American has health insurance. I am not trying to cut \nanybody out.\n  But if we want to target those people who are here legally for under \n5 years, or those people, for heavens' sake, who are here illegally, \nthen we should integrate them into a health care system that works.\n  Today, cost shifting alone in the American health care system costs \n$200 billion a year. If we are talking about having a debate on health \ncare, let's talk about how to eliminate that $200 billion that doesn't \ngo to prevention, doesn't go to wellness, doesn't go to insurance \ncoverage. It goes to a big black hole that doesn't deliver health care \nto any American.\n  As I stated, this is not a debate about health care reform. It is a \ndebate about growing a Federal Government program.\n  The SCHIP statistics: 7.4 million children were enrolled in SCHIP in \n2008, a 4-percent increase over 2007. Yet, if you look at the devil in \nthe details, there were only 5.5 million enrolled on average per month; \n7.4 million total enrolled, 5.5 million on average throughout the year. \nAnd 5.4 million additional people are eligible for Medicaid or for \nSCHIP in this country and are not enrolled. Exactly what Dr. Coburn \nsaid earlier to my good friend from Pennsylvania. We have 5.4 million \nchildren who, today, are eligible for Medicaid or for SCHIP but are not \nenrolled.\n  I remember when Dr. Coburn and I held up the President's PEPFAR bill, \nwhen we were talking about an increase in funding from $15 billion to \n$50 billion for AIDS treatment in Africa. There was only one thing, \nwhen they increased substantially this amount of money for the program, \nthey also dropped the requirement that 50 percent of the funds actually \nbe used to treat people living with AIDS or HIV disease. They said we \nwould leave that up to the NGOs implementing the program.\n  In other words, the NGOs said: To get any further into the population \nof people who have HIV and AIDS, that is going to be really tough. \nRather than attempt to do something tough, we were going to lift the \nrequirement that 50 percent of the money had to be spent on medical \ntreatment.\n  So, what are we doing here? Now we have gotten to the SCHIP \npopulation that is tough--5.4 million kids who are eligible for \nMedicaid, eligible for SCHIP but are not enrolled. What are we saying? \nOK, States, we know it is tough to get to that 5.4 million kids so we \nare going to allow you to expand the pool you are able to solicit for \nthis program. We are going to increase the percentage of Federal \npoverty that you are going to be able to include in this program--and I \nmight say this to my good friend Senator Ben Cardin, who served in the \nHouse with me, not only did I vote for this program, I helped craft the \nfirst SCHIP bill. I remember the laborious days when we sat trying to \nfigure out exactly how to structure it, a program that was designed for \nStates to run, for us to target those kids in America whose families \ndid not have enough income to afford health care for them but had too \nmuch income to be eligible for Medicaid. It was targeted specifically \nat the families who were over 100 percent of the Federal poverty level \nbut under 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  That may be Greek to a lot of folks, so let me point out: At 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty level for a family of four, a person \nearns $44,000. Now we are up to 300 percent of poverty in SCHIP and 300 \npercent of poverty is $66,000 a year. But there is an exception, \nbecause New Jersey currently has a waiver to go up to 350 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level in SCHIP. That puts them at $77,175, for a \nfamily of four.\n  What about the Baucus bill? The Baucus bill also allows, for New \nJersey and New York, the ability to go up to 400 percent of poverty--\n$88,200 a year for a family of four.\n  For God's sake, do not lecture me on what SCHIP was designed to try \nto do in this country. We are leaving 5.4 million kids behind today who \ncurrently are eligible, and then you tell me there is some rational \nreason why we should roll over and pass something without a debate that \nincreases the eligibility from where I had it targeted at $44,000 a \nyear and raise it up to $88,200 a year. Why do others think we need to \nincrease the eligibility? It is simple. Because it is too hard to reach \nthe 5.4 million children who are below 200 percent or 300 percent of \npoverty who are eligible but not enrolled today in this country.\n  On another topic, the Medicaid FMAP in this country ranges from 50 \npercent to 75.9 percent with a ceiling of 83 percent, meaning that is \nhow much the Federal Government gives to the States for our portion of \ntheir Medicaid payment. SCHIP offers a higher Federal match than \nMedicaid. The SCHIP match ranges from 65 to 83.1 with a ceiling of 85 \npercent.\n  If you listened to me list the numbers, I think you can figure out \nwhat is going on, on the Senate floor today. Why do some want to \nincrease the eligibility limits? It is because, for some States under \nMedicaid, they get a 50-percent match, but under SCHIP they get a 65-\npercent match. So, you want to expand SCHIP eligibility because then \nthe Federal Government is picking up 15 percent more of the tab. Why \nwouldn't some want the parameters of SCHIP to increase if we are \nletting the State off the hook for 15 percent of the cost they are \nobligated to cover?\n  As a matter of fact, in full disclosure, let me say that in North \nCarolina our SCHIP match rate is 74.8 percent, and our North Carolina \nMedicaid match rate is 64.6 percent.\n  I think it is important also to remind my colleagues that in the \nBaucus bill, even though it limits the SCHIP match rate to children and \nfamilies below 300 percent of poverty, it still does allow Medicaid to, \nin fact, wrap around that. I call it the Medicaid sandwich. Medicaid \ncovers people up to 100 percent of poverty, SCHIP fills in right here, \nand then Medicaid goes back right on top.\n  I am not sure there is a rational, sane person in the world who would \ndesign the health care system we currently have. Yet we are on the \nSenate floor today, and we will be here tomorrow and the next day and \nwe will probably be here the entire week, and we are here trying to \nrationalize why this program needs to be reauthorized in its current \nform, why we should drop things that have been bipartisan in the past \nso we can increase the enrollment size to include somebody here legally \nbut under sponsorship, or people here illegally but who want to be \ncovered. We are here to debate whether the eligibility parameters \nshould be increased.\n  I return to my colleague from Pennsylvania, to another one of his \nquotes. He said ``all this stuff doesn't rise to the level.'' Well, I \nbelieve it does. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. But I believe \nthis stuff does rise to the level of Senate debate. I believe it rises \nto the level of public disclosure.\n  The American people look at SCHIP. And I might note, Mr. President, \nwe had this debate last year as we got ready for reauthorization, when \nall of a sudden SCHIP dropped the ``S.'' I noticed, with the first two \nspeakers on the majority side today, that everything refers to the CHIP \nprogram. I assume I have not picked up the provision in this bill yet \nthat eliminates this as a ``State'' program, and now it is going to be \nonly the ``Children's Health Insurance Program,'' run by the Federal \nGovernment, administered by the Federal Government, and the States will \nnot have anything to do with it.\n  I haven't found that provision yet but, then again, we have not had \nthe bill long enough to read all the nuances of it. We have had it long \nenough to read the budget aspects of it, and I think Dr. Coburn alluded \nto that very effectively.\n  CBO says the Baucus bill spends, in fiscal year 2012, $14.98 billion. \nRather than continue that spending level for SCHIP into 2013, the bill \nsomehow drastically reduces the allocation to only $5.7 billion in \n2013.\n  Let me cover that again. In 2012, we allocate $14.98 billion for \nSCHIP, almost $15 billion. But under the bill's\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nstructure in 2013, we allocate only $5.7 billion for the health care of \nthat same population. Somehow we are either going to lose two-thirds of \nthe kids under the program or we are miraculously going to find another \n$9 billion.\n  You know, numbers like $9 billion appear frequently up here. It is \ncalled debt. It is called debt on our children and our grandchildren. \nWe make it up, we print it, we fund it, it goes into place.\n  I might add, I am not sure I am the only one who caught onto this. I \nthink Senator Baucus caught onto it too when he wrote the bill because \nin 2013 he also has a one-time charge of $11.4 billion, not counting \nthe 2013 allocation. I was worried that I might not have read the \nnumbers right the first time until I looked at 2013 and I found the \none-time charge.\n  He just doesn't want that amount included as a score under the 5-year \ntimeline. Why? Because as Dr. Coburn said, we are being less than \nhonest with the American taxpayer. We are suggesting that this program \ncan be run for X and we know it is going to cost Y. How in the world \ncan we take something up as serious as children's health insurance and \nlie about the numbers? If we lie about the numbers, how do we expect \nthe American people to believe us when we say we are only covering 300 \npercent of poverty, or we are only covering kids?\n  On that point: We are only covering kids? I know it will be shocking \nto some--probably not to all--to find out that we currently cover \n334,616 adults under the SCHIP program: 334,616 adults under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Why? Because we allowed States to \nincrease the eligibility under waivers because it was too tough to find \nthe 5.4 million kids who were eligible under the original structure of \nthe SCHIP bill that we wrote and passed in 1997.\n  In 1996, we conceived a plan, passed in 1997. It went for 10 years--\n$40 billion. It went for 10 years, $4 billion a year. Before we had \never gotten to the end of the 10 years we already changed the \nparameters, already changed the eligibility, we already put more money \ninto it. We knew 10 years ago, now 11, soon to be 12 years ago, we \nneeded to fix our health care system. We didn't do it under the Clinton \nadministration, we didn't do it under the Bush administration, we \ndidn't do it in the 104th Congress, 105th, 106th, 107th, 108th, 109th, \n110th, 111th--well, maybe in the 111th Congress. We are in the 111th \nnow.\n  And regarding the assertion that we should not have this health care \ndebate? We should have this debate. We should fix it. For once, the \nSenate ought to step up and say let's quit continuing to do something \nthat we know is broken and let's fix it. Let's not just increase \neligibility of a broken program, let's fix the program. Let's not just \ntalk about supplying an insurance product to a certain segment of \nAmerica. Let's do it for everybody. Let's have an honest debate and \ndiscuss whether every American ought to be insured and let's have a \ndebate as to how we get there.\n  Over the next 2 days we are going to talk extensively about this \nprogram. Today a Grassley amendment has been offered--it strikes the \nability for legal immigrants to be brought into the program during \nthose first 5 years. And a Hatch amendment which is very clear. If a \nState wants to bring in other people into the SCHIP program, then they \nhave to verify that they have reached a threshold where 95 percent of \nthe eligible kids are enrolled in the program. Mr. President, 95 \npercent of all the eligible kids would have to be in the program in \norder for this to be expanded--I think this is reasonable. If you are \nconcerned with covering children, then I think this is a slam dunk \namendment, and I might add it was part of the bipartisan bill last \nyear.\n  The last amendment is Kids First, offered by Leader McConnell. I \nmight reiterate one more time, it spends $19.3 billion over 5 years.\n  It increases the enrollment in SCHIP by 3.1 million kids, as opposed \nto the Baucus bill that spends $34 billion over 5 years that increases \nenrollment by 5.7 million but does it by enrolling 2 million kids who \nare currently under their parents' insurance. That means our additional \ncosts, the cost to the American taxpayer, is $4,000 per child for the \nadditional 600,000 kids who would have health insurance for the first \ntime under the Baucus bill because they are currently uninsured.\n  But we have options. We will have more amendments. We will have more \ndebates. I look forward to working with my colleagues on what I think \nis a very serious piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, a couple of points: Obviously, based upon \nwhat my two colleagues have said this morning, we do not agree on a \nnumber of points. That is pretty obvious. But I think there is one area \nof common ground which maybe we can make progress on; that is, the \npoint that was raised by both the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator \nfrom North Carolina about the eligible but not enrolled.\n  I know one of the biggest problems over time, for example, in \nPennsylvania with this program has been that you have a great program \nbut not enough people know about it. If you do outreach by way of \ntelevision advertising, that is the most effective by far, but any kind \nof outreach would be welcomed certainly by me and by those who are \nsupportive of the legislation. The problem is, if we do not pass this \nlegislation, all of the good intentions that I think are evident in \nwhat was said about getting people enrolled is without merit. So that \nis an area on which we can agree.\n  I have to say, one of the things I get from this chart with the \ncarriers on it, one of the points that has been made about this is, \nbecause it is a Federal and State program that is obviously supported \nby public resources, the impression is that somehow it is a 100-percent \npublic program, it is just growing government, and the usual arguments \nthat are made against it.\n  I understand the philosophy behind it. This is often lost; that this \nis indeed now for 15 years, and will be, a very successful public-\nprivate partnership. These, for example, are in Pennsylvania, the \nprivate providers for the Children's Health Insurance Program in our \nState: Aetna, Ameri Choice, Capital Blue Cross, First Priority Health, \nHighmark, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania, \nKeystone Health Plan, Unison Kids and UPMC for Kids. This is the very \ndefinition of a successful--remarkably successful--public-private \npartnership where hundreds of thousands of children in our State and \nliterally millions across the country have been provided health \ninsurance.\n  With regard to the numbers, where are we now in terms of covered \nversus not covered under this program? Nationally, the covered number \nis 6.7 million right now. The number of children who are not covered \namounts to 4.1 million children. And 83 percent, or 3.4 million of \nthose 4.1 million uninsured covered by the legislation are currently \neligible.\n  So we have all of these children, more than 4 million children, who \nare eligible but are not enrolled. Some of the issues we talked about \nearlier about enrollment, simplifying paperwork, and eliminating \nbureaucratic areas, we should work on that, and that is what is \ncontemplated by this legislation: funding for outreach and enrollment, \nwhich has been pushed by people in both parties in connection with this \nlegislation, and incentives to States to encourage them to provide \ncoverage for those who are eligible but not enrolled.\n  The point was made also about bipartisanship. Look, the definition of \nbipartisanship does not mean unanimous. I realize in the Finance \nCommittee there was more Democratic support than Republican support. \nBut the fact remains this program, the birth of this program and the \ncontinuation of it, has been bipartisan. The votes in 2007 were \nevidence of that, and I think even the debate today and the support--I \nshould say more than the debate--the support is bipartisan.\n  When this is voted on in the Senate, you will have a lot of \nDemocratic support, obviously, but you will also have significant \nRepublican support. That is the definition of bipartisan, in my \njudgment. Maybe it is in the eye of the beholder, but I am trying to \nemphasize this is indeed bipartisan.\n  We are going to have time today in the hours ahead of us on the \nquestion of immigration. Two points I wanted to make: One is the 5-year \nbar. Basically,\n\n[[Page S866]]\n\nwhat we are talking about is a restoration of something that was in \nplace before. Prior to 1996, lawfully residing immigrants, those \nholding green cards and those defined as ``permanently residing under \nthe color of law,'' those individuals, prior to 1996, were indeed \neligible for Medicaid. And this amendment, the Rockefeller-Snowe-\nBingaman-Kerry-Wyden, a lineup of names that is bipartisan, by the \nway--that amendment offers a restoration of eligibility for only some \nof these immigrants: children and pregnant women who are here \nlawfully--lawfully--who intend to remain in the United States and who \nmeet all other Medicaid and CHIP eligibility requirements. That is what \nwe are talking about. We are talking about children, legal immigrant \nchildren, and pregnant women.\n  Removing the 5-year bar could help States provide coverage to \nadditional low-income children. What do we mean by that? You would \nthink, listening to this debate, that removal of this is somehow \nbrandnew, that it has never happened before, and no States are doing \nthat. In fact, right now 23 States use their own funds to pay for \nhealth coverage for lawfully residing immigrants, immigrant children. \nLet me say that again: lawfully residing immigrant children or pregnant \nwomen, those 23 States, during the 5 years, who have become ineligible \nfor Medicaid or CHIP. If this 5-year waiting period were removed, these \nStates could secure Federal matching funds which would free up State \nfunds to cover additional low-income children.\n  So this is something States are wrestling with now, and what this \nwould do is provide an option for States to have some help in the \ncoverage they are providing for those individuals. So it is nothing \ndramatically new, but I think it is humane, and it is prudent based \nupon what has happened with this program over time.\n  Let me make one other point about the issue of legal immigration and \nthe so-called public charge: Nothing in the bill changes the agreement \na person makes when sponsoring an immigrant, when an immigrant comes to \nthis country. Citizenship and Immigrant Services, so-called CIS, does \nnot consider participation in a public health program a failure to \nsupport the immigrant. Longstanding Citizenship and Immigration Service \nguidance makes it clear that immigrants will not be considered a public \ncharge if they use health care benefits, including Medicaid and CHIP, \nprenatal or other low-cost care at clinics. So when we are talking \nabout this issue, it is important to put that on the table, what \nCitizenship and Immigration Services would consider to be a public \ncharge.\n  I want to get back to some of the provisions in the bill. I wanted to \nget that chart on rural children. One of the discussions we have had \nover many months now is, Who benefits from this program? Certainly, \nchildren across the board, children in urban and suburban communities. \nBut what is often not emphasized is--and I want to make this point \nbecause I have a significant part of our State that is rural, and most \nof our State, when you get outside of the major urban areas of \nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh, is indeed rural. Rural children are more \nlikely to be poor. Nearly half of rural children live in low-income \nfamilies at or below 200 percent of the poverty level.\n  In this economy, when you consider the confluence of bad \ncircumstances for rural children and rural families, here is what you \nhave: escalating costs for energy, which disproportionately affects \nrural Americans; significant job loss in rural communities; an \ninability to have access to health care--I should say a lack of access \nto health care in rural communities. All kinds of problems.\n  This bill, among the many other good things it does, would have a \ndisproportionately positive impact, in my judgment, when you look at \nthe data on rural children. Rural children increasingly rely on \nchildren's health insurance. More than one-third of rural children rely \nupon the Children's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid. One-third of \nrural children rely upon one of these two programs.\n  So in this debate it is important that we stress the broad reach of \nthis bill as it pertains to children from across the board, across the \ndemographic and even economic landscape.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will make this short because I know we have a swearing \nin.\n  I wanted to make a few points. When President Obama talks about being \nresponsible, if you sign an affidavit that you will cover and be the \nsponsor for a legal immigrant in this country, you ought to do that. \nThat is what he is talking about. He is not talking about: I will do it \nuntil I can get someone else to take care of my responsibility, talking \nabout it, if you sign an affidavit that you will do it.\n  The idea that 22 States already do this is great. If States want to \ndo it, that is what makes our Union so great, that 22 States can, \nexcept now they cannot afford to do it, and we are going to be bailing \nthem out to the tune of about $300 billion on Medicaid and SCHIP \nprograms in the supplemental or the spending package or the stimulus \npackage that is coming through.\n  What this bill is going to do is make permanent that people do not \nhave to be responsible when they, in fact, sign an affidavit that they \nwill sponsor a legal immigrant.\n  One final point I would make is, the Senator from Pennsylvania listed \nall of those premium assistance programs that Pennsylvania has because \nthat is what they are, premium assistance rather than a regular SCHIP \nprogram. Well, in this bill you have extremely limited any new premium \nassistance programs without an absolute mandate and an absolute mandate \non what kind of program you have. You will be in an HMO. You will not \nhave the doctor of choice, and you will not go where you want; you will \ngo where you are sent.\n  So great points, great need in our country, great debate, but \nintegrity first. Be honest with the numbers about what they really \nmean. Everybody in this Chamber knows they are not, but we are not \ngoing to change that. Even if we offer an amendment, it is not going to \ngo anywhere because nobody knows what to get rid of to be able to \nafford to pay for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S866-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today with the advent of the 111th \nCongress, the Senate is considering legislation to renew and expand the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, sending a clear and definitive \nmessage that this country will no longer turn its back on our 9 million \nuninsured children.\n  When we pass this bill, we will make it clear that the health and \nwell-being of our children--in bad economic times or, in the future, in \ngood economic times--the well-being and health of our children comes \nfirst.\n  After 2 long years and repeated vetoes from former President Bush, \nthis legislation finally has a chance of becoming law, thanks to the \nsupport of a new President who is committed to reforming our Nation's \nhealth care system.\n  It is my sincere hope that the passage of this legislation will be \nthe beginning--the beginning--of a major overhaul of American health \ncare, which ultimately will provide all Americans with the quality, \naffordable health care coverage we all deserve as Americans.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is a success story. It was \ncreated about 13 years ago, in 1996, to provide health coverage to \nchildren who would otherwise not be insured. The program provides \nhealth insurance to low-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid \nbut who are unable to afford private coverage, to reduce the number of \nuninsured children in working families--underscore that, Mr. President: \nin working families--by about one-third.\n  Despite its huge successes, there is room for improvement. Sadly, \nmillions of American children remain without health insurance, even \nthough the law states they are eligible for it.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to take decisive action to bridge that \ngap and to reach children who need this coverage desperately but who \nare not receiving it. The legislation before us today would provide \ncoverage to an additional 4.1 million uninsured low-income children. It \nwould improve access to dental coverage. It would improve the public \nhealth by enabling legal--legal--immigrant children to receive care in \ndoctors' offices rather than taking them to more high-cost, less \nprimary care, emergency rooms.\n  If signed into law, S. 275 would have a profound impact on children \nand families nationwide, including in my State of Ohio, including \nToledo and Akron and Canton and Mansfield and Cincinnati and Bellaire. \nIt would provide approximately $294 million to Ohio in fiscal year \n2009, helping my State cover approximately 245,000 uninsured children--\nchildren such as Emily Demko from Athens County.\n  Emily was born with Down Syndrome. When her mother Margaret made the \ndecision to stay at home to care for Emily, their family found \nthemselves without health insurance. The Demkos looked into many \noptions, but no private insurer would cover Emily, at any cost, due to \nher genetic, preexisting condition. Luckily, the Demkos found they were \neligible for Medicaid. However, during their 6-month reauthorization \nmeeting, they were informed their income was--get this--$135 per month \ntoo much to qualify any longer. Mr. President, $135 too much to qualify \nfor Medicaid any longer.\n  Since Emily's medical bills were in excess of $3,500 a month, the \nDemkos had to make decisions no parent should ever have to make. They \nhad to decide what therapies and treatment they could afford for their \ndaughter.\n  Although they have done their best to manage Emily's medical care, \nbeing uninsured has left Emily without access to needed hearing tests, \ncorrective treatment for an eye condition, and several blood tests to \nscan for conditions likely to occur with Down Syndrome.\n  It is for children such as Emily that we must support the \nreauthorization and the expansion of CHIP. Access to health coverage \nwill provide Emily and so many others around our great Nation with the \nopportunity to live a healthier, happier, more productive life, \nregardless of their medical condition.\n  For the third time in my Senate career, I have come to this floor to \nadvocate for the reauthorization and expansion of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. I did it in the House 13 years ago, when this \nprogram was first conceived and when we first enacted it.\n  For the third time in my Senate career, I have come to the Senate \nfloor to speak on behalf of the 9 million children in this country who \ndo not qualify for Medicaid but whose families cannot afford health \ninsurance.\n  For the third time in my Senate career, I have come to this floor to \ncast a vote in favor of legislation which will enable parents to help \ntheir children when they are ill. In my opinion, there are few \nlegislative or ethical priorities more important than that.\n  This is the third time I have advocated for CHIP on the Senate floor. \nI believe, I hope, the third time will be the charm.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, there was an amendment offered earlier by \nSenator Hatch with whom I sit on the Health, Education, Labor and \nPension Committee. Senator Hatch has played a major role in health \nissues in this country and I respect him for that. His amendment, \nhowever, to this bill is sort of the same old same old. We have seen \nthis throughout the Children's Health Insurance Program debate. We saw \nit last year both times when the President vetoed the bill. We saw it \nraised by opponents in the House of Representatives. We saw it raised \nmany years ago. When the amendment says States should have to enroll at \nleast 90 or 95 percent of their kids under 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level before they can enroll children at higher income levels, \nit pretty much says no more children in the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I wish they would simply be more direct saying, We don't want \nmore kids in here. Instead, they say if you can't find close to 100 \npercent of these children who are eligible--this is a big country, it \nis a complicated country; so many of the people we are trying to insure \nare living economically on the margins. There are two children with a \nsingle parent who has moved from one job to another. Those children \noften move across town or to another county as their mother or father \nget another job--a job that may pay $20,000 a year and a job without \nhealth insurance--so the Children's Health Insurance Program is so \nimportant to them. So when they build in this ``standard'' that \nvirtually everybody--95 percent of all children eligible have to be \nenrolled before you can enroll new children who are a little bit better \noff--a little bit better off isn't a family making $100,000 a year; it \nis a family making much less than that without health insurance and \nsimply can't afford it. Even mandatory programs we have found around \nthe country don't have a 95-percent take-up rate. It is simply \nimpossible for Government or for private businesses\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nor for social services working with Government to get to 100 percent of \nthe people who are eligible. So what this does is say no more children \nwould enroll.\n  We know health insurance is becoming less and less affordable for \nfamilies at every income level. I know what has happened in my State. \nAs the Senate majority leader told us earlier today--an hour ago--\n85,000 people in this country lost their jobs today. Eighty-five \nthousand people lost their jobs today. In my State, we have lost \n200,000 manufacturing jobs in the last 8 years. It was 200,000 as of \nlast October. That number has gone up. We hear about plant layoffs such \nas the third shift at Lordstown in northeast Ohio, a General Motors \nplant that assembles goods. As the Presiding Officer knows from what \nhas happened to his plant in Delaware, we know what happens when people \nare laid off from these jobs. They cut off the third shift at \nLordstown. We are seeing Wilmington, DHL in southwest Ohio, 7,000 jobs \nover a several week period have been terminated in a city of about \n13,000 people. That DHL plant is the largest employer in a six-county \narea, in each of these six counties--in Clinton County, Brown County, \nAdams County, Highland County, and two other counties.\n  The point is we don't want with this economic downturn--we don't want \nto turn back the clock. It is the worst possible time to cut back on \nStates' tools for helping low-income children. We want these children \nto become insured, not to find ways to deny coverage. The Hatch \namendment does that. That is why it is so important later today, if and \nwhen we vote on this amendment.\n  Another point. There are about 150,000 children in my State. My State \nhas a population of around 11 million. There are about 154,000 of our \nchildren in my State--enough to fill Ohio State Stadium. The Presiding \nOfficer, even though he is from Delaware, is an Ohio State graduate. He \nknows how big that stadium is. It holds more or less 100,000 people in \none place--Columbus--in the heart of the State. There are 150,000 \nchildren who don't have insurance, enough to fill that stadium one and \na half times. That number grows. That was sort of yesterday's number. \nThat number grows every day. Ohio has already lost 100,000 jobs in this \nrecession. If the pace of job loss accelerates this year as expected, \nmore and more children will suddenly become uninsured. President Obama \nhas already said the 2009 economy is going to be even worse than the \n2008 economy. That is why Senator Inouye and so many others in this \nbody, Senator Mikulski and others on the Appropriations Committee, are \nworking so hard to put a stimulus package together that will have an \nimpact as quickly as possible as we work our way through the second \nyear of this recession.\n  In these tough economic times, the risk of being uninsured is even \ngreater. Many Ohio families, as we know too well, are only one \nemergency room visit away from bankruptcy and foreclosure. Too many \nhave declared bankruptcy, too many people have lost their homes to \nforeclosure, too many people have lost their jobs to this recession. We \nshould not turn our back on them in providing health insurance to their \nchildren. Again, these are mostly people who are eligible for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, mostly children in families where \nmom or dad or mom and dad have jobs and simply are not making enough to \nbuy health insurance and those employers for whom they work simply \ndon't have the ability to provide insurance to these families. That is \nwhy this legislation is so important. That is why defeating the Hatch \namendment is so important.\n  I would add that in the Hatch amendment, the 95-percent rule is \nespecially for those who want to enroll legal immigrant children and \npregnant women. Again, that is a standard I don't think we can meet, \nbecause no matter how hard these States try, they can't find 95 percent \nof the people who are eligible. That will mean too many children of \nlegal immigrants, legal people in this country, too many pregnant women \nsimply would not have insurance for their children that we should offer \nthem in this body.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the legislation that is before us is a \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, but it is, \nas I said yesterday in my remarks, seriously flawed in a number of \nrespects. Because of that, the minority leader, the Senator from \nKentucky, and I have offered an alternative. It is called the Kids \nFirst Act. The Kids First Act is an effort to reauthorize this \nimportant program but address the numerous flaws in the pending \nproposal so we can adopt something that literally puts kids first.\n  I spoke yesterday about several of the problems with the underlying \nbill. First, the problem of crowding out private coverage. We created \nthis Children's Health Insurance Program in order to help families who \ndid not have insurance. But the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office \nhas noted that because of provisions in the underlying bill, there are \nactually over 2 million people--in fact, 2.4 million people--who will \ngo to the Government insurance program who already have private health \ninsurance that is perfectly adequate to their needs. The reason \nprimarily is because their employers obviously appreciate the fact that \nit is costing them money to insure their employees' families and it \nwill be a lot cheaper if those families go to this Government-run \nprogram. Our effort was never to cause people to leave the health \ninsurance coverage they have to come to a new Government program. Our \neffort, when we adopted the kids insurance program, was to provide \ninsurance for those who did not have it already.\n  This crowdout effect is well known, and it is well understood. It can \nactually be quantified as the Congressional Budget Office did. Last \nyear, we offered a couple of amendments to ensure that the crowdout \neffect would be minimized. The amendment I offered was not adopted. But \nrecognizing that there was a serious problem, when the Democratic \nleaders in the House and the Senate wrote the bill that ended up \npassing both the House and the Senate, though it was vetoed, it was \nsupported by Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate, and it \nhad some language related to crowdout. I thought it was insufficient \nlanguage, but nevertheless I understood the necessity of dealing with \nthe issue.\n  That language is not in this bill. So in the committee, I offered the \nDemocratic language. The Senator from Montana, the chairman of the \ncommittee, helped draft it. As I said, it was supported by Democratic \nmajorities in both the House and Senate. Essentially on a party-line \nvote, that amendment was rejected.\n  We need to deal with the problem of crowdout. The legislation Senator \nMcConnell and I have drafted does put kids first. It tries to deal with \nthe problem of kids who do not have insurance rather than taking \nfamilies who are already insured and transferring them to a Government \nprogram.\n  Another problem we spoke of is the fact that as this program has \nexpanded, it does not just relate to families who are at the poverty \nlevel or even twice the poverty level but three and four times the \npoverty level. In other words, it can actually cover families in two \nStates--up to $88,000 a year in New York and about $10,000 less than \nthat in New Jersey. That is clearly wrong. We are trying to talk about \nlow-income families. In fact, if you add other assets of a family that \nare not counted in income, you could literally have $40,000 in \nadditional assets and, in New York, be making $128,000 a year for a \nfamily and be eligible for this low-income children's health care--\n$128,000-a-year income. That is wrong. What that does is take money \nfrom the State of the Senator from Oklahoma, it takes money from my \nState of Arizona and other States and transfers that. We are trying to \nbe as frugal as we can. Our limit is 200 percent of poverty. That is \ntwice the poverty level. That is what we pay for in Arizona. But we are \nhaving to pay for more than twice that much for families in New York. \nThat is not fair. The program Senator McConnell and I have offered as \nan alternative deals with that problem as well.\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\n  In addition, we ask that people demonstrate that they are eligible \nfor this coverage. That has always been a part of the program. The bill \nthat is before us weakens those provisions so that you do not have to \nhave the same kind of documentation that you are eligible for the \nprogram. It expands the program to legal immigrants in this country who \nhave always had a contract that they will not become part of our public \nwelfare system.\n  One of the really interesting things is the budget gimmick that is \nused which Senator McConnell and I believe should not be part of this \nprogram. It is a budget gimmick to circumvent the Senate's so-called \npay-go rules by which we ensure whatever the costs are, there is a way \nto cover those costs. The way that is done is that the program, even \nthough it is a 10-year program, as all of our authorizations are--after \n5 years, there is just an assumption that it does not cost very much \nanymore. Of course, under that assumption, we would have to disenroll \nmillions of people from this program. That is never going to happen. \nEverybody knows that. Everybody knows that gap in financing would be \nfilled, and as a result, the program would actually cost $40 billion \nmore than it is alleged to cost as the bill came out of the committee. \nAnd that is by CBO's number, $41 billion-plus.\n  Those are some of the deficiencies with the legislation.\n  The amendment Senator McConnell has offered, the Kids First Act, is \nvery targeted and I think a much more responsible approach to the \nproblem. It does reauthorize the children's health care insurance \nprogram. It preserves health care coverage for millions of low-income \nchildren. It actually adds 3.1 million new children to SCHIP. It \nminimizes the reduction in private coverage, the so-called crowdout I \nspoke about earlier, by targeting SCHIP funds to low-income children, \nnot higher income families who may already have access to insurance. By \nthe way, it is offset without new tax increases or a budget gimmick \nsuch as the program before us is.\n  I encourage my colleagues to ask us questions about this amendment. \nIf they have concerns about it or would like to debate, I would love to \nhave that debate on the floor, if anyone would like to engage me in a \ndiscussion about why this is not a superior alternative.\n  The bottom line is, we have two choices. We have a budget buster that \ndoes not protect SCHIP coverage for low-income children, that \nrepresents an open-ended financial burden on taxpayers and takes a \nsignificant step toward Government-run health insurance or the \namendment Senator McConnell has filed, a fiscally responsible SCHIP \nreauthorization that preserves coverage for low-income children. It is \nfully offset without a budget gimmick or a tax increase, and it \nminimizes the so-called crowdout effect on employer-sponsored health \ncoverage that people have today.\n  I think the answer is clear. The Kids First Act is the right \nsolution. And when we have an opportunity to vote on that, hopefully a \nlittle bit later this afternoon, my colleagues will take a good hard \nlook at it and see if they don't agree that is a good approach to the \nreauthorization of SCHIP and support the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona. The minority leader filed this amendment in \n2007. It was not a good idea then. It simply knocks too many children. \nThese are not rich kids. These are sons and daughters of people who are \nworking who are not making a lot of money, are not making enough that \nthey have health insurance or can afford out-of-pocket health \ninsurance. They are working for employers who do not provide it--small \nbusinesses, lower income workers. I don't want to do anything that \ntakes away the eligibility of those children.\n  When I hear about the crowdout provision Senator Kyl discussed, I \nwant to make a couple of comments about that. I just don't think it \nexactly is going to work that way.\n  The CHIP statute already requires States to determine and monitor \nwhether crowdout is occurring and adopt policies to limit crowdout if \nit does occur. Most States that cover children at more moderate income \nlevels have imposed 3- or 6-month waiting periods to prevent families \nfrom dropping employer-based coverage to enroll in CHIP. There may be a \ntime when families are not going to want to do that.\n  It is not as though States want to give away this money. States are \nsqueezed today every bit as much as many families are squeezed. States \nalready have a strong interest in monitoring and preventing crowdout. \nThey don't want to spend limited resources on children who already have \nprivate health insurance.\n  This bill does a good job of targeting the lowest income children. \nThe new enrollment options, the performance bonus, and the outreach \nfunding all help to achieve everyone's shared goals to ensure that the \nmost vulnerable are covered.\n  We accept that our friends on the other side of the aisle want to \ninsure people at 100 percent, 150 percent of poverty, but we also want \nto extend this to families who still do not have insurance for their \nchildren because of their economic situation. These are not \nCongressmen's kids. These are children whose parents are working at \nplaces that do not offer insurance and do not make enough money that \nthey can out of pocket come up with health care coverage for their \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wonder if anybody has ever asked the \nquestion--it has certainly never been answered--if you are a family and \nyou qualify at the new 300 percent and you are buying your own \ninsurance and you are covering your two kids, what happens when you \ntransfer your kids to SCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program? \nWhat happens to your premium? I can tell you what happens to the \npremium. Do you know what happens to the premium? It goes down zero \nbecause health insurance is sold as an individual or a family product. \nSo by taking two children, if I am earning 300 percent of poverty, and \ntaking them off and transferring--now I am paying for it--and \ntransferring that to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the \ntaxpayers of this country now will pay for that premium about $2,200 a \npiece when you can buy it in the private market for $1,100 a piece, but \nthe parents will get no decrease in their insurance premium. That is \nwhy the crowdout provision is so negative for the American taxpayer and \nthe generations that follow us.\n  My friend, the Senator from Ohio, mentioned that everybody wants to \ncover the 200 percent and below. The fact is, we have done a terrible \njob of covering the 200 percent and below. There are 5.4 million \nchildren out there today who do not have health insurance, whose \nparents do not have health insurance, who are eligible for Medicaid and \nSCHIP today, and they are not signed up. What are we doing? We are \nexpanding a program that has only gotten about 51 percent of the kids \nwho are eligible right now signed into the program. We are also being \ndishonest about what it costs. It is actually going to cost $42 billion \nmore than what we say it is going to cost. Nobody will deny that. So \nwhy would we not want to have something that will limit the amount of \ncrowdout because as we take money for kids who are now insured and put \nit to them through a Government program, it means these same 5.4 \nmillion kids are still not going to get covered.\n  We have not improved the program by increasing the eligibility. What \nwe have done is we have just moved the income scale up to $60,000, some \n$62,450 a year, and we say: We will now cover your kids, and even if \nyou have them covered now, you will not get any break from your \ninsurance. But the same 5.4 million kids who are in poverty or at 200 \npercent of poverty still are not covered.\n  What are we doing? Why wouldn't we want to fix it to where all the \nkids who are out there today who do not have insurance, who are 200 \npercent and below the poverty level, why aren't we making sure they are \ncovered? Why are we not doing that? Why are we not saying: States, you \ncan go to the 300 percent if you want but only after you have covered \nthe kids whom the program was designed for in the first place.\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\n  There is an amendment by Senator Hatch in that regard. Why would we \nspend all this extra money?\n\n  By the way, we just met with the President. Other than the short-term \nfinancial struggles we are in, one of the big concerns with him is the \nfact that we have an unending entitlement disaster before us and we are \ngetting ready to make it worse. Why would we not address that? Why \nwould we say we are going to help kids but not really help kids? Why \nwould we say we want to help the poorest children and the families who \nneed it the most but still ignore them?\n  There is an answer to it. There is an answer to it, in that we want \nto move whichever way we can to eventually have a single-payer system \nin this country. We gutted the Premium Assistance Program. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania listed all the great things about the Premium \nAssistance Program. He listed all the different programs in \nPennsylvania. Those are gutted under this bill. You can have one, but \nby the time you get it, nobody will want to have it.\n  We have taken what people have and said maybe we could spend $500 per \nkid per year to keep them in a health insurance program that the \nparents might have at work, but instead we are taking them all out and \nputting them in a Government program that costs twice as much as it \ndoes to buy them the same insurance in the open market.\n  Crowdout is a real phenomenon, but the most important thing is it \nhelps the people who need it the least the most. And it helps the least \nthose people who need it the most. That is what we are doing in this \nbill. We are not helping the lowest. We are only moving it up the chain \nand we are saying if you make $62,000 a year in this country, your \nchildren can be covered by the Government.\n  Why would you not want to do that? We do not have any other \nGovernment program that people do not voluntarily take if we put it out \nthere. That is in the face of the fact that this year--hear my words \nvery clearly--this year the true Federal budget deficit will be $1.6 \ntrillion. The Government will spend $24,000 per family more than it \ntakes in. Hear those words--$24,000 more per family it will spend than \nit takes in.\n  What is the future to be for this child at the 300 percent above \npoverty level? Their parents make $62,000 and we are going to give them \nthis gift of health insurance today. But you will not be able to afford \na college education. You certainly will never afford a home. It is \ndoubtful you will ever be able to afford a car that is reliable. You \nwill be in a debtor nation. Those are the consequences of our actions \nin the name of wanting to expand a program that today is highly \nineffective in addressing the needs of the real poor children in this \ncountry.\n  Why would we do that, and just say: Don't worry, you have a pricetag \nto pay if you ever hope to get out of college or have the ability to \nget out of college? By the way, we are going to up your taxes if you \nget out there and get it up here on the front end.\n  This body is abandoning the very principles this country was built \non. This country was built on a heritage of sacrifice, sacrifice by the \ncommon man for the common good to create a great, bright shining future \nfor the generations that follow. This bill doesn't fit with that \nheritage. This bill, as a matter of fact, undermines that heritage. In \nthe name of helping children, we are hurting those children's children. \nWe are stealing opportunity from those children's children.\n  As I said earlier this morning, I want every child in this country \ninsured. If we took the money that was out there today in Medicaid and \nSCHIP and the State contribution to it, we could insure every child in \nthis country. We could create an insurance policy for every child in \nthis country that gives them total screening exams, could give them \nprevention care, could give them acute care, and could give them \nhospital care. Yet when we run it through the Government, it costs \ntwice as much because of the inefficiencies that are inherent in the \nsystem.\n  Later on I am going to offer a limitation based on improper payments. \nThe American public may not know this. Certainly Members of Congress \nknow. We do not know how much money is wasted in Medicaid because \nMedicaid has refused to report it. By law they are mandated to report \nit. They have refused to report it. We now have the information on 17 \nStates on improper payments. The average is 10.5 percent on the 17 \nStates we have looked at. Of that, 90 percent of those are \noverpayments. In New York City alone their own inspector general said \nat a minimum $15 billion a year is wasted in fraud, abuse, and deceit \non the Medicaid Program. Where have we addressed any of that in this? \nWhere have we put the safeguards to make sure this doesn't happen here? \nWe have not done that.\n  We are not fixing the problems that are in front of us. What we are \ndoing is creating more problems in the name of expanding a children's \ninsurance program and limiting the future of the things that have been \nvery successful with it, such as premium assistance, and taking that \naway.\n  There is going to be crowdout and the crowdout is going to benefit \nthe most wealthy of the upper middle income because in some States, by \nthe time you count exclusions, you can earn $120,000 a year and have \nyour kids on SCHIP. We are going to help them. But not the kids of the \nparents working at $7 an hour, both of them, making $28,000 or $30,000 \na year, of which half of them are not on either Medicaid or SCHIP. Why \nwould we do that? Do we truly care about children's health? Are we \nreally about trying to solve it?\n  Where are the ideas of combining where the biggest health care \ndisparities are in our country? We know where those are. Why not design \na program to go and attach and direct health care dollars to the large \nhealth care disparities? We know it pays big returns in terms of \nchildhood obesity, in terms of precluding the onset of smoking, in \nterms of prevention and vaccinations, in terms of well-child care? Why \nwould we not look at where the problems are and try to direct dollars \nto where the problems are? Instead, we are going to allocate across \nthis country, to those who can now afford it, we are now going to start \npaying for it.\n  Even if we wanted to do that, why would we do it at twice the cost of \nwhat you could buy in a private market? Mr. President, $1,156 is the \naverage market cost to insure a child in this country. Why would we \nspend $2,200 to get the same thing? So we can say we did something?\n  If, in fact, you could take $1,156 or $1,200 for every child out \nthere--we have more than enough money with what we are spending today \nto accomplish that--we could buy them all an insurance policy.\n  I am not sure this bill is about children. I am not sure it is about \nchildren's health care. I have some doubts when we are not frugal. If \nit is about children's health care now, it is certainly not about those \nchildren's long-term financial security, when we are not even going to \nbe honest with how much this bill costs. We have pulled a trick so we \ndo not have a pay-go rule, and the trick keeps us from offsetting $42 \nbillion in expenses associated with this bill. Everybody knows that. \nNobody will say that is not right. Nobody wants to talk about that. \nThat is what is wrong.\n  That is why people do not have confidence in the Congress. It is \nbecause we have this sleight-of-hand. We want to do something good but \nwe don't want to tell you what it costs and we don't want to get rid of \nprograms that don't work in order to be able to do something good. We \nare going to hide it under the blanket. So we are hiding $42 billion \nunder the blanket. We are playing the inside baseball game, not being \nhonest with the American people about what it costs; not being honest \nwith the American people that it is a lot cheaper to give premium \nassistance than it is to give a program directly to a child; not being \nhonest about the fact that this costs twice as much as what you could \nbuy a health insurance policy for, for every child in this country.\n  We are not being honest at all, so our integrity is in question. \nWould we do the right thing in the long term for these kids that we say \nwe care about their health care? I do not have the confidence we will. \nI have the confidence that this train is going to roll, we are going to \ndo it just the way we have done it. There are still going to be 5.4 \nmillion kids out there 10 years from now, when we look at eligibility. \nIt will be the same 5.4 million under the 200\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\npercent of poverty level that we did not reach, that we didn't get out \nand actually make a difference. And then we are going to pay a larger \ncost as they mature as adults because what we could have prevented will \nnot have been prevented, what we could have taught will not be taught, \nand the health care costs associated with that will be tremendous.\n  Mr. President, 5.4 million children are presently eligible for either \nSCHIP or Medicaid and we have done nothing to make sure those kids get \na program that is readily available to them today. We have done \nnothing. We put $100 million in for outreach and said we will feel good \nabout it because maybe that will reach some of them. We will still have \nmillions of children who are eligible for these programs who will not \nget it.\n  We are going about approaching it the wrong way. We ought to be \nsaying let's have a bill that insures every American child. Let's do \nthat. Every American child, universal access with an insurance policy \nfor every American child, why won't we do that? That is what we should \nbe doing. Let's do it for every child. Then the insurance rates on \nadults will modulate and then husband and wife will not be paying a \nfalsely elevated price once their kids get pulled off of their \ninsurance policy and go into a Government program. Why not buy them all \nsomething, from then until the time they are 21, that covers them, that \ngives them the prevention care, that gives them the counseling, that \ngives them the immunizations? We know what it costs and we know what we \ncan do it for. Why not do that?\n  Instead, we have created this complex, convoluted system that can be \ngamed. The estimate on Medicaid fraud--listen to this--the estimate on \nMedicaid fraud is $60 billion a year. That is enough to pay for where \nwe cheated on this program if we would get rid of 10 percent of it a \nyear over the next 10 years, if we got rid of 10 percent of the fraud. \nThere is nothing in here on fraud. There is nothing in here to make the \nStates accountable for the money we send out there.\n  We have done a poor job. We claim we want to help children, we claim \nwe want children to have health insurance, yet we mortgage those very \nchildren's futures by not being honest about how we are going about \ndoing it, about how we are going to pay for it and what the ultimate \nresults will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate as always, even when we \ndisagree, the words of the Senator from Oklahoma. He and I have worked, \nfrom our time in the House, on international health legislation \ntogether. We come at things from very different perspectives. But I \noften come down in the same place. I would love to hear more about his \nplan on children's health, to extend universal coverage to all \nchildren.\n  I was driving to the airport this morning after leaving my mother in \nMansfield, and heard Bill Considine, who is the president of Akron \nChildren's Hospital, one of the premier children's hospitals in my \nState and in our country. Mr. Considine, the CEO of that hospital, had \nsome interesting things to say about what I believe he called Kids \nCare, which may be similar to what Senator Coburn was talking about.\n  I hope we can work some things through there. I want to disagree, \nthough, for a moment briefly with Senator Coburn's comments about we \nabsolutely want to--we do not want 50 percent of children covered who \nare at 200 percent of poverty or 300 percent or beyond for that matter.\n  We obviously want to do better. We have done generally fairly well \nlocating those children and signing them up, those children who are \neligible.\n  This legislation goes a good bit further, and the efforts to, if you \nwill, encourage and find those children who are eligible and sign them \nup, those efforts have been very bipartisan in the last dozen years.\n  The Presiding Officer from Vermont has been part of this. He has \nalways had an abiding, intense interest with what we do with children's \nhealth care. I extend this back a couple of sessions ago--Senator \nFrist, the Republican leader, and Senator Bingaman, a Democrat from New \nMexico; and Senator Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, with Senator \nBingaman; and at other times Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, \nSenator Hatch a Republican from Utah--all of them have been part of, \nand many on my side of the aisle have been part of, finding ways to get \npeople to sign up, simplification of paperwork and bureaucratic \nrequirements, including language directly from legislation introduced \nby Senators Lugar and Bingaman; providing funding for outreach and \nenrollment, which is language originally introduced by Senators Frist \nand Bingaman and pushed and supported by Senators Grassley and Hatch in \nthe legislation in the last Congress.\n  It provides for incentives for States to encourage and to provide \ncoverage for those eligible but unenrolled children. We can certainly \nlearn from Senator Coburn to do more, but this legislation is replete \nwith provisions to bring in more children. It does not mean we do not \nenlarge the eligibility to 300 percent of poverty, nor does it mean we \ndo not look down the road, I hope, sooner than later with the \nrelationship that Senator Coburn has built with President Obama, both \nas freshmen Members of the Senate and since Senator Obama has become \nPresident, to work together in finding ways to do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments. \nThere is an easy way to solve this; it is called auto enrollment. You \njust write a bill. Anybody in any region under 200 percent who has a \nclaim of deduction for children is automatically enrolled in SCHIP or \nMedicaid. It is not hard. We do not want to do that. Why are we not \ndoing that? Because we do not want to help all of these 5.4 million \nchildren. We do not want to do that.\n  We have all of these incentives that have not worked in the past. We \nhave done all of these things. All you have to do is auto enrollment. \nWe can write a law. We can pass it. We can say: The IRS can look at \nevery family who has children under 200 percent who files a tax return \nor files for the earned income tax credit, and their children are \nautomatically enrolled. They automatically get a notice that says: Here \nis your insurance. Here is your State card. You have coverage.\n  It is not hard. We can do that. But we have not done it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wanted to pick up where I was before \nlunch. I am glad to see my good friend from Ohio. We were having \nconversations before lunch on this bill. Clearly, it is an important \npiece of legislation.\n  As Dr. Coburn and I said before lunch, I think every Member of the \nSenate, I think every Member of Congress, and probably everybody in the \ncountry believes it is important that we cover children; that the \nprevention and wellness aspects of having coverage means we have a \nhealthier community; that we take those who, by the way, are \nhistorically more healthy, younger folks, and we give them the \nassurances of check-ups and the ability to visit a doctor so that we \nminimize anything that can happen to them. In 1996 and 1997, the \nSenator from Ohio and I were both on the Energy and Commerce Committee. \nWe were involved in crafting the original legislation. I remember it \ntoday as well as I do then. The legislation was targeted at a specific \ngroup of our country's children: those over 100 percent of poverty \nwhose families made too much for Medicaid but those with not enough \nincome between their parents to be able to afford health care at the \ntime.\n  My gracious, health care has done nothing but get more expensive \nsince 1997. We appropriated and authorized $40 million for a 4-year \nprogram. The target--I can't remember what the target was for the \nnumber of kids--but today, at 100 percent of poverty for a family of \nfour, they would have an income of $22,000. At $22,000 they apply for \nMedicaid, regardless of what State they live in, and health care is \nprovided under Medicaid for that family.\n  As Dr. Coburn pointed out, I think rather clearly, for Medicaid and \nSCHIP today, we have probably eliminated access to about 40 percent of \nhealth professionals because they choose not to\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nparticipate in the programs. Why? It is because the reimbursements are \nso pitiful in those two programs, regardless of the State. Doctors have \nchosen to opt out of providing that care and focus just on the Medicare \nand private market or just on the private market.\n  So just the creation of Medicaid and SCHIP means we have eliminated \nsome choices for these people where this coverage is their only option, \nit is their safety net. Now, if I had my druthers, I would rather be \nhere debating overall health care reform because I believe every \nAmerican should have the ability to be insured.\n  I am not sure I would have much disagreement in Congress or in \nAmerica on that. We will have a big disagreement on how we get there, \nbut we can get there. Were we to have that debate today, we would not \nbe here talking about the expansion of one program that hits a small \ngroup of Americans and is targeted to put them in a one-size-fits-all \nprogram that only 40 percent of the health care professionals even \nparticipate in.\n  Now, having said all of that, SCHIP is up for reauthorization. We are \nnow 10 years down the road, and we are talking about, How do you change \nthis bill to apply what we have learned? Can we reach new efficiencies \nin cost? Can we cover more people? If so, how? Which States have done \nwell? Which states can we learn from? Which have done poorly? Which \nstates should we work with in the legislation to try to prod?\n  Well, we find in this legislation that in 10 years, we have moved \nfrom 200 percent of poverty to 300 percent of poverty. I do not have \nany big disagreement with that, with the rise in health care costs. \nThree hundred percent of poverty for a family of four is $66,000 a \nyear.\n  So under this program--SCHIP currently, not under the reauthorization \nbill--if a child lives in a household that has an income of $66,000, \nabove $22,000, they are eligible in several states for SCHIP today.\n  So what is our experience so far? As we get ready for this \nreauthorization, we have 7.4 million children enrolled in SCHIP in \n2008. But the average monthly enrollment for 2008 was 5.5 million, \nmeaning that somewhere, somehow we have had almost 2 million drop out. \nThey have moved to a different State. The income of their family \nchanged. They are no longer eligible. So 5.5 million covered children \ntoday seem to be sort of the fixed point.\n  Well, how many are eligible today but not covered? I think my \ncolleagues would be amazed to find out it is 5.4 million. We are \ncovering 5.5 million, but we are not covering 5.4 million who are \neligible under today's guidelines.\n  So in typical Washington response, what do we do? We come out with a \nreauthorization that expands the eligibility. Already we have in place \na waiver where New Jersey can currently go up to 350 percent of \npoverty. Well, what is that? That is $77,175. Now in the \nreauthorization bill, we are going to grandfather the 350 percent, and \nwe are going to go up to 400 percent for New York. What is 400 percent? \nWell, that is $88,200. How do those 5.4 million who were eligible \nbefore get enrolled? Well, the answer is, they are not. This is what \nDr. Coburn was talking about. How about the kids nobody is going out to \nenroll? Do auto enrollment. It is easy.\n  But that is not what this bill is attempting to do. This bill is \nattempting to increase the eligibility to get a bigger slice of America \neligible for Government programs so that at some point the number of \nfolks who are on Government programs--Medicaid, Medicare, SCHIP, VA, \nthe list goes on--is well over 50 percent of America, and then the die \nis cast. We go to a single-payer system. The Government runs it, the \nGovernment tells us how much we get, the Government tells us where we \ngo, and the American taxpayer pays for everybody.\n  Now, here is the decision the Senate has--the House has already voted \nthis bill out. We have a decision whether we are going to stand up for \nthose 5.4 million. Those are the tough ones. Those are the ones who did \nnot walk into the door and raise their hand when their parents were \ntold they were eligible and say: I want to enroll. I would like health \ncare. I would like prevention. I would like a primary care doctor. I \nwould like a medical home. No, they are the 5.4 million children who \nare out there to whom no State is reaching out. They are just letting \nthem fall by the wayside. Rather than focus on the 5.4 million, we are \nfocusing on how we increase eligibility, how we change the income \nparameters.\n\n  Let me point out New Jersey, which is grandfathered to 350 percent of \npoverty under this bill, ranked 47th in the country at enrolling \nchildren who are at 100 percent to 200 percent of poverty. Let me say \nthat again. A State that we have allowed to be grandfathered in at 350 \npercent of poverty ranks 47th out of 50 in the United States at \nenrolling kids between 100 and 200 percent of poverty.\n  As a matter of fact, 28 percent of their children are uninsured in \nthat 100 to 200 percent of poverty. Yet once again we are going to \ngrandfather them and allow this incredible expansion to continue. So \nwhere is their focus? Let's go after the easy ones. Let's go after the \nones in families who are easier to find and who are easy to enroll.\n  Well, why does that happen? Let me point out to my colleagues, \nMedicaid gets a matching rate from the federal government, depending \nupon which State you are from, and that rate is from 50 percent to \n75.9, with a ceiling of 83. So as the State makes a Medicaid payment of \n$1, depending upon what State you are from, the Federal Government \nreimburses anywhere from 50 cents to 83 cents.\n  But if you are enrolled in SCHIP, the range goes from 65 to 85. So if \nyou are on the bottom, if you are a State on the bottom, why would you \nlobby for expanded eligibility? It is because if you are on the bottom, \nyou are going to have an increase in the Federal share of what you pay \nout from 50 to 65 cents. It is 15 cents of every dollar. You are crazy, \nif you are a State, for not lobbying for this because you are going to \nspread the cost over the entire taxpayer base. It makes a lot of sense \nif your focus is not on 5.4 million children and how they get covered \nand how they get health care.\n  If you are only focused on how you get a bigger piece of the Federal \npie, if you are only focused on how you get a bigger share of space at \nthe trough, then this makes a tremendous amount of sense. But from the \nstandpoint of developing health care policy, it makes absolutely no \nsense whatsoever.\n  I don't take my position just looking at one section of the bill. Dr. \nCoburn pointed out, as I did earlier, that the financing of this bill \nis suspect. In fiscal year 2012, which is the last of 5 years, we \nallocate $14.98 billion to fund the program, almost $15 billion. Yet in \n2013, the bill reduces the allocation to $5.7 billion. How do you have \na health care program for children, with all these people enrolled, \nthat is sucking up $15 billion a year, and all of a sudden, the next \nyear it drops to $5.7 billion? The answer is, you don't. We all know \nit. The reality is, you have to go to the next 5-year period to find \nthe answer. The answer is, starting in year 6, out of the next 5-year \nbudget, we do a one-time payment of $11.7 billion on top of what it \ncosts us to run the program for 2013.\n  So what does that mean? Frankly, it means the accounting methods used \nin Washington are not accounting methods any family in America could \nuse because their creditors would walk in the door and shut them down. \nYet we get up here every day and claim we do things just like people at \nhome. In fact, we know when it comes to budgets, there is no American \nfamily who can get away with what we get away with, especially when it \nis this obvious. One year it costs us $15 billion. The next year it \ncosts $5.7 billion. There are only two ways you accomplish that. You \neither reduce enrollment drastically or you magically come up with the \nmoney and you stick it in and say: Oops, we didn't understand that was \ngoing to happen.\n  We understood it was going to happen. It is done to fit the \nparameters, to get around pay-go rules so you can actually take this \nmoney and stick it right onto the deficit and the debt of the country. \nIn other words, we are going to provide our children health care with \none hand, and we are going to rob their financial future with the \nother, all at the same time. It is miraculous that we would even \nattempt to do this. At least we could ask for honesty and transparency \nin how we are funding this program.\n  It is important that we sort of recap. What is SCHIP? I think a lot \nof people\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nwho might not have been in Congress very long, certainly weren't here \nin 1996 and 1997 when we passed it, people across the country might be \nsaying: I have never heard of this program. Again, we saw the need in \n1996 to create an insurance product for children's health, for those \npeople who financially didn't qualify for Medicaid and didn't make \nenough to purchase insurance on the open market. SCHIP was created with \nthe vision of trying to take kids from 100 percent of poverty to 200 \npercent of poverty and make them eligible for a program where 100 \npercent of them would have health care. Nationally, the parameters grew \nfrom 100 percent to 300 percent, and we still haven't met the original \n1996 mission of covering all the kids. Because with 5.5 million people \ncovered today, average monthly number, we still have 5.4 million over \nhere who are eligible and don't have insurance. Clearly, we have a \ntremendous amount of work to do to get the SCHIP program to fulfill its \noriginal mission.\n  Let me go specifically to the bill before us. CBO estimates the bill \nwill increase outlays by $32.3 billion above the baseline over 5 years \nand $65 billion over 10. The cost is offset by a tobacco tax. I am from \nNorth Carolina. I can get up and wail about how this is unfair. It is \nnot the first time Congress has done it. It is the most regressive tax \nthere is. In essence, we are taking a group who financially are \nchallenged and, according to every analysis I have looked at, the \npeople who are going to be most taxed by a tobacco increase are those \npeople in the lower socioeconomic levels. So, in essence, we are not \nspreading this across taxpayers. We are asking the parents of these \nchildren to pay for the expansion in eligibility because we are going \nto tax them for every cigarette they buy and consume. We are going to \nhope that they quit. When they quit, I am not sure how we are going to \nfund the program except probably do it the same way we are doing it in \nthe year 2013. We will come up with the money in some way and some \nfashion.\n  It is important we realize today we have something we call a Medicaid \nsandwich. Medicaid starts here; SCHIP goes here; Medicaid wraps on the \ntop. It is hard to believe we could have something designed that is so \ncomplicated for the States, that Medicaid applies here to some; SCHIP \napplies here to others; and Medicaid applies on top of that to an even \nlarger group. If it seems confusing, it is. If it is this confusing, \none has to ask: Why don't we change it? Why don't we fix it? Yet as I \ncontinue to go through the Baucus bill, what I find is that we are \nmaking it more complicated. We are designing it in a fashion that \naggressively goes after an increase in enrollment but does not go after \nthe 5.4 million children who currently today are unenrolled in the \nprogram but are certainly eligible. As a matter of fact, the Baucus \nbill spends $34 billion over 5 years. It targets 5.7 million new \nchildren. I might add, 2 million of those children today are currently \ncovered under their parents' insurance. So we have actually got a net \npickup of 3.7 million kids who were uninsured. That is $34 billion.\n  There is an alternative plan. It is called the McConnell substitute. \nIt is called Kids First. It uses $19.3 billion over 5 years to enroll \n3.1 million kids who are uninsured today. So what do we get with the \n$34 billion investment that we are not getting with a $19.3 billion \ninvestment? The answer is quite simple: 600,000 uninsured kids who are \nenrolled under the Baucus bill. When you do the simple math on that, \nyou find out you are paying $4,000 per enrollee under the Baucus bill.\n  Now, I don't expect everybody to associate with this, but last year I \nhad a son who was a senior in college. Because we have these funky \nGovernment rules that say no matter where you are in your education \nprocess, when you become 22, you are no longer eligible to be under \nGovernment insurance for your family--it doesn't apply just to Members \nof the Senate or to Congress; it applies to every Federal employee--I \nwas forced, as a parent, to go out and go through the thought process \nof getting my son insurance. Sure, he is 22 years old. He is healthy as \na bull. There is no reason I should suspect he is going to get sick. \nBut what if something happens to him.\n  So I immediately did what every good Federal employee would do. I \ncalled the correct office up here, and I said: This has to be something \nyou have run into. Have you got some type of gap insurance I can turn \nto and I can purchase for that 22-year-old healthy son? They said: \nCertainly, Senator. We have negotiated with the same company, the same \nplan he was under, and he can go on that tomorrow. I said: How much is \nthat? They said: $5,400 a year, for a 22-year-old, healthy-as-a-bull \nsenior in college.\n  I did probably what every parent would do. I called the college and \nsaid: Have you got a plan? Here is the situation. They said: \nAbsolutely. We have negotiated with the same company, with the same \nplan he was under as a child of a Federal employee. I said: What is the \npremium? They said: $1,500 a year.\n  Now, that lesson I actually learned when I became a Member of \nCongress. When I became a Member of Congress, I chose the same \ninsurance plan I was under in Winston-Salem, NC, working for a company \nof 50 employees, the same exact plan paying the same 25 percent, and \nthe only difference was my health insurance cost went up $100. Why? \nBecause a company of 50 employees negotiated a better plan than the \nU.S. Government on behalf of 2 million employees. But it had been 14 \nyears. I had forgotten that. I relearned it firsthand though with my \nson, when all of a sudden I realized he got a plan for $1,500 that the \nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill had negotiated, and the \nFederal Government had negotiated the same plan at $5,400. No wonder \nparents are confused. No wonder most Americans are confused. What a \nscrewed up market this is. How unbelievably complicated is it for an \nindividual to try to go out and access insurance, and at what point do \nyou actually know that you have found a value?\n  Let me try to bring some relevance to this story. For that 22-year-\nold, healthy-as-a-bull senior in Chapel Hill, his health care plan was \n$1,500 a year. For all these 600,000 kids we are adding to SCHIP, we \nare spending $4,000 a year to insure them. The average cost per policy \nfor somebody under 18 in America today is about $1,132. Yet under the \nBaucus bill we are going to invest $4,000 per child, per those 600,000 \nchildren, to make sure they are covered--not a wise investment. But \nconsidering my experience with the Federal Government, I can understand \nwhy, for some people here, that makes absolutely perfect sense.\n  Let's assume for a minute somebody is going to say my numbers are \nwrong. I am sure they will before the debate is over. Let's assume for \na minute we are trying to figure out the number of increased \nenrollees--and I am not talking about the ones who had their own \ninsurance and we just shifted them over to government insurance--what \nare we paying for them? We are paying about $2,200. They are still \npaying $700 more a year to insure every child 18 and under than I paid \nin premiums to cover my 22-year-old, healthy-as-a-bull senior in \ncollege. So we are overpaying at least by $700. At most, we are \noverpaying by almost $2,500. Somewhere in that range, I would hope the \nAmerican people would say: Hey, let's stop for a second. Let's call \ntime out. Let's go back and get Congress to re-look at this program \nbecause this doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  I am not getting into any of the aspects that have already been \naddressed which deal with the loopholes that were created. I actually \nsat on the floor and heard somebody say this was a bipartisan bill. If \nyou count one Republican vote out of the Finance Committee, then you \nare right, it is bipartisan. But I am not sure that is President \nObama's interpretation of what bipartisanship is. He came to the Hill. \nHe had lunch with us today because he is trying to get more Republicans \nto support a stimulus package because he doesn't want to just win it, \nand he doesn't want to win it by one vote. He wants the American people \nto understand that there is confidence up here in the legislation that \nis passed. He probably should have talked about this bill. It is going \nto be bipartisan, not by many votes.\n  If that is the type of bipartisanship we want, then it is going to be \na long couple of years.\n  My hope is we can actually get something done. There are so many \nareas I\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\ncould talk about on this bill, but it would keep me here forever, and I \nsee my good friend, Senator Whitehouse, is in the Chamber.\n  Let me end with this. I am sure I will come back. What I want Members \nto search their souls and ask is, Is it really the Federal Government's \nresponsibility and, more importantly, the taxpayers' responsibility \nthat a family making $88,000 be included in a plan that is designed and \nwas originally designed to take care of kids between 100 and 200 \npercent of poverty? Do we feel bad that today 5.4 million children who \nare eligible at 100 percent to 200 percent of poverty are not enrolled \nin the program?\n  This is not the first time I have had a test like this. My own \nPresident, last year, proposed we increase spending for HIV/AIDS \npatients in Africa from $15 billion to $50 billion, and to many \npeople's amazement, Tom Coburn and I supported the President. Then all \nof a sudden they made a change in the program. The program had always \nsaid 50 percent of the money had to go to the treatment of HIV and AIDS \npatients, meaning they actually had to deliver medicine to them.\n  Well, when all of a sudden the countries that got these Federal \ngrants to carry out these programs in Africa looked at the program, \nthey said: My gosh, for us to get from committing $7.5 billion all the \nway up to $22.5 billion in delivering medicines to people who have HIV \nor AIDS, that is going to be tough. We are going to have to work to \nfind these people. It is going to be dangerous in some cases for us to \nget drugs out.\n  What did the White House do? They dropped the requirement in total. \nThey did not require one dime of that $50 billion to actually go to the \ndelivery of drugs to HIV and AIDS patients. So what did we do? We held \nup the bill. We were taking flak from our own President because other \npeople wrote a bill that was structured poorly. It actually did not \naccomplish what we set out to have with PEPFAR originally.\n  At the end of the day, they put back in the requirement of 50 \npercent, and today, for the multiple countries this applies to, we have \na commitment that $22.5 billion is going to go to actually treat \nindividuals who have HIV and AIDS--our original intent of the program. \nWe just expanded it.\n  Now, we were not going to get there just by saying it is difficult, \ntherefore we do not think we should do that. And we are not going to \ncover these 5.4 million kids who are eligible but not enrolled if we \nsay: Do you know what. This is hard. And since it is hard, why don't \nyou change the program so the eligibility is wider so we can get some \nof the kids who are out here in different income groups who are easier \nfor us to enroll than for us to go and find the 5.4 million who are so \nhard to find.\n  Well, I am going to say to my colleagues, just like I said to my \nPresident: No. That is not what we intended to do. We put this program \ntogether to make sure the most at-risk kids in this country had health \ncoverage, so they had a medical home. To suggest we are now going to \nchange the parameters of this and allow a larger income pool to come in \nbecause it is hard to reach out and find these 5.4 million people, no; \nit is not going to happen. It may happen, but it should be as difficult \nat happening as it possibly can.\n  I look forward to the debate we are going to have. It is my hope we \nwill have an opportunity to actually look at honest budget numbers that \nshare with the American people exactly what this costs, that we can \nlook at the eligibility requirements with predictability, understand \nwho is going to have an opportunity to be enrolled, and, hopefully, at \nthe end of the day, when a bill passes--whether we vote for it or not--\nthat we can all look at it and say: There is a real chance that 100 \npercent of the kids at 100 percent to 200 percent of poverty have a \nreal opportunity to be enrolled in this program. I fear without changes \nto this legislation that will not happen. We will not have fulfilled \nwhat we set out to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend from \nVirginia, Senator Webb, who is prepared to speak, and we will recognize \nhim in just a moment.\n  I would note there would have been, by our estimates, 3.3 million \nchildren who would have been covered had the bill passed in 2007. That \nwould have been one very good way to reduce the number of children in \nthis country who are not protected by health insurance.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course.\n  Mr. BURR. Would any of those 3.3 million children have been in 100 \npercent to 200 percent of poverty?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As I understand it, the bill contained both funds and \nprograms for outreach that would have supported the States in their \ninitiatives to find the children who, because their parents were moving \nor for one reason or another, were eligible but had not entered into \nthese State programs. So I think the answer to that question would be \nyes.\n  Mr. BURR. Let me suggest to the Senator--and I will not ask him to \nyield much longer--there was the same expansion of eligibility in last \nyear's bill, so the likelihood is any increase in enrollment would have \nbeen spread across not just the 100 percent to 200 percent of poverty, \nbut all the way up to the 400 percent of poverty.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think the increase in enrollment would have spread \nwherever the program went. There are very few areas, as the Senator \nknows, where the eligibility level is 400 percent of poverty. In the \nvast majority of the country, in my State, for instance, it is well \nbelow that. It is a program that supports working families, that \nsupports low-income working families, that makes sure their children \nget health care.\n  But for a number of reasons, probably the most prominent of which is \npeople moving from location to location and not being registered with \nthe local program, there are outreach requirements. I would be happy to \nwork with the Senator on improving those outreach requirements in any \nway he wishes. But I think to hold the entire bill and his support--I \nthink in this case we are estimating it will now reach 4.1 million \nchildren--hostage because of not having gotten the outreach better is a \nstrategic mistake.\n  If your goal is to insure more children, then you should go about it \nby insuring more children. If the outreach is a problem, then we can \nhappily make that better. But for outreach to be criticized, when it \nwas President Bush who vetoed that bill, I am not sure how the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina voted on that--\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would be happy to disclose to my colleague \nthat I voted against the bill, for the same reasons that without \nchanges I will oppose it this year because the eligibility requirement \nis being expanded.\n  As I said, and I thought fairly clearly, when you expand eligibility, \nyou take the pressure off of making sure the enrollees come from the \nmost at risk. It is my hope we can modify this bill. I am not \nembarrassed to be on the Senate floor and talk about the aspects of \nthis legislation that I am unhappy with. But certainly I can count, and \nI know the majority can move this bill at any point they feel \ncomfortable, and I am sure they will.\n  At the end of the day, it is my hope we will cover as many of the \noriginally targeted children in that 100 percent to 200 percent of \npoverty as possible.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I understand the Senator from Virginia wishes to \nspeak. I will simply respond before I yield the floor to Senator Webb \nthat I have had quite a number of years of experience with our \nChildren's Health Program in Rhode Island, back to the years when I \ncame in with Governor Sundlun in a bad economic crisis in Rhode \nIsland--probably the largest percentage deficit in the State budget of \nany State ever recorded. Even in that very gloomy fiscal environment, \nGovernor Sundlun insisted we build a statewide universal health care \nprogram that protected children.\n  SCHIP is very much in line with that. The people who have been \nworking on that for these many years in Rhode Island--and I suspect it \nis the case in many other States--feel a real passion for trying to \nmake sure children get health care, that they get the health care to \nwhich they are entitled.\n  So I am not sure the notion that by just putting more pressure on \nthem, by just refusing to add any other children until they have done \nthis, is really a productive or fair way to go about\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\nreaching the children who have not been reached. What the bill does is \nprovide outreach funds and empower these people who care so deeply \nabout this issue to actually get out there and work harder to find \nthem, have the additional resources to find people. From my work in law \nenforcement, my work with schools, my work on health care, there are a \nlot of people who live apartment to apartment, very hand to mouth, and \nit is a very significant challenge to keep up with them. The resources \nto do that, I submit, would be the best way to solve that problem, not \nholding one set of children hostage to providing health care for \nanother set of children.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor for the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I \nam here to speak in favor of this legislation. This is a very important \npiece of legislation. It is long overdue. I also would like to point \nout that I have an amendment I will offer.\n  I am very concerned about the way this legislation is going to be \nfunded. We all have our own issues with respect to whether tobacco \nshould be used or not used, but to fund an entire program based on a \ntobacco tax, I think, is not the way to go for a number of reasons. So \nI am offering an amendment that will help offset this highly \nregressive, 61-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax that is \nbeing used to fund this bill, and to add on to the bill a tax on \ncarried interest, which is the compensation that is received by hedge \nfund managers. This proposal would generate $11.2 billion in revenue \nover 5 years. Tobacco taxes would thus be raised by a more reasonable \n37 cents a pack to make up for the shortfall between the revenue being \ngenerated by this amendment and the costs of the CHIP reauthorization.\n  Tobacco is already federally taxed at 39 cents per pack for the CHIP \nprogram. All 50 States and the District of Columbia also impose an \nexcise tax on cigarettes above this tax. For instance, my State of \nVirginia adds 30 cents on top of the present tax. In these difficult \ntimes, many States, including Virginia, are considering an increase in \ntheir State excise tax.\n  So we would have, with the amendment I am going to offer, the 39-cent \nFederal tax that is already in place on a pack of cigarettes, an \nadditional 37 cents--instead of an additional 61 cents--plus the State \ntaxes on cigarettes; and a big proportion of this--all the Federal \ntax--going to fund a health program.\n  I would like to be clear that there is no question in my mind about \nthe fact that we do need to reauthorize and expand this program. But I \ndo not think it is a proper to fund this program on the backs of people \nwho, for better or worse, smoke cigarettes. I am a reformed smoker. \nMany of my contemporaries in the Senate are reformed smokers. I am not \nencouraging anyone to smoke cigarettes. I hope you do not. I just \nbelieve although tobacco taxes are already a popular source of revenue, \nit does not change the reality that this tax is regressive.\n  We had a Congressional Research Service report brought to my office, \nand I am going to quote from it. It said:\n\n       Cigarette taxes are especially likely to violate horizontal \n     equity and are among the most burdensome taxes on lower-\n     income individuals. Only about a quarter of adults smoke, and \n     less than half of families have expenditures on tobacco. \n     Tobacco is more heavily used by lower-income families than \n     are other commodities, and is unusual in that actual dollars \n     (in addition to the percent of income) spent on tobacco \n     products decline in the highest income quintile.\n\n  My amendment will help soften the blow of the increase in the \ncigarette tax.\n  Let me provide some background on carried interest. A partner of a \nprivate equity or hedge fund receives two different types of \ncompensation. First, hedge fund managers receive management fees that \nare linked to the assets they oversee. Second, they receive what is \ncalled ``carried interest,'' which is compensation based on the \npercentage of the profits generated by the assets they manage. \nCurrently, carried interest is taxed at a capital gains tax rate. As \nnoted by Peter Orszag, who is now a member of the Obama administration, \nin his 2007 testimony, many economists view carried interest as:\n\n       Performance-based compensation for management services \n     provided by the general partner rather than as a return on \n     financial capital invested by that partner.\n\n  Given that carried interest is performance-based compensation, it \nmakes sense to tax it as ordinary income. This compensation has been \nearned by many of the same people who helped bring about the present \nfinancial crisis. The Financial Times stated these managers ``have made \nfabulous sums in recent years.'' Given the need to pay for children's \nhealth insurance, it makes more sense to have these persons, who are \nbetter positioned to pay for it, pay a greater percentage of the cost.\n  When it comes to taxing carried interest as ordinary income, there is \na wide acceptance in support of this proposal among thinkers and \neditorial writers across the country. The Financial Times itself \neditorialized ``this repair should be done at once.'' They made that \nstatement 2 years ago.\n  I have a string of editorials that support the idea of closing this \ncarried interest loophole as a matter of fairness. I ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. They include editorials from the Washington Post, New York \nTimes, USA Today, the Philadelphia Inquirer. In fact, the Washington \nPost in 2007, in talking about this particular tax break, said this:\n\n       The only mystery is why Senate Democrats don't have the \n     good sense to grab on to this as their centerpiece domestic \n     issue. It's hard to think of an issue that better taps into \n     the public anxiety about the markets and the economy, the \n     anger about income inequality, or the disgust with a \n     political system that bends to the will of powerful \n     interests.\n\n  The Washington Post continued:\n\n       This is a make-or-break issue for Democrats. If they can't \n     unite around this issue, then they aren't real Democrats and \n     they don't deserve to govern.\n\n  The New York Times in 2007 talked about this issue, mentioning:\n\n       With income inequality surging along with the need for tax \n     revenue, supporters rightly conclude that it is untenable for \n     the most highly paid Americans to enjoy tax rates that are \n     lower than those of all but the lowest income workers.\n       Congress will achieve a significant victory, for fairness \n     and for fiscal responsibility, if it ends the breaks that are \n     skewing the tax code in favor of the most advantaged \n     Americans.\n\n  There are others and, as I mentioned, I will insert the full text of \nthese editorials at the end of my comments.\n  I also should point out that our new President, President Obama, has \nsupported throughout his campaign the idea of taxing carried interest \nas ordinary income.\n  So the choice is this: Do we help fund this program, which we all \nagree is critically necessary, with a well-deserved tax adjustment for \nsome of those who are the most capable of absorbing a new tax, or do we \ntake money exclusively from tobacco, causing people who in large part \nare in the same economic circumstances as the beneficiaries of this \nhealth insurance program to foot the bill?\n  Let's think for a moment about the irony of that. We are taxing a \npractice that we deem unhealthy in order to fund a health program, and \nwe supposedly want this practice to go away, but if it goes away, we \nare not going to be able to fund our health program.\n  So we need to find a way to fund health care needs that is \nsustainable and fair, and a declining revenue source is not \nsustainable. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nmeasure, which will partially offset the cigarette tax that is a part \nof the bill. I again wish to express my strong appreciation to Chairman \nBaucus and to others, such as my colleague from Rhode Island, who have \nworked so hard on this bill and who work to help those in our system \nwho are most in need of medical care.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nEditorials Supporting Closing Private Equity/Carried Interest Loophole \n                         as Matter of Fairness\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 2007]\n\n           Private-Equity Tax Breaks, a Call To Be Up in Arms\n\n       Even by Washington standards, the private-equity industry \n     certainly went over the\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\n     top in conjuring up the economic woes that would befall the \n     United States if their cherished tax breaks were taken away.\n       Pensioners would be destitute.

People tend to get \n     suspicious.\n       As a result, government bodies periodically try to tamper \n     with private equity firms, hedge funds, venture capital firms \n     and the like. This largely unregulated industry does a lot to \n     stabilize America's financial system by fostering innovation \n     and bringing inefficient or undervalued markets closer to \n     equilibrium, and most of these attempts to regulate or \n     reconfigure the industry would be bad for the U.S. economy. \n     But this time around Congress has proposed legislation that \n     makes sense.\n       A House bill would set a higher tax rate for ``carried \n     interest,'' the cut of profits typically awarded to fund \n     managers at private equity firms and other investment \n     partnerships. In these investment partnerships, a fund \n     manager typically manages the investment made by himself and \n     various limited partners, with the manager usually \n     contributing about 1 percent of the investment. The fund \n     manager then usually receives 2 percent of the assets he \n     manages annually and 20 percent of the profits earned on the \n     investment when it is sold. Even though this 20 percent cut \n     makes up the bulk of the manager's compensation, and even \n     though it is awarded for managing others' money, under \n     current tax law this income is treated as capital gains \n     rather than ordinary income. As a result, fund managers who \n     make zillion-digit incomes from carried interest can be taxed \n     at the same rate (15 percent) as a part-time janitor.\n       The House bill, sponsored by Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), \n     Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), \n     Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) \n     and 13 other Democrats, would close this loophole for fund \n     managers and treat their ``carried interest'' earnings as \n     regular income taxable at the ordinary 35 percent top-income \n     rate that high-earning employees in other industries must \n     pay. The bill would not affect the other investors in these \n     funds, nor would it affect the tax rate for profits that fund \n     managers make on investments with their own money.\n       A Senate bill that also attempts to bring equity to the \n     private equity industry would force investment partnerships \n     that are publicly traded--right now, only a handful--to pay \n     corporate income taxes. Support for the Senate bill has \n     gained some momentum because of Blackstone Group's splashy \n     initial public offering, one of the largest in history. The \n     Senate's corporation-rather-than-manager-based solution seems \n     less effective, however, because companies can easily move \n     overseas (as many have already done), while individuals are \n     less likely to do so. Investment partnerships can also simply \n     choose not to go public.\n       Critics of the two bills argue that investment fund \n     managers should be rewarded for taking high risks. But these \n     fund managers, for the most part, are not risking their own \n     money, and they're paid management fees during the duration \n     of their partnerships, so they have steady incomes. Besides, \n     plenty of risky industries don't enjoy comparable tax \n     benefits. Income earned from managing an investment \n     partnership fund should be treated just like the income \n     earned for providing any other service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 2007]\n\n                    Raising Taxes on Private Equity\n\n       So much for the argument often made by managers of hedge \n     funds and mavens of private equity that higher taxes would \n     cripple their business.\n       The prospect of higher taxes did not dent, in the least, \n     the initial public offering on Friday of the Blackstone \n     Group, the giant private equity firm. The week before, a bill \n     was introduced in the Senate to raise taxes on private equity \n     firms that go public. On the day of the offering, a House \n     bill was introduced that would raise their taxes, whether \n     they're publicly traded or not.\n       And yet, Blackstone had a debut that was one of Wall \n     Street's biggest, its thunder muted only by the announcement \n     by its longtime rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, that it, too, \n     planned to go public.\n       The bills in Congress take aim at a provision of the tax \n     law that has allowed private equity and hedge fund operators \n     to pay a lower capital-gains tax rate of 15 percent, instead \n     of the ordinary top income-tax rate of 35 percent, on the \n     performance fees that make up the bulk of their huge \n     paychecks.\n       With income inequality surging along with the need for tax \n     revenue, the bills' supporters rightly conclude that it is \n     untenable for the most highly paid Americans to enjoy tax \n     rates that are lower than those of all but the lowest-income \n     workers.\n       Fairness is not the only reason to change the rules. The \n     private equity industry is on shaky ground when it claims \n     that current practice is a correct application of the law.\n       Many of the firms' partners are not investing their own \n     money in the various funds and ventures, and so have no \n     direct risk of loss, the general test for claiming capital-\n     gains treatment on one's earnings. Moreover, the tax rules in \n     question were developed decades ago for enterprises that had \n     passive investors to whom gains were passed along. Hedge fund \n     managers and private equity partners are not passive. They're \n     actively managing assets, and should be taxed accordingly as \n     managers earning compensation.\n       The challenge now is to develop a single bill that can \n     withstand the formidable lobbying efforts of the private \n     equity industry to water it down.\n       To do so, the final bill should clearly apply to other \n     firms where partners may also receive most of their pay as \n     capital gains, such as oil and gas partnerships. It will also \n     be necessary to narrow the bill, where appropriate. For \n     instance, it could include a mechanism to allow some \n     compensation to be taken in a form similar to incentive stock \n     options.\n       Congress will achieve a significant victory, for fairness \n     and for fiscal responsibility, if it ends the breaks that are \n     skewing the tax code in favor of the most advantaged \n     Americans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA TODAY, July 23, 2007]\n\n            Wealth Money Managers Make More, Get Taxed Less\n\n       As many business executives, doctors, lawyers and other \n     skilled professionals know, the top income tax rate is 35%. \n     The top rate on dividends and long-term capital gains is 15%.\n       Whether it makes sense to tax the output of expertise and \n     hard work at more than twice the rate of investment returns \n     is debatable. But, for better or worse, that's the way it is.\n       Except, that is, when it isn't. Owners of companies, \n     ranging from small real estate partnerships to multibillion \n     dollar hedge funds and private equity firms, have devised a \n     way to erase this distinction. Their managers pay 15% on \n     their income by dressing it up as investment returns--even \n     though they bear no investment risk or put none of their own \n     money in play.\n       Nice work if you can get it. But in this case it \n     constitutes a frontal assault on fairness. Why should such \n     people pay only 15% when senior corporate executives pay 35% \n     for making many of the same types of business decisions?

Here's how it works using the example of a \n     private equity firm: The partners raise capital from banks, \n     pension funds and other large investors, which they use to \n     buy companies and resell them. Their investors give them some \n     direct compensation, which is taxable as income.\n       But most of the compensation comes in the form of an \n     investment vehicle known as ``carried interest,'' which gives \n     them a right to a portion of the profits they generate \n     (typically 20%). That portion of the profit is taxed 15%, \n     just as if they supplied 20% of the capital at the outset.\n       It's a creative practice, but with a result that says the \n     rich get to write their own rules. That's not a new problem \n     in the American tax system, but it is nevertheless repulsive. \n     Income is income, or so you'd think.\n       Supporters of this scam argue that these money managers \n     actually are risking their own investments. It's just not \n     money, in their case, but their ``sweat equity,'' their time, \n     their expertise. But the same could be said of the lawyer who \n     takes a case on a contingency fee, the movie actor who \n     negotiates a cut of the box office receipts, the financier \n     who chooses to work for a firm known for paying enormous \n     bonuses during good years. In most, if not all, of such \n     cases, these people pay income taxes.\n       And so should partners in these exotic investment firms. \n     More so because the tax\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\n     they avoid paying is money that has to be made up by people \n     of lesser means--or borrowed from later generations by adding \n     to the budget deficit.\n       These schemes add insult to injury at a time of increasing \n     wealth concentration. It is time to end them.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Sept. 19, 2007]\n\n            Equity Managers' Loophole; Billion-Dollar Breaks\n\n       For years, a relatively few players in the corporate \n     takeover game have benefitted from a tax loophole that costs \n     the federal government billions annually.\n       Now a push is under way in Congress to tax these wealthy \n     managers of private equity funds at the same income-tax rates \n     as everyone else. Congress should end this unfairness in the \n     tax code.\n       Most workers pay income taxes on a graduated scale, with \n     marginal tax rates running from a low of 10 percent, to a \n     high of 35 percent for the wealthiest wage earners. But \n     managers of private equity funds, who usually do extremely \n     well for themselves, pay only a capital gains tax rate of 15 \n     percent on most of their income. That's because the tax code \n     considers their wages ``carried interest,'' even though this \n     compensation can run into hundreds of millions of dollars per \n     individual. The preferential treatment can be worth millions \n     of dollars to such a manager.\n       Rather than being taxed on compensation for services \n     rendered, these managers are taxed as though they had \n     invested a 20-percent stake in the fund. But, even though \n     they sometimes gain equity stakes in the companies they buy \n     and manage, they don't have capital at risk in the ventures. \n     They're really being compensated for their expertise and \n     effort.\n       This definitional fiddle creates a class of service \n     provider that is taxed a preferential rate. Economist Greg \n     Mankiw, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers \n     under President Bush, has said that carried interest should \n     be taxed at the same rate as other compensation for such \n     services. As it stands now, an executive in a financial-\n     services firm is taxed differently from the manager of a \n     private equity or a hedge fund.\n       There's no good reason why a person earning $200 million \n     per year should pay a lower tax rate than a single worker \n     earning $45,000 annually and paying 20 percent in taxes.\n       The loophole costs the Treasury several billions of dollars \n     per year. The sum is small compared with the overall federal \n     budget. But in a budget season in which Congress and the \n     president are feuding over a difference of about $22 billion, \n     such sums do matter.\n       Some argue that taxing these fund managers at a higher rate \n     would harm ordinary investors, such as those enrolled in \n     state employee pension plans, because the fund managers would \n     demand higher compensation. But the evidence is slim. The \n     liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit \n     think tank in Washington, said the impact on investors would \n     be ``quite small.''\n       And this glaring inequity shouldn't be preserved on the \n     presumption that a tiny fraction of it will trickle down to \n     the folks already paying their fair share.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 8, 2007]\n\n                            No Pay, No Patch\n\n       Nearly everyone wants to ``patch'' the alternative minimum \n     tax. Not everyone wants to pay to do so. That is the \n     challenge facing lawmakers as they race to install yet \n     another temporary fix on the tattered federal tax system in \n     time for the Internal Revenue Service to produce forms \n     reflecting the change. How this job is accomplished will show \n     whether congressional Democrats are willing to live up to the \n     pay-as-you-go obligations they imposed on themselves when \n     they retook control of Congress--and whether Republicans can \n     regain any credible claim to being committed to fiscal \n     discipline.\n       The alternative minimum tax was created in 1969 to dun a \n     tiny number of the super-rich who managed to avoid paying any \n     income taxes. Because the tax isn't indexed for inflation and \n     because the 2001 tax cut lowered regular tax rates, the AMT, \n     without adjustments, will affect millions of taxpayers who \n     everyone agrees were never its intended targets. But \n     exempting those millions will cost a lot in forgone revenue, \n     money that the Bush administration has built into its budget \n     numbers. Because fixing the problem is expensive and \n     complicated, lawmakers have chosen for years to slap a Band-\n     Aid onto it--and bill the cost to future generations. This \n     year's model totals $50 billion, $76 billion when the cost of \n     extending expiring tax provisions and other changes is \n     included.\n       To its credit, the House Ways and Means Committee has \n     produced an AMT patch whose costs are offset by other \n     changes, including eliminating the carried-interest deduction \n     that allows private equity and hedge fund managers to pay \n     taxes at far lower rates than other wage-earners. This is far \n     from a perfect solution: It would take 10 years of revenue to \n     pay for the one-year patch.\n       It's preferable, though, to the approach of congressional \n     Republicans and the Bush administration, which is to not \n     offset the tax cut with new taxes or spending cuts. House \n     Minority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) was illustrative of \n     the irresponsibility. ``Tax relief pays for itself by \n     creating more American jobs for more taxpayers to strengthen \n     our economy,'' he said in a statement. Perhaps Mr. Boehner \n     believes that the Tax Fairy will simply leave $50 billion \n     under the IRS's pillow; there is no economic basis for his \n     statement that ``tax relief pays for itself.'' Moreover, if \n     Mr. Boehner doesn't like the way Democrats propose to finance \n     the patch, what would he cut instead?\n       Republicans may not be the only obstacle to responsibility. \n     Senate Democrats say they want to comply with the pay-go \n     requirement, and there were hopeful signs last week from \n     Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). ``I'm not in favor of \n     waiving pay-go rules,'' he said. ``I think we cannot waver on \n     that.'' But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-\n     Mont.) has been less definitive, saying only that he'd like \n     to comply with pay-go to the extent possible; he has also not \n     been eager to close the carried-interest loophole. Once the \n     pay-go rule is ignored, though, lawmakers won't be able to \n     discipline themselves in the future. This is a key test for \n     the party that wants to wear the mantle of fiscal \n     responsibility.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 8, 2007]\n\n                        Alternative Tax Showdown\n\n       The House and Senate are poised to vote on a vitally \n     important tax bill that poses a test for each chamber of \n     Congress. In the House, the vote on a short-term fix for the \n     alternative minimum tax will test whether Democratic \n     representatives have the courage of their convictions. In the \n     Senate, the vote will test whether Democratic senators have \n     any convictions at all, or just a belief in keeping the world \n     safe for campaign contributors.\n       Under current tax law, 23 million taxpayers will owe the \n     alternative tax for 2007, up from 4 million last year. The \n     tax was originally intended to apply to multimillionaires. \n     But most of this year's alternative taxpayers make between \n     $100,000 and $500,000 and about a third make less than \n     $100,000. They all have good cause to feel rooked and to \n     expect help from Congress.\n       The challenge is the ``pay-as-you-go'' budget rule adopted \n     when Democrats took control of Congress this year. New tax \n     relief must be paid for, either by raising taxes elsewhere or \n     by cutting government benefits like Medicare or Social \n     Security that cover everyone who is eligible. The one-year \n     cost of shielding millions of Americans from a tax they \n     should not have to pay is $51 billion.\n       The House tax committee met the challenge, drafting a bill \n     that provides the needed tax relief and plugs the resulting \n     budget gap, mainly by raising taxes on private equity \n     partners and hedge fund managers. The bill is good policy. \n     The tax relief assuages justifiably aggrieved taxpayers. Tax \n     increases on private equity firms and hedge funds rectify \n     outdated rules that have allowed the very wealthiest to enjoy \n     tax rates lower than those paid by middle-income Americans \n     and, in some cases, to defer taxes indefinitely.\n       But key Democratic senators, among them New York's Charles \n     Schumer, who is the main fund-raiser for Senate Democrats, \n     are balking. They know they must provide alternative tax \n     relief, but they don't want to tax private equity and hedge \n     funds to pay for it. Their defense of the industries' morally \n     indefensible tax breaks is tawdry. As The Washington Post \n     reported yesterday, in the first nine months of 2007, as \n     pressure built to dismantle the tax breaks, investment firms \n     and hedge funds contributed $11.8 million to candidates, \n     party committees and leadership political action committees. \n     That's more than was given in 2005 and 2006 combined. More \n     than two-thirds of that money went to Democrats.\n       The Senate's equivocating has rubbed off somewhat on the \n     House. The bill is still expected to pass the House, as early \n     as tomorrow, but some members have wondered aloud why they \n     should support a tough measure if the Senate is determined to \n     kill it.\n       The answer is that it is the right thing to do. The House \n     bill holds true to the pay-as-you-go rule when doing so \n     matters most, that is, when large sums and difficult trade-\n     offs are at stake. It undoes a tax injustice. And maybe, just \n     maybe, the money men in the Senate can be swayed by example.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this week we have the chance in the \nSenate to provide health insurance to 4.1 million children in this \ncountry who now don't have it, to cover 11 million children total. All \nwe have to do is the right thing and pass H.R. 2, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  I know the distinguished Presiding Officer from Nebraska and the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, who has just spoken so eloquently, \nhave shared the experience I have had in my home State of Rhode Island, \nand that is to travel around and hear personal stories from people \nwhose lives and whose health have collided with our broken, \ndysfunctional health care system. Too often, families in this country \ncan't afford to pay for the care they need. As our economic troubles \nworsen, that problem only grows more acute. Too often, they can't even \nget in to see a doctor. Too often, when they do receive care, it falls \nshort in quality, in efficiency, in effectiveness, and in timeliness.\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\n  The crisis in our health care system affects all of us, but it is \ngreatest and it is most tragic when it affects our children. That is \nwhy Congress created the Children's Health Insurance Program which for \nyears has given millions of uninsured, hard-working American families \naccess to health care for their kids.\n  The program has not only expanded health care coverage for children, \nit has encouraged States to be flexible, innovative, and responsive in \nmeeting their families' health care needs. We come from 50 different \nStates with 50 different sets of history, demographics, and economics, \nand as a result, the States come up with different programs. That is \nsomething to celebrate, not to bemoan. The program has safeguarded the \nvulnerable, it has united families, and it has invested in the future \nof our Nation. It is a special program of all the things that we do \nhere.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program means that children are more \nlikely to receive medical care for common conditions such as asthma or \near infections. It means that children end up with higher school \nattendance rates, and that children have higher academic achievement. \nIt means that children have more contacts with medical professionals. \nIt means that children receive more preventive care. It means that \nchildren go to the emergency room when it is an emergency, and when it \nis not, they have someplace else to go that allows them and their \nfamilies to stay out of those expensive urgent care settings. So as we \nhave done for the past 2 years, this week we are working to pass \nlegislation to ensure that every eligible uninsured child in America \ncan get regular checkups when they are well and can get medicine when \nthey are sick.\n  Not long ago, former President Bush denied children needed health \ncare coverage by vetoing this legislation. But the American voters have \nspoken and we are in a new era in this country--a new era for peace of \nmind, for security, and for dignity for American children and for their \nfamilies. With a new Congress and a new President committed to health \ncare for all American families, I could not be more hopeful as we \ndiscuss this bill today.\n  I am especially proud to serve with my senior Senator, Jack Reed of \nRhode Island, and to support him in this fight. I have been in the \nSenate for 2 years now. Before I even got here, Jack Reed was one of \nthe most prominent, most ardent, and most determined fighters for our \nNation's children. Frankly, it is in significant part due to his \nrelentless work that we have come this far.\n  I am proud also to represent a State that has one of the lowest rates \nof uninsured adults and children in the Nation. It was not easy. Rhode \nIsland worked hard over the past 15 years to achieve this success. It \nbegan with the RIte Care Program in 1993. In 2001, the creation of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program allowed Rhode Island to further \nreduce uninsurance rates in the State. I am proud to be on the team of \nformer Governor Bruce Sundlun who turned 89 a few days ago. When he was \nGovernor, he created the original RIte Care Program. His vision and \ndetermination to do this, in a time of grave economic straits for Rhode \nIsland, has yielded immense rewards. Now, as health care costs \nskyrocket and the number of people in this country who lack health \ninsurance approaches the staggering number of 50 million--50 million \nAmericans, and so many of them children--we in Congress have an \nobligation to strengthen initiatives like RIte Care through which \nStates have made health care more accessible.\n  Today, 4.1 million uninsured children are waiting for us to pass this \nbill; 4.1 million children who might not see a doctor this winter when \nthey get the flu because their parents can't afford to pay out of \npocket for the visit; 4.1 million children who might delay needed \nvaccinations or other preventive care because their parents have to buy \nfood instead; 4.1 million children who might not get an inhaler or \ninsulin or--heaven forbid--chemotherapy because in this economic \ndownturn, the money just isn't there.\n  Who could say no to uninsured, vulnerable children? Should we not at \nleast be able to agree on that? Why would anyone say no? We plan to \nraise taxes on cigarettes, a tax that the American Cancer Society says \ncould prevent nearly 1 million deaths and keep nearly 2 million \nchildren from starting to smoke; a tax with health savings that could \nultimately decrease government costs for government health care \nprograms; a tax that the Congressional Budget Office confirms will \nfully offset this bill so as not to add to our deficit. I don't think \nthat would be a good reason to deny vulnerable children the safety and \nsecurity of health insurance.\n  During the course of this discussion, some Members have tried to make \nthis debate about illegal immigration. It is not. We should not permit \nthe very difficult issue of illegal immigration to affect this bill to \ndeny millions of children the health care they badly need. That would \nbe a grave mistake. That would be a wrong.\n  Let me be very clear: Only children who are legally in the United \nStates are eligible to receive coverage under Medicaid or the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. They must document their \nimmigration status. Medicaid agencies use information provided by the \nBureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services to confirm the status of \nlegal immigrants applying for benefits. Further, this bill does not \neven require States to cover legal immigrant children. It simply \nprovides and supports that option.\n\n  Legal immigrants pay taxes, they serve in our Armed Forces, and just \nlike the rest of us, they play by the rules. They are our future \ncitizens, and insuring their children makes sense. This was the law \nuntil 1996 when sweeping restrictions affecting legal immigrants were \nmade. Since 1996, we have become wiser, and many of those restrictions \nhave been reversed on a bipartisan basis by Congress. The provision in \nthis legislation covering legal immigrants is fully consistent with \nthat trend back to 1996 levels.\n  This Nation is slowly emerging from a dark time when our ideals and \nour virtues were too often hidden in the shadows, when we let our fear \novercome our principles and our better judgment, when we lost sight of \nour priorities and left millions of people in the cold and millions of \nchildren uninsured. That time can end now.\n  This bill is a chance to show these millions of Americans that we \nhave heard them and that we stand ready to help. We know how tough it \nis for working families in this economy. If there is one worry, one \nburden we can take off those parents' shoulders so they can be sure \ntheir children have the health insurance every American deserves, we \nshould stand ready to help. This country should once again own its duty \nto protect those who cannot protect themselves and to restore dignity \nand hope where it has diminished.\n  I close by applauding Chairman Baucus and the Finance Committee for \nbringing this vitally important and long overdue legislation to the \nfloor.\n  I urge all of my colleagues--it would be wonderful if we could do \nthis together--to allow these 11 million children to be covered by \nhealth insurance, to have access to the health care they need, to grow \nup healthy and strong and ready to seize the boundless opportunities \nthat are at the heart of the American dream.\n  I think we will find in the months and in the years ahead that there \nwill be things we cannot do to help families. I know everybody in this \nChamber wants to do everything they can, and we want to work as hard as \nwe can, but the economic situation is dire, and we are not going to be \nable to do everything we would like. But this is something we can do. \nThis is something we can do for American families and for their \nchildren, and I hope very much we will do it.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Committee Assignments\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in accordance with S. Res. 18, I announce \nthat the following Democratic Members have been assigned to the \nfollowing committees: Agriculture, Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Gillibrand; \nBanking, Mr.\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\nBennet; Environment and Public Works, Mrs. Gillibrand; Foreign \nRelations, Mrs. Gillibrand; Homeland Security, Mr. Bennet; Aging, Mr. \nBennet and Mrs. Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will show the appointments.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at 5:25 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate resume consideration of the DeMint amendment, No. 43, \nwith the time until 5:45 p.m. for debate with respect to the amendment, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form, with no \namendment in order to the amendment prior to a vote; that at 5:45 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation thereto; that upon disposition \nof the DeMint amendment, the Senate resume consideration of the Hatch \namendment, No. 45, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no \namendments in order to the amendment prior to a vote; that upon \ndisposition of the Hatch amendment, the Senate proceed to executive \nsession and the Banking Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of the nomination of Daniel K. Tarullo to be a member of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; that the Senate \nthen proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination; that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that the \nSenate then resume legislative session; further, that after the first \nvote in this sequence, the remaining votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  If I could say to Senators within the sound of my voice, we would be \nhaving more votes today, but I conferred with Senator McConnell. The \nFinance Committee is involved in marking up the economic recovery plan. \nThere are scores of amendments they are trying to work through so we \nare limiting the number of amendments today. We are going to work hard \ntomorrow, as I indicated when we opened today. We are not going to have \nmorning business all week. We are going to get these amendments \nprocessed as quickly as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I see the very distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas in the Chamber to take over managing this bill.\n  Before I leave the floor, I want to make two points. I have been here \nwhile a great deal of discussion has taken place about 5.4 million \nchildren who are eligible for children's health care but who, through \nlack of effort, it is claimed, the State programs are not finding. The \npurpose of the argument has been to argue if we could make the States \nfind these kids, they would be the ones for whom the program was truly \ndesigned, and that the 4.1 million additional children we are going to \nhelp with this legislation are sort of a distraction from that figure.\n  I have not been able to source that 5.4 million number to anything. I \nwould note on a population basis, my State of Rhode Island is one \nthree-hundredth of the country. So if there are 5.4 million kids out \nthere, in that circumstance, Rhode Island should have, by my math, \n18,000 of them. We only have 12,000 kids in the CHIP-funded portion of \nwhat we call the RIte Care Program.\n  From my own experience, the likelihood of there being 18,000 eligible \nchildren in our small State who cannot be found makes no logical sense \nat all, which gives me significant pause about the validity of this 5.4 \nmillion number upon which so much of our colleagues' argument stands.\n  The other point I would make is there are many States that could \nreach more eligible children, but the funding is not there for them. \nRhode Island is one such State. When other States return funds, we get \naccess to that pool, and we can expand our coverage.\n  So, in fact, by supporting this legislation, you will enable the \nState programs to reach whatever that group of kids is, whether it is \n5.4 million or 540,000. I do not know what the number is. Madam \nPresident, 5.4 million sounds very unlikely. But even setting that \nquestion aside, the fact that we would vote against this piece of \nlegislation in order to help those 5.4 million kids makes no sense \nwhatsoever because this legislation contains both the funding and the \noutreach tools to allow the State programs to reach those very kids.\n  So that argument, at least from this Senator's perspective, appears \nto hold no water whatsoever, or at least requires substantially better \njustification and support before it should be counted on, at least in \nmy view, by any Senator as a reason to oppose this piece of \nlegislation.\n  With that observation, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 43\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 5:45 will be equally divided \nand controlled prior to a vote on amendment No. 43, offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about an amendment I am offering \nas part of the children's health plan we will be voting on probably \nlater this week.\n  I think it is important, as we talk about expanding the program, we \ndo it responsibly and make sure we do everything we can to keep \npersonal responsibility as part of the plan. All of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, look forward to the day when every American family has a \nhealth insurance plan they can afford and own and keep.\n  The children's health plan is, I see, maybe an interim step to that. \nIt was started to help America's poorest children be insured. The plan \nwe are discussing today, however, expands the children's health plan to \nchildren over 200 percent of poverty. One of the things we want to make \nsure does not happen is people who have private insurance and have \ntaken responsibility for health insurance for their family are not \nencouraged to drop their private insurance and to join a government \nchildren's health plan.\n  There are ways we can do it, and some States already do this. This is \nby adding cost-sharing provisions for those who take advantage of the \ngovernment children's health plan. That is what my amendment is about: \nmaking sure States that provide Government health coverage to families \nover 200 percent of poverty have some cost-sharing arrangement to send \nthe signal that this is not a permanent subsidy from Government but a \ntemporary bridge to help families who need some help getting health \ninsurance for their children to get the help they need.\n  So let me talk a little bit about what is in there.\n  Again, the main goal of this amendment is to stop the people moving \nfrom private plans--that they are paying for and taking responsibility \nfor--to a Government-sponsored plan so there is accountability, and \nthat is what we want to make sure is in this system.\n  We need to remind our colleagues the children's health plan was \ncreated for America's poorest children. I wish a lot of our emphasis \nand debate was on: How can we get more children under 200 percent of \npoverty actually registered for the program? There are millions of \nchildren today who qualify for the current children's health plan who \nare not registered, either for what we call SCHIP or for Medicaid. \nInstead of\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\njust taking those numbers up and expanding the people who can take \nadvantage of the program, we should be trying to get those who are most \nneedy registered for the program. Instead, I am afraid we are going to \ncrowd out those folks, as we provide insurance for other families. In \nsome States, under this plan, families making over $70,000 a year, with \na family of four, can take advantage of Government health plans.\n  So what we are going to have is one person making $70,000 a year \npaying for their own private insurance and their neighbor making the \nsame amount who has Government health care. There are ways we can \ndiscourage it. A number of States already require that the \nbeneficiaries of this children's health plan pay a copay or a small \npart of the cost of the health insurance, and that is what this \namendment does.\n  My amendment specifically would require that States that are offering \nthe children's health plan to families above 200 percent of poverty \nhave some minimum cost-sharing. We protect the beneficiaries by saying \nthat no State can charge a user of the children's health plan more than \n5 percent of their monthly income, and we don't have a minimum. So we \nexpect most States to have a very minimum cost-sharing plan put in \nplace.\n  What we are doing does not replace or change anything that States \nalready have set up for cost-sharing. In fact, I think it will make it \nfairer for them. The way the system will work, unless we pass this \namendment, is the people in States that are participating in the costs \nof this plan will help pay more for those States that don't have any \ncost-sharing. So it is not fair, if we have some States encouraging \npersonal responsibility and cost-sharing, to put more of a burden on \nthem to pay for States that might not do the same.\n  My belief is that every State would implement for families over 200 \npercent of poverty a cost-sharing arrangement. What this does is just \nlays out some basic parameters that give the States complete \nflexibility, whether it is a copay, whether it is a percent of the \ninsurance, but not to exceed 5 percent of the income of any of the \nrecipients.\n  I understand this is the next amendment to be voted on. I encourage \nall of my colleagues to do everything we can to stop any incentives \nthat move people from private insurance to Government insurance, create \nsome accountability and personal responsibility in this plan for the \nones with higher incomes, and to save more of the dollars for those who \nare most needy in the plan.\n  Again, I encourage a vote, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided evenly, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nunderstand I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes left; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeMINT. And the quorum call will be applied against that time; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally applied to the Senator 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nand the time remaining on the majority side.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If the Senator would agree, I don't have much time left, \nand if I could reserve that time. If there is no opposition, obviously, \nI don't need to use any additional time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. That is agreeable.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I move to table the DeMint amendment No. \n43 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necesarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 45, offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to remind my colleagues, the Hatch \namendment, No. 45, says that before a State is permitted to cover legal \nimmigrants through CHIP and Medicaid, it must demonstrate to the HHS \nSecretary that 95 percent of its State children who are citizens under \n200 percent of the Federal poverty level are enrolled in either the \nState's Medicaid Program or CHIP.\n  My amendment does not prohibit legal immigrant children from being \ncovered, but it does set some of the parameters. Again, I believe our \nU.S. children who are citizens should be covered first. If you cover 95 \npercent, then you can go on and do more. Once those kids are covered, I \nam happy to work with my colleagues to cover legal immigrant children, \nbut our U.S. citizen kids should be covered first. That is all I am \nsaying, and I think it is reasonable.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a reasonable amendment. I am prepared \nto ask unanimous consent to have a voice vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, basically the amendment requires States to \ncertify that 95 percent of their CHIP children, or Medicaid, are being \npaid first before the children of legal immigrants. No State meets that \nrequirement.\n  I might also say the nationwide average for covering children under \n200 percent of poverty is 80 percent. No State reaches 95. It is too \nhigh a standard.\n  More than that, we do include in this bill provisions for bonus \npayments to States to encourage them to cover low-income kids first. I \nthink it would be inappropriate and unfair to make it an ironclad \nrequirement that States must certify 95 percent. These are kids who are \nsick through no fault of their own. Their parents are paying taxes. \nThey are full citizens--they are legal immigrants, but they are already \nincorporated into the system, being taxed, et cetera, and their kids \nshould not be penalized.\n  I strongly encourage us not to adopt this amendment because no State \ncan certify to 95 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we withdraw \nthe call for a rollcall vote and voice-vote this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rollcall vote has not been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have conferred with the Republican leader. \nThis will be the last vote today. The Finance Committee is still \nmeeting, and they expect to continue working tonight. I spoke to the \nchairman just a short time ago. He is going to do everything within his \npower to finish the markup tonight. We are going to get back tomorrow \nand again have no morning business. We will be back on this bill \ntomorrow.

The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Economic Recovery\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the severity of this economic crisis \nrequires the Federal Government to respond quickly and forcefully. The \neconomic recovery proposal we are considering has two key objectives: \nstimulating the economy and creating jobs. Congress currently is \nnegotiating where the funds will be spent--on infrastructure projects, \non health care and safety net programs, on developing alternative \nenergy for the 21st century economy. As we decide how to spend these \ntax dollars, it is imperative we consider where to spend them or, \nrather, on whom. These funds must create American jobs. To do that, we \nmust ensure that Federal funds are used to buy American services and \nAmerican products.\n  Our economy is suffering from the highest unemployment rate in more \nthan a decade and a half. In 2008, we lost 2.6 million jobs, the \nlargest job losses in 1 year in more than six decades. Our unemployment \nrate jumped to 7.2 percent. We all know that number doesn't tell the \nreal story, the real human story. The more accurate measure of \njoblessness, the unemployed and the underemployed, or workers whose \nhours have been cut, is almost 14 percent. More than 533,000 jobs were \neliminated in December. Yesterday, some of America's strongest, most \nprestigious companies announced more than 55,000 job cuts in 1 day. \nAmong them was General Motors, which announced it would cut a shift at \nits Lordstown plant in Mahoning County in northeast Ohio. As President \nObama said:\n\n       These are not just numbers on a page. There are families \n     and communities behind every job.\n\n  Communities such as Moraine and Chillicothe and Canton understand \nwhat happens when there is a major layoff. They don't need to hear the \nnew job numbers. They understand it when small businesses close and \ndiners empty out.\n  Manufacturing jobs keep American communities strong, and the steepest \njob losses are occurring in manufacturing. Nearly one in four \nmanufacturing jobs has simply vanished since 2000, and 40,000 factories \nhave closed in the last 10 years. Last year, manufacturing accounted \nfor nearly a third of all lost jobs, while factory orders plummeted to \nrecord lows. Inventories are piling up because no one is buying. This \nleads to production cuts and then massive job losses that we will \nlikely see more of this year. President Obama said it is likely going \nto get worse in 2009 before it gets better.\n  A loss of manufacturing is about more than jobs; it is about the loss \nof the Nation's middle class. I want to lay out what exactly the \nbenefits of manufacturing are to this Nation.\n  Many of us represent large manufacturing workforces. All of us \nrepresent some manufacturing, some in more States than others. We all \nrecognize or all should recognize the importance of manufacturing to \nour national security and to our domestic security--for families, \nneighborhoods, communities, for the Nation.\n  Let me cite the benefits of manufacturing:\n  No. 1, these jobs pay better on average than others.\n  No. 2, manufacturing jobs have a stronger multiplier effect, \nsupporting as many as five other jobs. For instance, an auto assembly \nplant obviously creates other jobs--suppliers and tool and die shops \nand machine shops and parts manufacturers, and all that those jobs \ncreate. Manufacturers are large taxpayers supporting vital public \nservices and schools in communities across the Nation.\n  No. 3, if you have a large industrial plant in a school district, \nthat school district gets an awful lot of help in local property tax \ndollars from the manufacturing plant.\n  No. 4, American manufacturers are on the cutting edge of new \ntechnologies in the clean energy economy of tomorrow.\n  No. 5, if we are to end our dependence on foreign oil, we need to do \nmore manufacturing here rather than allowing it to go offshore, \nespecially in alternative energy.\n  No. 6, our national security depends on a strong defense industrial \nbase to supply troops and protect our national interests.\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\n  Without a bold economic recovery plan that makes manufacturing a \npriority, the job losses will continue throughout this year and into \nnext.\n  ``Buy American,'' established in 1933 by President Roosevelt, \nrequires that Federal purchasers prefer U.S. products. In other words, \nif the product is made in the United States at a decent price, then \nFederal purchasers must buy those products. But over the years, waivers \nof those preferences have been abused to create giant loopholes in \n``Buy American.'' In other words, when we should be buying American, we \nare often buying Chinese or from some country in the European Union or \nMexico. U.S. tax dollars whenever possible should go to create U.S. \njobs. It is pretty simple. It is something people at home simply don't \nunderstand--nor do I--why we, as a country, as a government, don't use \nour tax dollars to create American jobs.\n  I am concerned about the lack of transparency in the waiver process \nand how that can lead to lost business, lost jobs, lost work, the \nactual steel, iron, cement, and other materials coming from overseas \nand not creating jobs in our country.\n  The Obama administration's stated goal is to make the biggest \ninvestment in the Nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower \ncreated the Interstate Highway System more than 50 years ago. Imagine \nall this infrastructure, steel, concrete, all the materials we are \ngoing to buy with tax dollars, what it will matter if these products \nare made in the United States and not somewhere else. That is what we \ndid mostly with the Interstate Highway System 50 years ago.\n  So when we are building infrastructure, whether it is water or sewer \nlines in Denver or whether it is a bridge in Minneapolis, this ``Buy \nAmerican'' provision says we should be buying American and creating \njobs here.\n  We have a responsibility to taxpayers to ensure that these dollars \nare creating jobs. Inclusion of ``Buy American'' requirements in the \nrecovery proposal would be the most effective way to ensure that tax \ndollars are spent in the United States to create jobs. We have a \nresponsibility to give American manufacturers the opportunity to bid on \nthe steel and the iron and the other products that will be in demand \nfrom these massive investments in our infrastructure.\n  We have ``Buy American'' provisions in Federal statutes that provide \nthat preference to use domestic materials, such as steel and other \nproducts and components, in federally funded highway and transit \nprojects for State and local authorities. These need to be applied to \nthe maximum extent possible as we try to revive the economy, as we move \nthe Obama stimulus package through the Chamber.\n  Just last week, the Government Accountability Office reported on the \nbenefits of Buy American policies. This is what the GAO said:\n\n       The types of potential benefits to this program include \n     protecting domestic employment through national \n     infrastructure improvements that can stimulate economic \n     activity and create jobs. . . .\n\n  This recovery proposal is about creating direct jobs with taxpayer \ndollars and then spin-off jobs with taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me be clear. This is not about stopping or slowing international \ntrade. It is about using provisions in U.S. law consistent with our \ninternational obligations that allow for a preference for domestically \nproduced goods financed by our U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n  Only if we do this will the recovery effort have the impact our towns \nand cities so desperately need. Why spend tens of billions--no, \nhundreds of billions--of dollars for infrastructure if we are not going \nto spend that money on American made products to create jobs directly \nand the spin-off jobs that come from that manufacturing?\n  American taxpayers deserve no less. Congress must act in good faith \nto create the most jobs here, especially in manufacturing. Enforcing \nthe Buy America requirements already on the books and, to the extent we \ncan, applying them to this stimulus bill is simply the right thing to \ndo.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program and the debate we are having in the Senate.\n  I appreciate what my colleague from Ohio just spoke of, the \ntremendous trauma that has been caused across the country with this \nterrible recession so many families are living through. I appreciate \nthe fact he reminded us about what has been happening in our States and \nour communities as a result of this economic horror that so many \nfamilies are living through. That horror and that trauma will only be \nincreased in the months and years ahead if we do not pass this \nchildren's health insurance legislation. I think it is directly related \nto what we are talking about here when it comes to the terrible \nrecession so many families are living through.\n  So I want to speak about the bill and deal with some of the questions \nthat have been raised about the bill. But in particular, I want to, \nfirst, step back from the bill, from the debate, even step back for a \nfew minutes from the program itself, to reflect on what the reality is \nfor families.\n  I think when we speak of families and children's health insurance we \nspeak and we think mostly about parents and the relationship they have \nto their children and what they want for their children. They, of \ncourse, want their children to succeed in life. They have hopes and \ndreams for their children. But, of course, for a parent, and especially \nfor a mother, who is often providing most of the care for a child, her \ninitial hopes, her initial fears, her concerns at the beginning of that \nchild's life are very basic: Will that child be born healthy? Will that \nchild grow and develop as he or she should?\n  I was thinking back to 2007 when we were having this debate at that \ntime, thinking of the love of a mother and what she can provide for a \nchild, especially a very young child. That mother can provide all of \nthe protection she can muster for that child, she can envelop or \nembrace that child with protection and love and nurturing and all the \nwonderful things that a mother--a parent but especially a mother--can \nprovide for a child. But there are some things that no matter what that \nmother does, no matter how much she loves her son or her daughter, \nthere are some things she cannot provide on her own. She cannot provide \nhealth insurance on her own. She cannot provide medical care if she is \nnot trained in that profession as a doctor or a nurse.\n  So there are a lot of mothers out there who have children they worry \nabout every day of the week. They go to bed worrying what if that child \nhas a problem in the middle of the night or some kind of a health care \nchallenge in the middle of the day, what will happen to that child?\n  So when we are thinking about this debate and this issue, we should \nthink about the love of a mother and what she can and cannot provide. \nThat is one of the reasons why as a country we come together to solve \nproblems such as this. We know an individual person cannot build a \nroad, so we come together and provide public resources to build a road. \nWe know one person or one family cannot provide law enforcement \nprotection, so we all contribute to that. The same is true on health \ncare. No matter how much that mother loves her child, she cannot on her \nown provide health insurance.\n  So what did we do? We created a program which in my State of \nPennsylvania is called the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP \nfor short. The program ``name'' is kind of redundant because the last \nword of the acronym is ``Program.'' But the CHIP Program then developed \ninto a national program, as the Presiding Officer knows from his time \nin the House of Representatives, the so-called SCHIP, State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. That is what the debate is about.\n  What did we do? We created a program which now covers 6.7 million \nAmerican children, most of whom, probably the overwhelming majority of \nwhom would not have any health insurance coverage because, as we know, \nthese are families who are above the income levels for Medicaid but \nthey are often below or outside the category of families who have \nemployer-sponsored health insurance. So they are in that gap: lower \nmiddle or middle-income families, in many cases. So we have covered 6.7 \nmillion children. That is wonderful. The only problem is there are \nmillions more who are not covered.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  This bill--strip away all the debate, all of the back and forth, all \nof the fighting about this--at its core, just as it did a couple years \nago, is to provide health insurance to more than 4 million additional \nchildren. So 6.7 million, roughly, and you add 4.1 million, that is \nwhat you are talking about.\n  So we have the program in the legislation now to cover more than 10.5 \nmillion American children. Few, if any, generations of Americans who \nhave served in a legislative body could say they cast a vote to cover \nthat many children. It is a tremendous opportunity for a child, for \ntheir family, for the community and neighborhood they live in, for \ntheir State, and for their country now and in the next months and years \nahead, but it is also important to all of us down the road.\n  Who would you want to hire 20 years from now? A child we invested in? \nA child who had health care in the dawn of his or her life? A child who \nhad early learning opportunities? A child who had a good healthy start \nin life? I think as an employer you would want to hire a person who had \nthat investment. They are bound to be more productive. So there is a \nlong-term workforce argument. But even if that argument was not there, \nthis is the right thing to do for the obvious reasons.\n  Now, what are we talking about? We are talking about health care and \nbenefits. There is a long list of benefits I won't go through. We have \ncharts we have all pointed to, and we will continue to do that.\n  But just consider one aspect of the benefits, one that I focus on \nbecause I think it is crucial to the life of a child and crucial to \ntheir--I should say, not just crucial, determinative of the kind of \nfuture they are going to have or not have, and that is well-child \nvisits. One of the benefits that is covered in Pennsylvania is that in \nthe first year of the life of that child he or she will get six well-\nchild visits. Every child in America should have that opportunity. \nEvery family should have the peace of mind to know that if all does not \ngo well, at least their child has health insurance, and in the first \nyear of their life they have been to the doctor at least six times, and \nthey have been to the dentist and any other specialty they can get to \nand that the benefits cover.\n  So if we want to just focus on one benefit of the children's health \ninsurance: a kid gets to the doctor six times in a year--pretty \nimportant. I am not a doctor, but we all know the benefit, as parents \nand as legislators from our work.\n  Another aspect of this legislation that does not get a lot of \nattention: When people hear about a government-inspired initiative, or \na program in this case, that is partially paid for with public dollars, \nwe often hear about: Well, that is just for communities where people \nare low income, but they are covered by Medicaid, so why do we need to \nhelp them? It does not help people kind of across the length and \nbreadth of the country. It is somehow targeted to one group and, \ntherefore, it is not good for everyone.\n  Well, I just made the case about the workforce long term. But one \naspect of this issue in terms of a group of children who are often not \nin the headlines but benefit directly and are reliant upon the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and the Medicaid Program for \nchildren is that a lot of poorer families with children are in rural \nareas--people who live in rural areas across the State of Pennsylvania \nand across the country.\n  In my State of Pennsylvania, when you get outside of Philadelphia and \nPittsburgh and Erie and Harrisburg--a couple of major urban areas--we \nare a very rural State. We have literally millions of people who live \nin the demographic category that we refer to as rural areas. Those \nchildren--one-third of them--rely upon either the Children's Health \nInsurance Program or the Medicaid Program. So it helps a high \npercentage of rural children.\n  In the midst of this economy, when those rural communities in \nPennsylvania and across the country have been disproportionately \nadversely impacted by high energy costs, including everything from \ngasoline to home heating oil, to all kinds of other energy costs, when \nthey have also been hit hard by the downturn in the economy--job losses \nare rampant in rural communities--when you factor in those realities \nwith the dependence or reliance they have on this program, it is \ncritically important we provide as much in the way of resources as we \ncan and outreach to get those children enrolled in rural areas, as well \nas in our urban and even suburban communities.\n  I want to conclude with a recitation of some myths and facts, some of \nwhich we have heard on the floor in the debate over the last couple \ndays. I will do just one, two, three, four--about four or five myths.\n  Myth No. 1, the children's health insurance bill reduces \ndocumentation requirements, allowing illegal immigrants to receive \nbenefits. That is the myth.\n  Here are the facts.\n  Fact No. 1: Under current law, only individuals applying for Medicaid \nare subject to the citizenship documentation requirements. This bill \nactually extends those requirements to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, requiring documentation in CHIP just like documentation is \nrequired in the Medicaid Program. You would never know that by some of \nthe debate here.\n  Fact No. 2 about this documentation issue: Because the requirements \nhave resulted in the widespread denial of coverage to many citizens, \nthe children's health insurance bill also gives States a new way to \nprove citizenship through matching Social Security Administration \nrecords. So that is further help on documentation.\n  Fact No. 3 under this section: These citizen documentation provisions \nare the same as they were in the children's health insurance bill \npassed in the Senate overwhelmingly--overwhelming--with bipartisan \nsupport in 2007. So it is the same. So for those who are creating the \nmyth that somehow it is new, that is not true.\n  Myth No. 2: The bill ends the mandatory 5-year waiting period for \nlegal immigrants to receive benefits--opening the program to abuse by \nillegal immigrants. It is another myth.\n  Fact No. 1 under this myth: The bill allows but does not require--it \nallows but does not require--States to cover legal immigrant children \nwithout forcing them to wait 5 years for coverage. Why should a child \nwho is a legal immigrant or why should a pregnant woman in the same \ncircumstance--why should they have to wait 5 years? Does that make any \nsense at all? Does that make any of us safer or does that make our \ncountry better to have vulnerable people wait to get these benefits, \nespecially when 23 States are doing this now? By listening to the \ndebate, you would think this is some new concept that just fell out of \nthe sky. Twenty-three States right now are doing this. So what does \nthis bill do? It allows States to cover legal immigrant children \nwithout forcing them to wait 5 years for coverage.\n  Only immigrant children here legally--legally--are eligible for the \nbenefits provided by Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. So if anyone uses the word ``illegal'' in this context, you \nknow automatically they are deliberately attempting to mislead people.\n  Children and pregnant women who will now be eligible must document \ntheir immigration status. State Medicaid agencies use the Bureau of \nCitizenship and Immigration Services' automated SAVE system to verify \nthe immigration status of legal immigrants applying for Medicaid. So \nthat is a protection that is built into this bill.\n\n  The next myth: This bill will allow children from families making \nover $80,000 per year to receive coverage while poor children are still \nnot enrolled.\n  That is another myth. This bill would extend coverage to 4 million \nmore low-income children and help struggling families in this time of \neconomic downturn. The CHIP bill prioritizes enrolling low-income \nchildren by establishing a performance-based system to reward States \nfor enrolling low-income kids while giving them new tools to do so. So \nwe incentivize States to go out and enroll more children, which is a \nworthy thing to do, and critically important.\n  Under the bill, States would be allowed to designate CHIP funds to \nhelp families afford private coverage afforded by employers or other \nsources.\n  Finally, under this section, the bill maintains provisions to reduce \nthe Federal match rate for the cost of covering children above 300 \npercent of the Federal poverty level.\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\n  Let me get to two more myths, and I will conclude.\n  The next myth: The revenue stream to pay for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program with tobacco tax is unsteady and will not be able to \nfund the program in the future, increasing the burden on taxpayers.\n  That is the myth. We have heard that a lot. The fact is, according to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the proposed $31.5 billion \nin spending will be fully paid for by the fee increase to tobacco \nproducts over the authorized 5-year timeframe.\n  Finally, this myth: Democrats have made unilateral changes to CHIP, \nwhich has jeopardized the bipartisan support of the previous version \npassed by the Senate.\n  Fact: The CHIP legislation introduced this year is almost identical \nto the legislation in 2007 which received broad bipartisan support in \nthe House and the Senate. Two prior bipartisan efforts were blocked by \nPresident Bush when he vetoed the legislation.\n  Providing health care for children is not a Democratic or Republican \nissue. We know that. It is a moral issue and one that all Senators \nshould support. The few unresolved policy disagreements were put to a \nvote in the committee. So we have had a committee vote as well.\n  So I would conclude tonight with where I began. What is the Senate \ngoing to do when faced with the question, the stark and fundamental \nquestion: Are we going to act this week to cover 4.1 million more \nchildren? It is up or down.\n  There have been a lot of discussions about so-called immigration \nissues which I think have been misleading. A lot of the debate is about \nnumbers. But we are either going to act to do this, to cover 4 million \nkids, or not.\n  Finally, what will the Senate do this week to speak to that one \nmother and to say to her: We understand a little bit--a little bit--\nabout what you are going through, and we understand that with all of \nthe love you surround your son or daughter with, we know you cannot \nprovide them health insurance on your own. We are going to help you \nbecause we have the program that has been in place for 15 years, which \nis one of the best pieces of legislation this body or the other body \never voted on; we know how to help you, and we are going to do \neverything we can to help you. We know this economy is especially tough \non that mother and that family. We are going to act to help you through \nthis difficult period in your life so that you can have the peace of \nmind to know that your son or daughter at least--at least--is covered \nby health insurance and can get six visits to the doctor in a year. \nThat is not asking too much of all of us and of the American people, to \nshow some degree of understanding and some degree of solidarity with \nthat mother and her children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         ERIC HOLDER NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nEric Holder to be Attorney General of the United States. As a member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I have given especially close consideration to \nthis nomination. I met privately with Eric Holder, reviewed his record, \nlistened to his sworn testimony, and I have come to the conclusion that \nhe will be an outstanding Attorney General.\n  On January 15 and 16, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. \nHolder's nomination where he was asked many questions from the \ncommittee members on both sides of the aisle. He stayed until every \nmember of the committee had asked every question they wished. Then, \nfollowing the hearing, Mr. Holder responded to literally hundreds of \nwritten followup questions from members of the committee.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on his \nnomination. Despite a lengthy 2-day hearing which included multiple \noutside witnesses and Mr. Holder's timely response to the questions, \nthe Republicans asked to postpone the committee's vote on Mr. Holder's \nnomination. That is their right under the Senate rules, but it is \ndisappointing that despite Mr. Holder's full cooperation, we have been \nunable to move forward on this nomination to this point. As a result, \nthe crucial position of Attorney General remains unfilled and the Obama \nadministration's national security team is incomplete.\n  Due to the delay, the committee will now vote on Mr. Holder's \nnomination as early as tomorrow. I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support the nomination so we can have new leadership in \nplace at the Justice Department.\n  I believe Eric Holder has the experience, independence, and \ncommitment to the rule of law to reform the Justice Department. He will \nbe one of the most qualified Attorneys General, having previously \nserved as Deputy Attorney General, U.S. attorney, judge, and a career \nJustice Department attorney. Mr. Holder will need to bring all of that \nexperience to bear to restore the integrity of the Department which has \ndescended to a sad state today.\n  However, it is more than just experience that he will bring. The \nAttorney General is the people's lawyer, not the President's lawyer, so \nhe or she needs to have the backbone on occasion, if necessary, to \nstand up for what is right, even if it means disagreeing with the \nPresident.\n  I have had many differences of opinion with John Ashcroft, our former \nAttorney General under the previous President, but there was a moment \nin history when he was literally in an intensive care unit and asserted \nhis authority as Attorney General to say no to the President. It took \ncourage. It took commitment. It took professionalism. We should expect \nnothing less of those who serve in that capacity.\n  There can be little doubt about Eric Holder's willingness to say no \nto the President. He has demonstrated a lot of independence throughout \nhis career. As Deputy Attorney General, he recommended expanding the \nStarr investigation into the Monica Lewinsky affair, and he recommended \nthe appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate a member of \nPresident Clinton's Cabinet. He has been involved in the investigation \nand prosecution of Members of Congress in both political parties.\n  The testimony of former FBI Director Louie Freeh, in support of Mr. \nHolder, is a good indication of his independence. No one would accuse \nMr. Freeh of being a partisan Democrat. He was a strong supporter of \nformer New York mayor Rudy Giuliani and also of John McCain's efforts \nwhen he ran for President. He has been a vocal critic of former \nPresident Clinton. Mr. Freeh included his decisions to pardon Marc Rich \nand offer commutation to the FALN as things he disagreed with. But Mr. \nFreeh enthusiastically supports Mr. Holder's nomination. Here is what \nhe said:\n\n       The Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. . . .  \n     the President has a White House counsel for those purposes. \n     And I know that Eric Holder understands the difference. I \n     think he would be very quickly able to say no to the \n     President if he disagreed with him. And I think that's the \n     confidence and trust we need in that position.\n\n  Mr. Holder is also supported by dozens of other prominent Republican \nlawyers, such as former Attorney General William Barr and former Deputy \nAttorney General Jim Comey, a man who, incidentally, distinguished \nhimself during the previous administration in his service at the \nJustice Department.\n  President Obama respects Eric Holder's independence. At his hearing, \nMr. Holder testified about a conversation he had with the President \nafter he accepted the offer. The President said:\n\n       Eric, you've got to understand you have to be different. \n     You know, we have a pretty good relationship. That's probably \n     going to change as a result of you taking this position. I \n     don't want you to do anything that you don't feel comfortable \n     doing.\n\n  What a refreshing exchange. It gives me hope that the Attorney \nGeneral, if it is Eric Holder, in this Justice Department will chart a \nnew and important course for this Nation.\n  In addition to Mr. Holder's experience and independence, there is \nlittle\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\ndoubt about his commitment to the rule of law. I voted against the two \nprevious Attorneys General because of their involvement in one issue: \ntorture.\n  As White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales was an architect in the Bush \nadministration's policy on interrogation, a policy which has come into \ncriticism not only in the United States but around the world. His \nsuccessor, Michael Mukasey, refused to repudiate torture techniques \nsuch as waterboarding. That was unfortunate because Mr. Mukasey really \nbrought a stellar resume to the job, but that really was a bone in my \nthroat that I couldn't get beyond, and I voted against his nomination.\n  Now, during his confirmation hearing, Eric Holder gave a much \ndifferent response. When asked directly, he said: ``Waterboarding is \ntorture.''\n  Those three words resonated throughout the committee room and across \nthe Nation among many Americans who had been concerned about this \nimportant issue and literally gave a message to the world that there \nwas a new day dawning in Washington.\n  I also asked Mr. Holder the same question I asked Attorneys General \nGonzalez and Mukasey: Does he agree with the Judge Advocates General, \nthe four highest ranking military lawyers, that the following \ninterrogation techniques violate the Geneva Conventions: painful stress \nposition, threatening detainees with dogs, forced nudity, or mock \nexecution. Mr. Holder said:\n\n       The Judge Advocate General Corps are in fact correct that \n     those techniques violate Common Article 3 of the Geneva \n     Conventions.\n\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested \nthat Eric Holder's opposition to torture will somehow lead to a witch \nhunt against former Bush officials. Frankly, this seems like a weak \nexcuse to delay the confirmation of a well-qualified nominee.\n  Here are the facts: President Obama and Eric Holder made it clear \nthat while no one is above the law, the administration is going to move \nforward, not back. The goal to investigate the Bush administration does \nnot come from the Obama administration but from others such as retired \nmajor general Antonio Taguba, who led the U.S. Army's official \ninvestigation into the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.\n  Here is what General Taguba recently said:\n\n       The Commander in Chief and those under him authorized a \n     systematic regime of torture. . . . there is no longer any \n     doubt as to whether the [Bush] administration has committed \n     war crimes.\n\n  In the words of General Taguba:\n\n       The only question that remains to be answered is whether \n     those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account.\n\n  Indeed, the facts are troubling. Former President Bush and former \nVice President Cheney have acknowledged authorizing the use of \nwaterboarding which the United States had previously prosecuted as a \nwar crime. Susan Crawford, the Bush administration official who ran the \nGuantanamo military commissions, said that the so-called 20th 9/11 \nhijacker cannot be prosecuted because ``his treatment met the legal \ndefinition of torture.''\n  Now it appears some Republicans are holding up Eric Holder's \nnomination because of the problems of the previous administration. A \nheadline in the Washington Post this last Sunday highlighted the irony. \nIt said: ``Bush Doctrine Stalls Holder Confirmation.'' Apparently, some \nRepublicans are opposing Eric Holder because of their concern that \nformer Bush administration officials may be prosecuted for committing \nwar crimes.\n  Here is what the junior Senator from Texas said:\n\n       I want some assurances that we're not going to be engaging \n     in witch hunts.\n\n  But Mr. Holder has made it clear in his testimony there will be no \nwitch hunts. He testified:\n\n       We will follow the evidence, the facts, the law, and let \n     that take us where it should. But I think President-elect \n     Obama has said it well. We don't want to criminalize policy \n     differences that might exist between the outgoing \n     administration and the administration that is about to take \n     over.\n\n  The junior Senator from Texas also expressed concerns about Eric \nHolder's ``intentions . . . with regard to intelligence personnel who \nwere operating in good faith based upon their understanding of what the \nlaw was.'' But Mr. Holder has made his intentions clear. He testified:\n\n       It is, and should be, exceedingly difficult to prosecute \n     those who carry out policies in a reasonable and good faith \n     belief that they are lawful based on assurances from the \n     Department of Justice itself.\n\n  What more would you expect a man aspiring to be Attorney General to \nsay? It certainly would be inappropriate to seek an advance commitment \nfrom any nominee for Attorney General that they will definitely not \ninvestigate allegations of potential criminal activity. No responsible \nAttorney General would ever say that, nor should that person be \nconfirmed if they made that statement.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, recognizes that fact. Senator Graham, also a military lawyer \nstill serving, said:\n\n       Making a commitment that we'll never prosecute someone is \n     probably not the right way to proceed.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I don't expect [Holder] to rule it in or rule it out. In \n     individual cases if there's allegations of mistreatment, \n     judges can handle that and you can determine what course to \n     take.\n\n  I think Senator Lindsey Graham has hit the nail on the head. I hope \nno one will use this false specter of a witch hunt as an excuse to \noppose a fine nominee.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you have an objection to Eric Holder based \non his qualifications, vote against him. But don't oppose him because \nthe previous administration may have been guilty of wrongdoing which \nmay lead to a prosecution. There are too many hypotheticals in that \nposition. In fact, these misdeeds are the reasons we need Eric Holder's \nleadership.\n  Here is what President Obama has said about the need to reform the \nJustice Department:\n\n       It's time that we had a Department of Justice that upholds \n     the rule of law and American values, instead of finding ways \n     to enable a President to subvert them. No more political \n     parsing or legal loopholes.\n\n  I think Eric Holder is the right person to fill the vision of \nPresident Obama. After 8 years of a Justice Department that too many \ntimes put politics before principle, we now have a chance to confirm a \nnominee with strong bipartisan support who can restore the Department \nto its rightful role as guardian of our fundamental rights.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Eric Holder's nomination.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 39\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 227 of S. Con. Res. 70, the 2009 \nBudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in \nthe resolution for\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nlegislation making improvements in health care, including, under \nsubsection (a), legislation that reauthorizes the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, SCHIP. The revisions are contingent on \ncertain conditions being met, including that such legislation not \nworsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \nthrough 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through \n2018. In addition, section 227 limits the amount of the adjustment in \noutlays to no more than $50 billion over the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2008 through 2013.\n  I find that Senate amendment No. 39, an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 2, the Children's Health Insurance Program \nReauthorization Act of 2009, satisfies the conditions of the reserve \nfund to improve America's health. Therefore, pursuant to section 227, I \nam adjusting the aggregates in the 2009 budget resolution, as well as \nthe allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate confirmed Timothy \nGeithner as the Secretary of Treasury with my support. Mr. Geithner has \nthe experience and the knowledge to lead the country through these \neconomic hard times.\n  The Treasury Department is facing an uphill battle to provide \nappropriate monetary policy and regulations to get our economy back on \ntrack. Congress has been working with Federal Reserve and the Treasury \nDepartment to find ways to jump-start our economy. Congress recently \napproved the release of the second half of the TARP funds and is \nworking with the new administration to create an effective economic \nstimulus package. I am pleased that President Obama and Mr. Geithner \nhave committed themselves to restructuring the TARP but stress the \nimportance of reforms which increase accountability, transparency, and \nhelp homeowners. Furthermore, the Treasury Secretary must implement \nmeaningful and effective policies to avoid another system-wide failure \nand promote long-term economic stability. Mr. Geithner's career in the \nTreasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has made \nhim well qualified for the difficult task at hand.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss my \nvote against the nomination of Mr. Timothy F. Geithner to be Secretary \nof the Treasury.\n  I was originally inclined to support the nomination to enable \nPresident Obama to get his team together and begin addressing the \neconomic crisis. As I have said publicly, I want to be supportive of \nPresident Obama and I understand the importance of assembling his full \neconomic team to address the critical problems facing our Nation's \neconomy. After considerable thought, I have decided I cannot support \nthis nomination. I have since taken a close look at the circumstances \nof Mr. Geithner's failure to pay Social Security and Medicare payroll \ntaxes from 2001 to 2004 while an employee at the International Monetary \nFund--IMF. Then, I spoke to Finance Committee ranking member Chuck \nGrassley who provided some additional insight. Based on those factors, \nI decided to vote against Mr. Geithner.\n  International organizations such as the IMF are exempt from the \nemployer contribution of payroll taxes, so U.S. citizens who work there \nare required to pay their portion as if they are self-employed. During \nan IRS audit conducted in 2006, it was discovered that Mr. Geithner \nfailed to pay these taxes and he then paid what was owed for tax years \n2003 and 2004. Despite having made the same error in previous years, he \ndid not pay for 2001 and 2002 because the statute of limitations had \nexpired. Only after the non-payment was discovered during the vetting \nprocess by the Obama transition team in late-2008 did Mr. Geithner \nfinally pay for tax years 2001 and 2002.\n  Mr. Geithner was paid an extra sum, or tax allowance, by the IMF with \nthe expectation that he would use it to pay the IRS for his payroll tax \nliabilities. According to remarks by Senator Grassley at Mr. Geithner's \nconfirmation hearing, ``Furthermore, the nominee received a tax \nallowance from the IMF to pay the difference between the `self-\nemployed' and `employed' obligations of his Social Security tax.'' At \nhis confirmation hearing, Mr. Geithner acknowledged receiving various \ndocuments detailing his obligations as an American employee at the IMF. \nThe IMF provides its employees with a tax manual at the time they are \nhired that includes information describing how to pay self-employment \ntaxes. Page 2 of the document states, ``U.S. citizens who are staff \nmembers are required to pay U.S. tax are entitled to receive tax \nallowances.'' Page 12 of the document states, ``Employees of \ninternational organizations are considered self-employed for purposes \nof social security taxes. As such, they must pay both the employer's \nand the employee's share of social security taxes. The Fund gives you a \ntax allowance for the employer's share of social security taxes only. \nYou are responsible for the employee's portion of this tax.'' Mr. \nGeithner signed a document each year in order to receive this extra tax \nallowance. At the end of the tax allowance form are the words, ``I \nhereby certify that all the information contained herein is true to the \nbest of my knowledge and belief and that I will pay the taxes for which \nI have received tax allowance payments\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nfrom the Fund.'' Also, the IMF provides its employees with detailed \nstatements of their liabilities.\n  These errors set a bad example for other taxpayers when the \nGovernment seeks to collect back taxes. We can be assured that the \nprecedent set by Mr. Geithner's neglect will be cited repeatedly by \nfuture offenders. Mr. Geithner's conduct would be problemsome on the \nconfirmation of any high-level officers, but especially so for \nSecretary of the Treasury. The Secretary has within his jurisdiction \nthe Internal Revenue Service which is responsible for collecting taxes. \nWith the full Senate confirming Mr. Geithner, it is a virtual certainty \nthat other taxpayers will cite his situation as a reason or excuse for \ntheir not having paid taxes. If the issue of failure to pay taxes goes \nto court in either civil or criminal proceedings, it will be an obvious \ndefense or argument by defense counsel in mitigation or defense.\n  President Obama has placed ethics reform as a top priority for his \nadministration. In his inaugural address, he said, ``Those of us who \nmanage the public's dollars will be held to account, to spend wisely, \nreform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day, because \nonly then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their \ngovernment.'' That is the appropriate tone to set an example, \nespecially for young people, where in the past election there has been \na resurgence of interest in voting and government. We ought to do \neverything we can to maintain that interest and momentum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S887-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S887-S889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I also wish to discuss the precarious \nstate of our United States economy, which is facing one of the most \ndire economic crises in history. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I understand that it is imperative that the \nFederal Government use all means at its disposal to address these \nproblems.\n  It is critical as we move forward that the Appropriations Committee \nand the Senate focus on spending our Nation's dollars on worthwhile \nprojects, which both benefit the American people on their merits and \nwill also lead to an increase in jobs.\n  To this end, I wish to highlight a few projects in my home State of \nPennsylvania which appear to have significant potential to stimulate \neconomic investment, as well as return our unemployed workers to the \nworkforce.\n  The fastest way to put people to work on transportation \ninfrastructure projects is to finance highway repairs. These repairs \nsupport construction jobs that can start immediately. Additionally, \ninfrastructure repairs ensure an acceptable level of safety and \nreliability on existing highway networks, which is critical in a State \nlike Pennsylvania that has 6,000 structurally-deficient bridges.\n  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, \nPennsylvania could obligate $1.5 billion on 313 shovel-ready highway \nrepair projects. These projects all focus on Pennsylvania's bridge \ndeficiencies, pavement needs and safety concerns, as well as create \njobs and achieve meaningful infrastructure improvements. Additionally, \nall of the highway infrastructure repairs can be put out to bid within \n6 months, with construction starting shortly thereafter.\n  The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has also provided me \nwith a list of 147 public transportation projects totaling $700 million \nthat, according to transit agencies around the State, are ready to \nbegin. The projects include replacing catenary pole involved in \nelectrified train service, station improvements, alternative fuel bus \npurchases and intermodal centers.\n  The Port of Pittsburgh Commission in Pennsylvania has identified over \n$580 million in shovel-ready project work that could be started in 6 \nmonths, of which $430 million could be completed in 2 years and the \nremaining $150 million could be completed in 3 years.\n  The largest share of that money would be applied to the Lower \nMonongahela Improvement Project for Locks and Dams 2-3-4, a project 5 \nyears behind the original completion date of 2004. Without investment \nfrom the economic stimulus, the project will not otherwise be completed \nuntil the 2019-2022 period. Stimulus funding could result in a working, \nreliable chamber, a major improvement over the current schedule. \nFunding can also be provided for emergency repairs to Emsworth Dam.\n  These projects would add or preserve tens of thousands of high-\nskilled, high-paying jobs for the southwest Pennsylvania region, \nincluding permanent employees at facilities that depend on river \ntransportation, such as U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, \nArcelorMital's Coke Works, Eastman Materials, Welland Chemical, Kinder \nMorgan, Ashland Petroleum, Consol Energy and the Elrama Power Plant.\n  Previous delays have resulted in increasing costs, interruptions to \nservice and benefits foregone. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \ncalculates that the region has already lost over $1.2 billion in \nbenefits that can never be recuperated.\n  Health care is one of the largest drivers of our economy and a \nworthwhile investment in the physical and economic health of the \ncountry.\n  In 2002, the Northeastern Pennsylvania Medical Education Development \nConsortium was formed to explore the feasibility of locating a new \nmedical college in northeastern Pennsylvania. A 2006 feasibility study \nmade the need for a medical school clear. This region of Pennsylvania \nhas shortages of physicians in many specialties and over one-third of \nthe practicing physicians are expected to retire in the next decade.\n  To address this critical need, the Commonwealth Medical College is \nscheduled to open in 2009 and has already received investments of $35 \nmillion from the Pennsylvania Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program \nand $25 million from Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania, as well \nas State, Federal, and private philanthropic sources.\n  Additional funding will be used to support construction of the \ncollege, which will attract medical and biomedical research to \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, improving the local and regional economy, as \nwell as the health of the population. Over the next 20 years, the \nCommonwealth Medical College is expected to greatly increase the number \nof physicians in the area, add $70 million to the local economy and \ncreate 1,000 jobs.\n  This project also has national implications, as the research \nconducted there will focus on healthcare conditions affecting the aging \npopulation, including research on cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\n  There are numerous higher education projects throughout the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania which exemplify the types of activities \nthat this country should target as it searches for an effective means \nto stimulate the economy. These meritorious projects provide necessary \ninfrastructure improvements to many colleges and universities in my \nhome State, while at the same time creating a myriad of new jobs and \nstimulating the economy. It is my understanding that all of these \nprojects are ready for construction within 6 months or sooner.\n  Specifically, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, \nwhich represents 14 public universities in my home State, provided me \nwith a list of 47 projects totaling $445 million. These programs focus \non new building construction, renovations to existing buildings and \nenergy conservation measures. The Pennsylvania Commission for Community \nColleges, which represents the 14 community colleges throughout \nPennsylvania, also provided me with a list of 34 projects totaling $128 \nmillion. Selected projects include building renovation and \nconstruction, public safety programs, infrastructure repairs and \nupgrades, and new resources for education and training.\n  In regard to the private colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, \nthe Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of \nPennsylvania, which represents 86 private institutions, provided me \nwith a list of 42 projects totaling $385 million. Many of these \nprojects focus on the construction of new academic buildings, the \nrenovation and expansion of training facilities and improvements to \nexisting infrastructure.\n  In many cities and small towns in Pennsylvania aging sewer pipes and \ntreatment plants are malfunctioning, leading to sewage contamination of \nlocal freshwater. In many areas across Pennsylvania, and the country, \nwater\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\ninfrastructure is 50, 60 years old or much older.\n  Throughout Pennsylvania the need for funding is great, because \nwithout it many of my constituents, a significant number of whom are \nretired and on a fixed income, are facing sewer rate increases of up to \n100 percent. An investment in water infrastructure is a wise one, as it \nwill lead to construction jobs in areas where jobs are often hard to \ncome by, while relieving a significant financial burden on residents.\n  In western Pennsylvania, the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, \nwhich services communities in and around Pittsburgh, is assisting \nmunicipalities in that region seeking to meet clean water compliance \nstandards. Currently, the Pittsburgh region is facing its largest and \nmost costly public works project thus far, the rehabilitation and long-\nterm maintenance of 4,000 miles of sewers that serve nearly one million \nresidents in the area. Additionally, in central Pennsylvania, the \nBorough of Philipsburg's outdated storm and wastewater collection \nsystem overflows during periods of heavy rain. The cost of modernizing \nthis sewer system is significant, but it is necessary.\n  While these are just two examples of water and sewer projects in \nPennsylvania, an investment in wastewater infrastructure would create \nconstruction jobs, and ease the financial burden on the residents in \nmany economically disadvantaged regions of Pennsylvania.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Remediation Grant \nProgram provides funding for private developers to take real property \nbusiness sites with environmental concerns and clean them up in order \nto redevelop. Redeveloping this land creates space for new businesses--\nwith new jobs--to expand in areas that might not otherwise be \navailable. Pennsylvania alone has an estimated 150,000 acres of \nbrownfields with great potential for re-use.\n  Brownfields cleanups create jobs not only through the workers needed \nto do the cleanups themselves, but subsequently with the new businesses \nthat occupy the property. I recently met with a developer in \nPennsylvania who is prepared to immediately undertake cleanup projects \ntotaling $283 million in my home State. Combined, his projects could \ncreate an estimated 322,225 new jobs in Pennsylvania.\n  For every $1 invested into brownfields cleanups, an estimated $15-20 \nare immediately returned to the economy in the form of job creation and \nState and Federal tax revenue. Jobs created by brownfields cleanups--\nboth before and after--are taken by locally available workers, \nstimulating local economies. This is exactly the result we should be \nrequiring from every program in the stimulus package.\n  These projects include cleanups in Bensalem, King of Prussia, Lehman \nTownship, Bridgeport, Frazer, Norristown, Malvern, Limerick, \nConshohocken, West Norriton, and Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. These are \nall areas in Pennsylvania that could certainly use targeted economic \ndevelopment. I understand that there is a question over how fast this \nmoney can be spent, and I agree that money from the stimulus be put to \nuse as soon as possible after passage of the bill. However, the \ndevelopers with whom I have spoken have all assured me that brownfields \nfunding can be used within the 120 day benchmark to determine shovel-\nready projects. Programs, such as this one, should be the focus of the \nstimulus.\n  I recently met with a group of Pennsylvania State Senators and \nRepresentatives who expressed their concern over cleanup efforts in the \nChesapeake Bay Watershed, a large watershed which covers much of \nPennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Cleanup efforts from agricultural \nrunoff and other environmental impacts can be expensive. The Watershed \nRehabilitation Program can mediate some of the enormous costs to \nindividual landowners--often small business farmers--who are tasked \nwith the cleanup of their own property.\n  These cleanup efforts will require labor--stimulating the workforce \nwhile simultaneously making our environment a cleaner place for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Military construction projects funded through the stimulus must be \nidentified as priorities by military leadership and be at or near \ndesign completion so that construction can be started in short order. \nThese projects must help modernize our military support structure and \ndefense capabilities. The following projects are both shovel-ready and \nof vital importance to the State, the military and the Nation.\n  The End Item Shipping and Receiving Facility at Letterkenny Army \nDepot is a perfect example of a shovel ready project that will create \nconstruction work for Pennsylvanians and will enhance Letterkenny's \ncapability to support the movement of military equipment. The \nidentified site is on Federal land, close to utilities, next to rail \nand ground transportation and in the depot industrial area. Design is \ncomplete and Congress authorized $7.5 million for the facility in the \nJohn Warner National Defense Authorization Act for 2007--P.L. 109-365. \nRegrettably, this valuable project failed to move forward and \nadditional funding is needed to complete the project at this time.\n  Another vital military construction project is the Hermitage \nReadiness Center, in Hermitage, PA. When complete, the facility will \nsupport 128 Pennsylvania Army National Guard members who are currently \nhoused in substandard and undersized buildings. This project is a high \npriority for the Pennsylvania Adjutant General, as land has been \nacquired and the design is 99 percent complete. I am told that \nconstruction could be started within 3 months, creating construction \njobs almost immediately.\n  A third military construction project is the Combined Surface \nMaintenance Shop at the Fort Indiantown Gap Vehicle Paint Prep Facility \nin Annville, PA. This facility will reduce hazardous waste associated \nwith paint operations, create safer working conditions, increase \nproductivity and reduce costs. I understand that land and environmental \nreviews are complete and the design is 75-percent complete, allowing \nfor construction within 3 or 4 months, were funds to be made available.\n  Vital funding in the economic stimulus bill will allow us to improve \nthe care we provide to our veterans. According to the Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Military and Veterans Affairs, necessary improvements to \nthe Southeastern Veterans' Center in Spring City, PA, could commence \nwith $17 million in Federal funding. A new long term health care \nfacility would replace the ten substandard modular units currently on \nthe premises of the Southeastern Veterans' Center. This proposed \nproject will include the construction, furnishing and equipping of a \nmulti-story facility with the capacity to provide skilled nursing care \nand dementia care for 120 residents. Further, this project will provide \nappropriate housing for the veterans and will enable the Southeastern \nVeterans' Center to entirely vacate the substandard modular units, \nwhile reducing costly maintenance.\n  In addition to major construction projects, I understand that \nPennsylvania has nearly $119 million in non-recurring maintenance and \nminor construction projects that are needed and could be completed in \nFiscal Year 2009 were funds made available at this time. The importance \nof these smaller projects should not be ignored, as many of them hold \nthe potential to impact positively the lives of our veterans in short \norder.\n  Providing funds in the economic stimulus package for construction and \nmaintenance projects at national parks could have a stimulating affect \non the economy and put people to work. Among the projects in \nPennsylvania that could benefit from economic stimulus funding is the \nFlight 93 National Memorial, which will honor the 40 passengers and \ncrewmembers of United Airlines Flight 93 who gave their lives to save \ncountless others on September 11, 2001. I have worked with members of \nthe Pennsylvania delegation to secure funding for this most important \nproject in the annual appropriations bills. However, it is my \nunderstanding that an additional $6.2 million is required for the first \nphase of construction to commence.\n  Additionally, according to the Congressional Research Service, recent \nestimates suggest that the National Park Service has a deferred \nmaintenance backlog of almost $10 billion. Deferred maintenance \nprojects often include important construction work on buildings, \ntrails, recreation sites and other\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\ninfrastructure within the parks. For example, according to Gettysburg \nNational Military Park officials, the current maintenance backlog at \nthe park would cost $55 million to complete. In addition, there are \ndeferred maintenance projects at Valley Forge National Historical Park, \nIndependence National Historical Park and the Delaware Water Gap \nNational Recreation Area Park, among others.\n  Funding these projects will not only put people to work, but will go \na long way to support the ongoing efforts to preserve, protect and \nenhance our country's most precious and historically significant \nnational treasures.\n  In conclusion, while I would like to hear further from the \nadministration and other economic experts to give us guidance on \naddressing the current economic crisis, the projects which I have \noutlined in Pennsylvania are the kind of expenditures that will provide \nthe most realistic opportunity to stimulate the economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S889-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                              Ken Salazar\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to voice my \ngreat respect and hope in the Senator from Colorado, the Honorable Ken \nSalazar, who has recently left this Chamber in order to serve as \nSecretary of the Interior under the Obama administration. It is with \nsorrow that I say goodbye to my good friend who has served with honor \nand dedication since 2005. Although Ken only served for a few years in \nthe Senate, he has left his mark on us all and will be remembered for \nhis dedication and service not only to his country but to Utah's \nneighbor the great State of Colorado.\n  Ken Salazar's personal history is a testament to his character and \naccomplishments. His family first settled in America just over 400 \nyears ago, 12 generations back. Ken's parents knew the value of \nteaching their eight children about hard work and dedication, and from \nthem he learned the worth of industry on his family's ranch growing up. \nThose early years on the ranch taught Ken about the importance of hard \nwork, integrity, and dedication. It is also from these early \nexperiences that Ken grew to love the beauty of the natural resources \nour Nation has to offer.\n  I am confident that the years of experience Mr. Salazar has worked on \nenvironmental policy in the West will serve him well in his new \nposition as Secretary of the Interior. He has a deep-rooted passion for \nclean, renewable, and affordable energy as well as protecting our \ncountry's precious natural resources. I believe he will take quite \nnaturally to his new role as our Nation's top public lands manager, and \nwe will be well served by his sensitivity to those natural treasures we \nvalue the most.\n  In short, Ken Salazar has the experience and the passion required for \nthe role he has taken on as Secretary. I thank him for his excellent \nservice in the Senate and look forward to seeing good things from him \nin the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S889-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S889-S890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AFRICA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent years more and more observers \nhave noted Africa's failing states, ungoverned spaces and pirate-\ninfested waters, and the threat they pose to our own national security. \nI have long raised these concerns on this Senate floor and I am pleased \nthat they are receiving increasing attention. However, it is not enough \nto simply acknowledge Africa's security challenges; nor is it \nsufficient to shift resources toward them, although that is a good \nstart. We must institute long-term strategies to further our national \nsecurity goals while developing sustainable partnerships with Africans \nthat advance our mutual interests and support nascent democratic \ninstitutions.\n  As a 16-year member and the current chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs, I have closely followed U.S. policy toward the \ncontinent for many years. Too often, I have found that our approach has \nbeen driven by short-sighted tactics designed to buy influence or react \nto crises. In the absence of comprehensive interagency strategies, \nthese tactics often undermine long-term efforts to build civilian \ninstitutions and strengthen the rule of law. This must change if we are \nto successfully pursue our strategic objectives on the African \ncontinent. It remains critical--and long overdue--that the United \nStates develop a carefully planned and long-term approach to both \npromoting stability and combating terrorism in Africa. I would like to \noffer some thoughts today on key components of such an approach.\n  During our December recess, I traveled to the headquarters of the new \nAfrica Command in Stuttgart, Germany and discussed a range of issues \nwith senior officials there. Although I have been focused on AFRICOM \nsince its inception--and on the idea of such a command prior to that--I \nwas reminded during my trip of the very important and strategic roles \nthat AFRICOM, if advanced properly, can play. These roles include \nhelping to develop effective, well-disciplined militaries that adhere \nto civilian rule, strengthening regional peacekeeping missions, and \nsupporting postconflict demobilization and disarmament processes. If \ncarried out properly, AFRICOM's work can complement that of the State \nDepartment, USAID, and other U.S. Government agencies working on the \ncontinent and help contribute to lasting peace and stability across \nAfrica.\n  It is because of the significant need for this important work that we \nmust support AFRICOM, while also working to ensure that it adheres to \nits defined military mandate and defers to the State Department as the \nlead on policy matters. The challenge for AFRICOM is to strike the \nright balance with our civilian agencies and not become our primary \nrepresentation throughout Africa. Serious work remains to be done in \nensuring that the Command is operating within comprehensive interagency \nnational security strategies and squarely under the authority of our \nChiefs of Mission. I also remain concerned that AFRICOM has been unable \nto adequately convey its role within a larger policy framework to \nCongress, to the American people or to African governments and regional \norganizations--perhaps its most important partners.\n  It is true that the Command's initial rollout was fraught with \nmistakes and the Command understandably received a cool reception on \nthe continent, among civilian agencies and here in Congress. But I am \nconfident from my recent meetings that the staff in Stuttgart has \nrecognized and is learning from these setbacks. Rather than merely \ncriticizing, we in Congress should work across the spectrum of agencies \nhere in Washington as well as with AFRICOM's leadership to help craft a \ncombatant command that is doing the right job, for the right reasons \nand can thus be adequately resourced. In the months ahead, I intend to \nuse my role as chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs to do \njust that.\n  I hope, however, that no one thinks for a minute that military tools \nalone are sufficient to transform the underlying causes of violence and \ninstability in Africa. To promote long-term stability, it is crucial \nthat we strike a better balance between our military relationships and \nour support for civilian institutions and the rule of law.\n  Achieving that balance is no small task and it will only be possible \nif we invest seriously in new institutional capacities for our civilian \nagencies on the continent. This begins with ensuring our embassies have \nthe Foreign Service officers and resources they need to do the job \nproperly. We cannot continue to shortchange our embassies across Africa \nwhile we focus on one or two other locations around the world. We need \nto make sure our embassies have sufficient resources to meet the \nchallenges of today, and to identify the challenges of tomorrow. And we \nneed to make sure our presence includes the right kind of people--\ntrained political and economic officers who can get out and about to do \ntheir job.\n  By expanding our diplomatic presence in Africa, including outside the \ncapitals, we increase our ability to learn about the continent--its \ngovernments, its people and its cultures. Right now, we do not have the \nnecessary human resources or expertise on the African continent to \ngather this information and anticipate emerging crises or fully \nunderstand existing ones. Diplomatic reporting and open source \ncollection in Africa are a critical complement to the clandestine work \nof the\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nintelligence community, and I have long called for more resources for \nboth. I have also called for an integrated, interagency collection and \nanalysis strategy, which is why Senator Hagel and I last year \nintroduced legislation to establish an independent commission to \naddress this long-term, systematic problem. This legislation was passed \nby the Intelligence Committee last year and, although Senator Hagel has \nretired, I intend to reintroduce this legislation this year.\n  Developing these capacities and a balanced approach is in our \nnational security interest and is necessary if we are to better address \nareas of concern in Africa. At present, there are several devastating \ncrises that we cannot ignore, including in Congo, Nigeria, the Sahel, \nSudan and Zimbabwe. But I believe one region stands out for its \nparticular significance to our national security, and that is the Horn \nof Africa and specifically the deepening crisis in Somalia. I would \nlike to spend the rest of my remarks discussing the situation in this \nregion, where the need for a carefully planned and long-term approach \nis particularly urgent.\n  During my December trip, I also visited Djibouti. There, I met with \nmany leading figures in Somalia, including the Prime Minister of the \nSomali Transitional Federal Government, the leadership of the \nopposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia, the UN Special \nRepresentative for Somalia, the President of Somaliland and members of \nSomalia's civil society. I also met with Djiboutian government \nofficials and members of civil society, as well as with our diplomats \nworking on Somalia out of both Djibouti and Nairobi, who are \nextraordinary and deeply committed individuals.\n  Tragically, the situation in Somalia continues to get worse. Six \nmonths ago I stood on the Senate floor to discuss Somalia's \nhumanitarian crisis--the worst in the world. According to a local human \nrights group, an estimated 16,000 people have been killed since the \nstart of 2007, with over 28,000 people wounded and more than one \nmillion displaced. USAID now estimates that 3.2 million people--soon to \nbe half of the population--are in need of emergency assistance, \nincluding hundreds of thousands of refugees in neighboring countries. \nThe stories and images of human suffering coming out of Somalia are \nhorrifying.\n  In addition to the humanitarian impact, I am deeply concerned by the \npotential impact of this crisis on our national security. With the \nEthiopian army withdrawing, the transitional government remains \ndeadlocked, new militias are forming, and existing ones continue to \ngain new territory. And while the Somalis are a moderate people, the \nterrorist group al Shabab has grown in ranks and expanded its reach. \nMoreover, just last month, several senior officials, including CIA \nDirector Hayden and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen, said that al-Qaida is \nextending its reach in Somalia to revitalize its operations.\n  The Bush administration's approach to Somalia--endorsing the \nEthiopian invasion, backing an unpopular transitional government and \nlaunching periodic military strikes in the absence of a broader \ncoherent strategy--was an abject failure. Without a carefully crafted \nstrategy for Somalia, we have long relied on short-sighted tactics and \na ``manhunt'' approach, rather than investing fully in efforts to \npromote a sustainable peace and help build legitimate and inclusive \ninstitutions. The result has been increased anti-Americanism, which \nhelps enable extremist groups to effectively recruit and operate.\n  With the Obama administration now in office, there is a critical \nopportunity, as well as an urgent need, to identify the lessons of this \nfailed policy and signal a break from the past. One of my top \npriorities is to work with the Obama administration to develop a new \ncomprehensive interagency strategy to bring stability to Somalia and \nthe wider Horn of Africa. Support for the Djibouti process should \ncontinue, but we need to be far sighted about what it will take to \ntranslate diplomatic initiatives into security for the people of \nSomalia. That effort must include efforts from the ground up to build \nlegitimate and inclusive governance institutions that respond to the \nneeds of ordinary Somalis. For only when those institutions take hold \nwill we finally be able to limit the appeal of violent extremism and \nachieve sustainable peace and security--and bolster our own national \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S890-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S890-S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       You are asking Idahoans to write about gas prices? You mean \n     you do not know? I think Washington D.C. may as well be \n     registered as another planet because I think your colleagues \n     are so far from reality of the rest of the people it is \n     absolutely outrageous.\n       Your colleague Barbara Boxer of California said that she \n     wants Americans to use alternative routes of transportation \n     and that it is a good thing that gas prices force people to \n     take the bus, ride bikes, or walk to their destination \n     because it helps reduce global warming.\n       I have something to say to you and to Boxer and you can \n     tell her for me.\n       I am a driver for a living. I deliver products right here \n     in Boise. I have to drive I have no choice. I am also a \n     salesman, and a night supervisor. To Senator Boxer, I live in \n     Idaho. I do not have the option of riding the bus. I cannot \n     walk my deliveries or ride my bike with my products? Is she \n     insane?\n       I find it absolutely insulting for her to talk down to me \n     like that. She and her liberal Senators love these high gas \n     prices because they want to use it as an excuse to make us \n     live how they want us to live to fight so-called global \n     warming, while she and Al Gore fly in jets. That's Eco-\n     Socialism in my opinion.\n       Senator Crapo, I have three jobs. Three jobs. And I am \n     still having problems fueling up. I have had to open credit \n     card accounts for the first time in my life. And my debt is \n     still going up.\n       You'd think with three jobs and three paychecks for one \n     person. I am not married no kids. I would be starving with \n     fuel prices if I had a family. I am just barely paying my \n     bills on time as they are, to about $1500 a month not \n     including gas prices.\n       Starting in 2005 till 2007, I did very well financially, I \n     was saving up and putting money away in my savings account. I \n     loved myself for putting money away. This month in June I had \n     to take one-quarter of my life savings out of my bank to pay \n     for bills including gas because the price skyrocketed from $3 \n     to $4 a gallon in one month.\n       This is outrageous. I am so angry at Congress right now. . \n     . You have no idea.\n       I think it is 80 percent the Government's fault for this \n     and 20 percent the oil companies. The only thing the oil \n     companies are doing wrong is speculating the price of oil for \n     really dumb reasons. Like if you so much as sneeze the price \n     would go up in panic.\n       Congress has done this because you refuse to drill for oil \n     in ANWR to save a deer called caribou! Congress is more \n     worried about a stupid deer than they are about my life? More \n     worried about the mating season of the caribou than they are \n     about the economy? My jobs? My gas prices? My bills? My \n     lifestyle? I am sorry I thought you were the people's \n     Congress? Not the caribou's congress! Do we have an animal \n     congress I should know about?\n       You won't allow drilling off shore? Well did you know that \n     China is drilling for oil off the coast of Florida? But we \n     cannot? Why? This is outrageous.\n       Do not listen to those radical environmentalists. They were \n     wrong about the second ice age in the 70s. When I was kid in \n     school in the 1980's, my teachers told me by the year 1999 \n     New York would be underwater and Los Angeles would be a bunch \n     of Islands. It has not happened. Of course the earth's \n     temperature changes and jumps over time. The earth's climate \n     changes all the time, has been since the earth cooled and \n     formed. The earth's temperature does not stay the same all \n     the time. There are so many scientists and people who \n     disagree with Al Gore, but if we disagree we are labeled \n     ``flat-earthers'' and ``Holocaust Deniers.'' How dare Al Gore \n     tell me that I have no first amendment right to disagree with \n     him on climate change.\n       My question for the Republican Party is this. Why did you \n     not approve drilling for oil\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n     when you had Congress lock, stock, and barrel? In 2002, I \n     cheered when the GOP took back the Senate and we had both \n     Houses plus the White House. I yelled, ``Yes! At last we can \n     get some real work done!'' But what have you done with those \n     four years of three Branches with GOP? Nothing! You took your \n     voters for granted and then you were surprised when you lost \n     in 2006.\n       I have spoken to many Republicans, Moderates, Independents, \n     Moderate Democrats, and Conservatives who are seriously \n     thinking of either staying home or voting Democrat based on \n     the GOP's laziness. Although I do not trust Democrats with \n     the economy, why should we the voters reward Republicans? \n     Give us a reason? Answer . . . gas prices! Point out that it \n     is the Dems who want the price high! Even Barack Obama \n     admitted that he wanted it to go high just not so fast.\n       Senator Crapo. You want to help me? A person with three \n     jobs and struggling with gas prices? I have not had a \n     vacation since March of 2007! I can't even take a one day \n     vacation to Jackpot anymore! Senator Crapo I work all seven \n     days a week! I get no weekends! And I still struggle to pay \n     gas prices! About $15 a day! Not a week! A day!\n       Drill here! Drill now! Drill in ANWR! Drill in America!\n       Tell your friends drill.\n     Aaron Banks, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hi. Thank you Senator for your sincere concern for Idaho \n     Residents.\n       I am 58 next month, and on disability from a very severe \n     fire I was trapped in several years ago.\n       Though I do get an income, this is where it goes:\n       Receive $625.00 a month\n       1. $200.00 a month mobile home space rent\n       2. $156.00 a month mortgage payments for my mobile home . . \n     . which without the owner of the mobile home, I would not be \n     on my way to being a first time home owner!\n       3. $48.00 a month mobile home insurance\n       4. $40.00 a month vehicle insurance . . . it is a 1988 \n     Plymouth Voyager van that I have had since 1988.\n       5. $39.00 phone bill . . . which was supposed to reduced \n     several months ago through my social worker, an still remains \n     at the normal price and I do not have long distance.\n       6. $30-40 electricity monthly . . . do not have an air \n     conditioner for summer but do open my windows and use my \n     ceiling fans that helps.\n       7. $125-and up in winter for gas to run my heater monthly . \n     . . that is after I receive fuel assistance which for some \n     reason only lasts 1-2 months and only use the heater to warm \n     up the area so can start my wood stove which is usually one-\n     half hour.\n       So if I am lucky, all I can afford to do is put up to \n     $20.00 a month in gas which gives me almost 1/4 tank and that \n     has to last the month.\n       I have medical problems that mean many trips to the doctor \n     and pharmacy, and with such a low amount of gas I have to \n     depend on others for rides when I run out of gas.\n       Thank you for your sincere concern and we are all hoping \n     and praying that gas will once again come down to where \n     people like me can afford to purchase more.\n     Loretta Lowerre, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       First of all, I am disappointed that you provide prefixes \n     for all kinds of people except the only class of people (with \n     one exception--MSgt) that have official (not courteous) \n     titles in these United States--the military. My title is \n     Colonel.\n       Second, from your letter on gas prices that you sent me, \n     you are starting to understand that the Congress holds most \n     of the blame for high oil (and thus gas) prices. Congress has \n     failed to act in the thirty years since the last gas crisis, \n     continually failing to take responsible action to make sure \n     domestic supplies are developed and used to reduce dependence \n     on foreign oil.\n       It should be clear that the single most deleterious action \n     of Congress over the last forty years was the Environmental \n     Protection Act. It has desperately needed revision since the \n     early seventies and because it was not, the economic impact \n     on America has been extreme. The inability to build domestic \n     gas refineries, increase domestic oil production and take \n     advantage of resources in ANWR are only a few of the \n     unintended and disastrous impacts of that act. An \n     environmentalist has only to write a single letter to cause \n     the price of any such proposal to escalade exponentially. The \n     latest case of the proposed nuclear reactor in Idaho is an \n     example. One man writing one letter can cause the waste of \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars to ``prove'' the lack of \n     environmental impacts of such a proposal.\n       The price of a house in Idaho has risen by 10-15 percent, \n     for instance, because of the ludicrous and technically flawed \n     environmental studies and reactions on the spotted owl.\n       Still no action in Congress to alleviate the situation. We \n     simply need someone to stand up and take the actions \n     necessary to replace political correctness with what used to \n     be common sense.\n       So the bottom line, Senator, is that Congress bears the \n     responsibility to stop passing stupid laws and start reigning \n     in those that are hurting the nation's ability to do the \n     right things rather than the politically correct things. Do \n     you have the courage to start?\n     Robert Keenan, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked what the high gas prices are doing to me. It has \n     become very difficult to even do normal things. I cannot \n     afford to go up town and buy necessary things. Since I am on \n     Social Security Disability my sister and I have been living \n     off my money. Since my sister does not have a car and I \n     cannot afford to buy one for her, nor could I afford the gas. \n     She would love to go to work. How would she get there? Idaho, \n     and particularly this area has a really horrible public \n     transportation system. It truly is a disgrace to our state. \n     My sister walks as much as possible. Our nation needs to stop \n     depending on foreign oil. I love all the animals and have \n     tried to protect them as much as possible, but we need to \n     start taking care of our families first.\n       The oil companies are making over the profit margin; that \n     is disgusting by itself. I do not trust one thing they say or \n     do. Therefore, we need to have alternative fuel. The wind can \n     run electricity. The air can fuel a car, water can do both, \n     after seeing the pictures of a car that runs on air. America, \n     the greatest country in the world needs to step up to the \n     plate. Oil companies need to step up to the plate before they \n     become the dinosaurs. Therefore, we need to drill. Do it. \n     Many families like mine are being devastated by the high \n     gasoline prices which makes high food prices we cannot \n     afford. Thank you for your time.\n     Marian Ruhling, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello--This is in response to a solicitation from Senator \n     Crapo regarding personal stories on how high energy prices \n     are affecting lives.\n       Greed is the source of most of the world's evil. I know I \n     sound like an ideologue, but please read on.\n       It is hard to disaggregate the effects of the high cost of \n     energy from other economic hits our family is experiencing. \n     When construction activity slowed in Valley and Adams County, \n     wage earning families left our valleys looking for jobs \n     elsewhere. So long, Tamarack?\n       The resulting reduced school enrollment (now compounded by \n     the end of Craig-Wyden) in our districts led me to being one \n     of the teachers RIF'd from the Council School District. \n     Fortunately, I found work part-time in the McCall School \n     District. Unfortunately, this 70 mile, round-trip commute (in \n     my 2000 140,000+ mile Dodge AWD Caravan--needed for \n     unpredictable roads) costs me $9.00-$12.00 a trip! I would \n     like to buy a more fuel efficient Subaru--but I cannot afford \n     to.)\n       My school-age children suffer because programs are being \n     severely reduced--Shop and Art are gone. Some high school \n     courses will only be offered every other year. Summer school \n     for poor learners is truncated. Field trips? Sports? Are you \n     kidding? Both are severely reduced. How can our small-town \n     children go out and experience the world when there isn't \n     even money for gas?\n       As consumers, our family lives so far from ``the source'' \n     that not only gas, but also milk and other basic commodities \n     seem to cost at least 25 percent more than they did a year \n     ago. Last year I was able to find milk for $2.29 gallon; now \n     milk costs close to $4.00/gallon. Healthy bread costs close \n     to $4.00/loaf. As a family, we certainly have not received a \n     COLA to offset these price increases.\n       As middle-class professionals (my husband is a forester) \n     and as parents, the drain on our budget means belt-tightening \n     for any of ``fun things'' like vacation trips. Additionally, \n     we have experienced a health crisis (and have met our \n     catastrophic limits). I now must commute to Fruitland (140 \n     miles round trip) every 2 weeks for chemo; in the fall I will \n     need to commute 5 days a week for radiation for 6 weeks! (My \n     doctor cavalierly denied me two prescriptions for drugs since \n     they are also available OTC. ``They only cost a few dollars. \n     `` He casually shrugged off my request for RXs. Well, the two \n     drugs cost more than $30 altogether. I do not think that the \n     upper-middle-class and upper-class have a clue that there is \n     an exponential difference between a few bucks (a latte) and \n     $30--a chance to visit a museum or movie, or halfway fill up \n     a gas tank to make it to a chemo session!)\n       I believe that our tax system rewards the rich on the backs \n     of the poor and middle class. I believe that oil companies \n     and owners of stocks are making fortunes as the little guy \n     suffers.\n       I believe we should take global warning seriously and allow \n     tax credits for the development of alternative energy. We \n     need to take recycling very seriously. We also need to be a \n     world economic partner on a fair playing field (Kyoto \n     convention), quit out-sourcing to countries that do not \n     provide the labor protections we do to our workers, and build \n     respectful relationships among all peoples and all cultures--\n     as a first step to world peace and understanding and a step \n     away from the ugliness of war.\n       I also believe that limiting population growth and sharing \n     the world's resource's equably is the only way we will ever \n     establish peace on earth.\n       Locally, for our family, what have been the effects of high \n     energy costs? Higher food and medical costs, loss of job, \n     reduced school programs for my children, dwindled savings, \n     ``making do'' with older cars and housing needs, fewer \n     amenities, no vacation.\n       Glad you asked.\n     Lynn, Fruitvale.\n                                  ____\n\n       I read your letter sent out today.\n       Glad to hear that at least one of our Senators in \n     Washington gets it. I hope there are\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\n     more of you in DC that can support the policies you want to \n     support in your letter.\n       We do need to start drilling again in the US and Off-Shore. \n     We need to make sure that we take precautions to avoid damage \n     to the environment. We cannot sacrifice one for the other. \n     But we must start drilling again, and do so in a respective \n     manner of Mother Nature.\n       And we are going to need some new refining capability. \n     Again, do it new technology and with respect to our \n     environment. Build it in Eastern Idaho--we have the space and \n     we could use the jobs and economic boost. Tough to get oil \n     here, but if they need a place for it, bring it here.\n       We must start the nuclear programs again. We need to build \n     some new reactors soon. I do not know for sure, but I am \n     betting some of our older reactors are getting long in the \n     tooth, and if they go off the grid, then what happens? \n     Besides we need more power and money spent to renew our grid \n     system.\n       We need to take a serious look at Ethanol. I am not sure it \n     is all it is being promoted to be. I am not sure the benefits \n     outweigh all of the costs. With the flooding in the Midwest, \n     I wonder what the cost of corn will be now? But it is not \n     just food issues, but the processing issues as well.\n       Wind Power should be promoted as well. But a Nuclear Power \n     Plant is much easier on the eyes than 1000 wind towers, and \n     not as susceptible to the changes in the wind.\n       Coal alternatives should be looked at as well. We need to \n     check if the benefits we can gain from technology like coal \n     gasification are valid and have low impact. Some of the \n     claims you hear and read about look promising. But as I am \n     learning with Ethanol, there may be some significant costs to \n     chase this type of technology.\n       But the short of it--we need to develop our energy and \n     become more independent. The amount of jobs created would be \n     incredible in the process. You want a better health care \n     system and less unemployment and less government care \n     programs--just set the energy companies loose (for a change) \n     and see this economy rebound in a heartbeat. These energy \n     companies can afford health care plans and benefits for their \n     workers. Our current policies are killing us--and I really \n     hope there are enough Senators and Representatives in DC to \n     turn this around. We have been shooting ourselves in the foot \n     for more than 20 years. Guess it took that long for the \n     ``brain'' to finally realize the pain in doing so.\n       Good Luck.\n     Stephen Kaiser, Rigby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S892-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ARDIS DUMETT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ardis Dumett \nfor her 20 years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of \nWashington State. Ardis has served on my staff for the last 16 years of \nher distinguished public career. For 4 years prior to her service in my \noffice, she worked for the revered Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson. On \nJanuary 20, Ardis retired from my office. We are sad to see her go and \nhope that she enjoys her well-earned retirement.\n  Throughout her career, Ardis has been a thoughtful and dedicated \npublic servant. Initially, as my constituent services director, she led \nby example in her commitment and compassion to the constituents of \nWashington State. Covering immigration and environmental casework, she \nensured the people of my State were well served by their Federal \nGovernment.\n  As the director of special projects in my Seattle office, she worked \non numerous issues on my behalf over the years, ranging from the \nenvironment and emergency response to tribes and the transfer of \nmilitary property. She worked tirelessly to guarantee that our State's \npeople and communities received a fair process--and often a successful \noutcome--when working with Federal agencies. Over the years I have \nreceived many notes from constituents thanking me for Ardis' diligent \nwork.\n  I would like to thank Ardis for her years of service to me and the \npeople of Washington State. Her career is a tremendous example of \npublic service; and her dedication to her work is truly appreciated. I \nwish her all the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S892-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME 2009\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am proud to be involved for a \nthird year in the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme, UCWIP, \nan exchange program in which outstanding college students from \nAustralia's top universities compete to serve as interns for the U.S. \nCongress. The program is in its 10th year of bringing the Washington \nexperience to our friends from Australia, firsthand. In addition to \nworking in congressional offices, the program provides students with a \nnumber of other opportunities and activities including visits to \nhistoric sites, visits to government agencies, meetings with government \nleaders, and educational events.\n  This year, Nicholas Tam, a student from Melbourne University in \nAustralia, is taking a 2-month hiatus from his law degree to help me \nserve Idaho constituents. Of the program, Nick says, ``Working with \nSenator Crapo has been a gateway to developing a nuanced, sophisticated \nunderstanding of the United States and its precise position and role in \nthe world. UCWIP has been culturally enriching and enhancing of my own \nprofessional development. It has been a real privilege to aid in the \nadvancement of strong conservative principles whilst working here in \nthe United States Senate.'' Nick is a terrific temporary addition to my \nstaff and, like past interns, an intelligent individual, hard worker \nand personable.\n  Director Eric Federing and his wife Daphne have shown a decade of \ntireless commitment to enlarging the educational experience of \nAustralian students. Now with 81 program alumni, this educational and \nhighly successful exchange program has earned a rightful place among \nleading international academic exchange opportunities. I am honored to \ncontinue to participate in this well-crafted and successful \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S892-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S892-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S892-5", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 181.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndeliver a meaningful benefit and lower prescription drug prices under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the 6 years since Congress passed the \nMedicare Modernization Act, life for seniors has become increasingly \ndifficult. The majority of seniors live on a fixed income, but face the \nchallenge of paying more with less as the costs for everything continue \nto rise. Housing costs, basic nutrition, and healthcare needs are more \nexpensive.\n  The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare was long \noverdue, and many senior citizens and people with disabilities are \nrelieved to finally have drug coverage. But the drug benefit was not \nstructured like the rest of Medicare. For all other Medicare benefits, \nseniors can choose whether to receive benefits directly through \nMedicare or through a private insurance plan. The overwhelming majority \nchoose the Medicare-run option for their hospital and physician \ncoverage.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n  Unfortunately, no such choice is available for prescription drugs. \nMedicare beneficiaries must enroll in a private insurance plan to \nobtain drug coverage and with that are subjected to the multiple \nchanges drug plans are allowed to impose on seniors year after year.\n  Each drug plan has its own premium, cost-sharing requirements, list \nof covered drugs, and pharmacy network. After you have identified the \nright drug plan, you have to go through the whole process again at the \nend of the year because your plan may have changed the drugs it covers \nor added new restrictions on how to access covered drugs.\n  Seniors are having trouble identifying which of the dozens of private \ndrug plans works best for them. The complexity of the program has made \nbeneficiaries more vulnerable to aggressive and deceptive marketing \npractices as some insurers try to steer seniors into more profitable \nMedicare Advantage plans. Some seniors have been signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage plans without their knowledge, and, unfortunately, there have \nalso been dishonest insurance agents who have misrepresented what \nbenefits would be covered. Anyone who has visited a senior center or \nspoken with an elderly relative knows that the complexity of the drug \nbenefit has created much confusion.\n  Drug plans often do not tell beneficiaries that they can appeal a \ndrug plan's decision to deny coverage for a drug, even though they are \nrequired to do so. Beneficiaries who do appeal soon find that it is a \nlong and difficult process.\n  Multiple studies have shown that private drug plans have not been \neffective negotiators, which means seniors end up paying more than they \nshould. A report by Avalere Health released in late 2008 revealed that \nthe average beneficiary will see a 24 percent increase in their monthly \npremiums for 2009. The top 10 most popular plans by enrollment will \nincrease their premiums by more than 30 percent.\n  Today, I am introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and \nChoice Act. The bill would create a Medicare-operated drug plan that \nwould compete with private drug plans and would give the Health and \nHuman Services Secretary leverage to negotiate with drug companies to \nlower drug prices.\n  The Health and Human Services Secretary would have the tools to \nnegotiate with drug companies, including the use of drug formulary. The \nbest medical evidence would determine which drugs are covered in the \nformulary, and the formulary would be used to promote safety, \nappropriate use of drugs, and value.\n  The bill would establish an appeals process that is efficient, \nimposes minimal administrative burdens, and ensures timely procurement \nof non-formulary drugs or non-preferred drugs when medically necessary.\n  This is the kind of drug plan that Medicare beneficiaries are looking \nfor. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, two-thirds \nof seniors want the option of getting drug coverage directly from \nMedicare, and over 80 percent favor allowing the Government to \nnegotiate with drug companies for lower prices.\n  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan \nand deserve a simpler, more dependable, and less costly program that \nprioritizes their needs.

A bill to establish a comprehensive interagency response to \nreduce lung cancer mortality in a timely manner; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Lung Cancer \nMortality Reduction Act, calling for a new effort to combat this often \ndeadly form of cancer. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Brownback, \nthe Co-Chair of\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nthe Senate Cancer Coalition, and a strong voice on a variety of cancer \nissues.\n  This bill will renew and improve the Federal Government's efforts to \ncombat lung cancer. It will affirm the goal of a 50 percent reduction \nin lung cancer mortality by 2015.\n  It will authorize a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, with \ninteragency coordination, to develop and implement a plan to meet this \ngoal.\n  It will authorize $75 million for lung cancer research programs in \nthe National Heart Lung Blood Institute, National Institute of \nBiomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, and Centers for Disease Control.\n  It will create a new incentive program in the Food and Drug \nAdministration to be modeled on the Orphan Drug Act for the development \nof chemoprevention drugs for lung cancer and precancerous lung disease. \nThese are drugs that could prevent precancer from progressing into \nfull-blown disease.\n  It will improve coordination disparity programs to ensure that the \nburdens of lung cancer on minority populations are addressed.\n  We have made great strides against many types of cancer in the last \nseveral decades. However, these gains are uneven.\n  When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, lung cancer had a 5-\nyear survival rate of only 12 percent. After decades of research \nefforts and scientific advances, this survival rate remains only 15 \npercent. In contrast, the 5-year survival rates of breast, prostate, \nand colon cancer have risen to 89 percent, 99 percent and 65 percent \nrespectively.\n  A lung cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The average life \nexpectancy following a lung cancer diagnosis is only 9 months.\n  This is because far too many patients are not diagnosed with lung \ncancer until it has progressed to the later stages. Lung cancer can be \nhard to diagnose, and symptoms may at first appear to be other \nillnesses. As a result, only 16 percent of lung cancer patients are \ndiagnosed when their cancer is still localized, and is the most \ntreatable.\n\n  Lung cancer still lacks early detection technology, to find cancer \nwhen it is most treatable. Mammograms can find breast cancer, and \ncolonoscopies can find dangerous colon polyps. But there is no \nequivalent test for lung cancer at this time.\n  Under this legislation, the National Cancer Institute has clear \nauthority to work with other institutes on this early detection \nresearch. Coordination between all branches of the National Institutes \nof Health, including those with expertise on lungs, imaging, and cancer \nwill be necessary to make this long overdue progress.\n  Lung cancer lags behind other cancers, in part, due to stigma from \nsmoking. Make no mistake, tobacco use causes the majority of lung \ncancer cases. Tobacco cessation is a critical component of reducing \nlung cancer mortality. Less smoking means less lung cancer. Period.\n  But tobacco use does not fully explain lung cancer. Approximately 15 \npercent of the people who die from lung cancer never smoked. A study \npublished in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2007 tracked the \nincidence of lung cancer in 1 million people ages 40 to 79. It found \nthat about 20 percent of female lung cancer patients were nonsmokers \nand 8 percent of male patients were nonsmokers.\n  These patients may have been exposed to second hand smoke, or they \nmay have been exposed to radon, asbestos, chromium, or other chemicals. \nThere could be other causes and associations that have not yet been \ndiscovered, genetic predispositions or other environmental exposures.\n  Dana Reeve put a face on these statistics, with her brave fight \nagainst lung cancer. Dana Reeve was a nonsmoker, and still was \ndiagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 44. She died a mere 7 months \nlater, leaving a young son.\n  Dana Reeve's story shows that smoking cannot fully explain lung \ncancer. Everyone in this country could stop smoking today, and yet we \nwould still face a lung cancer epidemic. According to the Lung Cancer \nAlliance, over 60 percent of new lung cancer cases occur in those who \nnever smoked, or who quit smoking.\n  I believe that we have the expertise and technology to make serious \nprogress against this deadly cancer, and to reach the goal of halving \nlung cancer mortality by 2015.\n  We need this legislation to ensure that our Government's resources \nare focused on this mission in the most efficient way possible.\n  Agency efforts must be coordinated, and every part of the National \nInstitutes of Health that may have some ideas to lend should be \nparticipating. That is what the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program \nwill accomplish.\n  We can do better for Americans diagnosed with lung cancer. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 332\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lung Cancer Mortality \n     Reduction Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for \n     both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer \n     deaths.\n       (2) Lung cancer kills more people annually than breast \n     cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, \n     melanoma, and kidney cancer combined.\n       (3) Since the enactment of the National Cancer Act of 1971 \n     (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and \n     comprehensive research has raised the 5-year survival rates \n     for breast cancer to 88 percent, for prostate cancer to 99 \n     percent, and for colon cancer to 64 percent.\n       (4) However, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is \n     still only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and \n     comprehensive research effort is required to achieve \n     increases in lung cancer survivability rates.\n       (5) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed as \n     nonsmokers or former smokers.\n       (6) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are \n     women.\n       (7) Certain minority populations, such as African-American \n     males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer \n     incidence and mortality, notwithstanding their similar \n     smoking rate.\n       (8) Members of the baby boomer generation are entering \n     their sixties, the most common age at which people develop \n     lung cancer.\n       (9) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer \n     carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and \n     battlefield emissions are serious problems among military \n     personnel and war veterans.\n       (10) Significant and rapid improvements in lung cancer \n     mortality can be expected through greater use and access to \n     lung cancer screening tests for at-risk individuals.\n       (11) Additional strategies are necessary to further enhance \n     the existing tests and therapies available to diagnose and \n     treat lung cancer in the future.\n       (12) The August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n     Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that \n     funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels \n     characterized for other common malignancies and far out of \n     proportion to its massive health impact''.\n       (13) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group \n     identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of \n     integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research \n     consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer.\n       (14) The United States must enhance its response to the \n     issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress \n     Review Group, and this can be accomplished through the \n     establishment of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the \n     lung cancer mortality rate by 50 percent by 2016 and through \n     targeted funding to support this coordinated effort.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG \n                   CANCER RESEARCH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a \n     national public health priority; and\n       (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified \n     and necessary to adequately address and reduce lung cancer \n     mortality.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of \nMoldova; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to extend permanent normal trade relations to Moldova. Moldova \nis still subject to the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to \nthe Trade Act of 1974, which sanctions nations for failure to comply \nwith freedom of emigration requirements. This bill would repeal \npermanently the application of Jackson-Vanik to Moldova.\n  Moldova is a small country located in Europe between Ukraine and \nRomania. Throughout the Cold War it was a part of the Soviet Union. It \ngained its independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991. The \nUnited States has supported Moldova in its journey toward democracy and \nsovereignty.\n  The United States enjoys good relations with Moldova and has \nencouraged Moldovan efforts to integrate with Euro-Atlantic \ninstitutions. Moldova has been selected to participate in the Eastern \nPartnership, an initiative proposed by the European Union in 2008, \nwhich will facilitate the creation of free trade agreements, energy \nsecurity plans, and closer economic ties between the EU and Moldova.\n  Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova \nhas enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. In 2001, \nMoldova became a member of the World Trade Organization. Furthermore, \nMoldovan\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nPresident Vladimir Voronin has recently expressed his desire to sign an \naccord to strengthen relations between Moldova and the European Union \nthis year. Until the United States terminates application of Jackson-\nVanik on Moldova, the U.S. will not benefit from Moldova's market \naccess commitments nor can it resort to WTO dispute resolution \nmechanisms. While all other WTO members currently enjoy these benefits, \nthe U.S. does not.\n  The Republic of Moldova has been evaluated every year and granted \nnormal trade relations with the United States through annual \npresidential waivers from the effects of Jackson-Vanik. The Moldovan \nconstitution guarantees its citizens the right to emigrate and this \nright is respected in practice. Most emigration restrictions were \neliminated in 1991 and virtually no problems with emigration have been \nreported in the 16 years since independence. More specifically, Moldova \ndoes not impose emigration restrictions on members of the Jewish \ncommunity. Synagogues function openly and without harassment. As a \nresult, the administration finds that Moldova is in full compliance \nwith Jackson-Vanik's provisions.\n  Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, Moldova \nhas enacted a series of democratic and free market reforms. \nParliamentary elections in 2005 and local elections in 2007 generally \ncomplied with international standards for democratic elections.\n  Moldova has also contributed constructively towards a resolution of \nthe long-standing separatist conflict in the country's Transniestria \nregion, most recently by proposing a series of confidence-building \nmeasures and working groups. In addition, trade increased between the \ntwo parties by 30 percent in 2007.\n  The United States and Moldova have established a strong record of \nachievement in security cooperation. In 1997 the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program responded to a Moldovan request for \nassistance. The U.S. purchased and secured 14 nuclear-capable MiG-29Cs \nfrom Moldova. These fighter aircraft were built by the former Soviet \nUnion to launch nuclear weapons. Moldova expressed concern that these \naircraft were unsecure due to the lack of funds and equipment necessary \nto ensure they were not stolen or smuggled out of the country. \nSpecifically, emissaries from Iran had shown great interest and had \nattempted to acquire the aircraft. These planes were not destroyed. \nThey were disassembled and shipped to Wright Patterson Air Force Base \nbecause they can be used by American experts for research purposes.\n  Moldova has made small, but important, troop contributions in Iraq. \nThese contributions include significant demining capabilities and \ncontingents of combat troops. I am pleased that the United States \nremains prepared to assist in weapons and ammunition disposal and force \nrelocation assistance to help deal with the costs of military \nrealignments in Moldova and to assist with military downsizing and \nreforms.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Moldovan relations is \nbilateral trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration \nrequirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should not be subject \nto the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik. The U.S. must remain committed and \nengaged in assisting Moldova in pursuing economic and development \nreforms. The government in Chisinau still has important work to do in \nthese critical areas. The support and encouragement of the U.S. and the \ninternational community will be key to encouraging the Government of \nMoldova to take the necessary steps to initiate reform. The permanent \nwaiver of Jackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade \nrelations will be the foundation on which further progress in a \nburgeoning economic and energy partnership can be made.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation. It is essential that we act promptly to bolster \nthis important relationship and promote stability in this region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S899-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 22--RECOGNIZING THE GOALS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK \n  AND HONORING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

and\n       (E) the relationship (if any) between changes in the \n     availability and affordability of dependent coverage under \n     employer-sponsored health insurance and CHIP crowd-out.\n       (2) IOM report on methodology.--The Secretary shall enter \n     into an arrangement with the Institute of Medicine under \n     which the Institute submits to the Committee on Finance of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n     House of Representatives and the Secretary, not later than 18 \n     months after the date of the enactment of this Act, a report \n     on--\n       (A) the most accurate, reliable, and timely way to \n     measure--\n       (i) on a State-by-State basis, the rate of public and \n     private health benefits coverage among low-income children \n     with family income that does not exceed 200 percent of the \n     poverty line; and\n       (ii) CHIP crowd-out, including in the case of children with \n     family income that exceeds 200 percent of the poverty line; \n     and\n       (B) the least burdensome way to gather the necessary data \n     to conduct the measurements described in subparagraph (A).\n     Out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, \n     there are hereby appropriated $2,000,000 to carry out this \n     paragraph for the period ending September 30, 2010.\n       (3) Incorporation of definitions.--In this section, the \n     terms ``CHIP crowd-out'', ``children'', ``poverty line'', and \n     ``State'' have the meanings given such terms for purposes of \n     CHIP.\n       (4) Definition of chip crowd-out.--Section 2110(c) (42 \n     U.S.C. 1397jj(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(9) CHIP crowd-out.--The term `CHIP crowd-out' means the \n     substitution of--\n       ``(A) health benefits coverage for a child under this \n     title, for\n       ``(B) health benefits coverage for the child other than \n     under this title or title XIX.''.\n       (c) Development of Best Practice Recommendations.--Section \n     2107 (42 U.S.C. 1397gg) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g) Development of Best Practice Recommendations.--Within \n     6 months after the date of receipt of the reports under \n     subsections (a) and (b) of section 116 of the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, the \n     Secretary, in consultation with States, including Medicaid \n     and CHIP directors in States, shall publish in the Federal \n     Register, and post on the public website for the Department \n     of Health and Human Services--\n       ``(1) recommendations regarding best practices for States \n     to use to address CHIP crowd-out;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of S. Res. 23, submitted earlier today \nby Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 23) honoring the life of Andrew \n     Wyeth.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of Senator Specter's \nresolution honoring Andrew Wyeth and to pay tribute to the landmark \nlife and legacy of this towering giant of American Art. My State of \nMaine joins Pennsylvania, the Nation, and the world in mourning the \ninexpressible loss of Andrew Wyeth, a painter of enormous genius, brave \nvision, and unmatched realism who long ago secured a rightful and \nprominent place in the pantheon of artists.\n  One of the most `American' of painters, Andrew Wyeth possessed a \ncourage and sensitivity to capture the stark beauty of the landscapes \nand individuals he depicted. And those of us from Maine will forever \nhold a special place in our hearts for the undeniable love he had for \nour State, as portrayed in his moving landscapes of Maine's coasts and \nespecially in his exceptional ``Christina's World.'' Like millions \naround the world, we will miss Andrew Wyeth's historic and enduring \ncontributions to the American story as told on canvas as well as his \npowerful capacity for capturing the human condition unvarnished.\n  On a personal note, it was such a privilege to know Andy and his \nwonderful wife, Betsy, over the years. I will always treasure the fond \nmemories of visiting Andy and Betsy and their family at their home on \nAllen Island. Indisputably, Andy lived his life the way he painted--\nwith integrity, grace, and an abiding sense of humanity. And I always \nremember the pride and honor I felt attending the presentation of a \nNational Medal of the Arts in 2007 to Andy at the White House in an \nunforgettable ceremony rightly recognizing his iconic body of work over \nan extraordinary lifetime.\n  I would like to include for the Record a recent outstanding article \nentitled Wyeth's White Wonder by John Wilmerding, published in The Wall \nStreet Journal, Saturday, January 24, 2009. Formerly a professor at \nDartmouth College, Mr. Wilmerding curated the exhibition Andrew Wyeth: \nThe Helga Pictures at the National Gallery of Art in 1987 and recently \nretired as Sarofim Professor of American Art at Princeton University. \nDescribing Andrew Wyeth's Snow Hill as one of his most memorable works, \nMr. Wilmerding captures the essence of the painting and the painter, \ncalling Snow Hill ``one of the most haunting, beautiful and resonant of \nWyeth's seven-decade career.''\n  Poet Robert Frost once wrote of a star that ``it asks a little of us \nhere/It asks of us a certain height,'' and certainly the same can be \nsaid of Andrew Wyeth who inspired and entreated us to experience his \ncourageous rendering of the world as he saw it, and like generations to \ncome, we are eternally indebted to him. Andrew Wyeth's artistic \nachievements resonate not only in our time--but for all time. He will \nbe profoundly missed, and we extend our deepest condolences to Betsy \nand to our great friends--their son, Jamie and his wife, Phyllis--their \nson, Nicholas; and the entire Wyeth family for their tremendous loss.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\n            [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 24-25, 2009]\n\n                          Wyeth's White Wonder\n\n                          (By John Wilmerding)\n\n       Andrew Wyeth died last week on a winter's day familiar to \n     us from many of his paintings: snowy, cold and moody. Perhaps \n     the best form of appreciation we can express for his artistic \n     achievement is to undertake a close look at one of his iconic \n     works in this case ``Snow Hill,'' a painting from the height \n     of his powers that is relatively little known, seen or \n     reproduced. While it has been on loan to the Brandywine \n     Museum (www.brandywine-museum.org) for several years, its \n     fragility of surface has kept it from going out on loan to a \n     wider audience, and its singularity of subject matter has not \n     readily found it a place in recent Wyeth monographs or \n     exhibition catalogs. Only posterity is likely to sort out \n     which of his paintings will stand up as his most memorable \n     works, but ``Snow Hill'' is likely to hold its own as one of \n     the most haunting, beautiful and resonant of Wyeth's seven-\n     decade career.\n       Indeed, the picture is about marking seven decades. Wyeth, \n     who lived to the age of 91, painted this large tempera to \n     mark his 70th birthday (in 1987). He finished the painstaking \n     effort two years later. There are few others that are larger \n     and as ambitious. The artist was conscious of mortality for \n     much of his career, from the deaths of his father and nephew \n     in a train accident in 1945, to his own miscellaneous \n     ailments, operations and illnesses throughout his later \n     years.\n       We know that many of his images were in varying degrees \n     autobiographical, and this painting was a conscious summary \n     of his artistic life that was both somber memoir and playful \n     recalibraion. Like many of Wyeth's winter landscapes in \n     watercolor, dry-brush, or egg tempera, this makes the most of \n     a near-monochromatic palette, where darks and lights play \n     against each other, and nature's full range of grays and tans \n     takes on a heightened texture. One of his great talents was \n     an intense technical virtuosity in all of his chosen media. \n     Yet even as his admirers and critics are drawn to the magic \n     realism of objects and surfaces, it is the charged emotion, \n     suggestive meaning, and complex moods beneath facades and \n     faces that distinguish his finest visions.\n       The setting was intimately familiar to Wyeth almost his \n     entire life, a view looking down over the Kuerner farm and \n     the nearby hills of the Brandywine Valley in Pennsylvania. \n     The artist knew almost every inch of the roads, buildings and \n     fields we see in the distance below. Historians and others \n     may argue for some time whether his future reputation will \n     rest on the landscapes or portraits (respectively descended \n     from two of his artistic idols, Winslow Homer and Thomas \n     Eakins). ``Snow Hill'' is unusual in the merging of the two--\n     one open, silent and vast; the other intimate, animate and \n     active. The foreground hilltop, receding valley, and broad \n     sky constitute a painted tour de force of whites, off-whites \n     and cream colors. Its poetic emptiness recalls the stark \n     eloquence seen in but a few of Wyeth's other strongest \n     compositions--such as ``Christina's World'' (1949), ``River \n     Cove'' (1958) and ``Airborne'' (1996).\n       Atop the hillside we view the improbable scene of a Maypole \n     dance at Christmas time. The seven ribbons descending from \n     beneath the tree above mark the artist's seven decades. In a \n     surreal vision, Wyeth assembles prominent figures from his \n     life and art who appeared in major paintings over the years. \n     Holding hands from left to right across the foreground are \n     Karl and Anna Kuerner, followed by William Loper and Helga \n     Testorf. In the back right is the family friend and neighbor \n     Allan Lynch, wearing his telltale hat with earflaps flying, \n     and finally, partially obscured, a figure with billowing \n     brown coat who recalls the artist's wife, Betsy, posing years \n     earlier in the snowy courtyard of their Chadd's Ford \n     farmhouse. In this enumeration we realize the group only \n     comes to six, suggesting a missing seventh figure. Possibly \n     Christina Olson, the most enduring of Wyeth's Maine subjects, \n     made famous by his first masterpiece, ``Christina's World,'' \n     is not present, since her paralysis would keep her from \n     dancing. Or perhaps the implied seventh individual might be \n     the artist himself, participant in their lives and unseen \n     orchestrator of this imaginary get-together. In any case, \n     this is a witty and exuberant conjuring of artistic \n     imagination.\n       Not surprisingly for Wyeth, however, there are notes of \n     darkness beneath the celebratory gathering: Wyeth had lived \n     through Karl Kuerner succumbing to cancer, Allan Lynch to \n     suicide, and William Loper to madness. Even so, what we \n     ultimately experience here is the enjoyment of art, life and \n     creativity, an idea subtly but vividly conveyed by the air-\n     touched ribbons. They contain the most intense colors and \n     free-flowing brushstrokes in this picture. Wyeth once \n     described how he approached their execution. In part \n     remembering his childhood games with friends, dressing up as \n     soldiers or medieval knights with play swords or sabers, he \n     envisioned here addressing the painting like a fencer with an \n     epee. With arm and brush extended, he swiftly moved to the \n     surface and slashed each stroke of color from the apex down \n     to the figures.\n       There is one more level of meaning embodied in this half-\n     real, half-dream image, which resides in its title. ``Snow \n     Hill'' is at once a literal description and a literary \n     allusion. Yes, our vantage point is on the crown of this \n     snowy hill, gently curving across the foreground. But its \n     contour also brings to mind the great rounded back of a white \n     whale, which Wyeth connected to ``Moby-Dick.'' His painting's \n     title comes from a line toward the end of Melville's book. In \n     chapter 133, ``The Chase--First Day,'' a sailor aloft cries, \n     ``there she blows!--there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! \n     It is Moby Dick!'' This of course reinforces Wyeth's own \n     juxtapositions of black and white, darkness and light, death \n     and life. His ``Snow Hill'' is a more personal drama than \n     Melville's, but no less a celebration of whiteness, in \n     symbolism and pigment.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 23\n\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth was one of the most popular American \n     artists of the twentieth century, whose paintings presented \n     to the world his impressions of rural American landscapes and \n     lives;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth was born in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania \n     on July 12, 1917, where he spent much of his life and where \n     today stands the Brandywine River Museum, a museum dedicated \n     to the works of the Wyeth family;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth died the morning of January 16, 2009, \n     at the age of 91, in his home in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas it is the intent of the Senate to recognize and pay \n     tribute to the life of Andrew Wyeth, his passion for \n     painting, his contribution to the world of art, and his deep \n     understanding of the human condition;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth was born the son of famed illustrator \n     N.C. Wyeth and grew up surrounded by artists in an \n     environment that encouraged imagination and free-thinking;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth became an icon who focused his work on \n     family and friends in Chadds Ford and in coastal Maine, where \n     he spent his summers and where he met Christina Olson, the \n     subject of his famed painting `Christina's World';\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth's paintings were immensely popular \n     among the public but sometimes disparaged by critics for \n     their lack of color and bleak landscapes portraying isolation \n     and alienation;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth's works could be controversial, as \n     they sparked dialogue and disagreement in the art world \n     concerning the natures of realism and modernism;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth was immensely patriotic and an \n     independent thinker who broke with many of his peers on the \n     issues of the day;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth was a beloved figure in Chadds Ford \n     and had his own seat at the corner table of the Chadds Ford \n     Inn, where reproductions of his art line the walls;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth received the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom in 1963 and the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in \n     1988;\n       Whereas Andrew Wyeth let it be known that he lived to paint \n     and never lost his simplicity and caring for people despite \n     his immense fame and successful career; and\n       Whereas the passing of Andrew Wyeth is a great loss to the \n     world of art, and his life should be honored with highest \n     praise and appreciation for his paintings which remain with \n     us although he is gone: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Andrew Wyeth as a treasure of the United \n     States and one of the most popular artists of the twentieth \n     century; and\n       (2) recognizes the outstanding contributions of Andrew \n     Wyeth to the art world and to the community of Chadds Ford, \n     Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/27/senate-section/article/S947-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
