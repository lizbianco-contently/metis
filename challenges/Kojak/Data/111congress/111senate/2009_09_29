Madam President, this afternoon we will begin work on the \nDefense appropriations bill, as I announced. The bill provides $636 \nbillion in new discretionary authority for the Department of Defense, \nincluding more than $128 billion in funding for overseas contingency \noperations.\n  This is a good bill. It provides funding to grow the Army by 22,000 \nsoldiers, provides $108 billion for procurement of new equipment that \nour men and women in the military badly need as a result of the \nequipment having been damaged, destroyed, and worn out in Iraq and \nother places. It also provides for a modification of tactical vehicles \nto better protect our forces in battle.\n  In Nevada, there are significant contributions being made, as we \nspeak, to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with more than 700 Nevada \nGuard men and women in combat today. Because the desert terrain in \nNevada is similar to that in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of our Nation's \nwarriors prepare for their deployment in Nevada. The Naval Air Station \nin Fallon, in northern Nevada, is the home to the Navy's preeminent \nstrike and air warfare center, which includes the Navy Fighter Weapons \nSchool, better known as Top Gun. Naval Air Station Fallon also houses \nthe Strike Warfare Center and the Carrier Airborne Early Warning \nWeapons School.\n  If you are a Navy fighter pilot, the only training that allows you to \nhave, in effect, a Ph.D. in flying the Navy's top fighter planes is \ngoing to Fallon. Hawthorne Ammunition Depot has been in existence since \nthe late 1920s as a result of a huge explosion of an ammunition \nfacility in New Jersey. Since the late 1920s, this base--in very arid, \ndry, north-central Nevada--serves as the staging area for conventional \nbombs, rockets, and ammunition, a role it has filled since World War \nII.\n  Creech Air Force Base, located about 35 miles north of Las Vegas, \nemploys the combat-ready Unmanned Aircraft System or what we call the \ndrones. It is known as the Joint Unmanned Aircraft System Center of \nExcellence. It is from that facility that the strikes take place in \nIraq and Afghanistan; that is where the people on the ground actually \ndo the work that allows these vehicles to do their damage, wherever \nthey are designated to go.\n  Finally, Nellis Air Force Base, outside Las Vegas, home of the first \ndedicated air warfare and later air-ground training facility, continues \nto provide advanced air combat training for U.S. and allied forces. \nThis is the home of the Thunderbirds.\n  The fiscal year ends tomorrow. We need to pass this Defense bill to \nensure\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nthese men and women in uniform--our soldiers, marines, sailors, air men \nand women--have every resource they need to successfully carry out \ntheir mission. Whether stationed in Nevada or on one of our many bases \naround the world, all America's troops are depending on us to do \nsomething and do it quickly.\n  The managers of this bill, Senators Inouye and Cochran, were here \nlast Thursday and Friday. They are back this afternoon, ready to \ncomplete action on this legislation. This is an extremely important \npiece of legislation. The Senate needs to act on it very quickly so we \ncan get to conference and minimize the time the Department of Defense \nhas to operate on a stop-gap continuing resolution.\n  I hope people who have amendments to offer will offer them. We have \nalready had 2 days to offer amendments. We have two of the most \nexperienced managers in the Senate with Senators Inouye and Cochran. I \nhope people would offer their amendments because we are not going to be \non this bill all week. We are going to get off this as soon as we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9896-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, this afternoon we resume \nconsideration of the Defense appropriations bill, and among our most \nimmediate concerns are the protection of our troops and allies in \nAfghanistan and the success of our mission there.\n  The President's pick to lead our efforts in Afghanistan, GEN Stanley \nMcChrystal, has made clear that more forces are necessary to accomplish \nthe mission. And while the administration has not yet reacted to \nGeneral McChrystal's report, in my view, the President must soon \nexplain to the American people his reasons either for accepting The \nMcChrystal Plan or for taking a different course.\n  Timing is important. A failure to act decisively in response to \nGeneral McChrystal's strategy, and his anticipated request for \nadditional forces, could serve to undermine some of the good decisions \nthe President has made on national security.\n  That said, no President decides to commit troops lightly; all such \ndecisions have far-reaching consequences. And that is why General \nMcChrystal and General Petraeus should also come to Washington to \nexplain to Congress and to the American people how their strategy will \nwork. A counterinsurgency strategy will require a significant \ninvestment in time, troops, and resources. We need an explanation from \nour generals why that investment is needed.\n  The recent disruption of an alleged al-Qaida plot against America was \na reminder to all of us of the seriousness and urgency of our efforts \nin Afghanistan. There should be no doubt that al-Qaida remains a \nserious threat. We cannot allow al-Qaida to establish a safe haven in \nthe very place where it plotted and planned the 9/11 attacks.\n  The Taliban is gaining ground in Afghanistan. And our commanders in \nthe field are in the best position to tell us what is required to \ncomplete their mission. General McChrystal says that without adequate \nresources, we will likely fail. In my view, we should listen to his \nadvice. And hopefully, we will be able to get that advice in person in \na timely manner.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to stand in unity with our \nfriends in the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, who are recovering from \na terrible natural disaster.\n  Tropical Storm Ketsana struck the Philippines Saturday near Manila, \ncausing massive flooding across the island nation. According to news \nreports, more than 80 percent of the capital city was submerged by the \nfloods. Footage shows people being swept away by raging torrents, \nstranded on rooftops without supplies, or wading through waist-high \nflood water. According to the Associated Press, at least 284 people in \nthe Philippines are confirmed dead, and nearly half a million people \nhave lost their homes. As I speak, rescuers are searching for any \nremaining survivors. Family members are mourning lost loved ones. \nMillions of Filipinos across the country are struggling to find clean \nwater, food, medicine, and shelter.\n  I commend the U.S. Embassy in Manila for pledging financial aid to \nhelp the Philippine government get life-saving necessities to people \nliving in emergency shelters.\n  I am proud and honored by the work of members of the United States \nArmed Services. based in the Philippines. Their important mission is to \nprovide counterterrorism training, but in the face of disaster, our \ntroops have heroically conducted a number of life-saving rescues. Now \nthey are helping to distribute supplies.\n  I also thank UNICEF for its large pledge of financial support.\n  In Hawaii, a number of organizations have stepped up to help. The \nFilipino Community Center, the United Filipino Council of Hawaii, and \nthe Philippine Consulate General of Honolulu are among the \norganizations raising funds. I am encouraged by all those offering \nassistance in Hawaii and across the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, Ketsana's path of destruction was not finished at the \nPhilippines. The storm picked up strength over the South China Sea, \nbrushed against the coast of China's Hainan Island, and at full typhoon \nstrength today slammed directly into Vietnam, where at least 23 people \nhave been confirmed dead.\n  Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand are now bracing for heavy rains as the \nstorm moves inland.\n  In the United States, we are no strangers to the horrors of tropical \ncyclones. We all remember the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. It hit the \ngulf coast more than 4 years ago, but many areas are still recovering. \nIn Hawaii, we will never forget Hurricane Iniki, which struck the \nisland of Kauai in 1992, killing six people, destroying homes, hotels, \nand businesses, and leaving residents in some areas without electricity \nfor months. It took parts of Kauai more than a decade to recover, and \nsome historic buildings have never been rebuilt.\n  The United States stands with our friends in the Philippines, China, \nand Vietnam as they work to help the survivors. I want to thank \neveryone who has pitched in to help our friends recover from this \nterrible disaster.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I take this time to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues legislation that has been introduced by \nSenator Lugar,\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\nthe Energy Security Through Transparency Act of 2009. I have joined \nSenator Lugar as a cosponsor, as have Senator Schumer, Senator Wicker, \nand Senator Feingold.\n  Let me first tell you the problem this legislation is attempting to \ndeal with; that is, there are these mineral-wealthy countries, \ncountries that have oil, countries that have gas, countries that have \nvaluable resources and minerals, and sometimes it is called a curse \nbecause in many of these countries there is horrible poverty, there are \nconflicts, open war, and very poor governance. The reason, in most \ncases, is corruption.\n  Quite frankly, there are individuals and groups and sometimes leaders \nwithin these poor nations that have wealthy resources who make their \nown individual deals with companies that extract these minerals and use \nthem for their own purpose rather than sharing it, as they should, or \nusing it, as they should, for the people of the nation in which these \nresources are located.\n  This is happening in so many countries in the world. It is in the \ninterest of the United States to change the way these nations deal with \ntheir resources, their wealth. It is in our interest for many reasons. \nThere are American businesses that would like to do business in these \ncountries. They would like to help the economy of America by having \nbusiness relationships with countries that have oil and gas and \ncountries that have other mineral wealth. The problem is, they cannot \ndo that because they cannot participate in corruption. It is against \nour laws for American companies to be coconspirators in corruption in \nanother country, as it should be against our laws. It is also not very \nstable for them to do business in a country that is corrupt, that does \nnot have the rule of law, that does not have the protections necessary \nto make sure their business relationships will be honored.\n  So for all those reasons, it is important for us to clean up the way \nthese nations deal with their mineral wealth. It is also in our \ninterests as far as energy security. I hope we will get into this \ndebate in this Congress on the floor of this body: how we can become \nenergy secure in America. But part of that is having a much more open \nrelationship with those countries that have mineral wealth so we know \nthe arrangements, so we know how the gas and oil and other minerals are \nentering into the international marketplace, so we can have an open \npolicy in America to deal with our energy. It is important for this \ncountry, as I pointed out, for our economics, it is important for our \nnational security to get this done. I might add, it is also going to be \nimportant for our environment, and we are going to have that debate, I \nhope, later this year in this body.\n  The international community has understood this. As a result of \nrecognizing this problem, the international community came together \nwith the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, known as EITI. \nI mention this because this international effort is to try to bring \ntransparency in what a company pays for mineral rights in a country. So \nif you are a company, and you are paying a royalty to a nation for \nextracting its minerals, you need to disclose that so the citizens of \nthat country have the basic critical information necessary to \neffectively monitor government stewardship of their natural resources.\n  That is basically what the EITI initiative is. It is all about \ntransparency so companies and governance can be held accountable. I \nwould think we all agree on that. I am proud of the role the United \nStates Helsinki Commission has played on this issue. I have had the \nhonor of chairing that Commission, and we have made the EITI initiative \na major priority of our Commission's work because we know if we can get \nthe mineral wealth to the people of that nation, so many of the issues \nwe are charged to deal with on human rights, on the environment, on the \neconomy, and on security can be dealt with, if we could just get that \nmineral wealth to the people of that nation. That is the reason why the \nCommission has had a very high priority in getting more participation \nby countries around the world in the Extractive Industries Transparency \nInitiative.\n  That brings me to the Energy Security Through Transparency Act of \n2009 that Senator Lugar has introduced and on which I have joined him \nas a cosponsor. It would suggest that the United States should be an \nimplementing country of the EITI, that we should subject ourselves to \nthose provisions, that we should lead by example by showing the United \nStates of America believes there should be transparency in all the \ncontracts we enter into resulting in extraction of mineral wealth from \nAmerica. That would require the proper disclosure of payments from \ncompanies that use public lands for mineral extractions. That is the \nright thing to do. We should have been doing this all along. The public \nshould know what is being paid by companies to take their wealth. This \nis Americans' wealth. It does not belong to any one of us. There should \nbe transparency in it. It is the right thing to do.\n  Another part of this legislation would require companies that are \nlisted on the U.S. Stock Exchange that are regulated by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to disclose their payments to other countries \nfor extraction of mineral wealth. In other words, we use the leverage \nof participating in the U.S. Stock Exchange--to be a listed security \nthat Americans invest in--they have the right to know what that company \nis paying to other countries to extract mineral wealth. That at least \ngives us part of the disclosure necessary to find out what a country, \nwhich is so poor in the way it treats its people, is doing with the \nmoneys that are being paid for the extraction of their national wealth. \nThat would go a long way to helping us get transparency.\n  This legislation would urge the President to work with our partners \nin the G8 and G20 to promote similar efforts by the industrial nations \nof the world so we can get more credibility on the EITI, where passage \nof the EITI, joining the EITI becomes a matter of respectability for a \nnation internationally to make sure the contracts that are entered into \nwith that government are shown to the people of that nation.\n  The bottom line is, the Energy Security Through Transparency Act of \n2009 is asking the United States to take a leadership position in \nfighting corruption. Unfortunately, in too many of the developing \ncountries of the world there is corruption. You have to deal with that \ncorruption if you are going to be able to develop the type of \nrelationships where that nation can deal with the poverty of its own \npeople and work with us on our international priorities.\n  It helps developing countries. We give significant resources to date \nfor humanitarian efforts in these nations. These nations should use \ntheir own wealth. This is a humanitarian issue. This is a human rights \nissue. It also provides economic opportunities for the people of that \nnation as well as the international community so they can participate \nin an open way to help that nation solve its economic problems.\n  It helps us with energy security globally. We cannot afford to waste \nthe world's resources, as we look internationally at problems of energy \nsecurity and global climate change. And it certainly helps in removing \nconflicts in many parts of the world. It is in our national security \ninterests to make the world safer because it is usually the United \nStates that is called upon first to deal with these conflicts.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to take a look at the \nEnergy Security Through Transparency Act of 2009, and to join us in \nmoving this legislation forward because I believe it does present great \nhope for America to lead the world in helping these nations take \nadvantage of their wealth in furthering U.S. international goals.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, today a news story had the title \n``Leading Dem Plans to Blow Up Deal with Big PhRMA'':\n\n       A Senate Democratic leader is hoping to blow up the deal \n     reached between the White House, drug makers and Senate \n     Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus by introducing an \n     amendment on the floor to allow prescription drugs to be \n     imported from Canada . . . et cetera.\n\n  There is a picture of me. I woke up this morning not thinking I was \ngoing to try to blow up anything. So I want to respond to this.\n  The question is, are those of us in this Chamber--a bipartisan group \nof 30 ranging from myself and Senator Snowe as the lead sponsor, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator McCain, and so many others who want to deal \nwith this issue of fair pricing of prescription drugs--are we trying to \nblow something up? The answer is no. We have been trying for a long \ntime in this Chamber to say we ought to have fair prescription drug \npricing for the American people, and presently it is not fair.\n  This is a pill bottle that would contain Lipitor made by Pfizer. It \nis made in Ireland and then sent around the world. These two bottles \nare identical. One is red, one is blue, but had the same pill made by \nthe same company put in the same bottle, this one shipped to Canada, \nthis one shipped to the United States. This was $1.83 per tablet. That \nis what the Canadian consumers paid. Our consumers got to pay $4.48 per \ntablet. The same pill, same company, same bottle, different price--\nAmerican consumers get to pay the higher price: $4.48 per pill compared \nto $1.83. It is not just Lipitor. That is the most popular cholesterol-\nlowering drug, widely taken. It is not just consumers of Lipitor, it is \nconsumers--this happens to be Canada, but in here I could put France, \nGermany, Spain, Italy, and so on--it is that we are charged the highest \nprices in the world for brand-name drugs. Plavix is 73 percent higher \nthan Canada. Boniva is 90 percent higher than Canada. Zocor is 103 \npercent higher than Canada. The list goes on--157 percent higher than \nthey pay in Canada; 194 percent. It is just not fair.\n  One day, I sat on a hay bale at a little farm reception with a guy in \nhis eighties. We sat there just talking. He said: My wife has been \nfighting breast cancer for 3 years. He said: For 3 years, we have \ndriven to Canada to buy Tamoxifen, where she could buy it for 80 \npercent less than it cost her in North Dakota. That is the only way we \ncould afford to pay for her drug to fight her breast cancer.\n  I am just saying that is not fair. So a group of us have been trying \nfor a long time to pass legislation that allows the consumer freedom, \nthe freedom to say: If this identical drug is being sold in Winnipeg, \nCanada, at a fraction of the price why can't our consumers in this \ncountry access that drug? Why don't they have the freedom to access \nthat drug?\n  We have put out a piece of legislation that establishes much greater \nsecurity for the safety of our drug supply with batch lots and \npedigrees and everything that attaches to the security side, and then \nwe say the American people can access the FDA-approved drugs in the \ncountries that have the same chain of custody we have and that have the \nsame kind of safety we have. Give the American people freedom. When \nthey have that freedom to access those identical drugs at a lower \nprice, sold at a fraction of the price in other parts of the world, \nthen the pharmaceutical industry will be required to reprice those \ndrugs in this country and give the American people fair pricing. That \nis just a fact.\n  I understand the White House negotiated with the pharmaceutical \nindustry and came up with a plan by which the pharmaceutical industry \nover 10 years would fill part of what is called the doughnut hole. It \nis complicated to explain--the doughnut hole is a portion of the drug \nbenefit in which the seniors have to pay their own drug costs. So I \nunderstand there was an agreement between the White House and the \npharmaceutical industry to provide a discount to seniors in the donut \nhole, but nobody here was a part of that agreement.\n  The 30 or so of us who have been very strongly working to address \nthis issue feel that when the health reform bill comes to the floor of \nthe Senate, we intend to offer this amendment. If you don't deal with \nthe increasing cost of prescription drugs when you try to put downward \npressure on the cost of health care, in my judgment, you have failed. \nOne of the fastest areas of cost increases has been prescription drugs. \nYou are just going to leave that aside and say: Don't pay any attention \nto that; it doesn't matter. You can't do that. So we are trying to find \na way to put some downward pressure on health care prices, and that \nmust include putting some downward pressure on prescription drugs.\n  Let me be quick to point out that the pharmaceutical industry does \nimportant things. I don't wish them ill at all. I have done things that \nsupport them, including research and development tax credits and so on. \nBut I am not interested in just waiting to allow them to continue to \nprice their brand-name pharmaceutical drugs much higher to our \nconsumers than they do to virtually every other consumer in the world. \nIt is not fair.\n  When the health care reform bill comes to the floor of the Senate, I \nand my colleagues--Senator Stabenow, Senator McCain, many others; a \nbipartisan group--intend to offer this bill as an amendment. It is not \nintended to blow up anything. We weren't a part of constructing \nanything; we are not going to blow up something. All we are going to do \nis demand that some common sense and basic fairness be established in \nthe pricing of prescription drugs in this country. The way to do that \nis to give the American people the freedom to access this identical \nprescription drug in other areas where it is sold at a fraction of the \nprice.\n  So, again, I wanted to disabuse anybody of the notion that we are \ngoing to blow up something. It is not true. I understand the \npharmaceutical industry does not like what we are trying to do. They \nwould like to have absolute pricing capability to price our drugs, in \nthe case of Lipitor, at $4.50 a tablet when they sell it to others for \nless than half of that. I understand they would like that opportunity. \nOn behalf of the American citizen, I say it is not fair. It is wrong, \nand it ought to change. If we pass the legislation we have introduced--\na broad bipartisan group here in the Senate--it will give the American \npeople freedom and force, in my judgment, a repricing toward fair \nprices for prescription drugs in our country.\n  Again, I wanted to make the point that we are not trying to blow up \nanything; we are trying to fix something that is wrong, and we are \ngoing to try to do that when the health care reform bill comes to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  We have been guaranteed an opportunity. Senator McCain and Senator \nSnowe and I intended to offer this earlier in the year, and as a result \nof that, the majority leader said: Don't offer it here, but I will make \ncertain you have the opportunity on the floor of the Senate. That is \nwhy we will be in line right toward the front end of the health care \nreform bill to offer the amendment and have a debate.\n\n\n                       Financial Industry Reform\n\n  If I might, for a couple of minutes on another subject, say that I \nhave spoken often about an issue on the floor of the Senate that goes \nback some decade or so on the matter of financial reform. I am not \ngoing to revisit all of that, which happened 10 years ago, but I do \nwant to say this: I happen to think one of the first items of business \nthis year should have been financial reform. I know others disagreed. I \nknow the President wanted to do health care and some other items first. \nBut I know the President and his team are working very hard now on \nfinancial reform. It is very important to get this right.\n  I wish to make a point. I have been reading recently about what is \nhappening, and I would like to demonstrate what is happening.\n  Last fall, a whole series of things steered this economy into the \nditch, the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n  So now, September 12, 2009, The New York Times, ``A Year Later, \nLittle Change on Wall Street'':\n\n       One year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the \n     surprise is not how much has changed in the financial \n     industry, but how little. Not much change on Wall Street.\n\n  September 15, the Washington Post, ``The Wall Street Casino, Back in \nBusiness.'' Think of that. A year after the\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\nalmost unbelievable, deepest recession since the Great Depression, 1 \nyear later, ``The Wall Street Casino, Back in Business.''\n  What are they talking about? Credit default swaps, derivatives, \nsynthetic derivatives, you name it, all kinds of exotic products where \nthey securitized everything. Everybody made a bunch of money, and on \nthe way back from depositing money in their bank accounts one day, they \ndiscovered the economy collapsed because a lot of bad decisions had \nbeen made by people who were gambling.\n\n  September 8, the Washington Post, ``A Year After Lehman, Wall \nStreet's Acting Like Wall Street Again.'' Not much change.\n  Wall Street Journal, August, last month, ``Bankers Play Dress Up With \nOld Deals'':\n\n       Irresponsible securitization helped bring the financial \n     system to its knees. Yet, as banks start to heal, little \n     seems to have changed. Wall Street has quickly fallen back on \n     old habits.\n\n  By the way, some of these FDIC-insured banks are still trading in \nderivatives out of their own proprietary account. They may just as well \nput a casino in their lobby or be playing Keno in their boardroom.\n  This is Steve Pearlstein, September 11: ``Wall Street's Mania for \nShort-Term Results Hurts Economy.''\n  Look, the reason I wanted to go through this is I agree not much has \nchanged, and certainly not enough has changed. The question, it seems \nto me, as we deal with this issue of financial reform is, Will we \naddress a central issue for me, and that is the too-big-to-fail issue? \nWhen we have decided as a matter of economic doctrine in this country \nthat there are big companies that are too big to fail--too big to \nfail--to me, that is no-fault capitalism. We saw that last fall.\n  We had the Treasury Secretary come to the Congress, and he said, on a \nFriday: If you don't pass a three-page bill giving me $700 billion and \ndo it in 3 days, there is eminent collapse of the American economy. The \nfact is, I didn't vote for the $700 billion because I didn't think he \nhad the foggiest idea what he was going to do with that money.\n  The plain fact is as well that the very firms that did the kind of \ndamage that steered this economy into the ditch--by the way, one of \nwhich the then-Treasury Secretary had previously worked for--\ndramatically expanding leverage; engaging in unbelievable, \nsophisticated exotic products they couldn't even understand. But you \ndidn't have to understand them as long as you were making a lot of \nmoney on them; securitizing almost everything; the scandal in subprime \nloans; paying massive bonuses to brokers who put mortgages out there \ncalled liar's loans, meaning people didn't have to describe their \nincome in order to get a mortgage; and then securitizing the good with \nthe bad and slicing and dicing as if you were cutting sausage and \nselling it to investment funds. So everybody was fat and happy, making \nall this money despite the fact they were creating this house of cards. \nAnd then the house of cards collapsed, and we had all of these firms \nwith dramatic leverage and exposure. Then we were told: You know what, \nyou have to bail them out. They are too big to fail. The American \ntaxpayer has to come out and open their pocketbook and provide the \nfunds because these companies are too big to fail.\n  The fact is, when we discuss financial reform, there is too little \ndiscussion about this right now. All the discussion we see are these \nstories: ``Wall Street is Back in Business Again''; ``Banks Still \nTrading in Derivatives on Proprietary Accounts.'' They might as well \njust put up a blackjack table in their lobby. Nothing is changing.\n  So the question is, when we get to this point--and it is very soon, I \nhope--will we seriously address the doctrine of too big to fail. If we \ndon't, we will go down exactly the same road and, mark my words, we \nwill find the same ditch once again for this economy. We must address \nthis issue of too big to fail. Some of the too-big-to-fail institutions \ngot a lot of TARP funds from the American taxpayer. And by the way, \nthey have gotten bigger now--too big to fail, and now they are too \nbigger to fail, I guess. It doesn't sound like good English to me. But \ntoo big to fail is a problem, so you make them bigger. It makes no \nsense.\n  This has to be a centerpiece in our discussion going forward. Are we \ngoing to continue to have no-fault capitalism where some of the biggest \nfinancial institutions in this country are engaged in gambling, trading \nin derivatives on their own financial accounts in a bank, while the \nbank is FDIC insured? Are we going to continue to allow that, or are we \nfinally going to decide that this doctrine of too big to fail has to be \naddressed along with the other issues? Are we going to securitize \neverything? Are we going to continue to allow this unbelievable \nexpansion of leverage? All of these are important questions.\n  At the end of the day, to me, the question of the doctrine of too big \nto fail is overriding. We must end that proposition. It is not just me, \nthere are a lot of good economists who believe this must be a part of \nour financial reform.\n  My hope is that in the coming month or so following the discussion on \nhealth care reform, we turn to financial reform. I am going to be on \nthe floor talking again about the doctrine of too big to fail and about \nthe Federal Reserve Board's notion of what that doctrine means and what \ntheir responsibilities are.\n  I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is not divided.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \npermitted to engage in a colloquy for up to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9899-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9899-S9902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, all of us were home in August. It was \na pretty good thing we were, because the people of the United States \nhad a lot to say to us about the health care bill. I think President \nObama was very correct when he said the health care reform bill is a \nproxy for the role of Federal Government in our everyday lives.\n  I think that is what we are debating here. On the one side, we have \nan effort by the majority and the President to do this massive, \ncomprehensive health care reform with thousand-page bills and White \nHouse czars and trillions in spending and debt. That is on the one \nside. On the other side we have Republicans saying we want health care \nreform, but let's focus on reducing costs to each American who has a \nhealth care policy--that is 250 million of us--that is why people are \nshowing up at town meetings; it is not some abstract thing--and \nreducing costs to our government, because we know that $9 trillion more \nin debt is coming.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, concerning the costs, how do we know what the cost \nis if we don't have legislative text? I think all of us have been \naround here long enough--we have talked a lot about the 72 hours that I \nabsolutely think we need. The text should be online so that every \nAmerican--not just the 100 of us who are fortunate enough to be here--\ncan read it. Everybody should have the right to know what a fundamental \nreform of health care in America is all about, and they should be able \nto read the legislation if they want to.\n  Just as importantly, I ask my friend, has he seen any legislative \ntext anywhere? Is it true that the Finance Committee is moving forward \nwith legislation regarding which there is no legislative text? And by \nthe way, we find out now, according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. \nBarthold noted in a followup letter that the willful failure to file; \nthat is, to take the government option, would be punishable by a \n$25,000 fine or jail time under a section of the bill.\n  I wonder how many Americans are aware of that. In fact, I have to \ntell my\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\nfriend from Tennessee, I was unaware of it. So if we are unaware of it, \nshould we not have legislative text so that Americans know what is \nbeing legislated in the Senate Finance Committee; and second, shouldn't \nit be on line at least 72 years so everybody would know about it?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator is right. He and I and the Senator from \nGeorgia are on the HELP Committee. We worked and we spent many hours in \nJune and July marking up that version of the health care bill. We \nfinished our work about July 15. That bill was 839 pages. It wasn't \neven presented to us until early in September, and we still don't know \nwhat it costs. I wonder if the Senator from Georgia heard much about \nreading the bill and how much it costs.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Georgia \nand I all sat through 67\\1/2\\ hours of markup in the HELP Committee on \nan 839-page bill, which was not scored and had 3 titles blank and they \nare still blank. We didn't have text during that debate on three titles \nwithin that bill, and what they are developing in the Finance Committee \ntoday, as I understand it, is concepts. The language is somewhere that \nwe have not yet seen. This is too important for us to guess on and to \ntake a chance on. It is most important that Congress know precisely \nwhat it is doing.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Maybe the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from \nArizona know more about this than I do, and they are debating concepts \nbut they are getting down to specifics. I saw in a morning newspaper \nthat Nevada was somehow miraculously taken care of in the provisions \nfor Medicaid expenses. We have had Governors, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, here saying if you are going to expand on Medicaid in our \nState, pay for it. What happened in Nevada?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Tennessee, first, it is clear \nthat the Medicaid cost increases to the States will be incredibly \nlarge. In the original version of the bill, according to media reports, \nthe State of Nevada would have, along with every other State, a \nsignificant Medicaid expense. So somehow now the legislation has been \nchanged, again, according to media because--excuse me, the concept has \nbeen changed because we don't have legislative language--that 4 States \nwould then have 100 percent of their Medicaid costs assumed by the \nFederal Government for as long as 4 or 5 years. That is what goes on \nwith the laws and sausages business here. I ask the Senator again, do \nyou--first, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial entitled \n``Rhetorical Tax Evasion'' in the Wall Street Journal this morning be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 29, 2009]\n\n                         Rhetorical Tax Evasion\n\n       President Obama's effort to deny that his mandate to buy \n     insurance is a tax has taken another thumping, this time from \n     fellow Democrats in the Senate Finance Committee.\n       Chairman Max Baucus's bill includes the so-called \n     individual mandate, along with what he calls a $1,900 \n     ``excise tax'' if you don't buy health insurance. (It had \n     been as much as $3,800 but Democrats reduced the amount last \n     week to minimize the political sticker shock.) And, lo, it \n     turns out that if you don't pay that tax, the IRS could \n     punish you with a $25,000 fine or up to a year in jail, or \n     both.\n       Under questioning last week, Tom Barthold, the chief of \n     staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, admitted that the \n     individual mandate would become a part of the Internal \n     Revenue Code and that failing to comply ``could be criminal, \n     yes, if it were considered an attempt to defraud.'' Mr. \n     Barthold noted in a follow-up letter that the willful failure \n     to file would be a simple misdemeanor, punishable by the \n     $25,000 fine or jail time under Section 7203.\n       So failure to pay the mandate would be enforced like tax \n     evasion, but Mr. Obama still claims it isn't a tax. ``You \n     can't just make up that language and decide that that's \n     called a tax increase,'' Mr. Obama insisted last week to ABC \n     interviewer George Stephanopoulos. Accusing critics of \n     dishonesty is becoming this President's default argument, but \n     is Mr. Barthold also part of the plot?\n       In the 1994 health-care debate, the Congressional Budget \n     Office called the individual mandate ``an unprecedented form \n     of federal action.'' This is because ``The government has \n     never required people to buy any good or service as a \n     condition of lawful residence in the United States.''\n       This coercion will be even more onerous today because \n     everyone will be forced to buy insurance that the new taxes \n     and regulations of ObamaCare will make far more expensive. \n     Too bad Mr. Obama's rhetorical tax evasion can't be punished \n     by the IRS.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This says:\n\n       Chairman Max Baucus's bill includes the so-called \n     individual mandate, along with what he calls a $1,900 \n     ``excise tax'' if you don't buy health insurance. (It had \n     been as much as $3,800. . . .)\n\n  So American small businesses, which are hurting more than any other \ngroup of Americans today, the creators of jobs--are now facing a $1,900 \nexcise tax. By the way, the President, in response to George \nStephanopolos, said there was no tax engaged here. I wonder how many \nAmericans are aware of that and how many Americans have had the \nopportunity to know exactly not only what the costs to the Federal \nGovernment and the respective States are, but the costs to the \nindividuals who are struggling to make it in America at a time of \nalmost unprecedented unemployment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is a very good point. The Senator from Georgia \nwas in small business for many years before he came to the senate.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes, I ran a small real estate company for 22 years. We \ntried--myself and other distinguished Senators--on the floor to pass \nsmall business health reform 3 years ago which would have made more \naffordable and accessible health care to those independent contractors, \nthe small business people. It was rejected and we could not get a \ncloture vote.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. May I interrupt for a moment? I often hear it said \nthat you Republicans are not for health care too much. The difference \nis we have a little more humility than to try to take on the whole \nhealth care system at once and fix the whole world. We are ready to go \nstep by step, and that is one of the most important steps--to allow \nsmall businesses to pool their resources and offer health care to their \nemployees. I think the estimate is it would add maybe a million new \npeople who could be insured that way.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Under outside estimates--not mine--of the 47 million \nalleged uninsured, up to 16 million would have access to insurance \nbecause of associated health plans and small business reform. That is a \nthird of the uninsured.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My friend from Tennessee brings up a good and an \nimportant point about some saying that Republicans have no plan. The \nfact is that the Republicans have no plan for the government to take \nover the health care system in America. That is what it is. What are we \nfor? We are for going across State lines so that these small businesses \nand individuals--and the Senator from Georgia used to be one of them--\ncan get the health insurance policy of their choice. Why should they be \nrestricted to the State they are in when perhaps there are minimum \nrequirements for those health insurers residing in that State for \ncoverage, which they neither want or need, and it may be in another \nState. Why don't we allow small business people to pool their assets \ntogether and negotiate with health insurers across America for the best \npolicy they can get? And we are for medical malpractice reform and \nmedical liability reform. We know doctors prescribe time after time, to \nprotect themselves, unneeded and unnecessary procedures and tests. We \nall know that. That is in tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. \nWe are for medical malpractice reform. Where is it in any bill that has \nbeen proposed by the other side?\n  We want outcome-based treatment. We want an individual who has a \ncertain chronic disease to be treated on the basis of long term. We \nwant Americans who have preexisting conditions to have a risk pool they \ncan go to or where risk pools would be established so they can get \nhealth insurance, and insurers will bid on those people with so-called \npreexisting conditions, so that every American can have affordable and \navailable health insurance. We are for that. We are for medical \nmalpractice reform. We are for going across State lines to get a policy \nof your choice. We are for outcome-based care. We are for taking on the \ndrug companies that have cut an unholy deal with the administration, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\nwill give them the obscene profits, and the lobbyists, who make over a \nmillion dollars. We want to be able to import drugs from Canada that \nare cheaper for the American people. We want competition, as there is \nin Medicare Part D, for these patients who need it, who don't have \nhealth insurance.\n  So we are for a number of things, but we are not for a government \ntakeover of the health care system. So the next time we read that the \nRepublican party does not have anything they are for, then they are not \npaying attention. There is more that we are for, but it has to do with \ncompetition and with availability and with affordability of health care \nin America, not a government takeover. We have seen that movie before \nin other countries.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As I listen to the Senator, I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Georgia is having the same impact. Every single step he said \nRepublicans are for, whether it is getting rid of runaway junk \nlawsuits, going across State lines to buy insurance, whether it is \nallowing small businesses to pool resources, or incentivizing \nprevention and wellness, they are all focused on reducing costs.\n  I ask the Senator from Georgia, I thought this was supposed to be \nabout reducing costs for health care premiums and costs to our \ngovernment; but it seems to me we are talking about more billions and \nmore debt and more spending and taxes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Those are the two things Republicans don't want, which \nis more debt to bankrupt our children and grandchildren and more taxes. \nRobert from Loganville was on my teletown hall meeting a week ago in \nGeorgia. We were talking about the pay-fors. He said, ``Senator, I want \nto ask you a question. The administration keeps talking about there \nbeing a half billion dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse in Medicare. If \nthat's true, why haven't you saved it instead of using it to save \nagainst a national health care?''\n  That is precisely right. The pay-fors they are talking about to keep \nus from going into debt are moneys that may or may not be there. They \ninvolve taxation and raising taxes on small businesses. Those are the \nthings we don't want to do as Republicans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Georgia, do you believe, one, that \nsmall business people in America today are ready for an additional cost \nlaid on them to provide health insurance for themselves and their \nemployees? Should we not make it easier and less costly, rather than \nimposing a government mandate, which may have types of health care that \nthey neither want nor need, or paying an ``excise tax,'' as is in \nChairman Baucus's bill?\n  The second point I want to ask the Senator about, of course, is this \nwhole issue of what should be the government's role in health care in \nAmerica today. We freely admit--not only admit but appreciate the fact \nthat Medicare is a government program. But we also appreciate that the \ncosts of Medicare have skyrocketed to the point where we now have, by \nestimates, a $31 trillion unfunded liability. In other words, our kids \nand grandkids will not have Medicare 7 or 8 years from now unless we \nfix the issue of costs.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator is precisely right, because as of right now, \nMedicare goes broke in 2017. That is only 8 years from now. In this \nbill, part of the pay-fors is to raise the cost of Medicaid on the \nStates to a level that would take Georgia's Medicaid payments in 2014 \nby State tax dollars to be from 12 percent to 20 percent of our State \nbudget. That is not the way to run a railroad.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Going back to the point of the Senator from Arizona, I \nhear our friends on the other side say you have used scare tactics, \nsaying there will be Medicare cuts. I ask the Senator, did I not hear \nthe President say he was going to take a half trillion dollars out of \nMedicare for seniors? There are about 45 million seniors on Medicare \nand who depend on Medicare, and they will spend it on new programs. Is \nthat not what I heard him say?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is why there is a rising sentiment, particularly \namong seniors, against this plan, the one passed through the House and \npassed through our HELP Committee and is now being formulated. Our \nseniors and our citizens are a lot smarter than many times we give them \ncredit for. They know you are not going to get $\\1/2\\ trillion in \n``savings'' from Medicare without there being reductions in Medicare.\n  There are hundreds of billions of dollars of savings that can be \nenacted in Medicare, but why don't we start tomorrow or why didn't we \nstart yesterday or why didn't we start at least at the beginning of \nthis debate imposing those savings so we could have a delay in the year \nwhen Medicare goes broke?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. May I ask the Senator, if there are savings in \nMedicare, shouldn't it be spent on Medicare?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Absolutely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is an excellent point. But also the fact is to root \nout this waste, fraud, and abuse is going to take time and effort and \nit is going to require some pretty hard work on our part. But we need \nto change some of the fundamentals of the Medicare system in providing \nmore competition in the form of prescription drugs, in the form of \nmedical malpractice liability reform, in the form of more competition \nbetween drug companies for Medicare and Medicaid patients. These \nreforms we are advocating have to be enacted in order to bring down the \ncosts of Medicare, Medicaid, and overall health care costs in America.\n  Look, it is obvious. The cost escalations that are bringing Medicare \nto a crisis are the same cost escalations everybody else in America is \nexperiencing.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. A lot of them are based in defensive medicine, which is \npracticed because of runaway lawsuits and verdicts. The \nadministration's most recent comment about tort reform, to which the \nSenator from Arizona referred, was they want to do a study. A study is \nnot what we need. What we need is action. That is one of the biggest \ncontributors to the rising cost of health care we have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Or a demonstration project conducted by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services who knows a lot about this, I admit, because \nI understand she was head of the Trial Lawyers Association for a number \nof years. I am sure that gives significant qualifications to the person \nwho is tasked with this project.\n  Life is full of anecdotes and experiences we have. I was down in \nMiami at the Palmetto Hospital. I spoke to a surgeon there. By the way, \nthey treat a very large number of people who have come to this country \nillegally. I asked the surgeon: How are you doing on making your \ninsurance payments, your malpractice or medical liability insurance \npayments?\n  He said: I don't have a problem. I don't have it. I don't have it \nbecause I couldn't afford it and probably I am not going to get sued \nbecause if they sue me, they are only going to get everything I have, \nnot what the insurance company has.\n  We are giving physicians and caregivers the untenable option of \neither paying skyrocketing malpractice insurance premiums--in some \ncases $200,000 a year for a neurosurgeon--or as this surgeon did and \nothers have done: I am not going to have insurance. That is not an \nacceptable thing to do to physicians in America or anybody in America.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The other consequence of that is the threat of it, and \nthe cost of becoming a physician is driving young people to go into \nother professions. We are going to have a shortage of providers, not \njust in physicians but nurses and caregivers, if we have an overly \nregulatory system and an indefensible tort system.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senators from Arizona and Georgia have raised a \nnumber of questions that need to be answered. How much is the expansion \nof Medicaid going to cost States in State taxes? How much of the \nMedicare costs are going to cost people on Medicare? Are individual \npremiums actually going up instead of down, which is what the \nCongressional Budget Office said. Why is there not something for \ngetting rid of junk lawsuits in the bill? Why don't we have a small \nbusiness health insurance pool?\n  The point we made when we first started is if we are taking on 17 or \n18 percent of the whole economy in another one of these 1,000-page-plus \nbills, why then do the Democratic Senators vote down the amendment to \nsay that\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\nthe bill needs to be online for 72 hours so we and the American people \ncan read it? Shouldn't we read the bill we are voting on, and shouldn't \nwe know how much it costs before we start voting on it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator is exactly right. Again, wouldn't it be nice \nfor our constituents--by the way, many of them come to the townhall \nmeetings with a sign that says ``Have you read the bill?''--to let them \nread the bill too. Wouldn't it be nice if every American citizen who \nwanted to could go online and read the legislation and give us their \nideas and thoughts as to how we could make it better?\n  May I mention--I hate to keep coming back to this issue of medical \nliability--a PricewaterhouseCoopers study says defensive medicine could \ncost us as much as $200 billion annually. If we are interested in \nsavings, why don't we go right at that? Do we need a demonstration \nproject someplace around America? I don't.\n  May I mention one other point, and I would be interested in my \ncolleagues' views on it. This proposal also levies new taxes on medical \ndevices. Why in the world would we want to do that? Medical devices and \nthe best technology in the world are developed in America, but they are \nvery expensive as they are. Why would we want to levy new taxes on \nmedical devices when we know very well that if the insurance company is \npaying for them, the insurance company passes on those increased costs \nto the insured, thereby increasing the cost of health insurance in \nAmerica. Why would we want to do that?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. It is raising the cost to the consumer because a lot of \nthose types of things that are being taxed are purchased \ndiscretionarily and are not covered. They are paid for out of the \npocket of the consumer. When you tax the medical device, you are just \nraising the cost of the medical device to the consumer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What the other side is trying to do is expand government, \nexpand coverage, and yet, at the same time, reduce costs. You cannot \nsquare the circle. That is why they keep bumping into--every time there \nis a new proposal and to make things more expansive and more available, \nthey run into escalations in costs and how we are going to pay for it.\n  I believe our constituents, again, have figured it out--a reestimate \nof a $7 trillion to $9 trillion deficit over 10 years, a some $700 \nbillion stimulus package that may have stimulated Wall Street but, \nfrankly, in my view from being home a lot, has not stimulated Main \nStreet and is not having an effect on unemployment in America, to say \nthe least. The neighboring State of California now has 12.2 percent \nunemployment. They cannot get to where they want to go without \nincreasing that deficit and debt burden that we are laying on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I wish they would sit down with us. I wish we could sit down \ntogether, start from the beginning, knowing what we know--we have all \nbeen well educated by this process--knowing what we know now, knowing \nwhat we can do to reduce health care costs in America and make it \naffordable and available. Unfortunately, as we watch the machinations \ngoing on in the Finance Committee, that has not happened yet.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I completely concur with the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Tennessee. There is common ground, but you have to be \nwilling to find it. So far that has not been the case. When we get to \nthat point, we can solve a lot of the American peoples' problems. Just \nramming through something we cannot read, we cannot quantify, we cannot \nscore is not the way to go about it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If there is one point we would want to make, it is \nthis. It is such an ambitious program. The stakes are so high. This is \nno abstract debate. The reason people are turning up at town meetings \nis because this is about their health care insurance and also whether \nyour government is going to go broke in the next few years, dumping a \nlot of burdens on our children and grandchildren.\n  What we are saying is we need to read the bill and know how much it \ncosts before we start voting on it. We need to read the bill. It needs \nto be online 72 hours. That is a modest request, it seems to me. That \nis a short period of time. Then we need to know how much it costs. Does \nit raise our premiums or lower them? Does it cut your Medicare, or does \nit not cut your Medicare? Does it increase the national debt, or does \nit not increase the national debt? We need to know the answers to those \nquestions. It would be the height of irresponsibility for us to begin \ndebating a bill that affects 17 percent of the economy at a time when \nour debt is going up so rapidly without having, one, read the bill and, \ntwo, knowing exactly what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \ntells us every provision costs.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I tell my friend, if the American people are able to \nknow the details of this legislation, I think they would be surprised \nto know that the new taxes--the medical devices, the prescription drugs \nand other tax increases--they begin in the year 2010, 3 years before \nthe provisions in the bill for ``reform'' are implemented. So for the \nnext 3 years, the cost of health care and health insurance goes up due \nto the new taxes and fees, but the so-called reforms are not \nimplemented--why did they do that?--so that the actual costs, as we \ncost it out over a 10-year period, are disguised by beginning the taxes \nand not implementing the reforms, which then the Congressional Budget \nOffice can give a cost estimate which is less than, frankly, what it \nactually is if you put the reforms in at the same time as the tax \nincreases.\n  That is a little complicated, but I think Americans need to know \nthat.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. My only comment in closing is simply this: The Senator \nis exactly right. Once this horse is out of the barn, you can never put \nhim back in. We have to get it right to begin with. We need to go back \nto the drawing board, have a bill we can read, and a bill we can \nafford.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nGeorgia. They said what we believe. We need to stop, start over, and \nget it right. Above all, we--it seems such a basic thing to say it is \nalmost embarrassing to say it on the Senate floor--we need to make sure \nwe read the bill before we vote on it, and we need to make sure we know \nwhat it costs before we vote on it. Those two things are minimum \nrequirements.\n  From the Republican side, we want to reduce health care costs, and \nrather than try a comprehensive health care reform of the whole system, \nwe would like to work step by step in the direction of reducing costs \nin order to re-earn the trust of the American people. Senator McCain \nand Senator Isakson have outlined a series of steps ranging from \neliminating junk lawsuits against doctors to allowing small businesses \nto pool their resources, all of which would help reduce costs. I thank \nthe Senators.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9902-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9902-S9906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I rise to address the issue of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010, which is the pending business \nbefore the Senate.\n  The funding provided in this legislation is very crucial. We need to \nsupport our commanders as they lead operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand elsewhere, and care for the men and women who are in the military, \nincluding making sure they are provided for, as well as our wounded \nwarriors. But I also note with great concern and alarm, dismay, and \neven disgust that billions of dollars in wasteful earmarks, \nunrequested, unauthorized, have again found their way into this \nlegislation. As I have said before, these are serious times, and we as \na Congress are required to make serious decisions, tough decisions, \nthat may go against the special interests.\n  I need not remind my colleagues that we are at war or that the \nnational debt is growing ever larger. Recently, there was a reestimate \nof the deficit for the next 10 years from $7 trillion to $9 trillion. \nWe are facing deficits of unprecedented proportions. Yet the spending\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\ngoes on here like, as some people have said, a drunken sailor. I do not \nuse that phrase anymore because I never knew a sailor, either drunk or \nsober, with the imagination Members of Congress have, which is best \nepitomized in this bill, as I will point out in several provisions. We \ncannot afford the waste. We cannot afford it. It is our duty to fully \nsupport the funding for our national defense and ensure that each \ndollar we spend is spent wisely in delivery of the stated need and not \non special interests.\n  The Appropriations Committee has provided $626 billion in total \nfunding for the Department of Defense--$498 billion for the base budget \nand $128 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Interestingly, it is $3.9 billion less than the \nPresident's budget request, and the bill further reduces the Defense \nprograms requested by the Pentagon to make room for $2.5 billion in C-\n17 cargo aircraft slated for termination by the administration and \nabout $2.7 billion--I repeat, $2.7 billion--in earmarks and special \ninterest items.\n  I have long talked about the broken appropriations process and the \ncorruption it breeds. I remain deeply concerned over the damage done to \nour country and the institutions we are so proud to serve in by their \ncontinued abuse.\n  While we have made some progress on the issue in the last couple of \nyears, we certainly have not gone nearly far enough. Legislation we \npassed in 2007 provided for greater disclosure of earmarks, and that \nwas a good step forward. But the bottom line is, we simply do not need \nmore disclosure of earmarks, we need to eliminate them. We need to \neliminate them. We should adopt the practice that was the practice here \nfor a long time, up until recent years, that we didn't appropriate \nunless it was authorized.\n  In the years that I have been here, I have seen a tremendous shift in \nthe authority and responsibility from the authorizing committees to the \nappropriating committees and a commensurate rise in earmarks and \ncorruption. I know my colleagues do not like to hear me use the word \n``corruption,'' but we have former Members of Congress residing in \nFederal prison. We had a Congressman from California who used to list \nthe appropriations he was able to get in one column and in the other \ncolumn the amount of money he received for earmarking those \nappropriations. That is corruption.\n  It is not responsible for us to continue to load up appropriations \nbills with wasteful and unnecessary spending. Americans all over this \ncountry are hurting. People are losing their jobs, their savings, their \nhomes. So what are we doing? We continue the disgraceful earmarking \nprocess, elevating parochialism and patronage politics over the true \nneeds and welfare of this Nation. I will be pointing out during the \ncourse of this debate a number of examples of that corruption, which I \nthink is really unacceptable to the American people. By the way, that \nis one of the reasons the American people have risen up in an \nunprecedented manner in demonstrations against the way we do business \nhere in Washington.\n  So I want to be clear, disclosure is good. But it was not inadequate \ndisclosure requirements which led Duke Cunningham to violate his oath \nof office and take $2.5 million in bribes in exchange for dolling out \n$70 to $80 million of taxpayers' funds to a defense contractor. It was \nhis ability to freely earmark taxpayer funds without question.\n  A lot is said during campaigns. A lot of promises are made. \nUnfortunately, some are not kept. The President of the United States \npledged during his campaign that he would work to eliminate earmarks. \nThe Speaker of the House promised to ``drain the swamp.''\n  Just last month, the President of the United States spoke in Phoenix, \nAZ, to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In that speech, the President's \nwords were quite compelling about waste and porkbarrel spending in \ndefense bills. In that speech, the President promised an end to \n``special interests and their exotic projects,'' and he reaffirmed that \nhe was leading the charge to kill off programs like the F-22, the \nsecond engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, and the outrageously \nexpensive Presidential helicopter.\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       If a project does not support our troops, we will not fund \n     it. If a system does not perform well, we will terminate it. \n     And if Congress sends me a bill loaded with that kind of \n     waste, I will veto it.\n\n  If the President means those words, this legislation should be vetoed \nin its present form by the President of the United States.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We will do right by our troops and taxpayers.\n\n  He is right. We should do right by our troops and taxpayers.\n  The bill has at least $5.2 billion in programs the Pentagon does not \nneed and did not ask for--$5.2 billion.\n  The President last month put on an all court press to terminate the \nF-22 program in the face of congressional determination to continue \nfunding the production of the aircraft. So why was the President so \nadamant about terminating the F-22 while at the same time possibly \ngiving a free ride to 10 unrequested C-17s in this bill at a cost of \n$2.5 billion? How can one differentiate between a fighter aircraft that \nthe Pentagon says further production is unnecessary from a cargo \naircraft that the Pentagon says the current fleet, coupled with those \non order, is sufficient to meet the Pentagon's needs, even under the \nmost stressing situations? Why has the administration, including the \nSecretary of Defense, been silent on $2.7 billion in Member-requested \nearmarks? These are questions for which I do not have a good answer.\n  What I do know is that the appropriators did not add $5.2 billion to \nthe bill to pay for the unrequested additions but, rather, secured this \nadditional funding by offsetting programs in other parts of the bill.\n  So what did the appropriators decide to cut to make room for most of \nthese unrequested earmark and porkbarrel projects?\n  They reduced $900 million from the President's request for the \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund at a time when the one thing we are in \nagreement on is that we need to increase the size of the capability of \nthe Afghan Army and security forces. It is a key component of the U.S. \nstrategy in Afghanistan. So they cut it by $900 million. Reducing \nfunding in the account runs counter to our ground commanders' plan for \nthe Afghan forces to assume a greater share of responsibility for \nsecurity as quickly as possible.\n  Equally as incredible, the bill reduces over $3 billion in operations \nand maintenance accounts through direct cuts and cuts mandated in other \nprovisions in the bill based on economic assumptions and excess cash \nbalances.\n  The administration strongly opposes these cuts and in their Statement \non Administration Policy said, ``These reductions would hurt force \nreadiness and increase stress on the military people and equipment.''\n  This account is the lifeblood for our military. The operations and \nmaintenance of our men and women in the military and the equipment they \nuse is absolutely vital. So what did we do? We took $3 billion out of \noperations and maintenance and put it in those porkbarrel projects, \nincluding the C-17. The account provides for services with funds to \ncarry out day-to-day activities such as recruitment and fielding of a \ntrained and ready force, all military training and exercises, food, \nweapons, spare parts, equipment repairs, depot maintenance, ship \noverhauls, transportation services including aviation fuel, Navy and \nMarine Corps steaming days, civilian personnel management and pay, and \nchildcare and family centers.\n  One thing in this debate about Afghanistan that almost everyone is in \nagreement on is that our equipment is wearing out and that we are way \nbehind in the repair and replacement of spare parts, equipment--all \nthat is necessary for our Active-Duty Forces and our Guard and Reserve, \nwho are practically, for all practical purposes, Active Duty. And we \nare looking at--and I have guarded confidence that the President will \nagree to General McChrystal's and Petraeus' and Admiral Mullen's \nrecommendation. We will need more money for operations and maintenance \nbecause we will be sending more men and women and equipment to \nAfghanistan. So what did they do? What is in this bill? A $3 billion \nreduction. Well, what is in its place? I will be going over some of the \nprojects that are in its place.\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n  One of the more egregious items in the legislation we are considering \ntoday is the addition of $2.5 billion for 10 C-17 Globemaster cargo \naircraft.\n  First, let's have a little background.\n  Recognizing that the Department's total requirement for 180 C-17 \naircraft has been well been exceeded for 3 consecutive years, the Bush \nadministration had actively tried to close down the production line for \nthe C-17s. Nonetheless, earlier this year, the House Appropriations \nCommittee Defense Subcommittee, added eight more C-17s for $2.25 \nbillion to the 2009 supplemental spending bill, a bill that is supposed \nto be used to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The final version \nof that bill included all eight of these aircraft. When the \nsubcommittee met later to consider the 2010 Defense appropriations \nbill, it went ahead and added three more.\n  This is a little hard to see, this chart, but it is an interesting \none. These are the C-17s that were originally in the Air Force budget. \nThese are the C-17s, in red, that have been added by Congress. Each \nyear--each year--the Department of Defense and the administration have \nsaid: Enough. We have enough C-17s. Obviously, that has not been the \ncase.\n\n  It brings us to where we are now--well in excess of requirements, \ncontinuing to spend billions of dollars for aircraft we do not need. \nIncluding the 8 C-17s in the 2009 supplemental, the Department has \nbought now a total of 213 C-17s. The original requirement was 180.\n  According to the most recent Statement of Administration Position, \nthe administration ``strongly objects'' to the addition of $2.5 billion \nin funding for 10--count them: 10--unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft. \nThe Department's own analyses show that the 205 C-17s in the force and \non order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 aircraft, are more \nthan sufficient to meet the Department's future airlift needs even \nunder the most stressing conditions.\n  In no uncertain terms, Secretary Gates has stated that the military \nhas no need to buy more C-17s. So here we are, my friends, with a $3 \nbillion cut in operations and maintenance, which any observer, much \nless the administration, the Secretary of Defense, and the Joint \nChiefs, says, is vital to continuing our operations and the well-being \nand protection of the men and women in the military, and we are adding \n$2.5 billion for more C-17s. What kind of a tradeoff is that?\n  Secretary Gates has stated the military has no need to buy more C-\n17s. While Secretary Gates called the C-17 ``a terrific aircraft''--and \nI agree--he stressed earlier this year that the Air Force and the U.S. \nTransportation Command ``have more than necessary [strategic airlift] \ncapacity'' for airlift over the next 10 years. Nonetheless, continuing \nC-17 production would cost about $3 billion per year from 2010 onward.\n  In connection with the fiscal year 2010 budget request, the President \nnot only requested no funding for additional C-17s but also recommended \nthis program for termination. Particularly in light of today's \nfinancial constraints, continuing to spend billions of dollars for more \nC-17s we do not need is becoming increasingly unsustainable. For these \nreasons, I will be offering an amendment to strike the additional 10 \naircraft.\n  Given how much our airlift capacity currently exceeds operational \nrequirements, I see no reason why we should buy more of these \naircraft--at a minimum, before key analyses on the subject, such as the \nInstitute for Defense Analyses' review and the Department of Defense \nMobility Capabilities and Requirements Study are completed.\n  I will be proposing an amendment shortly that I hope will correct \nthis egregious action on the part of the Appropriations Committee. The \nmen and women in the military, who are fighting and putting their lives \non the line, deserve a lot better than that.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes about earmarks. The practice of \nearmarking is detrimental to the Department and, with increasing \nfrequency, to Members themselves. The guilty pleas of former Members of \nCongress, congressional staffers, and lobbyists illustrate how earmarks \nhave been used to corrupt the legislative process. Check the polls. The \ntrust and confidence on the part of the American people in the Congress \nof the United States is at an all-time low, and deservedly so.\n  By my preliminary count, there are almost 700 unrequested earmarks in \nthis bill, over 400 of which are not authorized in the fiscal year 2010 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. That represents more than $1.3 \nbillion in funding for unrequested, unauthorized, Member-interest \nitems. It is unacceptable. It is the constitutional duty of Congress to \nprovide the Department of Defense the resources it needs while \nproviding the oversight our constituents demand. We have a fiduciary \nobligation to the American taxpayer, and every time we tuck pork into \nan appropriations measure, we shun that responsibility.\n  One of the great untold stories of earmarking is that the money, \nwhich is diverted to special-interest projects, would have otherwise \nbeen used to address the stated needs of our military services. The \nmoney does not come from anywhere but the taxpayers' wallets and \npurses. But the service chiefs, who are in the best position to advise \nCongress of their priorities, are routinely shortchanged so that \nSenators and Congressmen can fund their pet projects.\n  A sampling: $9.5 million is in this bill to fund research in Montana \non hypersonic wind tunnels, called MARIAH--M-A-R-I-A-H. This self-\nlicking ice cream cone has been with us, earmarked and unrequested, \nsince 1998. The Air Force, leader in hypersonic testing and technology, \nlost interest in 2004, so appropriators moved the program to the Army. \nThe Army has no official requirement for this capability and published \na report in 2005 stating their disinterest in the program.\n  To date, the Army has no plans to fund the MARIAH wind tunnel effort, \nas they have stated in their budget documents. That has not kept the \nCongress from pouring more than $70 million into it--more than $70 \nmillion--with no discernible return. One group has done very well in \nthe deal, however. Of course, I am referring to lobbyists, including \nGage LLC, whose CEO, coincidentally, had been a senior staffer to an \nappropriator from Montana. I intend to offer an amendment to strike \nthis earmark in the bill, and I can assure you, you will hear more from \nme on this.\n  We have spent more than $70 million on a project that has had no \nreturn, that the military has said they have no interest in pursuing.\n  Another earmark is $5 million to the battleship USS Missouri Memorial \nAssociation. This is a private organization which owns and operates \nthis battleship as a museum in Pearl Harbor. I am aware that the \nassociation plans to put the Missouri in drydock and refurbish it, and \nalso aware it was not part of the donation agreement that the Defense \nDepartment would pay for required maintenance.\n  I am all for Navy ships being placed in places where Americans can \nsee and appreciate the great service and sacrifice of the men and women \nin the military, the Navy and Marine Corps in particular. The deal was \nthat the Defense Department would not, that they would take care of the \nmaintenance of it, that they would take care of whatever the needed \nexpenses are. So here is $5 million.\n  Another earmark is $25 million for the National World War II Museum \nin New Orleans, to help pay for the construction of new facilities as \npart of a $300 million expansion. This privately funded museum opened \nin 2000 and, through the help of the Louisiana delegation, has already \nreceived $13 million in Department of Defense funds tucked into \nprevious appropriations bills.\n  Again, if the members of the Appropriations Committee wish to go \nthrough the authorization process and have this project authorized, I \nwould be more than willing to consider it.\n  Another appropriation is $13.8 million for five different earmarks \npertaining to nano-tuber research. Of the almost 800 earmarks I \nmentioned earlier, hundreds are for high-tech research or devices. I \nask my colleagues whether they are capable of weighing the merits of \nspecific technologies they fund in this bill.\n  Another earmark is $20 million for a center at the University of \nMassachusetts ``dedicated to educating the general public, students, \nteachers, new Senators, and Senate staff about the\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\nrole and importance of the Senate.'' This center was neither requested \nin the President's budget nor authorized by Congress. Certainly a \nlegitimate question should be whether $20 million should be \nappropriated for a project that has nothing to do with the defense of \nthis Nation. It may be a worthwhile project. Why couldn't we get it \nauthorized?\n  Another earmark is $10 million, as usual, to the University of Hawaii \nfor a program called the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Raid Response \nSystem, Pan-STARRS. On the surface, this program seems like a \nreasonable need for the Air Force as a part of its Space Situational \nAwareness efforts. Unfortunately, the Air Force will not be getting \nmuch return on this investment since it will only be allowed to use the \ntelescope 5 percent of the time.\n  Let's get that straight. The Air Force is paying $10 million so the \ntelescope could be developed and maintained, and they are going to get \nto use it 5 percent of the time. In dollar figures, the Air Force pays \n$10 million to the university and receives $500,000 in return. What is \nmore, the Air Force has not, in the 9-year life of this earmark, \nrequested a single dollar for this program. So since 2001, the Air \nForce has been forced to spend more than $75 million of its budget \nallocation on a program it does not want--but might be able to use--\nonly to be denied use 95 percent of the time.\n  I do not dispute that some of the earmarks listed in the bill have \nvalue. I am sure they do. But I protest the process by which Congress \nignores priorities of the armed services so that Members can deliver \ntax dollars to their constituents for programs which may have nothing \nto do with the defense of our Nation, and at a time when we can least \nafford to misuse resources. We all know the economy has taken a beating \nover the last year. Unemployment is just under 10 percent, and the \nnational debt is $11.8 trillion. So we are going to provide $20 million \nto a center with a purpose to extol the virtues of the Senate?\n  The issues we face as a nation require all of us to make sacrifices--\nall of us. It is about time we started setting an example.\n  In today's Washington Post is an article written by Jeffrey Smith, \nentitled ``Defense Bill, Lauded by White House, Contains Billions in \nEarmarks.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 29, 2009]\n\n   Defense Bill, Lauded by White House, Contains Billions in Earmarks\n\n                         (By R. Jeffrey Smith)\n\n       Sen. Thad Cochran's most recent reelection campaign \n     collected more than $10,000 from University of Southern \n     Mississippi professors and staff members, including three who \n     work at the school's center for research on polymers. To a \n     defense spending bill slated to be on the Senate floor \n     Tuesday, the Mississippi Republican has added $10.8 million \n     in military grants earmarked for the school's polymer \n     research.\n       Cochran, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations \n     subcommittee on defense, also added $12 million in earmarked \n     spending for Raytheon Corp., whose officials have contributed \n     $10,000 to his campaign since 2007. He earmarked nearly $6 \n     million in military funding for Circadence Corp., whose \n     officers--including a former Cochran campaign aide--\n     contributed $10,000 in the same period.\n       In total, the spending bill for 2010 includes $132 million \n     for Cochran's campaign donors, helping to make him the \n     sponsor of more earmarked military spending than any other \n     senator this year, according to an analysis by the nonprofit \n     group Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n       Cochran says his proposals are based only on ``national \n     security interests,'' not campaign cash. But in providing \n     money for projects that the Defense Department says it did \n     not request and does not want, he has joined a host of other \n     senators on both sides of the aisle. The proposed $636 \n     billion Senate bill includes $2.65 billion in earmarks.\n       President Obama has repeatedly promised to fight ``the \n     special interests, contractors and entrenched lobbyists'' \n     that he says have distorted military priorities and bloated \n     appropriations in the past. In August, he told a convention \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that ``if Congress sends me a \n     defense bill loaded with a bunch of pork, I will veto it.''\n       But the White House instead sent a generally supportive \n     message to the Senate about the pending defense bill on \n     Friday, virtually ensuring that the earmarks will win final \n     congressional approval. For the most part, the White House \n     lauded the bill's proposed funding for the wars in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as its cancellation of three \n     programs that Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has been \n     particularly eager to kill this year: the F-22 fighter plane, \n     a second engine for the F-35 fighter and a new presidential \n     helicopter program.\n       The bill, however, would add $1.7 billion for an extra \n     destroyer the Defense Department did not request and $2.5 \n     billion for 10 C-17 cargo planes it did not want, at the \n     behest of lawmakers representing the states where those items \n     would be built. Although the White House said the \n     administration ``strongly objects'' to the extra C-17s and to \n     the Senate's proposed shift of more than $3 billion from \n     operations and maintenance accounts to projects the Pentagon \n     did not request, no veto was threatened over those \n     provisions.\n       The absence of such a threat provoked Winslow Wheeler, \n     director of a military reform project at the Center for \n     Defense Information, to describe Obama's stance as ``too \n     wimpy to impact behavior.'' Wheeler, who earlier criticized \n     the House for approving a version of the bill that includes \n     extra C-17 planes, $2.7 billion worth of earmarks and other \n     projects that Gates dislikes, said that ``as a long-time \n     Senate staffer who has read these documents for years, my \n     interpretation of it is that the House-Senate conference will \n     listen politely . . . and then do as it pleases.''\n       Senior Obama aides responded that the White House never \n     sought to fix the problem of earmarks in one year. ``The \n     president has been clear from Day One: He wants to change the \n     way business gets done in Washington,'' Thomas Gavin, a \n     spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said \n     Monday. ``The results speak for themselves. Earmarks in the \n     defense appropriations bills are down 27 percent in the House \n     and 19 percent in the Senate. This is an important step \n     forward in the president's drive to shape a government that \n     is more efficient and more effective.''\n       Those figures are the most flattering the White House could \n     have used: They refer to the number of earmarks in the bills, \n     not total spending. Total spending on military earmarks in \n     the Senate declined by only 11 percent from the $3 billion \n     approved by Congress last year.\n       ``Despite the fact that earmarks are down, there's still \n     nearly 800 . . . for projects that rose to the top by dint of \n     political power rather than project merit,'' said Ryan \n     Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ``The \n     president needs to take a harder line against waste and \n     political gamesmanship, particularly in the defense bill, \n     which is paying for two wars.''\n       There is, however, wide bipartisan support in Congress for \n     diverting funds to political donors or home-state causes.\n       Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), chairman of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee, ran a close second to Cochran's \n     $212 million in earmarks this year, having added 37 earmarks \n     of his own worth $208 million, according to the tally by \n     Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n       Almost all of Inouye's earmarks are for programs in his \n     home state, and 18 of the provisions--totaling $68 million--\n     are for entities that have donated $340,000 to his campaign \n     since 2007. His earmarks included $24 million for a Hawaiian \n     health-care network, $20 million for Boeing's operation of \n     the Maui Space Surveillance System and $20 million for a \n     civic education center named after the late senator Edward M. \n     Kennedy.\n       ``Many of my earmarks are intended to support investment in \n     small businesses working to hone new and innovative \n     technologies that will better protect and support our \n     soldiers during a time when our nation is at war,'' Inouye \n     said in a statement Monday.\n       In Cochran's case, the proposed earmarks would benefit at \n     least two entities that hired his former aides. The manager \n     of Mississippi operations for Colorado-based Circadence is R. \n     Bradley Prewitt, whose biography on the company's Web site \n     states that he was counsel and campaign manager to Cochran \n     from 1997 to 2002. The University of Southern Mississippi, \n     which would receive $10.8 million in Cochran earmarks, paid \n     $40,000 to a firm that employs Cochran's former legislative \n     director, James Lofton, to help lobby on defense \n     appropriations, according to the firm's Senate registration.\n       ``Senator Cochran takes his responsibilities on the \n     Appropriations Committee very seriously,'' spokesman Chris \n     Gallegos responded Monday. ``Senator Cochran does not, and \n     never will, base his decisions on campaign contributions.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Quoting from the article:\n\n       President Obama has repeatedly promised to fight ``the \n     special interests, contractors and entrenched lobbyists'' \n     that he says have distorted military priorities and bloated \n     appropriations in the past. In August--\n\n  As I mentioned--\n\n     he told a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that \n     ``if Congress sends me a defense bill loaded with a bunch of \n     pork, I will veto it.''\n\n  Mr. President, this bill fits that description.\n  It goes on:\n\n       The bill, however, would add $1.7 billion for an extra \n     destroyer the Defense Department did not request. . . .\n\n  It talks about the C-17s and ``the Senate's proposed shift of more \nthan $3 billion from operations and maintenance accounts to projects \nthe Pentagon did not request, no veto was threatened over those \nprovisions.\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\n  I want to say again, I am sure the managers of this bill will somehow \ntry to justify this transfer out of operations and maintenance into the \nC-17. It is not a credible argument. It is not a credible argument.\n\n       The absence of such a threat provoked Winslow Wheeler, \n     director of a military reform project at the Center for \n     Defense Information, to describe. . . .\n       Senior Obama aides responded that the White House never \n     sought to fix the problem of earmarks in one year. ``The \n     president has been clear from Day One: He wants to change the \n     way business gets done in Washington''. . . .\n\n  One thing I know about egregious practices, if you do not stop them \nearly in an administration, you never will. It will be alleged that \nearmarks are down less than they were before, it is an important step \nforward, and the sponsors of the bill will say earmarks are down 27 \npercent in the House and 19 percent in the Senate.\n\n       Those figures are the most flattering the White House could \n     have used: They refer to the number of earmarks in the bills, \n     not total spending. Total spending on military earmarks in \n     the Senate declined by only 11 percent from the $3 billion \n     approved by Congress last year.\n       ``Despite the fact that earmarks are down, there's still \n     nearly 800 . . . for projects that rose to the top by dint of \n     political power rather than project merit,'' said Ryan \n     Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ``The \n     president needs to take a harder line against waste and \n     political gamesmanship, particularly in the defense bill, \n     which is paying for two years.''\n\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike amounts available for procurement of C-17 aircraft \n in excess of the amount requested by the President in the budget for \n    fiscal year 2010 and to make such amounts available instead for \n operation and maintenance in accordance with amounts requested by the \n President in that budget and for Operation and Maintenance, Army, for \n                    overseas contingency operations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Reduction of Aircraft Procurement, Air Force, \n     for Excess Amounts for C-17 Aircraft.--The amount \n     appropriated by title III under the heading ``Aircraft \n     Procurement, Air Force'' is hereby reduced by $2,500,000,000, \n     the amount equal to the amount by which the amount available \n     under that heading for the procurement of C-17 aircraft \n     exceeds the amount requested by the President in the budget \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010 for the \n     procurement of such aircraft, with the amount of the \n     reduction to be allocated to amounts otherwise available for \n     the procurement of such aircraft.\n       (b) Availability for Operation and Maintenance.--The amount \n     appropriated by title II for Operation and Maintenance is \n     hereby increased by $2,438,403,000, in accordance with \n     amounts requested by the President in the budget for the \n     Department of Defense for fiscal year 2010.\n       (c) Availability for Operation and Maintenance, Army, for \n     Overseas Contingency Operations.--The amount appropriated by \n     title IX under the heading ``Operation and Maintenance, \n     Army'', is hereby increased by $61,597,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment strikes funding in the \nDefense appropriations bill for 10 C-17 Globemaster aircraft that we \nneither need nor can afford. My amendment also redirects those funds to \ncritically important operations and maintenance accounts which the \nappropriators have seen fit to cut.\n  At about $250 million per aircraft, the total cost to the taxpayer of \nthe C-17 earmark in this bill is $2.5 billion. But how are we paying \nfor these aircraft? With the cuts made in the bill, it appears much of \nthe offset for paying for the 10 aircraft falls on the O accounts. So \nwhy are we buying C-17s we don't need and can't afford while at the \nsame time reducing overall O accounts by $3 billion?\n  I am sure the managers of the bill will justify this cut in \noperations and maintenance. I would rely on the judgment of the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman and members of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff who will tell us they need this money for operations and \nmaintenance.\n  I hope my colleagues understand what this really means. If this bill \npasses with these cuts, the Air Force in particular will be forced to \ndecrease funding for training, equipment, depot maintenance, and the \nrestoration and modernization of air bases across the United States, \nand they would not be alone. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and National \nGuard would also come out on the wrong end of these cuts and would be \nforced to reduce funding for facilities sustainment, training, and \nrecruiting.\n  After 8 years of war, the Army's equipment readiness has fallen to \ntruly worrisome levels. In testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee this year, Secretary of the Army Pete Geren said:\n\n       Predictable and timely funding is key for us to be able to \n     operate an organization the size of the United States Army. . \n     . .When funding is unpredictable, it makes it very hard to \n     plan long term.\n\n  I have seen a hollow Army, deeply degraded in the decade after \nVietnam and again during the drawdown of the 1990s. Today's forces are \nnot in such dire straits as those, but 8 years of war has taken its \ntoll on the Army, Marines, Guard, and Reserve component ground forces. \nAs GEN George Casey said: ``The current demand for our forces exceeds \nthe sustainable supply.''\n  Particularly in a time of war, I urge my colleagues to invest in the \nrecapitalization of our ground forces--not funding aircraft we neither \nneed nor can afford with those investments.\n  Finally, I wish to mention the Army Reserve and National Guard, which \nare, as General Casey described, ``performing an operational role for \nwhich they were neither originally designed nor resourced.'' In my \nview, any cut to their operations and maintenance accounts will retard \nthe ability of these components to fit and deploy for missions at home \nor abroad. And I am sure the Secretary of Defense would say he would \nlike a lot more because of the wear and tear and degradation that \nalready exists to much of our equipment and capabilities.\n  We can and must do better. Left uncorrected what we would do in this \nbill is effectively fund the purchase of new aircraft that we neither \nneed nor can afford with critical sustainment money. That would have a \nsignificant impact on our ability to provide the day-to-day operational \nfunding that our service men and women and their families deserve.\n  Let me turn briefly to the merits of the C-17 earmark itself. If some \nof these remarks sound familiar, that is because I was on the floor of \nthe Senate less than 3 months ago speaking about C-17s when the Senate \nAppropriations Committee earmarked eight of these cargo aircraft in the \n2009 supplemental appropriations bill at a cost of $2.25 billion. That \nis right. In just 3 months, the Appropriations Committee has set aside \nnearly $5 billion for 18 C-17 aircraft that we don't need, the Pentagon \ndoesn't want, and we can't afford.\n  Against that backdrop, over the last 3 years the White House has \nactively been trying to close down the C-17 production line, asking for \nas much as $500 million per year to shut down the line. But over that \nsame period, the appropriators have been working in the exact opposite \ndirection to ensure continued funding for the program in supplemental \nwar funding bills--bills that\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\nare supposed to be used to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  So despite that the Democrat Department of Defense's overall \nrequirements for C-17s continue to sit at 180, the appropriators have \nrequired the Department to buy through fiscal year 2009 a total of 213 \nC-17s, and they have done so before two key studies have been \ncompleted.\n  This chart illustrates what is going on. Marked in red we see the C-\n17s the appropriators have added. Why? Because our service men and \nwomen need them? No. In 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 the Air Force \nbudgeted money to close the line each and every year.\n  Is the reason some sort of new stimulus package which will create new \njobs? No. That is because, as I mentioned, they have had three dozen \nmore C-17s than the Air Force has needed. In fact, right now, the \nbacklog of C-17s is such that Boeing will not begin building these \naircraft earmarked by the appropriators for another 2 years.\n  In the bill we are debating today, the 10 C-17s the appropriators \nwant to fund will bring the total number of C-17s the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has added above any validated military \nrequirement to 44. Enough is enough.\n  According to the most recent Statement of Administration Policy, the \nadministration ``strongly objects'' to the addition of $2.5 billion in \nfunding for 10 unrequested C-17 aircraft. The Department of Defense's \nown analyses show that the 205 C-17s in the force and on order, \ntogether with the existing fleet of aircraft, are sufficient to meet \nthe Department's future airlift needs even under the most stressing \nconditions.\n  Secretary Gates has likewise very clearly said that the military has \nno need to buy more C-17s. While Secretary Gates called the C-17--and I \nagree--a ``terrific aircraft,'' he stressed earlier this year that the \nAir Force and U.S. Transportation Command ``have more than necessary'' \nstrategic airlift ``capacity'' for airlift over the next 10 years. \nNonetheless, continuing C-17 production would cost about $3 billion per \nyear from 2010 onward.\n  There is little reason why, in connection with the fiscal year 2010 \nbudget request, the President not only requested no funding for \nadditional C-17s but also recommended this program for termination. In \nlight of today's financial exigencies, continuing to spend billions of \ndollars for C-17s the Pentagon doesn't need and can't afford is \nbecoming increasingly unsustainable. More so than almost any other \nearmark I have discussed on the Senate floor, this earmark shows our \npriorities are just about the opposite of where they should be.\n  For that reason, I am persuaded by the strength of Secretary Gates's \nopposition, and I find unacceptable the apparent source of funding for \nthis earmark and urge the Members of this body to support my amendment. \nAs I mentioned before, the amendment would redirect money from buying \nthe C-17s we don't need and can't afford to critically important \noperations and maintenance accounts that are the lifeblood of our \ntroops and their families.\n  So we have a choice with this amendment. We can either continue to \nfund an airplane that the military neither wants nor needs, or we can \nrestore the cuts in funding in operations and maintenance which, \naccording to the testimony of every military leader, is badly needed \nand wanted. The body will be presented with that choice.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Investing in Education\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as Congress awaits health reform and \nclimate change, we must also remember that education is another one of \nthe great moral issues of our time.\n  Last week, my Washington office was honored to have DeAnthony \nCummings serve as an intern for the day. He was 1 of only 60 students \nselected nationwide who traveled to Washington to participate in Job \nCorps Day, 45 Years of Building Lives and Launching Careers. For more \nthan four decades, Job Corps centers around the Nation have provided \nvocational academic training for nearly 3 million economically \ndisadvantaged young Americans.\n  DeAnthony is enrolled at the Cincinnati Job Corps Center where he is \nserving his second term as class president. Several months ago I \nvisited with him and his friends at Job Corps. As the eldest sibling, \nDeAnthony wants to set a good example for his family. He says Job Corps \nis preparing him for college, where he wants to study psychology and \npolitical science. He told me he wants to run for elective office \nsomeday to serve his country. He deserves an educational system that \nhelps him get there.\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate will take up a major bill to expand \nstudent aid and education funding at no additional cost to taxpayers. \nFor aspiring college students such as DeAnthony, the bill would move \nall Federal student loans to the more efficient and less costly public \ndirect loan program. The $87 billion in savings over 10 years can be \ninvested in educational opportunities for our students--for future \nteachers and doctors and engineers and scientists and computer \ntechnicians and farmers.\n  The bill will protect a student's purchasing power of a Pell grant by \nensuring that the maximum grant grows faster than inflation. Senator \nCasey from Pennsylvania, who is with us today, worked with me last year \nto raise those Pell grants that hadn't been raised in 5 or 6 years to \nget them to the place where students had more opportunity to go to \nschool. For students attending college today, the maximum Pell grant is \nnow $5,350, a historic high.\n  By eliminating wasteful subsidies to lenders, we can make college \nmore affordable and focus our attention on retention and students' \nsuccess. That is where one of the Nation's most valuable resources \nplays a critical role. The community college system is essential to \ntraining our most talented workers and students for new jobs in new \nindustries. Last month, the New York Times reported how Sinclair \nCommunity College in Dayton focuses on jobs not just degrees.\n  President Obama's American Graduation Initiative has proposed \ninvesting $12 million in community colleges and increasing the number \nof community college graduates by 5 million over the next decade. Dr. \nJill Biden, one of the Nation's most eloquent voices on community \ncolleges, has said:\n\n       Community colleges change lives and serve as a gateway to \n     opportunity for students at all stages of their lives and \n     careers.\n\n  A few months ago, at a constituent coffee in Washington, I met an \nOhioan who inspired me. Denee, from Columbus, grew up with 13 different \nfoster care families and spent time with the Department of Youth \nServices. But she believed that better things were ahead for her. She \nworked hard, earned her GED, enrolled in Columbus State University, and \nis now finishing nursing school and will start a new job in the fall. \nLegislation such as the Building Student Success Act, which I recently \nintroduced, will help community college generate a better outcome for \ntheir students. It is that type of Federal investment that will help \npresidents of Ohio's colleges and universities provide the resources \nfor student success on campuses all over my State.\n  For the last 2 years, I have held the Ohio College Presidents \nConference which brings together presidents of Ohio's 2- and 4-year \ncolleges and universities to craft education policy in Washington that \nmeets the needs of Ohio's students. Some 55 college presidents each of \nthe last 2 years have attended and shared their experiences and ideas \nand views and best practices with one another. Much of what we \ndiscussed is what President Obama has explained before: that it is not \nenough for our economy just to recover, we must rebuild it, and that \nstarts in our classrooms.\n  Reforming Federal student loan programs frees up resources to \nmodernize schools and strengthen early childhood education. The impact \nof these investments will, of course, span generations. Student loan \nreform gives us an opportunity to address another problem that has \nbecome more acute because of the economic crisis. Too many of our \nNation's students are signing away their\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\neconomic future when they sign up for college.\n  In 2007, 63 percent of Ohio graduates of public colleges finished \nschool with an average debt of $21,000; 75 percent of Ohio graduates of \nprivate colleges finished school with an average debt of $22,700.\n  Private loans typically, though, have higher interest rates that can \ntop 18 percent and have fewer repayment options than loans administered \ndirectly by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  According to an analysis by the Project on Student Debt, nearly two-\nthirds of private student loan borrowers didn't exhaust their Federal \nloan eligibility. That is why I introduced the Private Student Loan \nDebt Swap Act.\n  Under my debt swap bill, if you have an expensive and unaffordable \nprivate student loan, you can use your remaining Federal student loan \neligibility to pay off or at least pay down some of that loan. By \nswapping expensive private loan debt, sometimes with local banks or \nnational banks at 18 percent interest, with low-cost Federal student \nloans capped at under 7 percent, borrowers could much more readily \nrepay their loans.\n  This legislation wouldn't increase government spending; in fact, it \nwill likely reduce it. Expanded Pell grants and a strong debt swap bill \nwould help Ohioans such as Kimberly, a schoolteacher from Toledo. \nDuring college, she took out private student loans, expecting that she \nwould consolidate them after graduating. After accepting a teaching \nposition, her lenders would not consolidate the loans because of the \neconomy. Kimberly is a teacher at a low-income Head Start school, so \nshe doesn't make as much money as a teacher in a public high school. \nShe has four loans, with four different interest rates, which are all \nsignificantly higher than Federal student loan rates.\n  Kimberly should not have to spend the rest of her career paying off \nher loans or as she writes:\n\n       I knew that I would be paying out my loan long after \n     graduating, but at this point, someone else will have to pay \n     out the loan after I'm gone.\n\n  Imagine that. She thinks she will never be able to fully pay this \nloan back because of the exorbitantly high interest rate charged by the \nbanks.\n  Private student loans with enormous interest rates are driving young \nAmericans into never-ending debt. There is no American dream within \nreach in that scenario for the Kimberlys of the world, just a sense of \nhelplessness and hopelessness.\n  That is why this student reform bill is so important. John F. Kennedy \nsaid once: ``Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our \nprogress in education.''\n  In Portsmouth, Lima, Mansfield, Marietta, Toledo, Akron, Gallipolis, \nand Mason, we have leaders in our community, such as Kimberly, teaching \nin our classrooms, or, such as Denee, healing people in our hospitals.\n  Years from now? DeAnthony Cummings should be able to stand in this \nChamber representing Ohio because there was an education system that \nbelieved in him.\n  The student aid reform bill is part of the progress we seek--that \nwill allow a child, a working mother or an older worker to believe that \nin this Nation, if you work hard and play by the rules, you, too, can \nhave part of the American dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is no doubt that there may be things \nin the Defense budget that you could characterize expensive, \noverbudget, and behind schedule programs. But the C-17 aircraft is not \none of them, which is why it is so bewildering--and disappointing--that \nsome of this Chamber's well-known budget hawks are opposed to a model \nprocurement program and a boon for the taxpayers.\n  While the most important concern, of course, is for our warfighter \nand national security--which I will go into in more detail in a \nmoment--let me address what seems like the primary concern for some of \nmy colleagues: the budget.\n  Investing in the C-17 is actually a better use of taxpayer dollars \nthan the obsolete and unreliable C-5A. C-17s are planes we need and can \nafford. The Government Accountability Office has found it would take \nseven rehabbed and remanufactured C-5As, at a cost of $924 million to \nthe taxpayer, to equal the capability of just one new C-17. They have \nto have that airlift. Right now, the C-5A is part of it. But it cannot \ncontinue as it is. You can get a C-17 for a lot less than you can \nremanufacture and rehab one of the old C-5As, and that doesn't even \nwork so good.\n  My biggest concern, of course, is national security. Some of my \ncolleagues have attacked the C-17 as a special interest item. I agree. \nInvesting in the C-17 is in the special interest of our warfighters and \nit is critical to our national security interests and it gives us the \nheavy lift air mobility we require these days.\n  The C-17 is a proven, combat-tested airlift capability that is \nessential to the fight we are in right now, and it has been a workhorse \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  As some of my colleagues have mentioned, we are at war. I couldn't \nagree more that this is our primary concern, which is, again, why the \nC-17 is so important. With the war in Afghanistan heating up and the \nwar in Iraq continuing, our airlift needs are only growing.\n  The Congressional Research Service has indicated that the C-17 was \ndesigned to fly 1,000 hours per year over 30 years. But as our overseas \ncommitments have grown, some aircraft have even reached 2,400 flying \nhours in a single year. My colleague from Arizona pointed out that \nequipment is being worn out quickly in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is no \ndoubt true. But one key piece of our equipment there is our heavy \nairlift capability. The heavy usage, in addition to the growth of the \nArmy and Marine Corps, the logistics difficulty of getting supplies \ninto Afghanistan, and the need for increased humanitarian/smart power \nmissions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the world are all \nreasons why I urge my Senate colleagues to support the provision in the \nbill that would add the long lead time purchase we need right now to \nmake sure we can continue to purchase the C-17s as the needs develop.\n  Some opponents may argue that the Department of Defense and the \nPresident don't want more, that they have enough C-17s and C-5s to do \nthe job. However, with a 50-percent readiness level, a per hour \noperating cost of $29,000, and 40 maintenance man-hours per 1 hour of \nflight, the C-5A represents ineffective and costly iron.\n  By replacing these obsolete, ineffective, and costly C-5As with new \nC-17s, which this Congress has allowed the Department of Defense to do \nby lifting a truly special legislative interest prohibition, saying in \nthe past they could not retire them, we could save money, provide a \nmore reliable capability for our warfighter, and preserve industrial \ncapability for the future.\n\n  I have talked about the importance of investing in our airlift \ncapability for our warfighter and our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. \nBut as America's only large airlift production line, the C-17 \nproduction line, if ended, would put at risk our Nation's long-term \nsecurity. Eliminating the only large airlift production line in the \nUnited States would demonstrate a lack of understanding and \nappreciation for the skill sets and efforts needed to build these \naircraft.\n  Without a follow-on program, and because we have already shrunk our \naerospace defense industrial base to such a low level, once these \nskilled workers, the engineers, designers, and their expertise are \ngone, we do not get them back.\n  If we lose the skilled engineers, designers, and dedicated workers, \nwe could be forced to turn to Europe or Russia for our future large \nairlift needs. More and more, this national talent and industrial \nworkforce, which manufactures the critical and unique equipment that \nhelps us fight and win our wars, is being eviscerated.\n  Without additional funding, our aerospace engineering, design, and \nmanufacturing base will atrophy.\n  This will put at risk our competitiveness on the global market, our \nability to address future airlift requirements, and put at risk 30,000 \nAmerican jobs stretched across 43 States.\n  This isn't about preserving jobs in tough economic times, although I \nbelieve the administration certainly missed a big opportunity in the \nstimulus bill to recommend stimulating the economy in defense \nproduction. They\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\ndidn't put a single dollar in defense production needs, which is where \nwe have tremendous needs.\n  The C-17 addresses a shortsighted decision on the part of the \nadministration. That decision took for granted the capacity and \ninnovation of our defense industrial base, but we cannot afford to let \nthat wither because their proposal put out of work the people who have \ndesigned these aircraft. We have found, in the past, when we have shut \ndown acquisition lines, the skilled engineers leave. One example is \nthey went to work at Disney. That is great. That is good work, but it \nis not protecting our national defense.\n  After the draconian defense cuts during the Clinton administration, \nthe arsenal of democracy consolidated and shrank to a point where any \nfurther consolidation will result in an irreversible loss in \ncompetition, innovation, and industrial capacity.\n  C-17 production will shut down in 2010 without these 10 aircraft, and \nrestarting production would be incredibly difficult and expensive--\naccording to the GAO, up to $1 billion.\n  The GAO study further noted that ``careful planning is needed to \nensure the C-17 production line is not ended prematurely and later \nrestarted at substantial cost.''\n  Additionally, the GAO found that ``both the manufacturer and Air \nForce agree that shutting down and restarting production would not be \nfeasible or cost-effective.''\n  Keeping the C-17 line open is critical not only for our national \ndefense but for thousands of American workers who rely on this aircraft \nfor their livelihood.\n  With the waning demand for commercial aircraft and a lull in military \nfighter jet production, it is more critical than ever to maintain the \naerospace industrial base that runs the only remaining wide-body \nassembly line in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to exercise their constitutional authority and \nnot go along with what I believe will be shown very shortly, if we make \nthe decision, to have been very shortsighted. This is a decision that \nwe, in our constitutional responsibility, can and must make.\n  We cannot afford disastrous defense cuts coming out of the OMB, which \nis why we fought and won the effort in committee earlier. It is \ncritical--and that colleagues join with me in supporting the managers \non the floor to fight a shortsighted attempt to eviscerate our \nwarfighter's airlift capability and our Nation's industrial base. Both \nare critical elements for the long-term security and future of our \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for about 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, many have come to this Chamber and have \ntalked about their constituents and the concerns that have been \nexpressed to us about health care and how their families would be \ndirectly impacted. The frustration driving many of those individuals \nwho have written to us, picked up the phone, attended a townhall \nmeeting continues. They worry we are not listening.\n  The biggest misconception is that those who are raising concerns \nabout the President's health care proposals believe that somehow they \nare defending the status quo. That could not be further from the truth.\n  We can all agree that health care costs are rising at rates that \ncreate hardships across our country. They impact families and \nbusinesses, and ultimately they are not sustainable for Federal and \nState budgets.\n  There are many things I believe upon which there would be very \nuniversal agreement. For example, I support insurance market reforms \nthat increase access to insurance for people who have preexisting \nconditions. Many of us do in the Senate. I support allowing small \nbusinesses to band together to bring down health insurance premiums. \nMany here do. I support subsidies for those who truly cannot afford \ninsurance to help them buy down their premiums, their deductibles or \ncopays. Again, many here could. I support real malpractice reform that \nwould curb costs by reducing defensive medicine. Again, many here do.\n  These commonsense reforms and others we could mention could be the \ncornerstone of what I believe would be a truly bipartisan solution to \nour health care crisis. But I believe the current proposals have veered \nin a very different direction. I cannot support so-called reform that \nlowers the quality of our health care, compromises the doctor-patient \nrelationship, and drastically increases costs for Americans. Yet I \nworry that the provisions working their way through the Senate Finance \nCommittee appear to do precisely that--increase costs and jeopardize \nquality. I do not believe it is the kind of health care reform \nAmericans have sent us to Washington to enact.\n  In our current economic crisis, the last thing American families need \nis to see more of their paychecks going to pay taxes. This legislation \npresents a ``darned if you do, darned if you don't'' scenario. It taxes \nyou if you have insurance and it taxes you if you don't.\n  People who depend on medical devices will see prices rise. So will \nindividuals who take prescription drugs. States will have to raise \nmoney to pay for what I regard as an unfair unfunded Medicare mandate. \nHaving been a Governor, I can tell you there are limited choices in \nState budgets, and State budgets are in crisis today. They are either \ngoing to have to raise taxes to somehow find the revenue to deal with \nthat mandate, or they are going to have to do something equally \nunpleasant; that is, cut programs. Which State programs do you think \nAmericans will want to sacrifice so Washington can have its way with \nthe States in the Medicaid unfunded mandate?\n  I can tell you from experience, cutting programs is an impossible \ndecision. So is raising taxes. States should not be put in a difficult \nposition again and again by an overreaching Federal Government. \nEmployers will be taxed in order to pay for required health care \ninsurance for their employees. These taxes will create financial \nheartburn that no doctor's prescription can ease.\n  This legislation will require every American to have health \ninsurance, with limited exceptions, and not just any health insurance. \nIt requires health insurance that meets specific qualifications the \nbureaucracy in Washington will dictate.\n  The Finance Committee bill would require you to spend a certain share \nof your income before becoming eligible for health insurance subsidies. \nUnder the original Finance Committee proposal, the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated that an individual who makes $32,400 a year--not a lot \nof money--would be required to pay $4,100 in health care insurance \npremiums before becoming eligible for a subsidy. That individual would \nalso be required to pay, on average, $1,600 in copayments and \ndeductibles. These individuals would be required, through the \ngovernment mandate, again, to spend 18 percent of their income on \nhealth insurance. Surprisingly, the cheaper catastrophic coverage some \nwould prefer would not be considered a so-called qualified plan; \ntherefore, not an option.\n  Furthermore, if you choose not to have health insurance that meets \nthese qualifications, you could be forced to pay out as much as $1,900 \nin additional taxes per family.\n  The Internal Revenue Service will be knocking on your door to make \nsure you literally buy into federally dictated health care reform \nefforts.\n  I have heard from many Nebraskans who feel as if this individual \nmandate is a direct assault on their freedom. Most people do not like \nthe notion that Washington tells them how to live their lives. Imposing \nan individual mandate tax rubs Americans the wrong way. Not only are we \ntelling them they must buy insurance, but we are telling them what kind \nof insurance they must buy.\n  I know some, including our President, argue this is not a tax; \nrather, it is simply a shared responsibility. The very language in the \nFinance Committee plan clearly states this is a tax,\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\nand it brings in about $20 billion. Where is the President's promise \nthat he would not raise taxes on individuals who make under $250,000 a \nyear? Well, it is nonexistent. Last week, this was made clear during \nthe Finance Committee markup. When asked about the effect of this \nindividual mandate tax on the middle class, the chief of staff for the \nJoint Committee on Taxation responded:\n\n       We would expect that some people paying would make less \n     than $250,000.\n\n  For hard-working families, the individual mandates will load them up \nwith a fancy benefit plan covering services they may not want or need. \nThey will be required to buy it or their government will penalize them.\n  This is a complex and a fundamental shift in how we approach health \ncare in our great country, indeed, in how much the government dictates \nthe health care decisions of each and every American.\n  Furthermore, this legislation raises money by taxing insurance \ncompanies, medical device manufacturers, and prescription drug \nmanufacturers. Does anybody doubt for a minute that will be passed on \nto the average guy? There is little doubt that these increased taxes \nwill lead to higher premiums, more expensive medical equipment, and \nhigher drug prices for Americans. These industries will compensate for \nthe added tax by raising prices, ultimately raising the cost of health \ncare in this country.\n  Additionally, this plan is likely to decrease research and \ndevelopment in the health care sector, which has been a major driver of \ninnovation and improvement in health care quality. Creating policy that \ndecreases the quality of our health care makes no sense. It is \ncounterproductive. Requiring employers to provide health insurance to \ntheir employees or be fined or taxed does not make sense. The Finance \nCommittee proposal is expected to collect $27 billion worth of those \nfines or taxes. In tough economic times, with unemployment almost in \ndouble digits and forecasts to go into double digits, putting more \nrequirements and mandates on job creators and job sustainers is \ncounterproductive. Employers will think twice about hiring more \nworkers.\n  There is little doubt that these increased taxes will lead to higher \ninsurance premiums, more expensive medical equipment, and higher drug \nprices for Americans. These industries will compensate by raising their \nprices. They simply will.\n  I fear low-income Americans will suffer the most. They need those \njobs. We must carefully evaluate the details of this legislation and \nensure that our attempts to make things better, which I believe we can \ndo in a bipartisan way, do not ultimately make things worse. I suggest \nthat in tough economic times, creating legislation that increases the \ncost of health care, that raises taxes is not true health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the Senate realizes the business today \nis the administration's fiscal year 2010 Defense budget proposal, our \nCommittee on Appropriations, as everyone knows, in the regular order, \nhad hearings and took advantage of advice from testimony and \nsuggestions received by other Senators on and off the committee about \nthe provisions of this important legislation. It sets out, as the \nSenate appreciates, the funding that will be permitted by the \nDepartment of Defense for the next fiscal year. So the subject we have \ntoday before us is specifically an issue involving a funding provision \nin the administration's fiscal year 2010 Defense budget proposal.\n  The administration proposed several funding cuts for weapons programs \nthey deemed unneeded. The Senate Appropriations Committee, in its \nhearings and in its deliberations, reviewed each of the proposals and \ngenerally agreed with the recommendations set forth in the \nadministration's budget submittal.\n  This bill does not include additional funding for F-22 aircraft, the \nPresidential helicopter, the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine, the \ncombat search and rescue helicopter, the Kinetic Energy Interceptor, \nand several other programs which were proposed for funding cuts by this \nadministration.\n  The C-17 aircraft is an area where we did not agree. The committee \nproposed $2.5 billion be included in the bill for 10 additional \naircraft. As we all know, the Defense Department is not infallible. It \nwas wrong and overruled by Congress when it recommended program \nterminations of the F-117 stealth fighter and the V-22 Osprey.\n  The C-17 is the current backbone of our strategic airlift capability, \nand it will be for decades to come. C-17s are being utilized all over \nthe world at a much faster pace than previously anticipated. While they \ncomprise only 60 percent of the Air Force's strategic airlift fleet, \nthey are flying 80 percent of all worldwide strategic airlift missions.\n  This demand for C-17 lift capability is only going to grow as new \nairlift missions emerge. Other missions we know about already are rapid \ndeployment of theater missile defenses, counterinsurgency operations, \nas well as growing airlift demands for an expanding Army and Marine \nCorps.\n  Failure to fund the C-17 will result in the United States shutting \ndown its airlift manufacturing base at a time when the demand for \nairlift is likely to grow. Allowing the C-17 supply base and production \nline to shut down and then trying to reconstitute it would cost \nbillions of dollars and take years to accomplish.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review and the upcoming Mobility Capability \nand Requirements Study are reassessing our strategic airlift \nrequirements. Until those requirements are reevaluated, the C-17s \nshould be included in this bill. The Air Force Chief of Staff has \nstated that he believes 205 C-17s and 111 C-5s are needed to meet \nstrategic airlift requirements and that procuring more than the 205 C-\n17s already purchased should involve a light reduction and retirement \nof C-5A aircraft.\n  Prior to enactment of the fiscal year 2009 Supplemental \nAppropriations Act in June of this year, the Air Force was prohibited \nfrom retiring the older and less capable C-5As. Now that the Department \nhas authority to retire these aircraft, we should replace a number of\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\nthem with a highly capable aircraft in production today. The Government \nAccountability Office has concluded:\n\n       It will take seven fully modernized C-5s at a cost of $132 \n     million each to attain the equivalent capability achieved \n     from buying one additional C-17 at a cost of $276 million.\n\n  In other words, it would cost $924 million to modernize seven C-5s to \nget the same capability of one C-17 costing $276 million.\n  Based on the growing airlift needs and the new authority to retire \nthe aging and hard-to-maintain C-5 aircraft, we added the $2.5 billion \nto sustain production of the C-17 program for 1 additional year. This \nadditional year will give the Department of Defense time to complete \nits airlift reviews and preserve the option of adding to our strategic \nairlift fleet.\n  If funding for C-17s is eliminated in this bill and the ongoing \nstudies determine additional airlift is needed, at best there will be \nsignificant cost increases and delays in getting the aircraft to the \nfleet; at worst, it will be cost prohibitive to restart the line and \nour service men and women will be denied equipment needed to perform \ntheir missions. That would be totally unacceptable, and I urge a ``no'' \nvote on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the statement I am about to present may \nappear a bit redundant after listening to the great statement of the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, vice chairman of this committee. But \nas chairman of this committee, I want to, by this redundancy, emphasize \nthat Senator Cochran and I work as a team, and we agree with the \nprovisions in this measure. For the interest of this body, it should be \nnoted that this measure was passed and presented to the Senate by a \nvote of 30 to zero--unanimous. A $636 billion bill coming out of the \ncommittee, after due consideration, unanimously is historic.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Arizona seeks to eliminate funds \nprovided in this bill to sustain the C-17 program. As I indicated, Vice \nChairman Cochran and I proposed, and the committee accepted, our \nrecommendation to relocate $2.5 billion to procure an additional 10 C-\n17 aircraft. If approved, this will bring the total C-17 inventory to \n223 aircraft. We believe this is a critical investment which will \nsupport our national security strategy and add much to the needed \nairlift capability.\n  There are three main reasons the committee supported adding funding \nfor the C-17:\n  First, as everyone in the military, from senior leadership to the \nsoldiers being transported, will agree, it is, simply put, a superb \naircraft. The C-17 represents the finest in military technology. It is \nefficient, cost-effective, and highly capable. In short, it has no \ndetractors.\n  Second, we believe the facts now show that additional aircraft are \nneeded to meet military requirements despite that it is being \nrecommended by the Pentagon for cancellation.\n  Third, the C-17 embodies the only strategic airlift production \nprogram in our Nation. As the Senator from Missouri pointed out, there \nis nothing on the planning ledger to replace it. If we cut off the \nproduction at this moment, it will be unaffordable to restart this \nprogram.\n  The C-17 provides the U.S. military with the essential flexibility to \nrespond on short notice--and I emphasize short notice--anywhere in the \nworld. Our air fleet assets are a major enabler of strategy and \noperational plans. There is not a military scenario in existence today \nwhich can be put into effect without a strong airlift fleet. The C-17 \nwas designed specifically to meet virtually all of the needs of our \nwarfighters. It is the only airlift aircraft that has the ability to \nfly both great distances and to land on austere airfields anywhere in \nthe world. That is very important because we don't have long runways \nprepared for us in far-off countries. When teamed with the tactical C-\n130 and the C-5, the C-17 fleet provides the Nation with the capability \nto deliver outsized cargo to our forces wherever they may be located.\n  We believe the C-17 is today the finest airlift aircraft in the U.S. \narsenal. With its new avionics and structures, it can maintain a very \nhigh mission capability rate. This is a term used by the Air Force to \ndenote the aircraft's ability to perform. Comparative data filed by the \nGovernment Accountability Office in November 2008 showed that the C-17 \nwas able to successfully perform its mission in excess of 85 percent of \nthe time. And I think we should note that--85 percent of the time, they \nare able to perform their mission. On the other hand, the aging C-5 was \nonly able to meet its performance demands 58 percent of the time. For \nour men and women in uniform, what this means is that if they are \ndepending on a C-5, their needs will be only addressed a little more \nthan half the time, while a C-17 will meet their needs more than 8 \ntimes out of 10.\n  In addition, the C-17 is much cheaper to operate than the C-5. It is \ntrue that a C-5 has the capacity to carry more cargo, but in the actual \nusage by the Air Force, the cost per flying hour of the C-17 is only 40 \npercent of the cost of the C-5. The Air Force has informed us that \ntoday its current statistics show that it costs $6.42 to fly 1 pound of \ncargo from South Carolina to Baghdad on a C-17--that is $6.42 from \nSouth Carolina to Baghdad--but $13.76 to fly the same item on a C-5. \nWhy? Because the C-5 is unreliable, because we rarely need to fill \neither plane to its maximum capacity on an average mission, and because \nthe C-17 is newer and modernized in comparison to the C-5. We simply \ncannot rely on the older, outdated C-5.\n  Opponents might argue that when we modernize the C-5 it will be able \nto overcome many of these problems. I would concur that a modernized C-\n5 will be a far better aircraft. However, I would point out that the C-\n5 Modernization Program has been plagued with delays and cost overruns. \nBecause of the high cost of the C-5 Modernization Program, the Defense \nDepartment decided that it could no longer afford to modernize all 111 \nC-5s and it cut the program to 52. That means our military will be \ndependent on 59 of the old and often broken C-5s that cost twice as \nmuch to operate as the C-17 for the foreseeable future. That is 47 \npercent of the C-5 fleet that won't be updated and will be unable to \noperate efficiently to meet our military needs.\n  The Government Accountability Office noted that additional \ninvestments in the C-17 may be attractive. It calculated that the \nDefense Department would need to modernize, as Senator Cochran pointed \nout, seven C-5s--to modernize seven C-5s--to get the equivalent \ncapability gained from acquiring one C-17. It is going to take seven C-\n5s to do the work of one C-17, but it would cost three times as much to \nmodernize the seven C-5s as it would to purchase one C-17.\n  I would like to point out that the C-17 is a fully matured program \nwith stable costs and little uncertainty, while the C-5 Modernization \nProgram is still in its infancy. If there is one thing we know about \nDefense programs, it is that new program costs generally increase \nduring their early years.\n  Some may address the Senate and say we don't need any more C-17s. \nThey note that today the Air Force now says we only need the 213 we \nalready have purchased. I would like to point out that in 2002 the \ncommander of the U.S. Transportation Command testified that his C-17 \nrequirement was for 222 C-17s. Moreover, the 2005 Mobility Capabilities \nStudy also raises questions about how many aircraft are required. This \nstudy, which is supposed to be the basis of our strategic airlift \ncapability requirements, identified the need for between 292 and 383 \nstrategic airlift aircraft, a combination of C-17s and modernized C-5s. \nIn the force today, we have 111 C-5s and 205 C-17s--a total of 315 \naircraft--near the bottom of the requirement level. But that doesn't \ntell the whole story.\n  In the last Quadrennial Defense Review in 2006, the Defense \nDepartment opted to keep its total inventory near the bottom of this \nrequirement range with 180 C-17s and 112 C-5s.\n  Although we have added C-17s since that time and lost one C-5, the \nmore important fact is that the QDR based this recommendation on a plan \nto modernize all 112 C-5s. With the plan to only modernize 52 C-5s, the \nairlift capability of the fleet is drastically diminished.\n  In 2008, the commander of the Air Force Air Mobility Command \nexpressed his concern with this plan. He testified that the plan with \n52 modernized C-5s and 205 C-17s will not provide the strategic airlift \nthat he required.\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\n  I would also note that these earlier studies did not take into \naccount today's force structure. That is a very important point. Since \nthe mobility study and the QDR were completed we have transformed our \nArmy creating additional combat capability that requires lift. We have \nincreased the end strength of our Marine Corps, and we have created the \nU.S. Africa command. All of these have increased our airlift needs.\n  At the same time, operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are aging our \nairlift fleet beyond anticipated rates. We are flying the wings off our \nC-17 fleet. In November, 2007, the Air Force Chief of Staff recommended \nbuying an additional 44 C-17s to meet the required force level. On the \n2009 Unfunded Requirements List the Air Force asked for an additional \n15 C-17 aircraft with a stated inventory objective of 248 C-17s. Our \nmilitary leaders have called for additional aircraft, our forces have \ngrown since our last studies were written and our plans have been \naltered to cut back on our modernization program.\n  It seems to me that notwithstanding the plan offered by the Defense \nDepartment, the country has a choice--we can either agree to modernize \nall the C-5s or we can continue to procure additional C-17s. As noted \nearlier, as the GAO discovered a new C-17 offers greater capability at \na lower price. To me and to many of my colleagues this just makes \nsense.\n  Unless we act this year and approve the recommendation from the \nAppropriations Committee, we won't have a choice. Without the funds in \nthis bill the C-17 program will begin to shut down. I say to my \ncolleagues this is a critical decision and we have to be certain on our \ncourse. As the GAO noted, ``careful planning is needed to ensure C-17 \nproduction is not ended prematurely . . . Restarting production would \nnot be feasible or cost effective.'' That is the GAO.\n  Earlier this decade, on several occasions the Defense Department \nurged the Congress to allow it to begin to retire the oldest and least \ncapable C-5s. It too believed that purchasing additional C-17s was a \nfar superior choice to meet our airlift needs. However, each year the \nCongress refused to allow DoD to retire any C-5s. Eventually, the \nPentagon gave up trying and decided it would be stuck with the old \nunreliable C-5s. While it originally sought to upgrade all the old C-5s \nto at least make the best of a bad situation, the cost overruns and \ndelays in the C-5 modernization program made that decision \nunaffordable. I would point out that the Congress rectified this \nproblem this year in the supplemental and allowed the Air Force to \nbegin to retire these aged aircraft. We know that it makes economical \nsense to retire these poorly performing aircraft and to replace them \nwith new C-17s. We are looking forward to the Air Force revisiting this \nissue in the fiscal year 2011 budget with a renewed plan to retire the \nolder C-5s and hopefully a desire to replace them with new C-17s.\n  In this year's budget the Secretary of Defense has made some tough \ndecisions'' He has opted to kill the F-22, the JSF second engine, the \nVH-71 Presidential helicopter, the combat search and rescue helicopter \nand the kinetic energy interceptor. In the bill before the Senate we \nhave supported each of these recommendations. I will be candid that I \nam not confident that each of these recommendations is in our Nation's \ninterest, but in general I support the Secretary's plans.\n  There is only one program that the vice chairman and I felt strongly \nenough about to reverse the recommendation of the Secretary, the C-17.\n  I have explained at some length why, it is cost effective, it is \ncapable, and it is needed. I urge all my colleagues to reject the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona and to vote to support the \ncontinuation of the C-17 program.\n  It is in our Nation's interest.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2484\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask the current amendment be set aside \nand we call up amendment No. 2484.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2484.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Prohibiting use of funds to fund the Association of Community \n                 Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       On page 263, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n       Sec. 9__.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be distributed to the Association of Community \n     Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or its subsidiaries.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to present amendment No. 2484. \nActually, this is an amendment we have acted on in previous \nappropriations bills. In fact, this is the amendment that deals with no \nfunding for the organization ACORN.\n  In the previous Interior bill this passed in a very bipartisan way \nwith a 85-to-11 vote; in the Housing and Transportation bill, again a \nvery bipartisan vote, 83 to 7.\n  This is an amendment that has overwhelming support of this body. My \ncomments relative to this organization are a matter of the record. I do \nnot feel a need to lay those out again, but I want to present this \namendment on this appropriations bill and we have reached an \nunderstanding that this can be accepted by voice vote. I want to \nindicate that will be acceptable to me.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2484) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is \nthe DOD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This measure contains \napproximately $636 billion, including nearly $130 billion to continue \nthe fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and all around Southwest \nAsia.\n  It contains funds to pay our men and women in uniform, as well as \nfunds to operate our forces and to take care of our wounded. It \nprovides the money required to equip the warfighters and to develop new \nweapons systems so that they may be protected in the future.\n  Today is September 29. The fiscal year ends tomorrow. I believe all \nof us should know that. On Thursday, the Department of Defense will \nbegin to operate on a continuing resolution, a stopgap measure required \nbecause the Congress has not completed action on its 12 appropriations \nmeasures.\n  I want to point out that the Appropriations Committee reported its \nfirst fiscal year 2010 bill in the Senate on June 18, more than 3 \nmonths ago, and this last bill on September 10, nearly 3 weeks ago. All \nof the other bills were reported before the August recess.\n  However, because of the scheduling problems we have had, this Senate \nhas passed just six bills. We have spent the better part of 7 weeks on \nthe floor to pass these bills. I wish to note that in years past, most \nappropriations measures were taken up and passed by this body in 1 or 2 \ndays. Now it is nearly 1 week on each bill. The Senate is known for \nbeing a deliberative body, but this is the third day the Senate has \nbeen on this important bill, and up until a few minutes ago, not a \nsingle amendment had yet to be offered.\n  Moreover, at this point, only eight amendments have been filed, and \nwe have seen this pattern week after week. Our colleagues are waiting \ndays before getting serious about these bills. The impact of these \ndelays is that the end of the fiscal year is upon us, and\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nwe are nearly only halfway done completing Senate action on our bills, \nand only one of the 12 bills has reported out of conference committee.\n  At this juncture, I wish to note that we have had 12 measures. Of the \n12 subcommittees, 3 reported the bill to the Senate on a vote of 29 to \n1--not quite unanimous, 29 to 1. The remaining nine subcommittee bills, \nafter due deliberation, debate, and discussion, were passed on to the \nSenate. The Senate committee reported to this Senate with a \nrecommendation that it be passed by a vote of 30 to 0.\n  This measure before us was adopted by the Appropriations Committee, \nmade up of liberal members, conservative members, middle of the road \nand whatever you want, men, women, by a vote of 30 to 0.\n  In January, when I became chairman of this committee, it was apparent \nto me that the Senate and the legislative branch were losing control \nover the budget process. We had not passed all of our spending bills as \nfreestanding measures since 2005. We only accomplished that feat once \nduring the past decade.\n  In many cases, we have resorted to large omnibus bills to complete \nour work. The Senate has not been allowed to debate or amend many of \nthe measures that were passed. This is no way to run the government.\n  Vice-Chairman Cochran and I agreed to put a stop to this practice. We \nvowed to pass 12 bills and to send them to the President \nindividually. We have passed those 12 bills in a timely fashion and \npresented them to the Senate. Our leaders fully supported us in this \nplan.\n\n  I remind my colleagues that the entire Republican caucus sent a \nletter to the majority leader urging him to follow this approach. But \nwhen it came to putting this in practice, instead of working to get \nthis accomplished, we have been hamstrung by slow progress on each and \nevery bill.\n  We are well aware that Members have amendments they wish to have \nconsidered on this and other appropriations bills. We understand that \nand have been waiting to debate them. Senator Cochran and I came to the \nfloor Thursday night but were told there was nothing to do. We came \nhere on Friday morning with the same results. We are back this \nafternoon, and we have one amendment.\n  The go-slow approach that has been taken by a few of our colleagues \nhas put us in a position in which the government must now begin to \noperate on a continuing resolution. What does that mean to our \nagencies? It means they must throw out their plans for operations and \nstreamline activities so that only the most essential operations are \nfunded. Continuing resolutions will continue programs that have expired \nand are no longer needed, and the new programs that will replace them \nwill not be in place. It means they must delay purchases until they are \nsure the resources they are seeking will be approved.\n  In the case of the Defense Department, it means they have to delay \nstarting new weapons development and procurement programs. Some of my \nfiscally conservative colleagues might applaud this, thinking it means \nthey are cutting spending. But, unfortunately, they are wrong. In fact, \nwe are only running up expenses, as we follow penny-wise, pound-foolish \npractices which cost more in the long run than they save.\n  Senate rules are written to protect the rights of the minority and to \nensure that legislation is carefully reviewed. But it is also true that \nwhen time is of the essence, the deliberative process is frequently \nturned on its head and complex matters rushed through with no time to \ndebate or opportunity to offer amendments. Rather than delay these \nbills, which have minimal controversy, leaving the body no choice but \nto adopt expedited procedures to complete action, let's proceed apace \nand get this and the other five bills through the Senate as quickly as \npossible because it is the responsibility of the Congress to ensure \nthat taxpayer funds can be expended efficiently by passing each of \nthese appropriations measures without depending on continuing \nresolutions or omnibus measures.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to work with us so we can complete our \nwork, the work of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes to address \nthe pending amendment, if I may. Then, at the conclusion of those \nremarks, I wish to speak as if in morning business for a few minutes to \naddress another matter that will not be the subject of the pending \nlegislation, if that is permissible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend and colleague from Arizona that could wipe out a \nhighly skilled American workforce. It would irreparably damage our \ncombat readiness, deprive our troops in the field of critical resources \nand threaten our national security. Those are strong words, but that is \nwhat is involved if the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nArizona is adopted.\n  I wish to introduce my colleagues to three workers at Pratt & Whitney \nin Middletown, CT. We see three individuals working on this engine. \nThey are removing test equipment after completing testing on a \npowerful, cutting-edge engine, preparing it for delivery to the U.S. \nAir Force. The man on the left is Doug. He has been working for Pratt & \nWhitney for 24 years. He is married with three children, 8-year-old \ntwins and a 4-year-old.\n  The man in the middle is Steve. He spent 4 years in the Air Force \nbefore coming to Pratt & Whitney and boasts a quarter of a century in \naviation experience. On the right is his coworker Michael, with 15 \nyears of experience on the floor and 8 as a supervisor at this \nfacility. If we effectively lay off these workers and the 30,000 \nAmericans like them in 43 States who build the C-17, we will be causing \ntremendous pain and financial hardship at a time when our communities \ncan least afford it.\n  In my home State of Connecticut--29th in total population, but 6th in \ntotal aerospace employment--we just received word that Pratt & Whitney \nis going to close maintenance facilities in Cheshire, CT, and East \nHartford, CT, costing 1,000 jobs. If this amendment prevails, my \nState's largest private employer tells me that they will stand to lose \nanother 3,000 jobs. That means the loss of decades of experience and \nexpertise that has allowed us to maintain not parity with the world, \nbut superiority, in the aerospace industry.\n  Perhaps my colleagues aren't persuaded by the imminent loss of \nthousands of jobs in my state or even their own. Perhaps some might be \ntempted to threaten the livelihoods of 30,000 people at a time when we \ncan ill afford it. To them I say, think about these three individuals \nare doing for our troops.\n  According to the Air Force, over the last 3 years in the military's \nCentral Command alone, the C-17 has flown more than 100,000 airlift \nsorties, moved more than 2 million personnel, delivered nearly 300,000 \ntons of cargo, and executed nearly 2,000 air drops. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, C-17s have delivered more than 2.4 \nmillion tons of cargo to Iraq and Afghanistan alone. That is 2.4 \nmillion tons of supplies--everything from critical gear to large \nvehicles--sustaining our troops on the battlefield.\n  The Government Accountability Office also notes that this aircraft \nhas ``drawn praise during combat operations''--listen to this--with an \n86-percent readiness rate, compared to the 53-percent readiness rate of \nthe 40-year-old C-5 fleet that shares the cargo lift mission with the \nC-17s. The C-17 is the most reliable airlift plane in our arsenal, and \nit is also the most versatile. Unlike any other aircraft we have, the \nC-17 can complete combat, humanitarian, and other transport missions \nall over the world, thanks to its unique ability to take off and land \nin difficult environments, in remote airfields, or in situations where \nrunways are shortened or degraded.\n  The Air Force reports that the C-17 is able to take off and land on \n65 percent of the world's soils, whereas older airlift planes can only \nland on 6 percent.\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\nThis incredible versatility makes the C-17 vital to the success of \ncounterinsurgency, humanitarian, and research missions the world over. \nIt can operate not only in Iraq and Afghanistan, but in places such as \nBosnia, Rwanda, Sudan, and even Antarctica.\n  But today I feel this versatility is taken for granted. Our \ncommitments overseas, especially since 2001, have imposed far greater \nburdens on these aircraft than we had originally planned for.\n  The Congressional Research Service reports that the C-17 was designed \nto fly 1,000 hours per year, with an expected lifespan of 30 years. But \nas our overseas commitments have grown since 2001, the fleet has \naveraged 1,250 hours per aircraft and some have even reached 2,400 \nflying hours in a single year.\n  GEN Arthur Lichte, the Air Force's air mobility commander, has said \nthat at this rate, the C-17s may have a lifespan as short as 22 years. \nWhen a mission-critical aircraft is due to retire 8 years earlier than \nintended, as this one may be, we who are charged with equipping our \ntroops in the field must address our procurement plans and we must do \nit now. Some of our newest C-17s are already 15 years old.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that last July the Senate voted 93 to \n1 to authorize the expansion of the Army by 30,000 soldiers. I, along \nwith nearly all of my colleagues, supported that increase to meet our \ngrowing security demands and relieve the combat burden on our already \noverstretched forces. When we took that vote, we incurred an obligation \nas well to provide those troops with the support they will need in \norder to do their jobs.\n  Chairman Inouye and the members of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee have demonstrated incredible foresight by acting quickly to \nprevent these future shortfalls in this very important fleet. If this \namendment to undo their good work prevails, we are doing a disservice \nto our troops. We are also doing a great disservice to our taxpayers.\n  The author of this amendment has said we should kill the C-17 now and \nwait for a government study down the road to see whether we need more \nof these aircraft. Well, if we kill the C-17, we will lose our only \nwide-body assembly line in the United States. According to the \nGovernment Accountability Office, it will cost up to $1 billion to \nrestart the line when it inevitably dawns on us that we need additional \nmilitary cargo planes to support our troops in the field. If we hand \nthese three individuals and the 30,000 of their fellow workers around \nthe country pink slips in the next few days, who do we think is going \nto build those planes down the road?\n  By the way, if we choose to try to make up the capability by \nextending the lives of the C-5As, we would need to overhaul and repair \nseven of them at a cost of nearly $1 billion to equal the capability we \nwould get from buying just one additional C-17 at a cost of $276 \nmillion.\n  This amendment would hurt our workers, our troops, and our national \nsecurity. It is a massive expenditure disguised as a short-term \nsavings. It is the very definition of cutting off our nose to spite our \nface when it comes to the critical needs of our troops in the field. \nWhatever views one may have on Afghanistan or Iraq, we want to make \nsure that our troops, wherever they are, receive the support they need.\n  Today, when the vote occurs, I urge my colleagues to support the \ncommittee and reject the amendment to cut out these critical aircraft.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to move to a matter \nother than the one I just discussed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it has been a tumultuous year in Iran.\n  The Iranian regime has continued to pursue its nuclear ambitions, \nfund terrorist activities throughout the Middle East, and repress its \nown people. The world watched this repression play out in the wake of \nthis summer's illegitimate elections, when brave and peaceful \nprotestors were violently attacked.\n  If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons capability, it would pose a \nsignificant threat to peace and security in the Middle East, especially \nto our close ally Israel and others in the region.\n  For years, the Iranian regime has refused reasonable requests by the \ninternational community. And it has failed to meet its obligations \nunder international nonproliferation rules.\n  That is a threat to both national security and global stability, and \nit cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged.\n  President Obama has undertaken an aggressive dual-track approach. He \nhas offered high-level engagement with Tehran, but has matched that \ncarrot with the stick of sustained pressure through economic sanctions. \nAs the President has warned, Iran won't be allowed to run out the \nclock.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I intend to introduce \nlegislation that will arm the administration with the ability to impose \ntough, targeted sanctions if Iran does not respond to our final \ndiplomatic efforts in the coming weeks.\n  We must confront Iran's government with its long record of duplicity \nand deception on the issue of its nuclear facilities.\n  Last week, President Obama revealed that Iran is building a secret \nuranium enrichment facility in violation of international rules.\n  The President and our allies have rightly insisted that IAEA \ninspectors be allowed to access this facility promptly. And over the \nweekend, Iran moved forward on provocative missile tests.\n  In two days, the United States and our allies will begin key talks \nwith Iran's leaders. Unfortunately, Iran's President has already \nsuggested that appropriate limits to his country's nuclear enrichment \nprogram are off the table.\n  Clearly, in light of this growing threat, there is cause for great \nconcern and prompt action on our part.\n  But there is also cause for hope that Iran might be forced to change \ncourse. We have received renewed support from our allies. We have been \nencouraged by the strong international rejection of election abuses. \nAnd we have seen tensions within the Iranian regime begin to break into \nthe open.\n  It is not too late for a proper resolution. But the road ahead is \ndifficult. It will require sustained diplomatic effort to ensure all of \nour strategic partners--the Europeans, the Russians, the Chinese, the \nIndians and moderate Arab states throughout the Middle East join this \neffort.\n  We will only succeed if Iran is confronted by the prospect of \nsustained, progressively intensifying multilateral economic and \ndiplomatic pressure on its government including tougher sanctions.\n  This week's negotiations should confront Iran's leaders with a clear \nchoice: end its illegitimate efforts to enrich uranium, halt its \nproliferation efforts, and stop supporting terrorists around the \nworld--or continue to deepen this regime's isolation, and ruin the \nIranian economy.\n  The administration is right to attempt engagement with Iran even as \nwe make clear that biting sanctions will follow if international \ndemands for greater transparency continue to meet with stubborn \nrefusal.\n  Administration officials have outlined to me a menu of additional \ntough multilateral sanctions that they are considering imposing. \nCongress must equip President Obama with a full range of tools to deal \nwith the threats posed by Iran.\n  In the last Congress, the Banking Committee approved comprehensive \nlegislation to impose tough new sanctions on the Iranian regime; \nauthorize investors to divest from companies active in Iran's energy \nsector; and combat black-market networks spreading weapons around the \nworld. Unfortunately, floor consideration was repeatedly blocked by a \nsmall minority.\n  Given the rising stakes, I intend to work with my committee \ncolleagues, including Ranking Member Senator Shelby, to press forward \nsimilar sanctions legislation in the next few weeks.\n  I want to congratulate Senators Lieberman and Bayh for their \nleadership on this issue, including their legislation to impose further \nsanctions on entities involved in importing gasoline to Iran or in \nassisting Iran's efforts to expand its domestic refining capacity.\n  Iran's energy sector is a key source of revenue to the government--\nand Iran is especially susceptible because of its dependence on \nimported gasoline. I will integrate these critical provisions into the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\n  Our legislation will be targeted and strategic, maximizing the \neconomic leverage of the U.S., our partners and allies, and investors \nwhile avoiding the risks of a more indiscriminate approach.\n  The bill would also expand coverage under the Iran Sanctions Act to \ninclude financial institutions, underwriters, guarantors, and other \nbusiness entities, and extend the applicability of sanctions to oil and \ngas pipelines and tankers.\n  It would impose a broad ban on direct imports from Iran to the U.S. \nand exports from the U.S. to Iran of those few items still able to be \nso shipped, exempting food and medicines.\n  It will strengthen existing authority to freeze the assets of \nIranians active in weapons proliferation or terrorist activity, and \nmake it clear that U.S. entities who establish a subsidiary to get \naround sanctions laws will be held liable for the activities of their \nsubsidiaries.\n  Finally, it would impose new requirements that the President actually \nmake a determination, and report every 6 months to Congress, regarding \nthe sanctionability of eligible investments in Iran's energy sector.\n  In addition to expanding U.S. sanctions, the bill would also \nestablish a simple formula authorizing divestment from firms which \ninvest significant amounts in Iran's energy sector, with provisions \npatterned after the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act enacted 2 \nyears ago.\n  Many of us believe that Americans should be able to divest from \nenergy firms doing business with the Iranian regime whose policies they \nabhor, and which indirectly help to prop up the regime.\n  They should be given the tools they need to make socially responsible \ndecisions. And investors who choose to divest--States, large pension \nand mutual funds, and others should be held harmless for these \ndecisions. Investing in Iran is risky business, and investors should be \nfully informed of those risks going in. The bill does not require \ndivestment; it simply permits it.\n  Finally, this bill will provide incentives for countries to \nstrengthen their export control systems to stop the illegal diversion \nof sensitive dual-use technology to countries like Iran, and impose \ntough new licensing requirements on those who refuse to cooperate.\n  As we confront the realities of a global marketplace, with \nmanufacturers assembling parts of complex machinery such as aircraft \nand computers from a supply chain spanning the globe, and as regimes \nlike Iran, North Korea, and Syria trawl various trans-shipment hubs for \nsuch parts to assemble high-tech weapons, it makes sense to address \nthis problem head-on.\n  We have developed a way to do this, with an array of carrots and \nsticks to prod unwilling countries to get serious about developing and \nimplementing tough, comprehensive export control rules and systems.\n  Our allies continue to work closely with the US to increase economic \nand diplomatic pressure on Iran.\n  I believe our legislation will complement and reinforce those ongoing \ndiplomatic efforts, and send a clear signal to Iran's government of \nwhat's in store if they continue to flaunt the will of the \ninternational community.\n  Congress will be moving forward on the same timetable that the \nPresident and our allies have set for this fall, to underscore to \nIran's leaders the huge price they will pay economically, politically, \ndiplomatically, and otherwise if they do not change course.\n  The government of Iran must come clean on its nuclear program, which \nas President Obama observed last week represents a direct challenge to \nthe basic foundation of the international nonproliferation regime. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting efforts in the coming \nweeks to make clear to the Iranians that we in Congress stand with \nPresident Obama in our determination to confront this problem \nforcefully, and urgently, before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, we will have our hearing on October 6 in the Senate \nBanking Committee. My intention is to, shortly thereafter, a week or \nso, combine the proposals offered into one strong, comprehensive \nsanctions bill. I, as well as others, believe we should take no options \noff the table and that we understand the implications of the statement.\n  Most of us agree every effort ought to be made to resolve this matter \nshort of the use of military force. Obviously, that option remains. I \nbelieve we are proposing a sanctions regime, along with the needed \ncooperation of other nations around the world, that will send an \nunequivocal message--and nothing would be more important at this hour \nthan to send that clear united message from this body and the other \nbody--of our determination to use all the tools available to us to \nbring about the desired change we seek.\n  By adopting this strong legislation, my hope is they will understand \nhow serious we are in our determination to achieve the common goal \nsought by the administration and us in this body.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise with respect to Iran's nuclear \nprogram. I commend the Senator from Connecticut, chairman of the \nBanking Committee, for his presentation a few moments ago. Similar to \nso many Americans, we have learned a lot in the last couple days that \nis troubling.\n  The Iranian regime, discredited this summer by the deplorable \nrepression of peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators across the country, \nhas reached a new low on the international stage. Again, I speak of the \nIranian regime--the Government--and not the people of Iran. The \ndisclosure of the uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qum \nshould serve as a wakeup call for those who believed Iran's nuclear \nprogram was only for peaceful purposes. The regime continues to deceive \nthe international community about its nuclear intentions and program \ndevelopment. It continues to threaten our ally Israel; it continues to \ndisregard its international commitments; and, yes, the regime continues \nto directly threaten the national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  As the administration begins talks on Thursday, we in the Senate \nshould be prepared to do our part and pass tougher sanctions on the \nIranian regime to compel its compliance with international standards. \nWe have a responsibility to provide the administration with the tools \nit needs to maximize pressure on this increasingly intransigent Iranian \nregime.\n  I applaud the administration's approach to recalibrating U.S. \nengagement around the world. At a minimum, this international effort \nwill restore America's long-held reputation of being an honest broker, \nof a country that values diplomacy and relationships with allies and \nwelcomes new ones. Internationally, the United States is on a better \nfooting than it has been in years. Ties with allies have been \nstrengthened. Those on the fence, such as Russia and China, in this \nparticular question, are showing signs of cooperation on issues that \nare critical to our national interests. Our adversaries, not sure how \nto demonize the United States such as they used to do, are on their \nheels. The administration's diplomatic offensive has put us into a \nposition where we have a strong coalition going into these important \ndiscussions on Thursday.\n  The events of the last week are unfortunate evidence of the Iranian \nregime's deceit, defiance, and disregard for international standards \nfor peace and security.\n  First, on Monday, the Iranian regime sent a letter to the IAEA \ndisclosing the existence of the second enrichment and refining \nfacility, a site that the United States and Israeli intelligence \nreportedly have tracked for years. This missive denies that the site \nwas intended for nuclear purposes, though the 3,000 centrifuges were \nclearly meant for weapons-grade refinement. Moreover, the site was \nburied deep underground and under protection by the elite Revolutionary \nGuard--not the typical protocol for a peaceful energy site.\n\n  On Wednesday, the Iranian President, Mr. Ahmadinejad, used his time \non the rostrum at the United Nations not to welcome a new day of \nengagement with the international community but in typical fashion to \nrail against Israel. This desperate attempt to divert attention from \nhis own internal political\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nproblems, as well as his government's deceitful nuclear program, once \nagain showed this regime is not a responsible actor on the world's \nstage. Iran's people recognized this last June by voting against Mr. \nAhmadinejad and his brand of politics. The world witnessed on live \ntelevision how Mr. Ahmadinejad viewed the democratic process as his \npeople paid dearly for the audacity of their vote.\n  Finally, over the weekend, Iran's news service reported three rounds \nof missile tests, including those capable of hitting Israel. GEN \nHossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guard Air Force, said the \ndrills were meant to show that Tehran is prepared to crush any military \nthreat from another country. This erratic display will actually weaken, \nnot strengthen, Iran's hand in Geneva and will hopefully serve to \nconvince our Russian and Chinese friends that the Iranian regime is not \na credible actor nor a reliable trading partner.\n  After this disturbing but strangely predictable week of Iranian \nregime behavior, American negotiators will head to Geneva. This is the \nfirst official and direct meeting with Iranian negotiators in 30 years. \nLeading the American delegation is Ambassador Bill Burns, one of \nAmerica's most respected diplomats. Having served in Russia, Ambassador \nBurns is well placed to address the complex international dimensions to \nthis diplomatic problem. We will be well represented in Geneva, and I \nwish Ambassador Burns and his team all the best in what will surely be \na challenging assignment.\n  Iran is not going into these negotiations on sure footing, while the \ninternational community has never been more united. Led by the United \nStates, Britain, Germany, and France, opposition to Iran's nuclear \nprogram is based in fact, rooted in a willingness to engage, and backed \nup with a clear and firm message: An Iran with nuclear weapons is \nunacceptable under any circumstances. Let me repeat. An Iran with \nnuclear weapons is unacceptable under any circumstances.\n  This message is gaining stronger resonance with Russia and China. The \nRussian President's comments at the University of Pittsburgh last week \nindicated a willingness to consider sanctions. This is a potentially \nremarkable breakthrough because if the Russians are willing to support \ninternational sanctions, the Chinese could be left alone among the P5+1 \ngroup in that determination. While China relies on Iran for substantial \nfuel imports, I trust they are carefully weighing their need for energy \nagainst Iran's increasingly erratic and irresponsible behavior. The \nopportunity cost of doing business with this regime has increased \nconsiderably and may now be too high a price to pay. I hope the Chinese \nwill support international efforts to pressure this Iranian regime at \nthis critical time with the understanding that these efforts could \nultimately result in a more reliable and stable partner in Tehran.\n  It is next to impossible that the Iranian regime will be able to \nprove that its nuclear sites are for peaceful purposes by this \nThursday. The Obama administration needs to be ready to move quickly \nand build on international momentum created over the past week to \npressure this regime. That is why we in the Senate need to be ready to \nplay our part, support the administration, and move on sanctions.\n  We currently have two proposals on Iran pending before us. First, the \nIran Sanctions Enabling Act is a measure introduced by Senator \nBrownback and myself. We introduced this bill last May. This would \nallow State and local government pension funds to divest from companies \nthat do more than $20 million in business with the Iranian energy \nsector. The second bill, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, \nintroduced by Senators Bayh and Kyl, explicitly empowers the President \nto impose new economic sanctions on foreign firms involved in the \nexport of gasoline and other refined petroleum products to the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. I am cosponsor of this bill, along with more than 75 \nof my Senate colleagues.\n  The Iran Sanctions Enabling Act is modeled on similar legislation \npassed in response to the genocide in Sudan. Eighteen State \nlegislatures have passed individual Iran sanction measures, and our \nlegislation would bring these State efforts into line with Federal law. \nWhen President Obama was in the Senate, he introduced an earlier \nversion of this legislation. It was right in 2007, and it is right in \n2009.\n  Analysts have estimated that Iran requires $20 billion annually in \ninvestments for its oil and natural gas sector. This sector directly \nprovides funding for Iran's nuclear program, as well as its support for \ninternational terrorism. Iran will only cease its illicit nuclear \nprogram, end its support for terrorists in Hamas and Hezbollah, and \nstop arming militant groups in Iraq when it is compelled to pay an \neconomic price.\n  We are entering a critical phase in President Obama's strategy of \nengagement with Iran where Tehran will face a true test. I hope the \nOctober 1 negotiation will lead to a freeze in Iran's nuclear \nenrichment efforts and ultimately a nuclear weapons-free Iran. Will the \nregime accept the President's genuine offer of dialog and comply with \ninternational nuclear standards or will it continue a losing strategy \nthat serves to deepen its own isolation? These are questions for the \nIranian regime, and they must answer these questions.\n  If last week is any indication, Congress should be prepared to hand \nthe President the leverage he needs to send a message to the regime \nthat America cannot and will not accept an Iran with nuclear weapons. \nThe administration needs all the tools at its disposal to increase \npressure on the regime diplomatically, politically, and through more \nstringent economic sanctions.\n  I call on my colleagues to listen to legislatures in so many States \nacross the country that have passed divestment measures already. The \nAmerican people do not want anything to do with investing in this \nregime. Let's pass divestment and petroleum sanctions and send a \nmessage to this regime and to the international community that a \nnuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2558\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, earlier, the Senator from Arizona raised \nconcerns that the Committee on Appropriations had reduced funding in \nthe operation and maintenance accounts. As I noted in my opening \nstatement, this committee of ours reviews the entire budget and adjusts \nfunds based on that review. That review came out with various results, \nand I would like to discuss some of them with you.\n  Before I do the analysis, I would just point out to my colleagues the \nbudget that we are considering at this moment was formulated about a \nyear ago--a year ago. That is when the process began. I am certain all \nof us will agree that since that time much has changed. Therefore, the \ncommittee believed we owe it to the Senate to apply the funds we \nrecommended where they are most needed at this moment, not where they \nwere needed a year ago.\n  For example, the reductions to operations and maintenance programs we \nrecommended are based on a lack of justification or of changed \nrequirements. The funds are not reduced because of a need to transfer \nfunding to other appropriations.\n  The Senator from Arizona suggested we are taking out certain funding \nto pay for earmarks. The O accounts--operation and maintenance \naccounts--were reduced in this fiscal year 2010 base budget for many \nreasons, and just let me explain a few.\n  Five hundred million dollars, or half a billion dollars, was not a \ncut as suggested by the Senator from Arizona, but it was, rather, a \ntransfer from the base budget request to the overseas contingency \noperations budget because the resources for certain programs were more \nappropriately funded for the Iraq and Afghanistan war. This is what \nthey suggested.\n  One hundred million dollars was reduced based on administrative \nsavings proposals. In April of this year the Office of Management and \nBudget was directed by the President to work with agencies to identify \ncuts to their administrative budgets separate and apart from those \nidentified by the fiscal year 2010 budget--beyond that.\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\n  The DOD savings identified by the administration was $100 million in \nfiscal year 2010, and we allocated these funds to other worthy \nprojects.\n  Finally, $100 million was cut from the Security and Stabilization \nProgram because that was not authorized by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, we do this type of review every year. Every year \nsomeone complains their programs are cut, but we stand by our \nrecommendations. We do more to enhance the readiness of the forces in \nthis bill than was requested. Keep in mind since this budget was \ndrafted, we have requested and added 30,000 more troops. We do so by \nproviding equipment to our National Guard and Reserves. Everyone \nsupports the National Guard, but we give them secondhand tools. It is \nabout time they got some good ones. We do so by applying resources to \nbuy MRAPs to protect our troops. And, yes, we do so to buy more C-17s \nto carry our forces wherever our leaders send them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the McCain amendment that would \nstrike the $2.5 billion in additional funding for C-17 aircraft in the \ncommittee-reported bill and restore serious cuts that were made in the \nreadiness accounts, in part to shift funds to support continued C-17 \nproduction.\n  Terminating production, like closing a base, can involve some \neconomic loss for the communities involved. It involves pain--we \nunderstand that--up close and personal. But we must do so from time to \ntime and make these difficult decisions. We have to do that for what is \nbest for the Nation and for the men and women in the Armed Forces \nbecause, as Secretary Gates said in a letter to me today expressing \nsupport for ending C-17 production: The Department does not need \nadditional C-17s to meet strategic needs.\n  First, I want to agree with Chairman Inouye that the C-17 is a fine \naircraft. I have been a strong supporter of the C-17 program, even when \nit was having growing pains early in the program. If we did not already \nhave a C-17 aircraft fleet, we would have to create one. But this is \nnot a question of whether we should buy the C-17. We have bought them, \nfor a total of 213 aircraft. It is a question of ``How many C-17s do we \nneed?''\n  On that very point, I wrote a letter to the current Chief of Staff of \nthe Air Force, General Schwartz, who was then commander of the U.S. \nTransportation Command, on November 6, 2007.\n  I had asked for his professional opinion as to whether we needed C-17 \naircraft beyond the 190 C-17 aircraft the Air Force had already bought, \nand he gave us his personal and professional opinion. He said:\n\n       Since you asked for my personal and professional opinion, I \n     believe that 205 C-17s and 111 C-5s is the correct fleet mix \n     for the future.\n\n  He explained how he reached that opinion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to General \nSchwartz and his letter to me be printed in the Record, and also a \nletter I received from Secretary Gates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2007.\n     General Norton A. Schwartz, USAF,\n     Commander, U.S. Transportation Command,\n     Scott AFB, IL.\n       Dear General Schwartz: The conferees on the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 are meeting \n     now to reach agreement on the contents of this bill. One of \n     the issues before the conferees is the question of buying \n     more C-17 aircraft as recommended in the House-passed bill.\n       Before we come to a conclusion on the best way to proceed, \n     we need to hear your personal and professional opinion on two \n     issues: (1) what is your requirement, if any, for C-17 \n     aircraft beyond the 190 C-17 aircraft that the Air Force has \n     already bought; and (2) what is the basis of your \n     requirement, if any, for aircraft beyond the 190 C-17 \n     aircraft that the Air Force has already bought.\n       Due to the urgency of completing our conference, we \n     appreciate receiving your response to these questions no \n     later than 5 p.m., Tuesday, November 6, 2007.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  U.S. Transportation Command,\n\n                       Scott Air Force Base, IL, November 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Sir, thank you for the opportunity to \n     respond to your questions concerning the strategic airlift \n     fleet. I support the programmed strategic airlift fleet of \n     180 C-17s, extended by the Fiscal Year 2007 Bridge \n     Supplemental to 190 aircraft, combined with 111 modernized \n     and reliability improved C-5s. This fleet mix, augmented with \n     the capability of the Civil Reserve Airlift Fleet (CRAF), \n     provides sufficient airlift capacity to meet strategic and \n     operational objectives during large-scale deployments, while \n     supporting other high priority operations and forward \n     deployed forces,\n       However. the outcome of the C-5 modernization program will \n     have a direct impact on the capacity the C-17 will shoulder. \n     Therefore, given the uncertainty surrounding the C-5 \n     modernization program, I cannot recommend terminating C-17 \n     production at this time.\n       Since you asked for my personal and professional opinion, I \n     believe 205 C-17s and 111 C-5s is the correct fleet mix for \n     the future. I reach this opinion by combining the analysis of \n     available million-ton-miles per day (MTM/D) capability, fleet \n     mission capable rates, the annual flying hour program, \n     average cost per flying hour, total number of organic \n     aircraft tails, available pallet capacity, and average age of \n     the fleet. Taking these factors together, I personally \n     conclude 205/111 is the sweet spot.\n       My top airlift priority, however, remains the \n     recapitalization of our aging tanker fleet. The KC-X will not \n     only fulfill its primary refueling role, but will multiply \n     our transportation options. The strategic airlift fleet mix \n     should be calibrated as necessary to account for this \n     strategic necessity and to ensure we don't over-build overall \n     organic capacity to the detriment of our commercial partners.\n       Thank you for considering my input on these very important \n     issues. And as always, thank you for the outstanding \n     leadership you provide our country and for the excellent \n     support you provide the Armed Forces of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Norton A. Schwartz,\n     General, USAF, Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                  Washington, DC., Sept. 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman,Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing as a follow up to our \n     discussion last week regarding the retirement of strategic \n     airlift aircraft.\n       The Department fully supports the language in Section 311 \n     of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009 (Public Law \n     111-32) which requires a minimum of 292 strategic airlift \n     aircraft as reflected in the Department's 2005 Mobility \n     Capability Study.\n       Since the release of MCS-05, Congress has funded an \n     additional 33 C-17s the Department did not request. The \n     addition of these C-17 aircraft influenced our decision to \n     upgrade only 52 of 111 C-5s with the Reliability Enhancement \n     and Re-engining Program (RERP). Congress is now considering \n     adding another 10 C-17s in the FY2010 budget.\n       The Department's current fleet of 324 aircraft (213 C-17/\n     111 C-5) is in excess of strategic airlift needs, driving \n     increased operating costs at the expense of other priorities. \n     Each C-5A costs over $13 million in annual operating \n     expenses. Since we are over our current requirement by eight \n     aircraft, as determined by the analysis conducted during the \n     C-5 RERP Nunn-McCurdy recertification, it costs the \n     Department over $100 million a year in excess expenditures. \n     These costs will only grow if we receive additional C-17s \n     and/or delay the ability for the Department to retire excess \n     aircraft.\n       Initial indications from Mobility Capability Requirements \n     Study 2016 show the strategic balance will not fundamentally \n     change. This leads me to believe: (1) the Department does not \n     need additional C-17s to meet strategic needs; and (2) the \n     Department needs to begin shedding excess strategic airlift \n     inventory by retiring a portion of the C-5A fleet now. The \n     Department requests your support and authority to allow the \n     proper management of the strategic airlift fleet to meet the \n     Nation's requirements.\n       Thank you for your strong interest and continued support of \n     the Department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for those members of the Senate not \nfamiliar with the phrase ``personal and professional opinion,'' let me \nexplain. In the Armed Services Committee, we require that military \nofficers, appointed to senior positions such as the Transportation \nCommand position, affirm that, when asked for their personal and \nprofessional opinion on any matter, they are obliged to give their own \nopinion, whether that opinion agrees with that of the Secretary of \nDefense, the President, or anyone else in the executive branch.\n  General Schwartz replied to my letter on November 6, 2007:\n\n       Since you asked for my personal and professional opinion, I \n     believe that 205 C-17s and 111 C-5s is the correct fleet mix \n     for the future. I reach that opinion by combining the \n     analysis of available million-tonmiles per day (MTM/D) \n     capability, fleet mission capable rates, the annual flying \n     hour program,\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\n     average cost per flying hour, total number of organic \n     aircraft tails, available pallet capacity. And average age of \n     the fleet. Taking these factors together, I personally \n     conclude 201/111 is the sweet spot.\n\n  It is clear from his letter that General Schwartz and the members of \nTRANSCOM had given serious thought to the question of how many C-17s we \nshould have.\n  More recently, in the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Act, we \nrequired that the Department conduct a Study on Size and Mix of Airlift \nForce. That study was conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses, \nIDA, and was completed in February, 2009. Among the questions that the \nstudy answered were the following:\n  What are the cost and other implications for stopping production of \nthe C-17 line and then restarting it later, if needed?\n\n       Our assessment of the C-17 line shutdown and restart is \n     that continued production, even at low rates, is expensive \n     relative to restart costs. Moreover, under the scenarios and \n     other assumptions considered in this study, additional C-17s \n     were not needed to meet the MCS (Mobility Capability Study) \n     moderate-acceptable-risk delivery rates used as a benchmark \n     by the analyses conducted here. We also found that retiring \n     C-5As to release funds to buy and operate more C-17s is not \n     cost-effective.\n\n  Mr. President, the time has come to stop C-17 production at 213 C-17 \naircraft. That is all we need to buy, that is all we can afford to buy, \nand that is all we should buy.\n  The money that would be freed up by the McCain amendment would be \ntransferred to the operation and maintenance, O, accounts. The bill \ncut roughly $2.4 billion from the budget request. I fear that this \noverall reduction could force the Department to make serious reductions \nin O activities, if not, in fact, forcing the Department to ask for \nanother supplemental funding request. We should do all we can to avoid \nthat possibility.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 3326, the Departments of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $636.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $401.7 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $646 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $1 million below its section 302(b) \nallocation for budget authority and is $28 million below its allocation \nfor outlays.\n  The bill includes $128.2 billion in budget authority designated as \nbeing for overseas deployments and other activities. Pursuant to \nsection 401(c)(4) for the 2010 Budget Resolution, adjustments to the \nAppropriations Committee's section 302(a) allocation and to the 2010 \ndiscretionary spending limits were made for that amount and for the \noutlays flowing therefrom.\n  No budget points of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        H.R. 3326, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.......................................      636,270\n    Outlays................................................      646,043\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority.......................................      636,271\n    Outlays................................................      646,071\nHouse-Passed Bill:-\n    Budget Authority.......................................      636,293\n    Outlays................................................      647,932\nPresident's Request:-\n    Budget Authority.......................................      640,137\n    Outlays................................................      650,641\n \n                    SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority.......................................           -1\n    Outlays................................................          -28\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority.......................................          -23\n    Outlays................................................       -1,889\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority.......................................       -3,867\n    Outlays................................................       -4,598\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: The table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency\n  budget authority (BA) provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations\n  Act (P.L. 111-32) but does include outlays from regular BA designated\n  as being for overseas deployments and other activities.

VIKEN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                      THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Jeffrey L. Viken, of \nSouth Dakota, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as you know, one of the duties granted to \nthe Senate in the Constitution is the advice and consent of judges \nappointed by the President to the bench. The lifetime appointment of a \njudge is a very serious decision, one that has a lasting impact on our \ndemocracy.\n  Today the Senate takes up the nomination of Jeff Viken to be Federal \ndistrict judge for South Dakota. It is this nomination that I wish to \nspeak of today.\n  So far this Congress, under the new President, has confirmed two \njudges. One of those judges is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor \nand the other is a Second Circuit judge. I am proud to have a South \nDakotan as the third judge to be confirmed by the Senate. However, we \nare 9 months into this new administration, and we have only confirmed \ntwo judges.\n  I must say I think the process of nominating and confirming judges \nhas become increasingly overpoliticized. While I believe a President \nshould have some latitude in selecting judges, they should not be \nideologues.\n  Jeff attended law school at my alma mater, the University of South \nDakota, where our attendance overlapped. I received my law degree in \n1975, and Jeff received his law degree in 1977. Jeff has served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney and acting U.S. attorney for South Dakota \nbefore going into private practice. His extraordinary reputation of \nskill and integrity during his years of public and private law practice \nwill translate well and benefit this court. The same can be said of his \ntenure as the Federal Public Defender for North and South Dakota, a job \nhe has held since 2003.\n  Regarding his nomination, Jeff received a ``well qualified'' rating \nfrom the American Bar Association. It is clear he has an accomplished \nresume and many years of public service. It is a great honor that \nPresident Obama has placed on Jeff. We are very fortunate to have a \ngreat member of the South Dakota legal community nominated to this \npost. Jeff has many years of public service, and we look forward to his \nfuture work for the people of South Dakota. Most importantly, his \nnomination to the bench is a victory for justice and the rule of law, \nnot only for South Dakota but for our Nation.\n\n  I have known Jeff for a long time. I find him to be a nominee of good \nmoral character and standing in the community. It is with great \nsatisfaction that I will cast my vote today for the confirmation of \nJeff Viken to be the next U.S. Federal district judge for South Dakota. \nI urge my colleagues to support this very qualified nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Johnson for his comments \nand value his opinion on this nomination. I look forward to seeing this \nnominee confirmed.\n  The confirmation process we have in this country is a very important \nmatter. Our Democratic colleagues are, understandably, inclined to be \nsupportive of whomever the President puts up. It has been a recognized \nresponsibility for the minority party, the party that is not of the \nPresident's party, to ask questions and dig into the backgrounds of \nthese nominees and move the good ones and raise the proper questions if \nthere are problems.\n  Mr. Jeffrey L. Viken has an impressive background. Early in his \ncareer, he was an Assistant and Acting U.S. attorney. He is a member of \nthe trial lawyers plaintiff bar association in South Dakota. He has \nbeen in private practice for 22 years, and for the last 6 years he has \nbeen a Federal Public Defender where he defends criminal cases. So he \nhas been a prosecutor and a public defender. I guess that is a pretty \ngood match, and I am happy we were\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\nable to work out this agreement with the majority and process this \nnomination very quickly. Actually, he was voted out after his first \nappearance before the Committee and is already on the floor.\n  But I would note for some people who say there has been a dragging of \nfeet on the nominations that the President did not send this nomination \nforward, his first district court nominee to the Senate, until June 25, \na few months ago, when the Senate and the Judiciary Committee were \nconsumed with the Supreme Court nomination of now-Justice Sotomayor. \nUnderstandably, Chairman Leahy could not and did not report his \nnomination until after that confirmation process was over, until after \nLabor Day. We were then able to come to a time agreement and also to \nvote on the nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who is a highly able \nnominee but an activist judge with a philosophy too close, by my way of \nthinking, to Justice Brennan on the Supreme Court for whom he clerked. \nSo I think it is healthy for us to ask questions. I voted for Judge \nLynch for the Second Circuit, and he was confirmed by a very large \nvote.\n  We will continue to work with the majority party and the President \nand move the nominees at an appropriate pace.\n  I wanted to note a little bit more about the pace of nominations. You \nknow, it is not possible for the Senate to confirm a nomination until \nthe President has nominated someone. I have heard my colleague, the \nChairman, Senator Leahy, say that we haven't had enough confirmations, \nbut I would note that there is an 11-percent vacancy rate in the \nFederal courts. That is not an extraordinarily high vacancy rate. It \ntakes some time to do background checks and for the President to \nconsider the people he might want to nominate and to consult with \nMembers of the Senate as he does so. I would note that at this moment \nthere are 74 Federal District Court vacancies--Judge Viken is nominated \nfor one--but there are only 9 nominees before the Senate. There are 28 \ncircuit and district court seats that are deemed to be judicial \nemergencies, but only 6 nominees have been submitted to the Senate for \nthose judicial emergency seats. We can't confirm people until they are \nnominated. We can't do a background check on nominees until they have \nbeen nominated. We can't have the information and their records and \ntheir FBI backgrounds and the bar association evaluations take place \nuntil they have been nominated.\n  I would just make my commitment that we will continue to move \nnominees like Mr. Viken in a timely fashion. I reviewed his record. I \nhave also carefully reviewed his responses to questions from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. One of his answers, I have to note, was troubling \nto me. He stated that he believes he fits President Obama's standard \nfor the types of judges he will nominate to the Federal courts; that \nis, he meets the President's ``empathy standard.''\n  President Obama described that standard as follows:\n\n       We need somebody who's got the heart, the empathy, to \n     recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom, the empathy to \n     understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or \n     gay, or disabled, or old. And that's the criteria by which I \n     am going to be selecting my judges.\n\n  In 2005, when then-Senator Obama was in the Senate and he explained \non the floor his vote against Chief Justice John Roberts, who I think \nis one of the finest nominees we have seen in decades and whose \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee was stunning in its \nimpressiveness and his grasp of the legal issues, his comprehensive \nknowledge of how the Court worked, and cases--there was not a case \nbrought up that he didn't seem to fully know about. Virtually every \ncase the Supreme Court had ever written he seemed to be knowledgeable \nabout. It was just a tour de force. Senator Obama voted against Judge \nRoberts and stated that 5 percent of cases are determined by ``one's \ndeepest values and core concerns . . . and the depth and breadth of \none's empathy.'' We can only take this to mean that the President \nbelieves that in 5 percent of all cases, judges should not set aside \ntheir personal beliefs, biases, or experiences. I think this is a \nradical and a dangerous departure from the most important pillar, the \nfundamental pillar of the judicial system--judicial impartiality.\n  Whatever the empathy standard is, it is not law, and we have courts \nof law in this country. Whenever a judge employs his personal beliefs, \nbiases, or experiences to make a decision that favors one party, is it \nnot true that he necessarily has, therefore, disfavored the other party \nas a result of his personal beliefs and biases? For every litigant who \nbenefits from the judge's so-called empathy, there is a litigant who \nloses not on the basis of law but because the judge did not identify \nwith them.\n  When people are nominated to our Federal bench, we ask them to take a \njudicial oath before they take office. The oath embodies the time-\nhonored American tradition of blind justice. The oath says this:\n\n       I . . . do solemnly swear that I will administer justice \n     without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor \n     and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially \n     discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me . . . \n     under the Constitution and laws of the United States, so help \n     me God.\n\n  I am pleased to say the Supreme Court has not yet struck down ``so \nhelp me God'' in the oath, and hopefully they never will. I think the \nPresident's standard for judicial nominees plainly conflicts with that \noath.\n  We have had a big discussion about that, and it is not a little bitty \nmatter. It is not a small matter. Judges take the oath to be impartial. \nI practiced law in Federal court for many years, and I have always \nbelieved and expected that a judge who heard my case would rule on the \nlaw fairly and objectively. If I lost and did not have sufficient law \nor evidence and logic to support my position, I did not expect to \nprevail. That is the kind of concept that underlies American justice.\n  Aside from nominee David Hamilton, almost every one of President \nObama's nominees, including Justice Sotomayor, has rejected outright \nthe empathy standard. So at first blush, I found Mr. Viken's answer \nthat he believes he fits that standard to be concerning. However, his \nanswers to questions we submitted to him for the record provide maybe a \nmore complete view. This is what he said in his answer in writing:\n\n       A judge's consideration of a case must always be governed \n     by impartiality, evenhandedness, attention to the facts \n     presented by the parties, and respect for established law. \n     Empathy is a personal characteristic which may assist a judge \n     in analyzing the human circumstances which bring people \n     before the court. But the law and not the personal \n     experiences of jurists is the path to justice in considering \n     each case.\n\n  I think that is OK. I am not sure how you can have any empathy--\nempathy is a personal characteristic, maybe? I would hate to disagree \nwith the President who nominated me, but that is a pretty good \nstatement overall.\n  He also stated he believes that, ``The role of a Federal district \njudge encompasses diligent legal scholarship''--that is true--``a \nstrong work ethic''--true--``impartial and dispassionate consideration \nof proven facts and reasoned legal arguments, fidelity to binding and \npersuasive precedent, and respect for all who appear before the \ncourt.''\n  I think that is good statement. I think if he will conduct himself on \nthe bench according to those standards he will do well. And I believe \nhe will.\n  I am glad to see he is an honors graduate, but he didn't go to some \nof these schools, Senator Johnson, he went to school in South Dakota; \nhe has practiced law before judges over the years, a lot of practice; \nand in the course of that, you learn that judges really do--the good \njudges--consistently try to reach the right dispassionate result.\n  I think he may have made some statements about empathy that are not \nperfect, but my judgment is that he has been in the courtroom and he \nhas been before good judges. I am hopeful he is going to be a very good \njudge.\n  We will see. I think the issues become even more problematic when \nsomeone is nominated for the Supreme Court or for a circuit court \nbecause those higher courts seem to be the ones who feel less \ncompunction in allowing their personal views to influence cases. \nBecause this nominee is nominated to a seat on the district court and \nis confined not only by the U.S. Supreme Court but also by his circuit, \nthe circuit precedent, and because he stated he believes the role of a \njudge entails the impartial and dispassionate consideration of proven \nfacts and reasoned\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\nlegal arguments, fidelity to binding and persuasive precedent, I would \ncertainly give him the benefit of doubt and vote in favor of his \nnomination. I am hopeful he will follow through on those statements and \nwill interpret the law as written, refraining from imposing personal \nviews in his decision and will basically follow the oath to uphold the \nConstitution, first and foremost. Even if he didn't like it, he should \nuphold it.\n  In closing, I would like to quote from an essay by the former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, which was published \non Constitution Day. He said this:\n\n       The Constitution--its words and their meaning--was \n     established by the people, can only be changed by the people, \n     and is sacredly obligatory upon all government, including \n     judges. That is why in the debate on judicial selection is \n     really a debate over judicial power. It is a debate over \n     whether the Constitution controls judges or judges control \n     the Constitution; over what the Constitution really is, with \n     nothing less than liberty itself at stake.\n\n  I think that is an eloquent statement of the role of a judge, and why \nat its most base level, policy in a democracy must be set by the \nelected branches who are accountable to the people.\n  Judges are supposed to be neutral arbiters of the law, deciding a \ncase based on the law and facts, without allowing their personal, \npolitical, or ideological views or biases to enter into the decision-\nmaking process. That is why they put on a robe, to suggest their \nimpartiality. That is why they take the oath I quoted from. And that is \nthe key ingredient of our legal system, the greatest legal system the \nworld has ever known.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg.) Who yields time? If no one \nyields time, time will be divided equally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Viken nomination is the pending question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman has 17\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, \nand 5\\1/2\\ remains with the vice chairman.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of \nJeffrey Viken for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of South Dakota.\n  President Obama nominated Mr. Viken with the bipartisan support of \nboth Senators from South Dakota, Senator Johnson and Senator Thune. Mr. \nJohnson, the distinguished senior Senator from South Dakota spoke just \na moment ago about his strong support for this nominee.\n  Even though we are almost at the last day of September, this is only \nthe first Senate confirmation for a Federal district court judge, and \nthe first to fill 1 of 74 current Federal trial court vacancies.\n  There are more than 90 current vacancies throughout the Federal \njudiciary, and we are soon going to be at near record levels. I \naccommodated the Ranking Member and other Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee by postponing a hearing on Mr. Viken's nomination while we \nconsidered the recent Supreme Court nomination, or his nomination would \nhave come to the full Senate earlier. But I am pleased that the \ncommittee unanimously reported the nomination at the beginning of this \nmonth by a voice vote. I think that the vote tonight, I can virtually \nguarantee you, will be an overwhelmingly positive vote. I hope it is a \nsign that we might finally, finally start making some progress on \njudicial nominations, and do it expeditiously.\n  The Senate has to do a better job of restoring our tradition of \nregularly considering qualified, noncontroversial nominees to fill \nvacancies on the Federal bench without needless and harmful delays.\n  As I look around this Chamber, I believe I have been here longer than \nanybody else who is presently on the floor. I saw my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Inouye step off the floor, who has served here longer \nthan I have. But I have been here 35 years. I have been here with both \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents. I have never seen a situation \nwhere there is this kind of slow walking of nominations. We have got to \ngo back to the way we have traditionally done it for the good of the \ncountry.\n  I was briefly chairman of the Judiciary Committee during President \nBush's first term. And even though we had the unfortunate experience of \n61 of President Clinton's nominations being pocket filibustered by a \nthen-Republican majority, when I came in during that less than a year \nand a half, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. I \nthink it is an all-time record in speed in getting nominees through. \nThat was by a Democratic majority with a Republican President.\n  I do want to thank the Committee's ranking member, Senator Sessions. \nI see Senator Sessions on the floor. I do want to thank him. I had, as \nI said, agreed to hold back this nominee, the Viken nomination, because \nof the nomination for Sotomayor, to give time to prepare. But I do want \nto thank him. After we confirmed Judge Sotomayor to be a Justice on the \nU.S. Supreme Court, we moved quickly Mr. Viken's nomination through the \ncommittee at our business meeting on September 10 without an \nunnecessary holdover period. Unfortunately, now that it has been on the \nSenate Executive Calendar, it still has taken 2\\1/2\\ weeks to schedule \nSenate approval of a noncontroversial nominee who is probably going to \nbe unanimously confirmed, and should be.\n  Mr. Viken has a wide range of experience. He has been both prosecutor \nand defender. He is currently the Federal Defender for the combined \ndistricts of North Dakota and South Dakota. It is not just the \npopulation, but for those of us who come from New England, the area \ncovered in these districts is enormous.\n  He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and as Acting U.S. Attorney \nfor South Dakota. He spent more than two decades in private practice. \nHis nomination received a rating of ``well qualified,'' from the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. \nI urge Senators to give him a strong bipartisan vote, and then do a \nbetter job of filling the rising number of judicial vacancies to ensure \nthat justice is not delayed or denied to any American because of \noverburdened courts.\n  I hope instead of withholding consent and threatening filibusters of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees, the other side would work together \nto treat his nominees fairly, as I did with President Bush's nominees. \nI point out, by this time in President Bush's first term, we had \nalready confirmed six of his nominations to the Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts. Now, nine months into President Obama's first term, we \nhave confirmed only one of his lower court nominees, despite the fact \nthat President Obama made his first nomination two months earlier than \nPresident Bush did.\n  We can do better. It is not just that the Senate can do better, the \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  After months of delay on September 17, the Senate finally confirmed \nJudge Gerard Lynch to serve on the Second Circuit. I know that circuit \nwell. It covers the States of Vermont, New York, and Connecticut. \nDespite the fact that Judge Lynch's nomination was noncontroversial, \ndespite the fact that it was reported out of the committee unanimously \nwith the strong support of both Republican and Democratic members, it \nstill took more than three months after his nomination was reported by \nthe committee for the Senate to confirm it. Delayed. Delayed. Delayed. \nYou would think there might be some controversy. But when we finally \nvoted, the vote was 94 to 3. It was being held up for months because \nthree Members out of 100 Senators wanted to hold it up? That is not \nbeing responsible. That is not showing the deference to the judiciary \nthat we should show.\n\n  Thirteen nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee remain \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar, seven of them from back \nbefore the last recess. Five of these nominations are for appointments \nto be Assistant Attorneys General at the Department of Justice. Five \nout of a total of 11 divisions at the Department remain without Senate-\nconfirmed Presidential nominees--the Office of Legal Counsel, the Civil \nRights Division, the Tax Division, the Office of Legal Policy, and the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources Division.\n  Just think of that: nominees to head five out of a total of 11 \ndivisions at the\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\nJustice Department are being held by Republicans even though the \nPresident has made the nominations and even though they have passed out \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. If any Senator does not like a \nnominee, vote against them. But let's have a vote up or down.\n  President Obama made his first judicial nomination back in March. I \nremember it was snowing like mad. He nominated David Hamilton to the \nSeventh Circuit. That nomination has been on the Executive Calendar \nsince early June, even though it has the support of the senior most \nRepublican in the Senate and one of the most distinguished Senators of \neither party who has ever served, Senator Lugar.\n  The nomination of Judge Andre Davis to the Fourth Circuit was \nreported by the committee on June 4 by a vote of 16 to 3. We cannot get \nit considered by the Senate. The nomination of Judge Beverly Baldwin \nMartin to the Eleventh Circuit was reported unanimously from the \ncommittee by voice vote on September 10 and is strongly supported by \nthe two Republican Senators from her State, but still we cannot get it \nscheduled or considered.\n  Federal judicial vacancies will soon number 120 unless we start \nmoving forward. I mention that just because we should have a history \nbefore us.\n  At least the one bright spot is moving Mr. Viken's nomination. At a \nquarter past 5, it is Mr. Viken. By a quarter past 6, it will be Judge \nViken. I congratulate him and his family. I remember him coming before \nour committee--a wonderful person, a wonderful family. I can see why \nthe two Senators--the senior Senator, a Democratic Senator; the junior \nSenator, a Republican Senator--support him. He should be a judge. But \nthen let's start moving these nominations a little more expeditiously.\n  Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining, and the minority has 5 1/2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be run equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jeffrey L.

Mr. President, I rise today to respond to Bryan Walsh's \nrecent article, published August 31, 2009, in Time Magazine, entitled \n``The Real Cost of Cheap Food.''\n  I ask people to read the article and, as you read it, take into \nconsideration my view of it, which is not very positive. Unfortunately, \nI see this article as one of the most skewed and one-sided articles I \nhave ever had the opportunity to read, particularly in the mainstream \nmedia.\n  This report was far from objective journalism. It seems to me that \nwhen people are talking about America's food crisis and how to fix it, \nit ought to be very intellectually accurate.\n  Before outlining the numerous factual errors the author presents in \nhis article, I will mention that I support organic and sustainable \nagriculture. In fact, Norman Borlaug, father of the green revolution, \nfrom Iowa, is credited with creating a sustainable agricultural system \ndecades ago. And as you may know, the Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1970, \nNorman Borlaug--the person I just referred to--recently passed away at \nthe age of 95.\n  This article refers to the Niman Ranch. What Niman Ranch and other \norganic farmers across Iowa and our Nation are doing is to be \ncommended. These producers are providing additional choices to \nconsumers and creating highly profitable small farms which can help \nsustain rural communities. In fact, the National Agriculture Statistics \nService reports that in 2007, 566 organic farms were located in my \nState of Iowa.\n  That being said, I am disappointed that an information source, such \nas I referred to by Time magazine, by the author, Mr. Walsh--previously \nTime magazine was known as a news magazine--has resorted to an \ninaccurate, incomplete, and unfair reflection of family farmers--I \nemphasize the word ``family'' in connection with farmers--from across \nthe United States. So I will take a few minutes on the Senate floor to \nrefute a few main points this author has made.\n  First, I wish to discuss how our Nation's farmers are stewards of our \nland, protecting and caring for their livestock and our environment.\n  Second, I wish to address population growth and the growing demands \nto produce safe and affordable food.\n  Finally, I will address how both organic agriculture and conventional \nagriculture serve complementary needs and can coexist in harmony.\n  As everybody in this body knows, I have been a family farmer all my \nlife. Of course, I have to give credit to my son Robin for doing most \nof the work on the farm and a grandson in that farming operation. One \nthing you find out as a grandfather, when you have a grandson in a \nfarming operation, is that grandfathers are not quite as important as \nthey used to be.\n  My son Robin and I crop share our land, and we have taken great pride \nover the years in both caring for our livestock and conserving our \nnatural\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\nresources, while producing bountiful corn and soybean harvests. We are \nnot unlike tens of thousands of other farmers across Iowa and this \ncountry whose livelihoods depend on taking care of our soil, water, and \nanimals.\n  I give credit to the new occupant of the Presiding Officer's chair, \nSenator Tester from Montana, for being another family farmer, as well, \nand being a good caretaker of the environment.\n  With final passage of the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, \nalso known as the farm bill, Congress made one of the largest \ncommitments to conservation this Nation has ever seen. An additional $6 \nbillion in new money was added for working lands programs, such as the \nConservation Stewardship Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, and the \nFarmland Protection Program.\n  Even on my own farm, we use no till for our beans, minimal tillage \nfor our corn, and we put in wetlands, a waterway and a grass strip, \neven though we have mostly flat farmland. Robin and I are required to \ndo this. We do it because we know, as stewards of our environment, our \nfarm will benefit in the long run. In other words, it is economically \ngood to be good stewards of the land. It puts money in your pocket. We \nwill be able to then, in the final analysis, pass the operation down to \nour grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  That is one of the main points the author of the Time article, Mr. \nWalsh, totally misses. He basically demonizes production agriculture. \nMr. Walsh implies that the only family farmers in our country are those \nwho live on 30 acres of farmland. But nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Family farmers can operate small farms, but they can also \noperate large farms. If given the opportunity, they want to be able to \npass that farm on to future generations of the family.\n  It makes absolutely no sense to imply that these producers would \npurposely deplete our resources for a quick buck. There has never been \na quick buck in farming, but it can provide, over a lifetime, a \nrewarding and sustainable lifestyle.\n  I am going to use three charts during my presentation. The first one \nis going to be used to refute some of the accusations that have been \nmade.\n  Producers around the United States continue to become more and more \nefficient in their production practices. This chart shows that in the \nlast 25 years, we have been able to produce more bushels of corn with \nless fertilizer. Now get this. Everybody thinks the commercial and \nfamily farmers are pouring on the fertilizer without any care \nwhatsoever about the environment to produce, produce, produce. But that \ndoes not make you money, and particularly in recent years with the high \nincrease in the price of phosphorous, potassium, and especially \nnitrogen, this is absolutely the wrong course to go if you are a farmer \nwho thinks pouring more fertilizer on is going to make you more money.\n  What we show here is, in the last 25 years, we have been able to \nproduce more corn with even less fertilizer. We can see it in the \ndownward trends of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash. We use U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture data compiled by the Fertilizer Institute \nthat nitrogen, phosphate, and potash efficiency is growing in corn \nproduction.\n  To put it another way, we are growing more bushels of corn per pound \nof nutrient applied. This is in direct contradiction to the impression \nthat Time magazine author Mr. Walsh makes with his statements.\n  We know the hypoxia is partly a natural phenomenon, but scientists \ngenerally agree that nitrates from agriculture and other manmade \nfactors contribute to it. When the hypoxia zone forms--and most of the \ntime we talk about this in the Gulf of Mexico--it does, in fact, \ndisplace fish. But it is particularly unfair to try to quantify impacts \non the fishing industry because there is not sufficient data to back up \nthat claim. Technology has allowed farmers to apply the exact amount of \nfertilizer in the right way so there is not excess.\n  However, even in organic farming, which the author seems to hold in \nthe highest esteem, it uses manure from animals for fertilizer which \nalso contains nitrogen. Soil naturally contains nitrogen that under \ncertain circumstances of too much rain or too much moisture in the \nground can eventually get into our streams. That is true whether it is \nfrom natural fertilizer or whether it is from commercial fertilizer.\n  Farmers for years have been employing conservation practices such as \nno till, buffer strips, and wetlands, just like I have on my farm, to \nprevent soil erosion and to keep runoff from going directly into the \nwaterway. I anticipate, especially under this new farm bill, that these \npractices will grow.\n  In addition, research is starting to shift on hypoxia issues in \nregard to the Gulf of Mexico. There is increasing recognition that \ncauses of hypoxia relate strongly to manmade alteration of the entire \nsystem, including channelization of the Mississippi, reversal of the \nAtchafalaya River in Alabama, and extreme loss of wetlands and barrier \nislands that filter nutrients and protect against storm surges, not \nsolely nutrient issues, as this author would imply.\n  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, Science Advisory \nBoard has a hypoxia report out indicating that 22 percent of the \nnitrogen and 34 percent of the phosphorous loads can be attributed to \npoint source rather than agriculture, as far as the hypoxia problem in \nthe Gulf of Mexico is concerned.\n  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that over \n2 trillion gallons of untreated combined sewer overflow run into our \nNation's waterways each year, and the Army Corps of Engineers' projects \ndump millions of yards of nutrient-rich soil into the Missouri and \nother rivers for habitat restoration purposes that also contribute.\n  These types of dredging projects in the Missouri River floodplain \nalone may represent as much as 8 percent of the spring's total \nphosphorous discharge, leading to problems in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Technology in corn production in the United States over the last 100 \nyears has been remarkable. From about 1860 to 1930, corn averaged just \nabout 25 bushels per acre. Not until the 1950s through 1980s, when corn \nbreeders began using double-cross and single-cross technology, did we \nsee these great advances in yields of corn.\n  Just in the last 10 years, we have seen increased use of \nbiotechnology which has provided yields over 150 bushels per acre. This \nauthor, Mr. Walsh, clearly views biotechnology as a bad thing when, in \nfact, traits such as drought resistance and nutrient-use efficiency are \nactually improving corn's performance with less inputs, as demonstrated \nby this chart.\n  Many of our technology companies are expecting their yield trends to \nexceed 300 bushels per acre in coming years. For someone such as me who \nhas been farming for 50 years, it is almost unimaginable, but exciting \nat the same time, to have these projected yields we are hearing.\n  I wish to turn to another chart now. It deals with another issue that \nis very important for us to understand when we are talking about \nefficiency of agriculture and reducing pollution. In fact, in 1915, we \nused 90 million acres--in comparison to about 90 million acres, I think \nit is more like 87 million acres this year of corn being produced, or 2 \nyears ago, 93 million acres of corn being produced. I am referring to \n90 million acres in this picture. In 1915, 90 million acres of cropland \nin America were simply used to fuel our agricultural production.\n  So let's get it straight. It took 90 million acres of crops just to \nfeed all the horses and all the mules that provided the work and the \nenergy on our agricultural land before tractors were invented.\n  If you add up all the land in the United States being used to produce \ncorn, wheat, and soybeans, it is about 224 million acres today. So less \nthan 100 years ago, we would have been using nearly half the acres in \nthe United States just to feed the draft animals that produced the \npower to till the soil and to produce those 25 bushels of corn per acre \ncompared to the 150-some bushels per acre now that we will have in the \nUnited States this year of corn production.\n  By 2050, it is estimated that the world's population will exceed 9.3 \nbillion people, compared to 6 billion people now. As the world demand \nfor nutrient-rich food and protein continues to grow as both income \nlevels and populations grow in developing nations,\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nAmerica's farmers are ready to answer that call to help feed the \nincreasing number of people around the world, and, most people would \ntell you today, not by putting more land into production but by getting \nmore from each acre of land as that productivity and yield increase \nvery dramatically, as it has in the past and will continue to into the \nfuture.\n  Mr. Walsh of Time magazine attacks animal agriculture throughout this \narticle. His theme is that if an animal doesn't roam free on the \nwestern prairie and eat grass, it simply couldn't be healthy or safe to \neat. Mr. Walsh cites the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal \nProduction in his analysis of why animals treated with antibiotics \nproduce meat unsafe to eat. However, the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation responded to the Pew report with a lengthy report of its \nown, which Mr. Walsh conveniently fails to mention, perhaps because the \nAmerican Veterinary Medicine Association study said:\n\n       A scientific human/animal nexus, connecting antimicrobial \n     treatments in animals with food-borne or environmentally \n     contracted human disease, has not been proven.\n\n  Livestock producers take very seriously their responsibility to \nprovide safe and abundant food to the general public. Dairy, poultry, \nand livestock farmers have made a voluntary commitment to using \nantibiotics responsibly. By developing responsible-use guidelines, \nthese industries have proactively taken steps to safeguard both human \nand animal health, and Mr. Walsh makes no mention of that.\n  On issue after issue, I have worked on my main priority: that the \npolicy decisions we make must be based on sound science and not on \npolitical ideology. We have seen studies that indicate that the risk of \nfoodborne bacteria on meat increases when antibiotics that help \nsuppress animal disease are removed, actually making our food less safe \nto eat. Does Mr. Walsh take that into consideration?\n  We only have to turn to our neighbor across the Atlantic to see how a \nban on antibiotics has played out. The European Union made a decision \nto phase out the use of antibiotics as growth promoters over 15 years \nago, and in 1998 Denmark instituted a full voluntary ban, which in 2000 \nbecame mandatory. After the ban was implemented in 1999, pork producers \nsaw an immediate increase in piglet mortality and post-weaning \ndiarrhea.\n  Dr. Scott Hurd, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Under \nSecretary for Food and Safety and professor at Iowa State University \nCollege of Veterinary Medicine, released a study which shows that when \npigs have been sick during growth, they have a greater presence of \nfood-safety pathogens on their carcasses when slaughtered.\n  I want to refer to what went on in Denmark with my third and last \nchart--the effects of banning antibiotics--and we have a Danish model \nhere. It doesn't project very good healthy animal agriculture or safety \nfor the consuming public. If this ban had resulted in improvements to \npublic health--in other words, the ban the European Union put on \nantibiotics, and particularly in Denmark--suffering consequences such \nas piglet mortality would make sense. But the science does not back up \nthat positive improvement in public health has occurred as a result of \nthe Denmark ban. In fact, in 2002 the World Health Organization \nreleased a study on antimicrobial resistance and could find no public \nhealth benefit from the Denmark ban. It is true that overall use of \nantibiotics in Denmark has declined, but there has been a significant \nincrease in the use of therapeutic antibiotics which are used to treat \nand control diseases. I think an interesting statistic is that in 2009 \nthe use of therapeutic antibiotics in Danish pigs is greater than what \nwas used to prevent the disease and to promote growth prior to the ban \nin 1999. So I think it is very easy to see that if you look at the \nscience--and Mr. Walsh conveniently ignores it--the practice in the \nUnited States is superior to the practice of the ban in Denmark.\n  We had a 2009 Iowa State University study estimating that production \ncosts would rise by $6 per pig in the first year of a prohibition if a \nsimilar ban were imposed in the United States as it is in Denmark. Over \n10 years, the cumulative cost to the U.S. pork industry would exceed $1 \nbillion. This would all be on top of the estimated $4.6 billion U.S. \npork producers have lost since September 2007 due to a perfect storm of \nevents within that industry.\n  The author, Mr. Walsh, also points to recent recalls in nuts, fruits, \nand vegetables as evidence that conventional agriculture is harmful and \nunsafe. What Mr. Walsh chooses to ignore is that salmonella and e. coli \nare naturally occurring organisms that, with proper handling, \nprocessing, and cooking, can be minimized or even eliminated. Organic \nagriculture is not somehow exempt from being affected by these \nbacteria, as Mr. Walsh might want us to believe.\n  In fact, one of the main challenges within our food safety system has \nbeen the perpetual underfunding of the Food and Drug Administration. I \nhope the Senate will be able to undertake comprehensive food safety \nreform yet this year and give very serious consideration and attention \nto the funding deficiencies of that agency.\n  American consumers demand not only a safe and abundant food supply \nbut also an affordable selection to feed their families nutritious and \nhealthy food. The author fails to recognize that personal choice is \npart of that equation. Ask any American consumer. While less than 1 \npercent of agriculture is farmed organically, as he points out, a \nsimple economics lesson would tell us that supply and demand are in \ndirect relationship to one another.\n  In 2008, Americans spent 9.6 percent of their disposable personal \nincome on food expenditures. This has steadily decreased since the late \n1920s, when nearly 24 percent of our income was spent for food intake. \nOur consumers have demanded an affordable food supply, and our \nagricultural industry has answered that call. Other nations with less \ndeveloped agricultural industries than the United States spend anywhere \nfrom 12 percent to 45 percent of their income on food.\n  At the same time producers have become more efficient and are \nproviding U.S. consumers with lower food costs, the farm share being \nretained by the producer--in other words, the family farmer--has been \ndecreasing. For example, in the years 2000 to 2006, the farm value \nshare ranged from 5 to 6 percent for cereals and bakery products \ncompared to what is being paid at the retail level. Costs in packaging, \nprocessing, and transportation account for most of the cost at the \ngrocery level. Conventional agricultural producers are not getting \nrich. Instead, they are producing the safest, most abundant, most \nreasonably priced food in the world for our consumers at a time when \ntheir share of the food value is not increasing.\n  Perhaps Mr. Walsh, the Time author, believes we should be spending a \nhigher percentage of our income on food. However, because of the \nfinancial situation our Nation is facing, including families out of \nwork and with lower disposable income, citizens would be outraged if \nsuddenly their food expenditure skyrocketed. The Economic Research \nService at the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that total food \nexpenditures for all food consumed in the United States was $1.165 \ntrillion in 2008, a 3.3-percent increase from the $1.128 trillion in \n2007. Prices are naturally rising because of the higher cost to do \nbusiness, including transportation costs. But do we really think it is \nfeasible to see these prices go even higher so that the author, Mr. \nWalsh, can further promote what I consider a political agenda? Growing \nall of our food organically will take more land, cost more money to \nproduce, drive prices up, and ultimately make food even less affordable \nto those in need.\n  I appreciate the opportunities organic agriculture has made possible \nfor farmers in my State of Iowa, and I am sure other Senators would say \nthe same for their own States. It has truly allowed our smallest \nfarmers to flourish and receive a premium for their crops and \nlivestock. It has also promoted gardens and has helped us teach our \nchildren where their food comes from.\n  I agree with the author that the gardens of First Lady Michelle Obama \nand the U.S. Department of Agriculture are bringing more visibility to \neducating our consumers about where their food comes from. I commend \nthem for highlighting the important issues relating to our health by \neating fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\n  Organic agriculture and conventional agriculture can coexist. Both \nwill be driven by demand, and both provide important choices for the \nU.S. consumer. Some consumers will shop for locally grown foods, others \nwill shop for the cost effectiveness due to their tight household \nbudgets.\n  It is time--it is time--for Time magazine and Mr. Walsh to start \nbeing honest with their readers. The next time the magazine wants to \nrun a story that clearly reflects the author's personal views, it \nshould identify that article as such. I expect the next article Time \npublishes on agriculture to be better researched and to present a more \nbalanced view.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9924-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DAVID C. PARRISH, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President. I would like to recognize a courageous \nKentuckian, David C. Parrish, Jr., for his induction into the Kentucky \nAviation Hall of Fame on October 17, 2009. Sixty-five years ago this \npast August, Mr. Parrish undertook brave actions during his service as \na fighter pilot during World War II. A native of Paris, KY, Mr. Parrish \nrepresented the very best in courage, gallantry, and self-sacrifice in \ndefense of this Nation in the skies west of Paris, France. Like many of \nAmerica's ``greatest generation,'' Mr. Parrish was willing to disregard \nhis own safety for the safety of his fellow airmen and the protection \nof his country.\n  Valor and sacrifice are words that describe the nature of Mr. \nParrish, and patience would also describe his character. Although he \nwas recommended for the Silver Star in August 1944, lost records and \nbureaucratic delays meant it would take 60 years for Mr. Parrish's \nheroism to be officially recognized. It was my deep privilege to work \nwith Mr. Parrish in this effort and to personally present him with his \nSilver Star in his hometown in 2004. I believe Mr. Parrish's story is a \ntimely reminder of the sacrifices that so many American men and women \nhave made in the name of freedom.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with you a retelling of Mr. \nParrish's actions in defense of this Nation that earned him the Silver \nStar and his induction into the Kentucky Aviation Hall of Fame. On \nAugust 8, 1944, 1LT David C. Parrish, Jr., was flying in the area of \nMortain, France. His flight was part of an eight-plane squadron that \nbecame separated from the lead flight while on patrol. Lieutenant \nParrish and three others were on their way home when the controller \nreported 100 enemy fighters flying above him and toward American \nbombers. His wingman had to fly home because he was low on fuel. \nLieutenant Parrish and the remaining two fighters climbed toward the \nenemy planes.\n  Lieutenant Parrish was also low on gas and would have normally \nreturned to base, being so outnumbered by enemy fighters. However, \nrecognizing the danger to the friendly bombers, Lieutenant Parrish dove \nhis three fighters into the heart of the enemy formation. The enemy \nfighters dispersed and Lieutenant Parrish and his fellow airmen gave \nchase. Lieutenant Parrish pursued one enemy fighter at 4,000 feet and \ndestroyed it. He then turned toward another enemy fighter flying at \ntree top level and eventually was able to force the enemy pilot to bail \nout. These pursuits were extremely hazardous, and even more so because \nLieutenant Parrish was perilously low on fuel.\n  It is my great pleasure to recognize Mr. Parrish for the sacrifices \nand risks he has made for this country, and I would like to \ncongratulate him on his well-deserved induction in the Kentucky \nAviation Hall of Fame. He has made Kentucky very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9924-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M.

Mr. President, today I am saddened by the death of my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Edward Kennedy.\n  Born and raised in Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy dedicated his life \nto serving his country and the Commonwealth. He enlisted in the U.S. \nArmy in 1951, beginning his long career of public service. Elected in \n1962, Senator Kennedy is the third longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the Senate. He served the people of Massachusetts well for \n46 years, and I know his family and the people of Massachusetts are \nproud to call him one of their own.\n  Senator Kennedy had a long list of accomplishments to show for the \npeople of Massachusetts and the Nation.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my distinguished \ncolleague from Florida, Mel Martinez, who retired from the Senate \nearlier this month.\n  I have worked with Senator Martinez since he was elected to serve the \npeople of Florida in 2004. He has served his country proudly in several \ndifferent roles. Senator Martinez also had the distinct honor to serve \nas the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in President George \nW. Bush's Cabinet and as the chairman of the Republican National \nCommittee. In both roles, it was not personal ambition that drove Mel. \nRather, it was his passion to make his country a better place to live \nfor his family and for all Americans.\n  I have also had the privilege of serving on the Senate Banking \nCommittee with Senator Martinez. As a member of this committee, Mel \nbrought a greater understanding and perspective on housing issues \nfacing the Nation than many Senators that have served on this \ncommittee. Floridians and all Americans have benefited from his vast \nexperience in this area as well as his dedication to serve for the \ngreater good. A person of this caliber will truly be missed in the \nUnited States.\n  I am honored to know him and to have worked with him. I would like to \nthank Senator Martinez for his contributions to the Senate and to the \ncountry we both love. I wish him and his family the best in all of \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9924-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9924-S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Senator Carper successfully offered an \namendment to this act that would authorize the EPA to conduct a study \non black carbon emissions to ``improve global and domestic public \nhealth'' and ``to mitigate the climate impacts of black carbon.''\n  A similar bill, S. 849, was also introduced by Senator Carper and \napproved recently by the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  While I did not object to the purpose of the bill, I did object to \nthe bill because the cost of the study--$2 million according to the \nCongressional Budget Office--was not offset.\n  As I wrote in a letter to Minority Leader McConnell and Senator \nCarper outlining my objections to this bill, ``At a time when our \nnational debt is greater than $11.6 trillion, we cannot afford to add \nto this debt that will be inherited by our children and grandchildren. \nEven our best intentions need to be paid for with offsets from lower \npriorities or wasteful spending.''\n  I also requested the opportunity to modify this legislation if no \noffsets were made.\n  I intended to offer a second-degree amendment to offset the expected \ncost increase in spending as a result of the Carper amendment by \ncapping the amount of funds EPA can spend on conference travel. \nAccording to EPA, $17.296 million was spent on conference travel in \n2006--the last year for which we have records. This amendment would \nhave capped conference travel spending at $15 million, thus assuring \nthat the full cost of the study will be offset.\n  In the past couple of years, as Americans were tightening their belts \nand travelling less, EPA was growing its conference budget and \ntravelling more. This is reflected in its annual costs for\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nconference participation and related expenses, which increased from \n$10.781 million in fiscal year 2000 to $17.296 million in fiscal year \n2006.\n  Conference attendance for Federal employees in many, if not most, \ncases is discretionary, meaning that it is up to Federal agencies to \ndetermine to what conferences agency employees should go and how many \nemployees should go. Some conferences provide valuable educational or \nagency-related information in a format unavailable in a normal office \nsetting. Many conferences, by the sponsors' design, are held in \nlocations chosen to attract attendees.\n  That being said, it is the responsibility of the U.S. Congress and \nthe managers within Federal agencies to exercise due diligence in \nperforming oversight over an area of Federal spending that has cost \ntaxpayers over $2 billion on conferences from 2000-2006. This spending \nhas increased over 95 percent, from over $200 million a year in fiscal \nyear 2000 to almost $400 million a year in fiscal year 2006. In \naddition to the financial cost of these trips, oversight hearings I \nheld as the chair of the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee \nhighlighted the lost productivity of government employees when they are \nout of the office on nonessential travel.\n  The EPA is just one among many Federal agencies that I believe has \noverspent on nonessential conferences and travel. In my research I \nfound numerous instances where EPA showed questionable judgment in this \nregard.\n  In September 2006, EPA sent 23 employees to Paris, France, for the \nInternational Society of Exposure Analysis Meeting, at a cost of \n$56,000. This conference featured a gala dinner cruise on the River \nSeine and a cast of presenters that consisted primarily of Americans.\n  The agency's employees attended an annual National Beaches Conference \nin Niagara Falls, NY. The 2006 conference was attended by at least \nseven EPA employees, at a cost to taxpayers of $52,500.\n  One EPA employee attended a December 2006 GSA Small Business \nConference in Palm Springs, CA, at a cost of $4,100, with his or her \ntravel costs alone listed at $1,800.\n  A Cancun, Mexico, meeting attended by two EPA employees cost $4,200, \nwith travel costs listed at $2,900.\n  A March 2007 Waste-to-Energy Conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico cost \ntaxpayers $48,000 for nine EPA employees and two taxpayer-funded \nnonemployees to attend.\n  A 2006 ``Beyond Translation Forum'' sponsored by the EPA in Texas to \n``engage the Hispanic community in becoming environmental stewards'' \ncosts $52,100 for the attendance of 20 EPA employees and 85 taxpayer-\nfunded nonemployees.\n  Over 2 years, EPA also spent $2.6 million in grants and contracts and \nover $300,000 in travel and related expenses for brownfields \nconferences in Oregon and Missouri.\n  EPA spent $235,000 in grants and $25,000 in travel costs for the \nNational Tank Conference in Memphis. Costs included events at BB King's \nand seeing the Memphis Grizzlies basketball team play.\n  EPA spent $355,000 in grants and contracts and $167,000 in travel \ncosts for the Community Involvement Conference in Milwaukee.\n  In February of 2007, EPA spent $150,000 to sponsor the ``Measuring \nProgram Results'' Conference, to which it sent one EPA employee and \npaid for the attendance of four nonemployees.\n  Instead of specifically capping the amount EPA could spend on \nconference travel, Senator Carper has graciously modified his amendment \nto transfer $2 million from the EPA's Environmental Programs and \nManagement account to fund this study of black carbon emissions. This \nEPA account ``provides personnel compensation, benefits, and travel and \nother administrative expenses for all agency programs.''\n  It is my hope that this transfer in funds will help EPA better manage \nthe funds it is entrusted with by Congress and limit questionable \nexpenditures and unnecessary conference travel and related expenses.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to this offset and hope that \nCongress can begin to prioritize funds for its priorities with real \noffsets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9925-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING JOSEPHINE PEREZ\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, on August 28, 2009, Colorado and \nthe Nation lost a champion for justice and equality, Josephine Marie \nVarela-Perez. Josie, as she was known by all, surmounted the daunting \nchallenges life brought her to become an exemplary voice for minority \nstudents in Denver. Her courage and conviction created a better future \nnot only for Denver students but for countless kids across the country.\n  Josie's humble beginnings never held her back from achieving her \ndreams. When faced with adversity, she overcame.\n  School year after school year, Josie would show up on the first day \nto be counted among her classmates and then return to working in the \nbeet fields, never attending class past the fourth grade. But Josie--a \nstrong believer that education was the key to success and should be \navailable to all children no matter their race or creed--taught herself \nEnglish and Spanish and earned her GED.\n  Josie's commitment to education and minority rights thrust her into \nthe center of the civil rights movement as a party to the landmark \ndesegregation case, Keyes, et al v. School District No. 1, Denver, \nColorado. She also marched with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm \nWorkers and was a voice for the less fortunate. Her strength and \ncourage in standing up for the rights of minority students and the less \nfortunate is an inspiration to all.\n  Josie's strong spirit extended far beyond her activism. Josie worked \ntirelessly to support her six kids--Ricardo, Patricia, Lou, Carlos, \nTerry, and Sheila so that they could have the future they deserved.\n  I join Coloradans and Americans across the country in grieving the \nloss of this civil rights champion. Josie's legacy will continue to \ninspire Americans for generations to come.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9925-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9925-S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING FIFTY YEARS OF ICBMS\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish today as cochair of the \nSenate ICBM coalition along with my friend from Wyoming to recognize \nand pay tribute to 20th Air Force as the Air Force celebrates the 50th \nanniversary of the first nuclear-tipped ICBM on alert, and to honor the \nheritage and accomplishments of the ICBM mission and people--past and \npresent--who acquire, develop, operate, maintain, and secure this \ncombat capability for our Nation.\n  In July 1954, the Air Force established the Western Development \nDivision in response to the growing Soviet missile threat. It developed \nthe first-generation ICBMs--the Titan that is housed in underground \nsilos as well as the above-ground Atlas.\n  In October 1959, the first alert of a nuclear warhead-equipped Atlas \nD occurred at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA. Immediately thereafter, \nthe Air Force started working on a solid-fueled, second-generation ICBM \ncalled the Minuteman. Ten Minuteman I ICBMs were already on alert at \nMalmstrom Air Force Base, MT, by the Cuban Missile Crisis in October \n1962. Just three years later, the first-generation ICBMs were replaced \nwith the larger and more accurate Minuteman II.\n  By January 1970, the Air Force had deployed the Minuteman III. \nThroughout the 1970s, in response to the Soviet Union's buildup of \nmultiwarhead ICBMs, the Air Force started work on the Peacekeeper. In \n1987, 50 Peacekeepers were deployed in existing Minuteman III silos at \nF.E. Warren Air Force Base, WY. At the height of the Cold War, the Air \nForce maintained an ICBM fleet of more than 1,200 missiles on alert as \na counterforce to the approximately 1,400 Soviet ICBMs poised against \nthe United States.\n  Currently, the Air Force maintains a fleet of 450 on-alert Minuteman \nIII ICBMs, spanning the missile fields in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, \nNorth Dakota, and Wyoming. In August 2009, the Air Force activated a \nnew major command--Air Force Global Strike Command--committed solely to \nthe nuclear deterrence mission. This December, 20th Air Force and the \nICBM\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\nmission will transfer from Air Force Space Command to Air Force Global \nStrike Command. The pride shared today in the heritage and rich history \nof the ICBM mission will always be a part of Air Force Space Command's \ncontribution to our national security.\n  Mr. President, the American people are fortunate to have the \ndedicated Airmen of 20th Air Force operate, maintain, and secure \nAmerica's only land-based strategic deterrent 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek, 365 days a year. I know my colleagues will join me in \ncongratulating the Air Force on 50 years of the highest commitment in \ncarrying out the ICBM mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9926-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ABERDEEN MONUMENT TO FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a special \nunveiling of the Aberdeen Monument to Firefighters on October 15, 2009. \nThe handsome bronze, carefully crafted by Aberdeen sculptor Benjamin \nVictor, is a tribute to the firefighters who put their lives on the \nline and heroically serve with courage, pride and honor. Fully aware \nthat firefighting is inherently dangerous work, these men and women \nwork day and night to save lives, save property and protect the \nenvironment.\n  Benjamin Victor has crafted a spectacular sculpture to commemorate \nthese heroes. It portrays his passion for expression and detail and his \nnatural ability to create unique and inspiring works of art. Ben, at 26 \nyears old, is the youngest artist ever to have a sculpture in the \nNational Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. Art critics and \norganizations throughout the country recognize the aesthetic and \nconceptual integrity of Ben's work. Early on, Aberdeen saw his talent \nand its citizens are very grateful that he continues to share his \ntalents with their community.\n  I also want to commend the Aberdeen community for their efforts to \nmake this unveiling possible. Using no tax dollars, the entire funding \nfor this project came from businesses, service clubs, schools, \nfraternal organizations and individuals in the community who saw the \nsignificance of this monument. This contribution by the Aberdeen \ncommunity and Benjamin Victor will commemorate the important role of \nour firefighters for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9926-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERTO BALDUCELLI\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of a patriarch of the Italian-American \ncommunity in my home State of Delaware, Father Roberto Balducelli. On \nColumbus Day, Father Balducelli will be honored by the Columbus \nCommunion Breakfast Committee with its Outstanding Achievement Award.\n  Father Balducelli's 96 years on this Earth, while a true gift to all \nhe has served, reads like a novel. As a 9-year-old boy in the small \ntown of Castelluccio, Italy, he decided that he wanted to pursue an \necclesiastical education in Rome. In 1929, at the age of 16, he joined \nthe Oblates of St. Francis de Sales. After studying in France and \nSwitzerland, he returned to Italy from September 1939 to March 1946.\n  During World War II, Father Balducelli helped save Italian Jews from \npersecution. The young priest recovered the bodies of civilians killed \nin bombing raids, was injured in one of these attacks, and sheltered \nrefugees from Nazi persecution.\n  After receiving a passport to come to the United States, Father \nBalducelli crossed the Atlantic Ocean over the course of 29 days and \narrived in New York on April 10, 1946. The young oblate arrived at St. \nAnthony's of Padua Church in Wilmington soon after and became the \nchurch's first Italian priest. In 1959, he became pastor of St. \nAnthony's.\n  As a first-rate mason and a licensed contractor in the State of \nDelaware, Father Balducelli oversaw and helped undertake the renovation \nof an old public school to meet young Catholic students' educational \nneeds, and he helped establish a new school, called Padua Academy, for \ngirls, as well.\n  His love of welding helped to build St. Anthony in the Hills in the \n1960s, a popular summer retreat and sanctuary for children and their \nfamilies near Hockessin, DE. On his watch, the parish opened a senior \nand day care center and expanded the regionally prominent Italian \nFestival in Delaware. He retired as the church's pastor in 1988.\n  I am privileged to have known Father Balducelli for many years. I \nlook forward to breaking bread with him at the Columbus Communion \nBreakfast in Wilmington's Little Italy on the day of his special \nrecognition.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating Father Balducelli's \nsignificant accomplishments, which he achieved over the course of a \nlifetime dedicated to our community. Wilmington and our Italian-\nAmerican community could not have woven such a fabric of family and \nstrength if it were not for the commitment and foresight of Father \nRoberto Balducelli.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9926-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL HUNTING AND FISHING DAY\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am here today in recognition of \nNational Hunting and Fishing Day, which was recognized on September 26. \nHunters and anglers contribute significantly to our Nation's economy. \nMore than 1 million hunters and anglers add over $3 billion each year \ninto Michigan's economy alone.\n  From the very beginning, hunting and fishing have been at the center \nof Michigan's history and culture. Our two great peninsulas, surrounded \nby the magnificent Great Lakes, are home to over 8 million acres of \npublic hunting land, tens of thousands of rivers and streams, and some \nof the best hunting and fishing in the United States. Whether \nmeandering along Hemingway's Fox or Two Hearted Rivers for brook trout \nand ruffed grouse, or making the annual trip to deer camp with friends \nand family, Michigan's proud heritage comes with a sense of profound \nresponsibility to protect that legacy for future generations.\n  We have made some important progress. I have been pleased to \nspearhead a number of efforts including Federal funding to stop the \ninvasive cormorant from destroying our fisheries. This project has \nalready shown conclusive results in bringing back once-decimated \nfishing areas. Through my work on the Senate Agriculture Committee, we \nhave invested over $4 billion in new conservation efforts that will \nprotect wildlife habitats and increase access for hunters and anglers \nacross the country. Most recently, the Senate passed $400 million in \nfunding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to clean up the \nGreat Lakes.\n  While we have made progress, there is more work to be done. I will \ncontinue to work for passage of the National Fish Habitat Conservation \nAct and the Clean Water Restoration Act, which will help preserve \nMichigan's 36,000 miles of rivers and streams, including over 1,000 \nmiles of blue-ribbon trout streams. I will also continue to work to \nensure access to public lands and waterways.\n  Working together, we can preserve our natural resources so others can \nenjoy our rich hunting and fishing heritage for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9926-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9926-S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. CAROLYN PORCO\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I praise Dr. \nCarolyn Porco, a professor at the University of Colorado, senior \nresearcher at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, CO, and leader of \nthe imaging team for the Cassini mission. In this last role, she has a \nfront row seat on some of the most exciting scientific discoveries of \ntoday coming from the Cassini spacecraft, which for 5 years has been \norbiting and studying Saturn and its Moons. I have submitted for the \nRecord an article about Dr. Porco from the September 21, 2009, edition \nof the New York Times.\n  In Colorado, we are extremely proud of our science and technology \nenterprise. We have 16 Federal laboratories, top-flight research \nuniversities and a vibrant private sector pushing the limits on \neverything from biomedical research to space exploration. But even in \nthis crowded field, Dr. Porco stands out as an exemplary Colorado \nscientist. She has repeatedly been recognized as one of the top \nscientific leaders to watch this century both for her scientific \naccomplishments and her leadership within the scientific community. As \nthe Times article shows, she\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nhas come a long way from her humble Bronx upbringing.\n  Thinking about Dr. Porco, I am reminded that great scientists are not \nborn. They are made. They are made through the hard work and \ndetermination of the young boy who rejects the stigma that somehow \nbeing smart is not cool and the young girl who refuses to take a back \nseat to any boy. They are made through the guidance and support of \ncountless teachers and mentors who receive far too little credit for \nthe service they give to this country. And perhaps most importantly for \nthis body, they are made through the investments we make in research, \ndevelopment and education. If we want the Carolyn Porcos of the future \nto be here in the United States--and believe me, we do--we must invest \nnow in our research agencies, and we must have well-paid, high-quality \nteachers in the classroom.\n  Dr. Porco is a stellar example of what we can accomplish as \nindividuals and as a nation with focus and a little bit of tenacity. I \ncongratulate her on her accomplishments and well-deserved recognition. \nI, for one, will be following her progress and expecting many more \ngreat things from her in the future.\n  I ask that the New York Times article to which I referred be printed \nin the Record.\n  The information follows.\n\n              an Odyssey From the Bronx to Saturn's Rings\n\n                          (By Dennis Overbye)\n\n       It is twilight time on Saturn.\n       Shadows lengthened to stretch thousands of miles across the \n     planet's famous rings this summer as they slowly tilted edge-\n     on to the Sun, which they do every 15 years, casting into \n     sharp relief every bump and wiggle and warp in the buttery \n     and wafer-thin bands that are the solar system's most popular \n     scenic attraction.\n       From her metaphorical perch on the bridge of the Cassini \n     spacecraft, which has been orbiting Saturn for five years, \n     Carolyn Porco, who heads the camera team, is ecstatic about \n     the view. ``It's another one of those things that make you \n     pinch yourself and say, `Boy am I lucky to be around now,' '' \n     Dr. Porco said. ``For the first time in 400 years, we're \n     seeing Saturn's rings in three dimensions.''\n       On Monday, Dr. Porco and the Cassini team released a grand \n     view of the rings in all their shadowed glory, including \n     clumps, spikes, undulations and waves two and a half miles \n     high on the edge of one ring.\n       ``We always knew it would be good; instead, it's been \n     extraordinary,'' Dr. Porco said of the cascade of results \n     that have placed her in a spotlight to which she has become \n     increasingly accustomed. ``I feel I'm on a great human \n     adventure,'' she said.\n       The work may be carried out by robots, Dr. Porco said, \n     ``but we are all explorers.''\n       ``It's thrilling,'' she added, ``and I want everyone to \n     know how thrilling it is.''\n       Dr. Porco, 56, a senior researcher at the Space Science \n     Institute in Boulder, Colo., may be the leader of the camera \n     team on the $3.4 billion Cassini mission, an adjunct \n     professor at the University of Colorado and one of Wired \n     magazine's 15 people who should be advising the president. \n     But she is also a proud child of the 1964os who has never let \n     go of the exuberance of that era when President John F. \n     Kennedy ``said that the sky isn't even the limit,'' as she \n     puts it, and ``things were unleashed.''\n       Her entries on the Cassini imaging Web site echo the spirit \n     of the character Capt. James T. Kirk on ``Star Trek'':\n\n\n                     Captain's Log--March 23, 2009\n\n       We are almost there. Saturn and we, its companions, have \n     journeyed together now for nearly five years, in a \n     circumnavigation of the outer solar system.\n       Stanley Kubrick's film ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' is still \n     her favorite movie, and she still loves the Beatles. On a \n     visit to England in 2001, she and her imaging colleagues \n     recreated the album cover picture of the Beatles crossing \n     Abbey Road, with Dr. Porco leading, dressed in white like \n     John Lennon.\n       Dr. Porco was born and raised in a Bronx family with four \n     brothers she partly credits for her subsequent success in \n     astronomy. ``I'm used to fighting and arguing with males,'' \n     she said.\n       Her father, an Italian immigrant, drove a bread truck, and \n     her mother kept house. Dr. Porco attended Cardinal Spellman \n     High School, the same school that Justice Sonia Sotomayor of \n     the Supreme Court attended.\n       She was a studious child and a spiritual seeker--``13 going \n     on 80''--who lived a lot in her head. Later, as a student at \n     the State University of New York at Stony Brook, she said she \n     spent two years as a chanting Buddhist and even went on a \n     two-week pilgrimage to Japan, where she was the majorette in \n     a Buddhist marching band, wearing hot pants. ``Now, THOSE \n     were the days,'' she wrote in an e-mail message.\n       By then, Dr. Porco was pursuing the future she had glimpsed \n     at age 13 when she saw Saturn through a neighbor's rooftop \n     telescope. As a graduate student at the California Institute \n     of Technolgy, she floundered at first but then got a job \n     helping to analyze data from the two Voyager spacecrafts, \n     which toured the outer planets from Jupiter to Neptune from \n     1978 to 1989.\n       It was there, said Peter Goldreich, her thesis advisor, \n     that she demonstrated a knack for picking out important \n     things. Among them was a discovery that mysterious dark \n     spokes in Saturn's ring system were connected to the planet's \n     magnetic field. She did her thesis on aspects of the rings \n     and how they were shaped by the gravity of tiny moonlets.\n       Dr. Porco also did a lot of dancing, and played a guitar \n     and sang in the Titan Equatorial Band, a pickup group of \n     scientists and science writers named after a feature on \n     Saturn's largest moon, and later for a group in Tucson called \n     the Estrogens. ``Three women and one very brave guy,'' she \n     said.\n       By the time Voyager passed Neptune in 1989, Dr. Porco was a \n     research associate at the University of Arizona and leading a \n     small team trying to make sense of the thin rings around \n     Neptune.\n       ``She was one of the young rock stars of Voyager,'' said \n     David Grinspoon, of the Southwest Research Institute in \n     Boulder, who was a graduate student at Arizona at the time.\n       But it had not been an easy climb in the overwhelmingly \n     male and competitive environment of space science. Dr. Porco \n     once described scientists as ``schoolyard toughs.'' She \n     recalled pumping herself up to be an ``alpha male'' before \n     meetings of her ring team.\n       Even as a graduate student, Dr. Goldreich recalled, Dr. \n     Porco ``was making a deliberate effort to become tough, and \n     she succeeded.''\n       Dr. Porco found an ally and friend in Carl Sagan, the \n     Cornell astronomer, author and a charter member of the \n     Voyager team, who defended her once when her Voyager \n     colleagues teased her about not being married.\n       Dr. Porco was subsequently hired as a consultant for the \n     movie ``Contact,'' based on Sagan's novel about a feisty \n     astronomer, Ellie Arroway, who discovers a signal from \n     extraterrestrials.\n       Although plans fell through for Dr. Porco to meet Jodie \n     Foster, the actress who played Arroway, she did attend a \n     workshop on the script, where she took strong exception to an \n     idea that the character would sleep with her adviser. ``She's \n     a let-it-ripper, isn't she?'' recalled the movie's producer, \n     Lynda Obst. ``She let it rip.''\n       Voyager, Dr. Porco said, was the time of her life. ``It had \n     all the elements of Homeric legend,'' she said. ``It was a \n     long 12-year odyssey, punctuated by brief episodes of great \n     discovery and conquest. And then it was back in the boat, \n     oars in the water, until years later we reached our next port \n     of call. It was a defining experience for many of us, and \n     certainly for me.''\n       The chance to channel Dr. Porco's inner Captain Kirk \n     continued with the $3.4 billion Cassini mission, which was \n     launched on a roundabout course toward Saturn in 1997 and \n     arrived in 2004. Being on the imaging team is like standing \n     on the bridge of the spaceship, she said. ``We have the \n     windows,'' she said. ``That's what we're responsible for.''\n       Dr. Porco was chosen over more senior astronomers to head \n     the Cassini camera team in 1990, one of 12 team leaders for \n     the spacecraft. The job swallowed her life, she said, and \n     required her hard-won toughness. ``Our experiment has been \n     spectacularly successful,'' she said, ``and that would never \n     have happened if I let people roll over me.''\n       But Dr. Porco said it had all been worthwhile. ``Between my \n     participation in Voyager and my role in Cassini,'' she said, \n     ``when comes the time, I will die a happy and gratified \n     woman.''\n       One of the most thrilling Cassini moments was in 2004 when \n     the Huygens probe detached from Cassini and landed on \n     Saturn's largest moon, Titan, a strange, frigid world where \n     rocks are made of ice, and rivers and oceans are formed of \n     what Dr. Porco has described as ``paint thinner.''\n       Last month, astronomers announced that they had detected \n     methane storms on Titan, a cloudy moon that has an atmosphere \n     denser than that of Earth.\n       They also discovered plumes erupting from the south pole of \n     another Saturn moon, Enceladus, suggesting the presence of \n     underground water and prompting talk about a future mission \n     to cruise through the plumes. ``Should we ever discover that \n     life has arisen twice,'' Dr. Porco said, ``that would be a \n     game-changer.''\n       The Titan landing, Dr. Porco said in a talk in 2007, should \n     have been celebrated with parades in every major city.\n       That talk led to another movie adventure. J. J. Abrams, the \n     producer of the television series ``Lost,'' was listening and \n     asked Dr. Porco to consult on his ``Star Trek'' movie. On a \n     visit to the set, she suggested that a scene in which the \n     Starship Enterprise materialized inside clouds be set on \n     Titan. The scene made it onto the cover of Cinefex, a \n     magazine about special effects in films.\n       In an interview, Mr. Abrams said: ``She helped us feel \n     connected to what Gene Roddenberry had been trying to do. \n     This is our future,'' referring the creator of ``Star Trek.''\n       Cassini endures, and Dr. Porco is a member of the team for \n     the New Horizons spacecraft, which is scheduled to arrive at \n     Pluto in 2015. But she said she hoped to spend more of her \n     time popularizing science and hopes to write a book about \n     Cassini.\n       ``To my mind,'' Dr. Porco said, ``most people go through \n     life recoiling from its best\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n     parts. They miss the enrichment that just a basic knowledge \n     of the physical world can bring to the most ordinary \n     experiences. It's like there's a pulsating, hidden world, \n     governed by ancient laws and principles, underlying \n     everything around us--from the movements of electrical \n     charges to the motions of the planets--and most people are \n     completely unaware of it.\n       ``To me, that's a shame.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9928-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9928-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/29/senate-section/article/S9928-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3607.

(for himself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1726. A bill to reauthorize the expiring intelligence tools of the \nUSA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and defend \nagainst terrorism through improved classified procedures and criminal \nlaw reforms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, earlier this month, we paid homage to those \nwho lost their lives in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. \nThose attacks changed our nation forever, including how we combat the \nvery real and continuing threat of terrorism. One of the most important \nchanges that we made in the wake of September 11 was the enactment of \nthe PATRIOT Act. That legislation, which had strong bipartisan support \nin the Congress, provided for a number of common sense changes designed \nto give our national security intelligence community the same tools our \npolice and FBI agents can use against drug dealers and organized crime. \nAlthough many of the PATRIOT Act's provisions are now permanent, three \ncritical national security tools--the ``wiretap'' authority contained \nin Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act; the ``business records'' authority \ncontained in Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act; and the ``lone wolf'' \nauthority contained in Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004--will expire on December 31 of this \nyear.\n  The tools in the PATRIOT Act are as necessary today as they were when \nfirst enacted. Just this month, the government confirmed that the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, FISA, which includes \nPATRIOT Act provisions, was used to build a case against Najibullah \nZazi. Although many details remain classified, it appears as if \nNajibullah Zazi was an al Qaeda associate who was planning to detonate \nbombs within the U.S.\n  Similarly, it has been reported that the FBI likely used its roving \nwiretap and business records authorities--two of the PATRIOT Act's \nexpiring provisions--to thwart a terrorist plot uncovered earlier this \nyear in New York, in which four former convicts who converted to \nradical Islam plotted to use\n\n[[Page S9934]]\n\nexplosives to blow up synagogues and shoot down airplanes with surface-\nto-air missiles.\n  Those are two high-profile examples from just this year. There are no \ndoubt countless of other instances, not known to the public, where \nPATRIOT Act authorities have been used by our national security \nprofessionals to keep Americans safe. Recognizing the importance of \nthese tools, the Department of Justice has written the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to urge renewal of the expiring provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. In addition, FBI Director Mueller and David Kris, the \nAssistant Attorney General for the National Security Division, both \nexpressed their strong support for these authorities in testimony \nbefore the Judiciary Committee this month.\n  The reality is that the war on terrorism is not going to sunset. \nNeither should the tools that our investigators and analysts rely upon \nto prevent attack. That is why Mr. Cornyn and I are introducing today \nthe USA PATRIOT Reauthorization and Additional Weapons Against \nTerrorism Act of 2009. This legislation permanently renews the three \nexpiring PATRIOT Act provisions and addresses other critical national \nsecurity needs.\n\n\n                I. Renewing the Roving Wiretap Authority\n\n  The roving wiretap authority allows the Government, in certain \ncircumstances, to focus surveillance efforts on monitoring a particular \ntarget rather than a particular telephone number. Gone are the days \nwhen you used only one phone at home or in the office. Cell phones are \nubiquitous. The point is to intercept the calls of a particular person, \nnot a particular phone. Even so, the Government may have such authority \nonly in limited circumstances. It must provide the FISA Court with \n``specific facts'' indicating that the ``actions of the target of the \napplication may have the effect of thwarting the identification'' of \nthird parties necessary to accomplish the ordered surveillance. This \ntool helps ensure that investigators and analysts may overcome a \ntarget's efforts to avoid surveillance, for example, rapidly switching \ncell phone numbers.\n  As the Department of Justice noted in its September 14, 2009, letter \nto Chairman Leahy, the roving wiretap authority has ``proven an \nimportant intelligence-gathering tool in a small but significant subset \nof FISA electronic surveillance orders.'' The Department's letter \nexplains that the authority has been used judiciously--on average, only \n22 applications for roving wiretaps have been made per year--and that \n``the basic justification offered to Congress in 2001 for the roving \nauthority remains valid today. . . . Any effective surveillance \nmechanism must incorporate the ability to rapidly address an \nunanticipated change in the target's communications behavior.''\n\n\n              II. Renewing the Business Records Authority\n\n  The business records authority allows the FISA Court, under \nappropriate circumstances, to compel the production of needed business \nrecords. In its September 14 letter, the Department of Justice \nexpressed its strong support for the business records provision, \nstating that it ``addresses a gap in intelligence collection \nauthorities and has proven valuable in a number of contexts.'' The \nDepartment stated that some of the acquired ``orders were used to \nsupport important and highly sensitive intelligence collection \noperations, of which both Members of the Intelligence Committee and \ntheir staffs are aware.'' Although some have questioned the scope and \nuse of this authority, it is important to acknowledge that no one has \nchallenged a business records order in court, even though an explicit \nright to file such a challenge took effect in 2006. Such authority also \nexists in at least 300 federal government investigative contexts.\n\n\n                 III. Renewing the Lone Wolf Authority\n\n  The ``lone wolf'' provision fills a critical intelligence gap in \nsituations where the government can establish that a non-United States \nperson is engaged in international terrorism but cannot yet identify \nthe foreign power or terrorist group to which he belongs. Although this \nauthority has not yet been used, the Department of Justice made clear \nin its September 14 letter that there are foreseeable situations in \nwhich such an authority ``would be the only avenue to effective \nsurveillance.'' The Department stated that ``it is essential to have \nthe tool available for the rare situation in which it is necessary \nrather than to delay surveillance of a terrorist in the hopes that the \nnecessary links are established.'' Had we had this authority at the \ntime, we could have examined the computer of Zacarias Moussaoui, \nperhaps gaining enough information to provide some warning of 9/11. \nTerrorists do not carry membership cards in organizations, but it does \nnot make them any less dangerous.\n\n\n              IV. Addressing Other National Security Needs\n\n  In addition to reauthorizing these important national security tools, \nthis legislation responds to several other national security needs. For \nexample, it clarifies what kind of information and disclosures trigger \nthe procedures of the Classified Information Procedures Act, CIPA. This \nclarification is designed to resolve the difficulties created by the \nFourth Circuit's approach in United States v. Moussaoui. The \nlegislation also prohibits individuals from providing material \nsupport--for example, providing money to support a suicide bomber's \nfamily--to international terrorism efforts. It makes it illegal to \nconspire to violate the current prohibition on receiving military-type \ntraining from a foreign terrorist organization. It prohibits the use, \ntransfer, mass transfer, production, and trafficking of false travel \ndocuments. Finally, it ensures that convicted terrorists and sex \noffenders will not be released pending sentencing or appeal.\n  These are good, common sense provisions that all members should be \nable to support. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both \nsides to ensure that our national security professionals have the tools \nthey need to continue finding and apprehending terrorists before they \nattack.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
