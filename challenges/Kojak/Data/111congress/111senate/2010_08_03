Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Elena Kagan, \nof Massachusetts, to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we continue working this week to \ncreate jobs and finish the unfinished business of this work period, we \nwill also turn to the nomination of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan.\n  Giving the President the Senate's advice and consent, as prescribed \nby the Constitution for a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in \nthe country, is one of this body's most solemn obligations.\n  Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions oversaw, through the \nlengthy process, very thorough and respectful confirmation hearings. \nAll of them were fair and I think were probative. I thank them both for \ntheir leadership.\n  Several Senators have already made known how they will vote on Ms. \nKagan's nomination. Those Senators and many others will come to the \nfloor in the next few days to explain their positions. I will be one of \nthem speaking in support of this exceptional nominee. I will certainly \ngive her my vote.\n  As the debate moves to the Senate floor and as we move toward a final \nvote, I look forward to a continuation of the passionate but civil \ndiscussion we have seen in the committee thus far. In this respect, \nperhaps we can draw inspiration from Ms. Kagan herself. In her \nconfirmation hearing last year for the position she currently holds--as \nour Nation's Solicitor General, that is our Government's lawyer in \ncases that come before the U.S. Supreme Court--Ms. Kagan testified that \none of the attributes she would bring to the job was an ``understanding \nof how to separate the truly important from spurious.''\n\n[[Page S6598]]\n\n  In the final days of this process, I suggest we keep those words in \nmind. I hope my fellow Senators will bring to this debate the same \nappreciation for what is critical to the Court and to our country, that \nwill keep it separate from what is not.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Measure Placed on Calendar--H.r. 5901\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that H.R. 5901 is at the desk \nand due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nread the title of the bill for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5901) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to exempt certain stock of real estate investment trusts \n     from the tax on foreign investment in United States real \n     property interests, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I object to any further proceedings on this measure at \nthis time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, will control the first 30 minutes, \nand the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, will control the second \n30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 12 weeks ago, President Obama \nnominated Elena Kagan to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. When the \nPresident announced his choice on May 10, he talked about her legal \nmind, her intellect, her record of achievement, her temperament and her \nfair-mindedness.\n  Having heard from Solicitor General Kagan at her confirmation hearing \n5 weeks ago, I believe the American people have a sense of her \nimpressive knowledge of the law, her good humor, and her judicial \nphilosophy. In her testimony, she made clear that she will base her \napproach to deciding cases on the law and the Constitution, not on \npolitics, not on an ideological agenda. She indicated that she will not \nbe the kind of Justice who will substitute her personal preferences, \nand overrule the efforts of Congress to protect hardworking Americans \npursuant to our constitutional role. Solicitor General Kagan made one \npledge to those of us who were at that hearing: that she will do her \n``best to consider every case impartially, modestly, with commitment to \nprinciple, and in accordance with law.''\n  Incidentally, I might say, at the outset, I compliment Republicans \nand Democrats alike for the amount of time Senators spent at the \nhearing. I certainly compliment the ranking member, Senator Sessions. \nWe may have disagreed on the outcome and on the vote, but I think \nSenators worked very hard to get questions asked, to make sure that the \nAmerican people knew who Elena Kagan was. I note that Senator Sessions \nand I set the times for witnesses and all. We were constrained somewhat \nby the distinguished Presiding Officer's predecessor, who died that \nweek, and we were trying to arrange time for many of us to go to the \nfuneral. I wanted to publicly thank Senator Sessions for his help in \nworking out that schedule.\n  No one can question the intelligence or achievements of this woman. \nNo one should question her character either. Elena Kagan was the first \nwoman to be the Dean of the prestigious Harvard Law School and the \nfirst woman in our Nation's history to serve as Solicitor General, a \nposition often referred to as the ``Tenth Justice.'' As a student, she \nexcelled at Princeton, Oxford and Harvard Law School. She worked in \nprivate practice and briefly for then-Senator Joe Biden on the \nJudiciary Committee. She taught law at two of the Nation's most \nrespected law schools, and counseled President Clinton on a wide \nvariety of issues. She clerked for two leading judicial figures, Judge \nAbner Mikva on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit, and then for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, on one \nof the most extraordinary lawyers in American history.\n  I have been here since the time of President Gerald Ford, and I have \nlong urged Presidents from both political parties to look outside what \nthey call the ``judicial monastery,'' and not feel restricted to \nconsidering only Federal appellate judges to fill vacancies on the \nSupreme Court. This, of course, is what Presidents used to do. With his \nsecond nomination to the Court, President Obama has done just this; he \nhas gone outside the judicial monastery. When confirmed, Elena Kagan \nwill be the first non-sitting judge to be confirmed to the Supreme \nCourt in almost 40 years, since the appointments of Lewis Powell and \nWilliam Rehnquist.\n  I know there was criticism by some Republicans that this nominee \nlacks judicial experience. Of course, that ignores one key fact. \nPresident Clinton nominated her to the DC Circuit Court in 1999. The \nSenate was controlled by Republicans at the time and it was Senate \nRepublicans who refused to consider her nomination. She was pocket \nfilibustered. Had the Republicans not done so, Elena Kagan would have \nbeen confirmed and would have had more than 10 years judicial \nexperience. To give you some idea of her abilities, instead, when she \nwas not allowed to have a vote for the DC Circuit Court, she went on to \nbecome an outstanding law professor, the first woman Dean of Harvard \nLaw School--one of the most prestigious law schools in the country, \nactually the world--and the first woman to serve as the Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. Her nomination to the Supreme Court \nreceived the highest possible rating from the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Her \ncredentials and legal abilities have been extolled by many across the \npolitical spectrum. Two of these individuals were Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor and Justice Antonin Scalia. In addition, Michael McConnell, \nKenneth Starr and Miguel Estrada have given praise to this nomination. \nLike Justices Hugo Black, Robert Jackson, Earl Warren, William \nRehnquist and so many others, Solicitor General Kagan's experience \noutside the judicial monastery will be valuable to her when she is \nconfirmed. No one can question the intelligence or achievements of this \nwoman. I hope nobody would question her character either.\n  From the moment her nomination was announced, Solicitor General Kagan \nhas spoken about the importance of upholding the rule of law and \nenabling all Americans to have a fair hearing. She said that ``law \nmatters; because it keeps us safe, because it protects our most \nfundamental . . . freedoms; and because it is the foundation of our \ndemocracy.'' Like her, I believe the law does matter in people's lives. \nThat is why I went to law school. That is why I practiced law and then \nbecame a prosecutor. That is why I ran for the Senate. I believe that \nthe law matters in people's lives, because the Constitution is this \namazing fabric of our Nation; it is our protection. She understands \nthis, as did her mentor, Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  In her contribution to the 1993 tribute to Justice Marshall by the \nTexas Law Review, Elena Kagan recalled how Justice Marshall's law \nclerks had tried to get him to rely on general notions of fairness, \nrather than a strict reading of the law, so they could allow an appeal \nto proceed on a discrimination claim. She wrote that the then 80-year-\nold Justice referred to his years trying civil rights cases and said: \nAll you could hope for was that a court would not rule against you for \nillegitimate reasons. You could not expect that a court would bend the \nrules in your favor. That is the rule of law. Just as Sir Thomas More \nreminded his son-in-law in that famous passage from ``A Man for All \nSeasons,'' that the law is our protection, Justice Marshal reminded his \nlaw clerks that the existence of rules and the rule of law is the best \nprotection for all, including the least powerful. Elena Kagan \nconcluded, as I do, that Justice Marshall ``believed devoutly . . . in \nthe rule of law.'' He was a man of the law in the highest sense. He \nunderstood the Constitution's promise of equality.\n\n  I was disappointed to see the manner in which his legacy was treated \nby some during the recent confirmation hearing, and to read that there \nare Republican Senators, currently serving, who recently said they \nwould vote\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\nagainst Thurgood Marshall's confirmation to the Supreme Court if he \nwere up now. He was a giant, and I would hope that if he were here \nagain, those Senators would reconsider whether they would vote for him.\n  With this nomination, Elena Kagan follows in the footsteps of Justice \nMarshall, who was also nominated to the Supreme Court from the position \nof Solicitor General. She broke a glass ceiling when she was appointed \nas the first woman to serve as Solicitor General of the United States \nand when she served as the first woman dean of the Harvard Law School. \nWhen the Supreme Court next convenes, for the first time in our \nhistory, I predict there will be three women serving together among the \nnine Justices.\n  The stakes at the Nation's highest court could not be higher. One \nneed look no further than the Lilly Ledbetter case to understand the \nimpact that each Supreme Court appointment has on the lives and \nfreedoms of countless Americans. In the Ledbetter case, five Justices \nof the Supreme Court struck a severe blow to the rights of working \nfamilies across our country. Congress acted to protect women and others \nagainst discrimination in the workplace more than 40 years ago, but we \nstill struggle to ensure that all Americans--women and men--receive \nequal pay for equal work. It took a new Congress, joined by our new \nPresident, to reverse the activist conservative majority in the Supreme \nCourt by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Act, striking down the immunity \nthe Supreme Court had given to employers who discriminate against their \nemployees and successfully hid their wrongdoing. The Ledbetter case \nsaid, in a decision I still find shocking, that they could pay men a \nhigher rate than women for the same work. As long as they kept it \nhidden, it was OK.\n  Recently in the Citizens United case, just one vote on the Supreme \nCourt determined that corporate money can drown out the voice of \nAmericans in elections that decide the direction of our democracy. They \nsaid that if British Petroleum wanted to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars to defeat people who want to tighten the controls on our \noffshore drilling, or want to tighten the kind of inspections required \nfor offshore drilling, British Petroleum, according to the Supreme \nCourt, could spend hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat these \npeople.\n  I had hoped that Senate Republicans would join our effort to respond \nto the conservative activist majority of the Supreme Court, who wrongly \ndecided to override its own precedent and 100 years of legal \ndevelopment in Citizens United. Unfortunately, last week they \nfilibustered the DISCLOSE Act and gave their endorsement to unfettered \ncorporate influence in American elections.\n  For all the talk about ``judicial modesty'' and ``judicial \nrestraint,'' from the nominees of a Republican President at their \nconfirmation hearings, we have seen a Supreme Court in the last 5 years \nthat has been anything but modest and restrained. What we have seen all \ntoo often in these last years is the activist conservative members of \nthe Supreme Court substituting their own judgment for that of the \nAmerican people's elected representatives.\n  I have always championed judicial independence. I think it is \nimportant that judicial nominees understand that, as judges, they are \nnot members of an administration--any administration, Democratic or \nRepublican, but they are judicial officers. They should not be \npolitical partisans, but judges who uphold the Constitution and the \nrule of law for all Americans. That is what Justice Stevens did in \nHamdan, which held the Bush administration's military tribunals \nunconstitutional, and what he tried to do in Citizens United. That is \nwhy intervention by an activist conservative majority in the 2000 \nPresidential election in Bush v. Gore was so jarring and wrong. Mr. \nGore had gotten the majority of votes throughout the country, but there \nwas just one vote on the Supreme Court that he didn't get--the one vote \nthat decided the election. That one vote was given to President Bush.\n  During her confirmation hearings, Solicitor General Kagan reflected \nan understanding of the judicial role and the traditional view of \ndeference to Congress and judicial precedent. This is the mainstream \nview and one once embraced by conservatives. She indicated she would \nnot be the kind of Justice who would substitute her personal \npreferences and overrule congressional efforts designed to protect \nhard-working Americans pursuant to our constitutional role. In fact, it \nis precisely because of Solicitor General Kagan's independence that \nmany Republicans have announced their opposition to her nomination. \nThey oppose her not because she would be a judicial activist as they \nclaim, but rather because she would not overrule Congress as much as \nthey would like. They seem not to like the fact that she is genuinely \ncommitted to judicial restraint rather than furthering a conservative \nideological agenda.\n  Some who oppose this nomination do so because they seek to make this \nnomination a continuation of the fight over health care. They seek to \ntransform this policy dispute they lost in Congress into a \nconstitutional one that goes against 100 years of law and Supreme Court \nprecedents. They would turn back the clock by resurrecting long-\ndiscredited legal doctrines wisely rejected nearly a century ago. They \noppose Solicitor General Kagan because she will not commit to a narrow \nand outmoded legal view that would undermine the constitutionality of \nhealth insurance reform.\n  Congress has enacted and the President has signed into law the \nlandmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. I believe Congress \nwas right to do so in order to address our health care crisis and \nensure that Americans who work hard their entire lives are not robbed \nof their family's security because health care is too expensive. We \nwere right to make sure that hard-working Americans do not risk \nbankruptcy with every illness. Many Republican Senators disagreed, as \nis their right, and voted against the law. But many of those who \nopposed this law now seek to do in the courts what they could not do by \nobstruction in Congress. They are so adamant in seeking this result, \nthat they would turn back the clock by resurrecting long-discredited \nlegal doctrines wisely rejected a nearly a century ago.\n  In framing their opposition to health insurance reform as a \nconstitutional attack, these critics would also undermine the \nconstitutional basis of laws against child labor and those setting a \nminimum wage or the Social Security Act, Medicare, the Clean Water Act, \nthe Clean Air Act, and the landmark Civil Rights Acts. All are \nconstitutional because of Congress's authority to legislate pursuant to \nthe core powers vested in Congress by article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, including the general welfare clause, the commerce \nclause, and the necessary and proper clause. The radical consequences \nof a narrow-minded agenda would be to erode the Supreme Court's time-\nhonored interpretation of these enumerated powers that give Congress \nthe ability to promote the general welfare of the American people.\n  These critics wish to return to the conservative judicial activism of \nthe early 1900s, a period known by reference to one of its most \nnotorious cases, the 1905 Lochner decision in which the Supreme Court \nstruck down a New York State law protecting the health of bakers by \nregulating the number of hours they could work.\n  During this period of unbridled conservative judicial activism, the \nSupreme Court substituted their own views of property for those of the \nelected branches in order to strike down nearly 200 laws, including \nlaws outlawing child labor--something we take for granted today--and \nlaws protecting Americans from sick chickens--something that created a \nhuge health hazard. They envisioned their principal role as the \ndefender of business's profits--profits they made with child labor--and \nthe protector of unrestrained ability to perform contracts, however \nonerous or one-sided. The American people suffered. Their rights went \nunprotected. Congress was unable to provide assistance. That is not a \ntime anyone should want to return to because it was based on artificial \nlegal restraints that shackled the people's elected representatives in \nCongress.\n  Millions of Americans rely on Social Security, Medicare, unemployment \nbenefits, minimum wage laws, and other programs to protect Americans in \ntough economic times. This radical conservative agenda is a threat to \nFederal disaster relief and environmental\n\n[[Page S6600]]\n\nregulations and even laws responding to the reckless and fraudulent \nbehavior that wrecked our economy.\n  Progressive opponents of these artificial legal restraints ultimately \nsucceeded, with the support of the American people, in establishing \nSocial Security, minimum wage laws, and antidiscrimination laws to \nprotect the American people. The programs of the New Deal that helped \nAmericans through the Great Depression would be unconstitutional if \nradical conservative critics had their way. Radical conservatives who \nseek to again impose artificial legal restraints on Congress and the \nAmerican people would abandon the New Deal programs of the 1930s such \nas social security and the Great Society programs of the 1960s such as \nMedicare to the detriment of the American people. These are the \nprograms that for the last 75 years have helped the United States \nbecome a world leader, with the economic security of our citizens \nleading our economy to grow to lead the world.\n  Millions of Americans rely on Social Security, Medicare, unemployment \nbenefits, minimum wage laws and other programs that protect American \nfamilies in tough economic times such as these. This is no academic \ndiscussion. This radical conservative agenda is a threat to Federal \ndisaster relief, environmental regulations, and even laws responding to \nthe reckless and fraudulent behavior that wrecked the economy. \nAmerica's great safety net for those in need would be left in tatters \nif this outmoded legal doctrine were to take root.\n  Ask our fellow Americans in the gulf, those who have lost their jobs \nin the recession and those who have lost their homes, whether the Court \nshould adopt this radical view of the limits of Congress's power to \nhelp them. Ask them if they want to roll back the clock and overturn \nlaws passed by Congress to protect hard-working Americans. The \nconservative agenda to restore the Lochner era would leave hard-working \nAmericans without the protection their lifetimes of hard work have \nearned them.\n  The fact that Elena Kagan will not state that she shares the views of \nthose who opposed helping hard-working Americans obtain access to \naffordable health care does not mean she is outside the mainstream--far \nfrom it. The fact that some Republican critics opposed health care \nreform does not make it unconstitutional.\n  The Constitution in fact provides a clear basis for Congress' \nauthority to enact health care insurance reform. Our Constitution \nbegins with a preamble that sets forth the purposes for which ``We the \nPeople of the United States'' ordained and established it. Among the \npurposes set forth by the Founders was that the Constitution was \nestablished to ``promote the general Welfare.'' It is hard to imagine \nan issue more fundamental to the general welfare of all Americans than \ntheir health. The authority and responsibility for taking actions to \nfurther this purpose is vested in Congress by article I of the \nConstitution. As I stated earlier, article I, section 8, sets forth \nseveral of the core powers of Congress, including the general welfare \nclause, the commerce clause and the necessary and proper clause. These \nclauses form the basis for Congress's power.\n  Any serious questions about congressional power to take comprehensive \naction to build and secure the social safety net have been settled over \nthe past century. As noted by Tom Schaller, enforcing the individual \nmandate requirement by a tax penalty is far from unprecedented, despite \nthe claims of critics. Individuals pay for Social Security and \nMedicare, for example, by payroll taxes collected under the Federal \nInsurance Contributions Act, FICA. These FICA payments are typically \ncollected as deductions and noted on Americans' paychecks every month. \nProfessor Schaller wrote:\n\n       These are the two biggest government-sponsored insurance \n     programs administered by the [Federal Government], and two of \n     the largest line items in the federal budget. These paycheck \n     deductions are not optional, and for all but the self-\n     employed they are taken out immediately.\n\n  The individual mandate requirement in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act is hardly revolutionary when viewed against the \nbackground of Social Security and Medicare that have long required \nindividual payments.\n\n  Congress has woven America's social safety net over the last \nthreescore and 13 years, beginning before I was born. Congress's \nauthority to use its judgment to promote the general welfare cannot now \nbe in doubt. America and all Americans are the better for it. Growing \nold no longer means growing poor. Being older or poor no longer means \nbeing without medical care. These developments are all due in part to \ncongressional action.\n  The Supreme Court settled the debate on the constitutionality of \nSocial Security more than 70 years ago in three 1937 decisions. In one \nof those decisions, Helvering v. Davis, Justice Cardozo wrote that the \ndiscretion to determine whether a matter impacts the general welfare \nfalls ``within the wide range of discretion permitted to the \nCongress.'' Turning then to the ``nation-wide calamity that began in \n1929'' of unemployment spreading from state to state throughout the \nNation, Justice Cardozo wrote of the Social Security Act: ``The hope \nbehind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the \npoor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits \nthem when journey's end is near.'' In the Supreme Court's decision \nupholding the constitutionality of Social Security, Justice Benjamin \nCardozo, one of our greatest jurists, explained that it is the people's \nelected representatives in Congress that consider the general welfare \nof the country and laws to secure it. He recognized that it was the \npeople's wisdom as enacted through their representatives that was to be \nrespected, not the personal preference of a small elite group of \njudges.\n  The Supreme Court reached its decisions upholding Social Security \nafter the first Justice Roberts--Justice Owen Roberts--in the exercise \nof good judgment and judicial restraint began voting to uphold key New \nDeal legislation. He was not alone. It was Chief Justice Hughes who \nwrote the Supreme Court's opinion in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish \nupholding minimum wage requirements as reasonable regulation. The \nSupreme Court also upheld a Federal farm bankruptcy law, railroad labor \nlegislation, and the Wagner Act on labor relations. In so doing, the \nSupreme Court abandoned its judicially created veto over congressional \naction with which it disagreed on policy grounds and rightfully \ndeferred to Congress's constitutional authority.\n  The opponents of health care insurance reform are now opposing the \nnomination of Elena Kagan and now going to the extreme to attempt to \ncall into question the constitutionality of America's established \nsocial safety net. They would turn back the clock to the hardships of \nthe Great Depression, and thrust modern America back into the \nconditions of a Charles Dickens novel. That path should be rejected \nagain now, just as it was when Americans confronted great economic \nchallenges more than 70 years ago. To attempt to strike down principles \nthat have been settled for nearly three-quarters of a century is wrong, \ndamaging to the Nation, and would stand the Constitution on its head.\n  Due to Republican obstruction, it took an extraordinary majority of \n60 Senators, not a simple majority of 51, for the Senate's will to be \ndone. The fact that Senate Republicans disagree with the effort to help \nhardworking Americans obtain access to affordable health care does not \nmake it unconstitutional. As Justice Cardozo wrote for the Supreme \nCourt 73 years ago in upholding Social Security:\n\n       [W]hether wisdom or unwisdom resides in the scheme of \n     benefits set forth . . . it is not for us to say. The answer \n     to such inquiries must come from Congress, not the courts.\n\n  Justice Cardozo understood the separation of powers enshrined in the \nConstitution and the powers entrusted by our Constitution to Congress. \nThis is true judicial modesty reflecting the understanding of the \nrespective roles of Congress and the courts. Surely when Congress acts \nto provide for the general welfare of all Americans it does so pursuant \nto its constitutional authority.\n  I believe that Congress was right when it decided that the lack of \naffordable health care and health insurance and the rising health care \ncosts that\n\n[[Page S6601]]\n\nburden the American people are problems, ``plainly national in area and \ndimensions.'' Those were the words Justice Cardozo used to describe the \nwidespread crisis of unemployment and insecurity during the Great \nDepression. I believe that it was right for Congress to determine that \nit is in the general welfare of the Nation to ensure that all Americans \nhave access to affordable quality health care. Whether other Senators \nagree or disagree, I would hope that none would contend that we should \nturn back the clock to the Great Depression when conservative activist \njudges prevented Congress from exercising its powers, making its \nlegislative determinations and helping the American people through \ntough economic times. Sadly, some are making precisely that argument \nand contend that this settled meaning of the Constitution should be \nupended.\n  The dark days of unbridled conservative judicial activism in which \nCongress's hands were tied from outlawing child labor and enacting a \nminimum wage and social security are long gone and better left behind. \nThe Constitution, Supreme Court precedent, our history and the \ninterests of the American people all stand on the side of Congress's \nauthority to enact health care insurance reform legislation.\n  Under article I, section 8, Congress has the power ``to regulate \nCommerce\n. . . among the several States.'' Since at least the time of the Great \nDepression and the New Deal, Congress has been understood and \nacknowledged by the Supreme Court to have power pursuant to the \ncommerce clause to regulate matters with a substantial effect on \ninterstate commerce. That is consistent with Elena Kagan's testimony.\n  In Solicitor General Kagan's responses to questions about the \ncommerce clause I heard an echo of Justice Cardozo's explanation for \nwhy Social Security is constitutional and of Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes's famous dissent in Lochner. In particular, I recall Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan's response to a question from Senator Coburn that he \nlater admitted was intended to get her to signal how she would decide a \nconstitutional challenge to health care insurance reform. He asked \nSolicitor General Kagan what she thought of a hypothetical law \nrequiring Americans to eat three vegetables a day. She went on to \nexplain:\n\n       I think the question of whether it's a dumb law is \n     different from . . . the question of whether it's \n     constitutional, and . . . I think that courts would be wrong \n     to strike down laws that they think . . . are senseless just \n     because they're senseless.\n\n  The Supreme Court long ago upheld laws like the Fair Labor Standards \nAct against legal challenges, overruling its decision barring Congress \nfrom outlawing child labor and establishing basic working conditions \nsuch as a minimum wage. The days when women and children could not be \nprotected are gone. The time when the public could not be protected \nfrom sick chickens infecting them are gone. The years when farmers \ncould not be protected from market failures or natural disasters are \ngone. The era of conservative activist judges voiding regulation that \ndid not guarantee profits to corporations should be gone. The reach of \nCongress's commerce clause authority has been long established and \nwell-settled. Solicitor General Kagan's answer to Senator Coburn's \nquestion reflects not only this well-settled understanding, but also \nthe understanding of the proper roles of each of the branches that was \nrestored when the Supreme Court rejected the misguided conservative \nactivism of the Lochner era.\n  Since the great Chief Justice Marshall's interpretation of the \ncommerce clause in 1824, Congress has been understood and acknowledged \nby the Supreme Court to have the power ``to prescribe rules'' to govern \ncommerce that ``concerns more than one State.'' It was this same \nunderstanding that Justice Cardozo followed in upholding the Social \nSecurity Act and that Justice Felix Frankfurter later praised as Chief \nJustice Marshall's extraordinary achievement of capturing, for all \ntime, the essential meaning of the commerce clause. Pursuant to this \nunderstanding of its power under the commerce clause, Congress enacted \nnot only Federal disaster relief from the 18th century but also the \n1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting racial discrimination by public \naccommodations and the landmark Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, both of \nwhich President Nixon signed into law. Would conservative activists now \nargue that these acts, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Air Act and the \nClean Water Act, should suddenly be declared unconstitutional as beyond \nCongress's power?\n  Even recent decisions by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican-\nappointed justices have affirmed this rule of law. In 2005, the Supreme \nCourt ruled in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress had the power under the \ncommerce clause to prohibit the use of medical marijuana. This was \nupheld even though the marijuana was grown and consumed at home. It was \nupheld on the same rationale as Wickard v. Filburn in 1942, because of \nits impact on the national market for marijuana. Yet Republican \nSenators and conservative ideologues contend that Wickard should be \ndiscarded. Would they also demand that Federal laws against drugs be \ndeclared unconstitutional?\n  Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sandra O'Connor, both \nconservative Justices appointed by Republican Presidents, astutely \nnoted in their 1995 concurrence in United States v. Lopez:\n\n       [T]the Court as an institution and the legal system as a \n     whole have an immense stake in the stability of our Commerce \n     Clause jurisprudence as it has evolved to this point. [That] \n     fundamental restraint on our power forecloses us from \n     reverting to an understanding of commerce that would serve \n     only an 18th-century economy . . . and mandates against \n     returning to the time when congressional authority to \n     regulate undoubted commercial activities was limited by a \n     judicial determination that those matters had an insufficient \n     connection to an interstate system.\n\n  They are right as a matter of law and right when it comes to the \ninterests of the American people.\n  The Constitution also provides in article I, section 8, that Congress \nhas the power ``to make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper \nfor carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers \nvested by his Constitution in the United States.'' The Supreme Court \nsettled the meaning of the necessary and proper clause almost 200 years \nago in Justice Marshall's landmark decision for the Supreme Court in \nMcCullough v. Maryland, during the dispute over the National Bank. \nJustice Marshall wrote that ``the clause is placed among the powers of \nCongress, not among the limitations on those powers.''\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of \n     the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which \n     are plainly adopted to that end, which are not prohibited, \n     but consistent with the letter and spirit of the \n     Constitution, are constitutional.\n\n  He concluded by declaring, in accordance with a proper understanding \nof the necessary and proper clause, that Congress should not be \ndeprived ``of the capacity to avail itself of experience, to exercise \nits reason, and to accommodate its legislation to human affairs'' by \njudicial fiat. Chief Justice Marshall understood the Constitution, knew \nits text and knew the Framers. He rejected the constraints on Congress \nthat conservative activists now propose in order to empower \nconservative judicial activism.\n  The necessary and proper clause goes hand in hand with the commerce \nclause to ensure congressional authority to regulate activity with \neconomic impact. Just this year the Supreme Court upheld provisions of \nthe Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, a law we passed to \nallow for the civil commitment of sexually dangerous Federal prisoners, \nwhich was based on the commerce clause and the necessary and proper \nclause of the Constitution. As Justice Breyer wrote for seven Justices, \nincluding Chief Justice Roberts:\n\n       [T]he Necessary and Proper Clause makes clear that the \n     Constitution's grants of specific federal legislative \n     authority are accompanied by broad power to enact laws that \n     are ``convenient, or useful'' or ``conducive'' to the \n     authority's ``beneficial exercise.''\n\n  Congress passes laws like the Adam Walsh Act every year to protect \nthe American people. Would those who want to redraft and limit the \nConstitution really want to declare the Adam Walsh Act and its \nprovisions against pedophiles unconstitutional?\n  Solicitor General Kagan's testimony shows that she both understands \nand recognizes, in accordance with the longstanding judgments of both \nCongress and the Supreme Court, that Congress's power to legislate \nunder the commerce clause power and the necessary and proper clause is \nbroad but\n\n[[Page S6602]]\n\nnot unlimited. Indeed, she agreed with the Senator from Texas that the \nSupreme Court's decisions in Lopez and Morrison limit Congress's power \nto legislate ``when the activity that's being regulated is not itself \neconomic in nature and is activity that's traditionally been regulated \nby the States.'' But, she noted that ``to the extent that Congress \nregulates the channels of commerce, the instrumentalities of commerce, \nand . . . things that substantially affect interstate commerce, there \nthe Court has given Congress broad discretion.'' She is right as a \nmatter of law. The American people are able to act through their \nelected representatives in Congress to secure the blessings of liberty \nbecause of this meaning of our Constitution.\n  Through Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, Congress established \nsome of the cornerstones of American economic security. And \ncomprehensive health insurance reform has now joined them. Congress has \nacted within its constitutional authority to legislate for the general \nwelfare of all Americans, whether they are from Vermont or West \nVirginia or Alabama or anywhere else. No conservative activist court \nshould overstep the judiciary's role by seeking to turn back the clock \nand deny a century of progress.\n  Those who would corrupt the Constitution by trying to revive the \nLochner era are intent on a results-oriented litmus test. This litmus \ntest would lead them now not just to vote against this nomination and \nthe confirmation of Justice Thurgood Marshall as they have said, but \nalso against Senate confirmation of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, \nJustice David Souter, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice Anthony \nKennedy--four Justices appointed by conservative Republican Presidents, \nall nominations I voted to confirm.\n  It is interesting. I was here when John Paul Stevens' nomination came \nup. He was seen as a conservative from Illinois. He was nominated by a \nconservative President, Gerald Ford. He nominated him, and 2\\1/2\\ weeks \nlater, the Senate, which was overwhelmingly Democratic, voted \nunanimously to confirm Justice John Paul Stevens. I have not always \nagreed with every decision of his, but, boy, I have agreed with my vote \nfor his confirmation.\n  With this litmus test I mentioned, it is not just Chief Justice Earl \nWarren, and Justice William Brennan and Justice Thurgood Marshall whose \njurisprudence they are rejecting. Using these results-oriented litmus \ntests would require us to reject the vast majority of Justices who have \nserved honorably on the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justice Benjamin \nCardozo, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Justice Harlan Fiske \nStone, and Justice Charles Evans Hughes. I assume they would, as well, \nreject the greatest judge not to have been appointed to the Supreme \nCourt, the Second Circuit's Judge Learned Hand, because he had been an \noutspoken critic of the so-called economic due process doctrine that \nallowed activist conservatives to substitute their views for those of \nCongress. Indeed, if they were to be consistent, they would have to \nrethink their support for the current Chief Justice, John Roberts, who \ntestified at his confirmation hearing that during the Lochner era, when \nthe Supreme Court was striking down economic regulations in the late \n1800s to the early 1930s, to quote John Roberts, ``it's quite clear \nthat they [were] not interpreting the law, they [were] making the \nlaw.'' I agree with him. I will say parenthetically that I wish he had \nstayed consistent to that principle since he became Chief Justice. The \ndemand by critics that Solicitor General Kagan adhere to legal views \nthat would put her at odds with so many great Justices as the price of \ntheir vote is a strong reminder of how far many are seeking to stray \nfrom basic constitutional principles and traditions.\n  We do not need judges or Justices to pass a litmus test from either \nthe right or the left. In fact, I have urged Senators--they have heard \nme say this many times--do not listen to the single issue or special \nissue groups on either the right or the left when it comes to the \nSupreme Court. We have 300 million Americans in this great country. \nMost of the Justices we vote on will be here long after any one of us \nleaves this Chamber. There are only 100 Americans who actually get to \nvote on them. There are actually 101 people who are involved in this \nchoice--first, the President, who nominates the person, but he cannot \nappoint the person unless we advise and consent. So we have 101 people \nwith this awesome duty to pick somebody and to vote on somebody who is \ngoing to be there to protect the justice and the rights of all 300 \nmillion Americans. It is an awesome responsibility.\n  I tell groups of either the right or the left--and I have heard from \nmany of them over the years on all these nominees on whom I voted--I am \ngoing to make up my own mind. I am going to bring my own Vermont \nprinciples, my own sense of Vermont fairness, my own experience, my own \njudgment to bear, and then I will make up my mind. I urge all Senators \nto do that. Ignore the special interest groups on the right or the \nleft. Make up your own mind.\n  As I said, we do not need judges or Justices who would pass a litmus \ntest from the right or the left. We need judges and Justices who will \nrespect the laws as passed by Congress and appreciate that adherence to \nprecedence is a foundation of public confidence in our courts.\n  (Mrs. SHAHEEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is important that we restore public confidence in our \ncourts. They do protect our rights. They do protect the Constitution. \nBut we have to make sure we respect what they do. We need judges and \nJustices who will fairly apply the law and use common sense, Justices \nand judges who appreciate the proper role of the courts in our \ndemocracy and make decisions in light of the fundamental purposes of \nthe law. This is the standard I applied when reviewing this nomination. \nIt is the same standard I applied to every Supreme Court nomination, \nincluding six Justices nominated by Republican Presidents for whom I \nhave voted. It is a standard I believe Solicitor General Kagan has met.\n  Solicitor General Kagan not only has the necessary qualifications to \nbe a Supreme Court Justice but has also demonstrated her respect for \nthe rule of law, her appreciation for the separation of powers, and \nunderstands the meaning of our Constitution. Some may not want our \ncountry to move forward, to make progress, to move toward a more \nperfect union. But the issue squarely before this body is whether \nSolicitor General Kagan has the necessary qualifications, respect for \nthe rule of law, and judicial independence to be confirmed by the \nSenate to serve on our Nation's highest court. I believe she does. This \nVermonter will vote for Elena Kagan to be a Supreme Court Justice, and \nI will do it proudly.\n  Madam President--the Chair having changed during this speech, first \npresided over by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and now \nmy distinguished neighbor, the State of New Hampshire--the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire presides. With that, I will \nclose.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama on the floor. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate Chairman Leahy. He is a \nstrong and effective leader of our committee. We agree a lot of times. \nI try to work with him, and sometimes we disagree. One thing we will \nsoon be doing that I look forward to very much is going to the White \nHouse--maybe in 30 minutes or so--to participate in the signing of a \nbill to eliminate the vast disparity between crack and powder cocaine \nsentences. The sentencing mechanism under the guidelines I think was \nunfair and needed to be corrected. I have been working on that issue \nfor some time, and so has Chairman Leahy. We certainly agree on a lot \nof issues and get some things done, but we do not agree on this \nnomination.\n  The office of Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is one of the most \nimportant positions in our National Government. Justices are granted a \ndegree of\n\n[[Page S6603]]\n\nindependence unequaled anywhere in the United States. Justices hold \nlifetime terms, subject only to impeachment, and Congress may not even \nreduce their pay. Why did the Founders take such a step? They wanted \nour courts to be impartial, doing justice to the poor and the rich \nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States, as their oath \nsays, and they did not want them subject to political or other \npressures that might affect their objectivity. They wanted judges who \ncould do the right thing year after year, day after day.\n  Presidents get to nominate, but the Senate must confirm. This advise-\nand-consent power the Constitution gives is a confirmation process; it \nis not a coronation. Here, five Justices on the Supreme Court can \nhold--and four of them recently voted to, not the five necessary to \nrender a majority opinion--that a company cannot publish a book or a \npamphlet that criticizes a politician before an election. Five justices \ncan hold that the government can allow States and cities to deny \nAmericans the personal right to keep and bear arms, a right clearly \nstated in the Constitution.\n\n  The American people have no direct control over these Justices. All \nthey have and what they have a right to expect is that our Justices \nexercise self-control year after year, decade after decade. If this \nyoung nominee, Elena Kagan, were to serve to the age of the individual \nshe seeks to replace, she would serve 38 years on the Supreme Court.\n  Well, I am not able to support Elena Kagan for this office. I believe \nshe does not have the gifts and the qualities of mind or temperament \none must have to be a Justice. Worse still, she possesses a judicial \nphilosophy that does not properly value discipline, restraint, and \nrigorous intellectual honesty. Instead, she seems to admire the view, \nand has as her judicial heroes, judges who favor expansive readings of \nwhat they call the living Constitution; whereby, judges seek--and in \nPresident Obama's words, who certainly shares this view--to advance ``a \nbroader vision of what America should be.''\n  Well, I don't believe that is a responsibility or a power given to \njudges--to advance visions of what America should be. Whose vision is \nit they would advance, I would ask. It would be the judge's vision. But \nthey weren't appointed for that purpose. They were appointed to \nadjudicate cases.\n  President Obama's judicial philosophy, I think, is flawed, and I \ncertainly think Ms. Kagan shares his philosophy. The President \nbasically said so when he appointed her. Her friends say it is so. Her \ncritics say so. Her record of public action says so, and the style and \nmanner of her testimony at the hearing evidenced such an approach to \njudging. I don't think it is a secret. I think this is pretty well \nknown, that this is not a nominee committed to restraint or objectivity \nbut one who believes in the power of judges to expand and advance the \nlaw and visions of what the judge may think is best for America.\n  Ms. Kagan has been described as collegial, engaging, a consensus \nbuilder. These are fine qualities in many circumstances, and I am sure \nshe possesses them. She seems to. But as to personal discipline, \nclarity of mind, the ability to come quickly to the heart of a matter, \nobjectivity or impartiality, and scrupulous intellectual honesty--\ncharacteristics essential for a judge--not so much has been said. \nPerhaps this is so because many liberal activists in America have lost \nfaith in the idea of objectivity, which means they have lost faith in \nthe reality of objective truth, the finding of which--the finding of \ntruth--has been the goal, the central focus of the American legal \nsystem since its creation.\n  Our modern law school minds and some false intellectuals far removed \nfrom real trials--and I have had the honor and privilege to have spent \n15 years trying cases before Federal judges and so I have a sense of \nthis, I truly believe--are removed from these trials and from the \nnecessity of rules for civil order. They think, many of them do--these \nprofessors and theoreticians--that laws are just tools for the powerful \nto control the powerless and that words can't have fixed meanings. \nThings change. We can't consult 16th century dictionaries to find out \nwhat the Founding Fathers meant when they wrote our Constitution. \nIndeed, Justice Sotomayor recently confirmed this when she quoted, with \napproval, the line: ``There is no objectivity, just a series of \nperspectives.''\n  Americans are sick of political spin by politicians, and they do not \nwant it from judges. They reject judges who rely on their empathy, as \nthe President said a judge must have and that is what he looks for in a \njudge. The American people don't believe judges should rely on their \nempathy to decide legal cases or seek to advance their vision of what \nAmerica should be. They know Justices are not above the law. They know \nJustices should be neutral umpires, not taking sides in the game. Above \nall, they know judges--especially Supreme Court Justices--should not \nlegislate from the bench.\n  I do not desire that the Supreme Court advance my political views. It \nis enough, day after day, that the Court follows the law deciding cases \nhonestly. No more should ever be asked of them. I might not agree one \nday with this case or that one, but we have a right to expect those \njudges would be objective and not promote agendas. A recent commentator \nonce said: ``We liberals have gotten to the point where we want the \ncourt to do for us that which we can no longer win at the ballot box.''\n  Well, this nominee, I think, in my honest evaluation, comes from that \nmold. Yes, she is young, but her philosophy is not. It is an old, \nbankrupt judicial activism--a philosophy the American people correctly \nreject. In her writings, her judicial heroes, her extensive political \nactivities, her actions at Harvard to unlawfully restrict the military, \nher hostility to congressional actions against terrorism in a letter \nshe wrote, her efforts to block restrictions on partial-birth abortion \nwhile in the Clinton White House, her arguments before the Supreme \nCourt last year that Congress can ban pamphlets criticizing politicians \nand, perhaps the most disturbing to me as someone who spent 15 years in \nthe Department of Justice, her actions as Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, whereby she failed to defend the don't ask, don't tell \ncongressional law--not military policy, a law she had openly, deeply \nopposed but promised to vigorously defend were she to be confirmed as \nSolicitor General--leave no doubt what kind of judge she would be: an \nactivist, liberal, progressive, politically minded judge who will not \nbe happy simply to decide cases but will seek to advance her causes \nunder the guise of judging.\n  In addition, her defense of these positions at her hearings, her \ntestimony, in my opinion, lacked clarity, accuracy, and the kind of \nintellectual honesty you look for in someone who would sit on such a \nhigh and important Court. Indeed, her testimony was curious. She failed \nto convey to the committee, in my opinion, a recognition of the gravity \nof the issues with which she had been dealing and the nature of her \nrole in dealing with some of these issues that she was involved with in \nher career. She seemed to suggest that things happened around her and \nshe did all things right and no one should get upset about it.\n  Some of these concerns, I think, could have been overcome, had we \nseen the superb quality of testimony at her hearing as given by that of \nJustices Roberts and Alito at their hearings. But, alas, that we did \nnot see, not even close. Glib, at times humorous, conversant on many \nissues but not impressive on any in a more serious way, in my view. \nBased on so little serious legal practice--only 2 years, right out of \nlaw school in a law firm and 14 months as Solicitor General--this \nperhaps should not be surprising. The power of the testimony of Roberts \nand Alito did not spring fully formed from their minds either, though \nboth seemed to be naturally gifted in the skills needed for superior \njudges, and I fear Elena Kagan is not so blessed.\n  While she is truly intelligent, the exceptional qualities of her mind \nmay be better suited to dealing with students and unruly faculty than \nwith the daily hard work of deciding tough cases before the Supreme \nCourt. But Roberts and Alito, on the other hand, were steeped in the \nlaw over many years as lawyers and judges. That is who they were. That \nis their skill. That was their craft. That was their business. They \nunderstood it. It showed. Ms. Kagan did not show that. I believe that\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\nlack of experience was part of the reason her testimony was \nunconvincing.\n  I think a real lawyer or experienced judge who had seen the courtroom \nand the practice of law would not have tried, as she did, to float \ntheir way through the hearing in the manner she did. Her testimony \nfailed to evidence an understanding of the gravity of the issues with \nwhich she was dealing and the important nature of her role in them. She \nseemed to suggest these events just happened around her, none of which \nwas her responsibility. Several times in the course of her testimony \nshe inaccurately described the circumstances and the nature of the \nmatters in which she had been engaged, to a significant degree. Her \ntestimony was more consistent with the spin the White House was \nputting out than the truth. I was surprised and disappointed that she \nwas not more candid and did not, through accurate testimony, dispel \nsome of the false spin that had been put out in her favor.\n\n  So now we are at the beginning of the discussion of the Kagan \nnomination. While I have been firm in my criticisms of the nominee, I \nhave given considerable thought to the criticism that I have made and \ntried not to be inaccurate in them. I believe they are correct. But if \nI am in error, I will be pleased to admit and correct that error. No \nnominee should have their record unfairly sullied in this great Senate. \nThat would be wrong. I, therefore, ask and challenge the supporters of \nthe nominee to point out any errors in my remarks as we go forth so we \ncan, above all, get the facts straight.\n  The matters I will set forth today and later are serious. There is \ndisagreement, I believe, between what the record, the facts, and the \ntestimony show and the White House spin and even the Kagan spin--and I \nuse that word carefully. So let us, therefore, begin this debate in all \nseriousness. Let us get to the bottom of these matters. There is a \ntruth. We can ascertain what happened. Let us find out what happened in \nthese matters. Let us get to the bottom of it.\n  Some raise the question of how many Republicans will vote for the \nnominee. Another question to ask is: How many Democrats will vote \nagainst the nominee? I call on every Senator to study the record and \nmake an informed and independent decision. We are not lemmings. We have \na constitutional duty to make an independent decision. So I urge my \nDemocratic colleagues to not just be a rubberstamp, to not allow \npolitical pressures to influence your decisions but conduct an \nindependent and fair analysis of the nominee. I believe if Senators \nstrongly advocate and believe judges should follow the law, not make \nit; that they should serve under the Constitution and not above it; \nthat they should be impartial and objective--if Senators believe in \nthat--they should have very serious trouble with this nomination.\n  At this moment I am going to briefly mention a few of the serious \nconcerns that were raised in the committee. I will in greater detail go \nthrough each of them in the next several days. I am sure other Senators \nwill talk about them also. I will attempt to do so honestly and fairly, \nand at the end I will be listening to see if somehow I have misjudged \nthe nominee on these matters and whether I should change my views. But \nI am very serious when I say the actions of this nominee over the \nentirety of her career indicate an approach to judging that is \ninconsistent with the classic American view of a judge as one who shows \nrestraint, who follows the law, who adjudicates the matters before the \ncourt, and who is objective and fair.\n  One of the more serious issues that has been discussed quite a bit is \nthe nominee's handling of the U.S. military while she was dean at \nHarvard. She reversed Harvard's policy and banned the military from the \ncampus recruiting office. During that period of time a protest against \nthe military was held. She spoke to that protest crowd while in the \nbuilding next door a military recruiter was attempting to recruit \nHarvard students for the U.S. military.\n  She participated in the writing of a brief to oppose the don't ask, \ndon't tell policy which she deeply opposed.\n  The U.S. military did not have a policy called don't ask, don't tell. \nThat was a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President \nClinton. It was the law of the land and it was not their choice. They \nfollowed, saluted, and did their duty. Yet Ms. Kagan barred them from \nthe campus at Harvard. On four different occasions this Congress passed \nlaws to try to ensure that our military men and women, during a time of \ntwo wars, were not discriminated against on college campuses in this \ncountry. One of them was a few months before, finally, it was written \nin a way they could not figure out a way to get around it. That was \nshortly before she barred them from the campus, subjecting Harvard to \nloss of Federal funds, which resulted in the military, when they \nfinally realized that she had reversed this policy and found out they \nhad been stonewalled and the front door of the university had been \nclosed to them, appealed to the president of Harvard University and he \nreversed her position. It was not justified. It was wrong. It should \nnot have been done.\n  She did not seem to complain about the policy when she worked for \nPresident Clinton, who signed the law. But she punished the men and \nwomen who were prepared to serve and defend our country, and Harvard's \nfreedom to carry on whatever these silly activities they want to carry \non. So this is not a little bitty matter.\n  When she was nominated for Solicitor General, this was raised and she \nwas asked what if this don't ask, don't tell law is challenged in the \nCourt? We know you oppose it. We know you have steadfastly opposed it. \nWill you defend it? It is the law of the land. You will be Solicitor \nGeneral. You represent the U.S. Government before the Supreme Court. \nWill you defend it?\n  She flat out said that she would defend the laws passed by Congress \nand specifically promised to defend don't ask, don't tell. This is a \nmatter of some importance. I asked her about it, gave her opportunity \nto respond. She took 10 minutes--I did not interrupt her--with her \nexplanation of why she did not assert an appeal to the Ninth Circuit \nruling that seriously undermined don't ask, don't tell, because we know \nPresident Obama opposes it and we know she opposed it. We know the ACLU \nopposed it. They were the litigants in this case. She met with the \nACLU.\n  The ACLU did not want the Ninth Circuit case to go up to the Supreme \nCourt. Why? The reason is they expected the Supreme Court would affirm \nthe law. So what did Elena Kagan do? Did she vigorously defend the law? \nDid she take the opportunity to take this case to the Supreme Court and \nseek its affirmation by the Supreme Court? No, she allowed the case to \nbe sent back--without appealing it--to a lower court to go through a \nlong, prolonged process of discovery and trial that is disconnected to \nthe plain fact of the legality of the policy. She did not properly \ndefend the laws of the United States and she did not defend the law in \nthis matter.\n  The Solicitor General has that duty whether they like the law or not. \nCongressional actions, when challenged, should be defended, \nparticularly one so easily defended, in my opinion, as this one. I \nbelieve that is a serious matter, so serious that if my analysis is \ncorrect, that she failed to defend that action after explicitly having \npromised to do so, then this is disqualifying in itself. She would have \nallowed her personal views, political pressures from perhaps her \nappointing officer, President Obama, to influence her decision in a way \nthat went against her duty as Solicitor General. We are going to talk \nabout that in great detail as we go along.\n  As Solicitor General in the 14 months that she was there, she \napproved a filing of a brief calling on the Supreme Court to review and \noverturn a ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that had \naffirmed an Arizona law that said Arizona businesses that failed to use \nE-Verify or otherwise hire people who are illegally in the country \nwould lose their business license. There is a Federal statute that \nexplicitly says States can revoke licenses of businesses that violate \nour immigration laws.\n  This is quite a bit stronger case than the other Arizona case that I \nthink is improvidently being challenged, also by the Obama Department \nof Justice. But she approved this and again the trial court had ruled \nthe law was good. The Ninth Circuit, the most liberal activist circuit \nin the country, approved\n\n[[Page S6605]]\n\nit unanimously, and now it is before the Supreme Court and now she \nasked that the Supreme Court take it and reverse that.\n  I think this was bad judgment legally, and I believe it is another \nexample of her personal policy views influencing the decisions she made \nas a government official--not the kind of thing you want in a Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  Then there was the time she was in the Clinton White House and became \ninvolved in the great debate we had in the Senate, that went on for a \nperiod of years, over the partial-birth abortion issue, where unborn \nbabies are partially removed from the mother and there are techniques \nused to remove the child's brain. It is a horrible procedure. The \nphysicians group, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, ACOG, had issued a finding that there was never any \nmedical necessity for this horrible procedure that Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan referred to as so terribly close to infanticide.\n  President Clinton apparently was prepared to support a ban on this \nprocedure. But Ms. Kagan, as a member of his staff, advised that it \nmight be unconstitutional. In her notes from her time at the Clinton \nWhite House, she said the groups, that is, the pro-abortion groups--the \ngroups will go crazy. She even got ACOG to issue a new statement and \nwas able to influence President Clinton to oppose the legislation. Six \nor 8 years went by before we finally passed a law banning the \nprocedure.\n  When I raised this at her hearing, she tried to make it seem like she \nhad nothing much to do with it, like she just happened to be in the \nWhite House. She said, ``at all times trying to ensure that President \nClinton's views and objectives were carried forward.'' That is all I \nwas doing.\n  She was asked about that: If that was your view, say so.\n  Well, I was just doing whatever the President wanted me to do.\n  I do not think that was an accurate analysis of it. Sometime after it \nbecame clear that ACOG had reversed its position--it caused quite a bit \nof national controversy. She was right at the center of that, \ncontacting the leaders of ACOG and prompting them to change the wording \nof their statement without talking to the professionals on the \ncommittee that had issued the original analysis. There was never any \nneed for this kind of procedure to take place. This was concerning to a \nlot of members of the committee. Her testimony is relevant to that.\n\n  With regard to the second amendment, she used the same language in \nher testimony to give the impression that she understood that the \nHeller and the McDonald cases, recently out of Chicago, were settled \nlaw and implied that if she were on the Court, she would vote to uphold \nthe right to keep and bear arms, which is plainly in the Constitution. \nI went back and asked her again. Settled law became mere precedent. \nThat precedent is the 5-to-4 decision in two cases, Heller and \nMcDonald, where by one vote the Supreme Court is upholding the right to \nkeep and bear arms. If one vote were to switch, the Court could rule 5 \nto 4 that any city and any State in America could ban completely the \nright to keep and bear arms, violating what I would say are the plain \nwords of the Constitution. Her actions, both as a law clerk and in the \nClinton White House, indicate she has a hostile view to gun ownership. \nShe grew up on the upper west side of New York. It is pretty clear she \nis one of a group who sees the NRA as a bad group and does not believe \nin gun ownership as a constitutional right. This is a serious matter \nbecause it is such a narrowly decided Court.\n  Who is this nominee? We will learn more about it as the days go by. I \nbelieve her actions, her background, and her approach to judging is \nunhealthy. It is not the kind of thing we need on the Supreme Court. It \nevidences a tendency to promote her political agenda rather than being \nobjective. Who is she? Vice President Biden's chief of staff, Ron \nKlain, a lawyer with whom she worked closely in the Clinton \nadministration and a longtime friend, said of her not long ago:\n\n       Elena is clearly a legal progressive . . . I think Elena is \n     someone who comes from the progressive side of the spectrum. \n     She clerked for judge Mikva\n\n  A renowned Federal activist judge--\n\n     clerked for Justice Marshall--\n\n  One of the most activist Justices on the Supreme Court--\n\n     worked in the Clinton administration, worked in the Obama \n     administration. I don't think there's any mystery to the fact \n     that she is, as I said, more of the progressive role than \n     not.\n\n  What does that mean, a legal progressive? In the early 20th century, \nprogressives thought that intellectuals and the elites in this country \nknew more than the great unwashed, and they were seeking to advance \npolitical agendas that went beyond what a lot of people thought was \nappropriate and constitutional. The progressives saw the Constitution \nas an impediment, not as a protector of our liberties, of our freedom, \nof our prosperity, of our property. They saw it as an impediment to \ngetting done what they would like to do. It is a dangerous philosophy.\n  Ultimately, all our liberties depend on faithful adherence to the \nConstitution--the free speech, free press, the right to a trial by \njury. All those things that are so important to our rights are in that \ndocument.\n  This nominee is indeed of that background. She is not sufficiently \nrespectful of the plain words of the Constitution. She will be the kind \nof activist judge who seeks to advance her vision of what America \nshould be. That is not an appropriate approach for a Justice on the \nSupreme Court to take. That is why I will be opposing the nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that time \nunder the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will proceed on leader time.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                  FMAP\n\n  Madam President, the American people are getting a good reminder this \nweek of why they have lost faith in Washington Democrats. Not only is \none of the last things Democrats plan to vote on here before the August \nrecess another bailout, it is also just the kind of bloated, slapdash \naffair Americans have come to expect and to loathe from Democrats in \nWashington. Basically what we are seeing here this week is the final \nact in Washington's guide for responding to a recession.\n  On Thursday they threw together a bill without even knowing how much \nit would cost the taxpayers, expecting us to vote on it yesterday. When \nthey found out last night it cost more than they thought it would, they \nthrew another bill together and expect us to vote on that one \ntomorrow--just before Senators head out of town. This is precisely the \nkind of rushed and reckless approach to lawmaking that has most \nAmericans thinking congressional Democrats can't go on their August \nrecess fast enough. If it means one less bailout cobbled together \nwithout regard for details or its impact on the taxpayers or its impact \non the debt, taxpayers would probably be glad to help book Democrats' \nplane tickets out of here.\n  Americans are fed up. They have had enough. The trillion-dollar \nstimulus bill was supposed to be timely, targeted and temporary. Yet \nhere we are, a year and a half later, and they are already coming back \nfor more. The $100 billion they got for State education budgets the \nfirst time wasn't enough, even though more than a third of the original \n$100 billion hasn't even been spent yet, and none of the extra money \nthey are asking for will necessarily be used to save teachers' jobs. \nThe purpose of this bill is clear: it is to create a permanent need for \nfuture State bailouts, at a time when we can least afford it.\n  Same goes for health care spending. The original stimulus included \nabout $90 billion in additional Federal Medicaid spending. That too was \nsupposed to be temporary. Yet here we are, a year and a half later, and \nthey want more.\n  So, as I said, the purpose of this bill is clear. It is a last-minute \neffort by\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\nDemocrats in Washington to funnel more money to the public employee \nunions before an election and to set the stage for the massive tax hike \nthat the administration plans to spring on America's small business \nowners on January 1 of next year. Once again, Democrats are showering \nmoney on their favored constituencies and asking the American people to \npay for it with higher taxes, more government, and fewer private sector \njobs.\n  It is time our friends on the other side actually do something to \naddress the jobs crisis in this country. As it is, virtually every bill \nthey pass adds more burdens on the very people we need to get us out of \nthe recession and create jobs. If a bill doesn't kill jobs or make it \nharder to create them, they are not interested. It is time for a \ndifferent approach. The approach of the past year and a half just is \nnot working.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me start by first expressing my \nappreciation to Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions. I have the honor of \nserving on the Judiciary Committee, and I think our leadership--our \nchairman, Senator Leahy, and our ranking Republican member, Senator \nSessions--conducted the confirmation process in the best tradition of \nthe Senate.\n  We had 4 days of hearings before the Judiciary Committee. Every \nmember of the committee was afforded ample opportunity to question \nSolicitor General Kagan on a far range of issues, and we got complete \nresponses. We had chances for followup questions. We even had a third \nround of questioning. We had outside witnesses who were before our \ncommittee. We had a chance to ask them questions as third-party \nvalidators. We also went through tens of thousands of pages of \ndocuments.\n  This was a very thorough confirmation process, a very open \nconfirmation process, and a very fair confirmation process. I do thank \nSenator Sessions, the ranking Republican member, for the way he \ncooperated with Senator Leahy to make sure the Senate did its business \nin getting a full record before voting to confirm Elena Kagan to be an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Solicitor General Elena Kagan has the experience, the intelligence, \nthe integrity, and the temperament to serve as an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. As to her experience, she was \nthe first woman Solicitor General in the history of our Nation. She was \nthe first woman to be dean at the Harvard Law School. Her intelligence \nhas been acknowledged by all as to her being a person who is very \ncapable to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Previous Solicitor Generals, including Charles Fried, Ken Starr, Ted \nOlson, and Paul Clement--Democrats and Republicans--stated that Elena \nKagan would ``bring to the Supreme Court a breadth of experience and a \nhistory of great accomplishment in the law.'' They are Democratic and \nRepublican former Solicitors General.\n  She has the integrity. We have seen third-party validators--Democrats \nand Republicans--testify to her integrity and legal career. She \ncertainly has the temperament. She put up with the Senators' \ninterrogations with a calm demeanor and good humor, which I think will \nserve her well on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  She brings to this position experience from being a clerk for Justice \nThurgood Marshall. I heard his name mentioned many times during this \nconfirmation process. We in Maryland are particularly proud of Thurgood \nMarshall. He comes from the State of Maryland. He comes from Baltimore. \nHe was one of the great leaders on the Supreme Court, one of the great \nlawyers of our time. I think we all are very proud of what America is \ntoday thanks to Justice Thurgood Marshall. I think it only adds to the \nqualifications of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to have clerked for \nJustice Thurgood Marshall.\n  I heard my colleague talk about her commitment to our military. Let \nme point this out: This was a very difficult issue for Harvard Law \nSchool in regard to their policies. But let me quote, if I might, from \na letter from Iraqi war veterans:\n\n       During her time as dean, she has created an environment \n     that is highly supportive of students who have served in the \n     military. . . .Under her leadership, Harvard Law School has \n     also gone out of its way to highlight our military service. . \n     . .\n\n  Students have complimented the way she acted as dean to support our \nveterans. She comes from a military family. In fact, during the time in \nquestion, the number of Harvard Law School students who were recruited \ninto military service went up. So I think you have to look at the \nrecord. She has been extremely supportive of our veterans, extremely \nsupportive of those who serve our Nation in military service.\n  As a last point, let me quote from Miguel Estrada. I think most \npeople know Miguel Estrada. He was nominated to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals and considered to be one of the conservative nominees. He said:\n\n       If such a person, who has demonstrated great intellect, \n     high accomplishments and an upright life, is not easily \n     confirmable, I fear we will have reached a point where no \n     capable person will readily accept a nomination for judicial \n     service.\n\n  So I would hope we all could agree that Solicitor General Elena Kagan \nis well qualified to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  What we want from an Associate Justice is a judge who will follow \nlegal precedent, giving due deference to Congress, following the best \ntraditions of the Supreme Court in protecting the rights of Americans \nagainst the abuses of power. To me, that is judicial restraint, to stay \nwithin the mainstream of American values.\n  I believe Solicitor General Kagan represents that best tradition of \nfollowing legal precedent, giving due deference to Congress, standing \nfor ordinary Americans against the abuse of power. For those reasons, I \nwill vote to confirm her to be the next Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  During the confirmation hearings, I used that opportunity to explain \nto my constituents, indeed, to the people of this Nation, that Supreme \nCourt decisions have real consequences on the lives of our \nconstituents. If you are a woman, if you are a consumer, if you are a \nworker, if you are a voter, if you care about the air you breathe or \nthe water you drink, you should be very concerned about Supreme Court \ndecisions. It affects your life.\n  I am very concerned, and I think my constituents are concerned, about \nrecent 5-to-4 decisions where the majority, the so-called conservative \nJustices, legislated from the bench on the side of powerful corporate \ninterests over protecting ordinary citizens.\n  During the confirmation process, I raised these issues and questioned \nSolicitor General Kagan on these cases in which there were 5-to-4 \ndecisions, which reversed precedents. In my view, they were cases where \nthey were legislating from the bench and they were restricting the \nrights of ordinary Americans.\n  I mentioned the Ledbetter case. I know the Presiding Officer is very \nfamiliar with the Ledbetter case, in which a 5-to-4 decision from the \nSupreme Court effectively told the women of our Nation they would have \nno effective rights to bring wage discrimination cases based upon \ngender. The Supreme Court basically said the statute of limitations \nwould run even if you did not have knowledge of the discriminatory act. \nLilly Ledbetter was denied her claim as a result of that decision.\n  I think it is going to be healthy for America to have more women on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States. When Elena Kagan is confirmed, \nshe will, for the first time in America's history, be the third woman \nout of nine on the Supreme Court of the United States. I think that is \ngoing to give us more commonsense justice in this Nation and certainly \none that reflects the diversity of our country.\n  It was not just the Ledbetter case. There have been other cases in \nwhich workers have found the Supreme Court has ruled on the side of \nspecial interest corporate America over the rights of\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\nordinary workers. In the Gross case, the Supreme Court reversed \nprecedent, here again by a 5-to-4 decision, and ruled that we would use \na different test for age discrimination, effectively denying claims by \nthose who were discriminated against because of their age. This is \nanother example where the so-called conservative Justices on the \nSupreme Court reversed precedent, reversed the clear intent of \nCongress, and ruled against workers in favor of corporate America.\n  It is not just limited to worker cases or wage cases. In the Citizens \nUnited case--this is a case we have talked about a great deal on the \nfloor--the Supreme Court not only ruled against Congress, because we \nhad legislated the McCain-Feingold bill, but ruled against prior \nSupreme Court decisions to reverse the rights of ordinary Americans in \ntheir election process. What the Citizens United case said is corporate \nAmerica could spend more on elections--not already spending enough, but \nthey could spend more. Even though Congress had passed bipartisan laws \nto rein in the amount of special interest corporate money and even \nthough other cases were upheld by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court \nwent out of its way, by a 5-to-4 decision, to rule on the side of \ncorporate America against ordinary Americans.\n  Here, if I might, let me quote from Justice Stevens in his dissent. \nJustice Stevens said:\n\n       Essentially, five Justices were unhappy with the limited \n     nature of case before us, so they changed the case to give \n     themselves an opportunity to change the law . . . there were \n     principled, narrower paths that a Court that was serious \n     about judicial restraint could have taken.\n\n  I agree with Justice Stevens. We all talk about wanting to see \njudicial restraint. We all talk about wanting to see a Supreme Court \nthat will give due respect to the actions of Congress. We talk about \nfollowing judicial precedent. We talk about following the tradition to \nprotect your constitutional rights. Well, this Supreme Court, too many \ntimes, by 5-to-4 decisions by the so-called conservative Justices, has \nbeen the most activist Court on ruling on the side of corporate America \nover ordinary Americans.\n  It is also true in environmental cases--the Rapanos case. I have the \nhonor of chairing the Water Subcommittee on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We work very hard, Congress has worked very hard, to \nprotect our environment. It is not easy to get legislation passed in \nthe Congress. I know all of us are frustrated that we cannot get more \nlegislation passed. But we have gotten some very important bills passed \nto protect our environment, such as the Clean Water Act, and we have \nprotected our waterways. The courts have upheld our power to do that.\n  But in the Rapanos case, the Court ruled, again, by the narrowest of \nmargins, on the side of corporate America against protecting our \nenvironment, against congressional intent, against prior decisions of \nthe Supreme Court, ruling on the side of corporate America over \nprotecting our environment for future generations.\n  That was also true very recently in the Exxon v. Baker case. This was \nparticularly important because it took over a decade for those who were \ndamaged by the Exxon Valdez oilspill, by the episode in Alaska, to be \nable to get their claims brought through the courts. The Supreme Court, \nagain, by the narrowest margin, reduced the claims of those who were \ndamaged as a result of the Exxon Valdez spill.\n  I know all of us are very concerned about what is happening in the \nGulf of Mexico. We want to make sure BP is held fully accountable for \nall the damage it has caused. We in Congress need to do our work to \nmake sure that is done. I expect we will get it done. But we also need \nthe Supreme Court of the United States to uphold the power of Congress \nto pass laws. We are the legislative branch of government, and too \noften this so-called conservative majority of the Supreme Court has \nruled the other way.\n  I believe Solicitor General Elena Kagan will follow in the best \ntraditions of the Supreme Court. She will follow legal precedent, \nallowing Congress to legislate. I say that, in part, because of her \ntestimony before our committee. I questioned Solicitor General Kagan as \nto our environmental statutes and the role Congress plays.\n  She replied:\n\n       Congress certainly has broad authority under the \n     Constitution to enact legislation involving the protection of \n     our environment. When Congress enacts such legislation, the \n     job of the Court is to construe it consistent with \n     Congressional intent.\n\n  That is the type of Justice I want on the Supreme Court in order to \nprotect our air and protect our water, while yielding to Congress to \npass the statutes rather than legislating from the bench. Basically, I \nwant to make sure the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court is on \nthe side of ordinary Americans.\n  Once again, let me quote from Solicitor General Kagan from her \nopening statement to the Judiciary Committee. When she was talking \nabout equal justice under the law she said:\n\n       It means that everyone who comes before the Court--\n     regardless of wealth or power or station--receives the same \n     process and protections . . . What it promises is nothing \n     less than a fair shake for every American.\n\n  That, again, is what I would like to see from the Supreme Court. I \nwant them to be on the side of ordinary Americans, giving them a fair \nshake, protecting them from the abuses of power, whether those abuses \ncome from the halls of government or from corporate America. In too \nmany cases, this Supreme Court, by narrow margins through the more \nconservative Justices, has not been on the side of ordinary Americans. \nI believe Solicitor General Kagan, as Associate Justice Kagan, will \ngive Americans a fair shake and will continue in the best traditions of \nthe Supreme Court in advancing Americans' rights against the abuses of \npower. For that reason, I intend to vote for the confirmation of Elena \nKagan to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, while speaking in support of Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan, I quoted from a letter received from former \nSolicitors General in support of Solicitor General Kagan for the \nposition of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. It is dated June \n22, 2010, signed by former Solicitors General in support of the \nconfirmation of Elena Kagan.\n  I also spoke about the endorsement received from Miguel Estrada. He \nwrote an extraordinary letter that speaks to the qualifications of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan for Associate Justice of the Supreme \nCourt. It is addressed to the chairman of the committee, Patrick Leahy, \nand the ranking member, Jeff Sessions, dated May 14, 2010.\n  I ask unanimous consent these two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 22, 2010.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: We write to \n     support the nomination of Elena Kagan to be the next \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     We have served as Solicitors General in the administrations \n     of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, William \n     Clinton, and George W. Bush. We support the Kagan nomination \n     in the same spirit of fairness and bipartisanship, and \n     deference to presidential appointments of well-qualified \n     individuals to serve on the Supreme Court, that was also due \n     the nominations of then-Judges John G. Roberts, Jr. and \n     Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to serve on the Supreme Court.\n       Elena Kagan would bring to the Supreme Court a breadth of \n     experience and a history of great accomplishment in the law. \n     In addition to her most recent service as Solicitor General, \n     at various points of her career she has served as a law clerk \n     to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, she has been in \n     private practice at one of America's leading law firms, she \n     has served in the office of the Counsel to the President, she \n     has been a policy advisor to the President, she has served\n\n[[Page S6608]]\n\n     as a law professor at two of the nation's leading law \n     schools, Harvard and Chicago, and she has served as Dean of \n     the Harvard Law School.\n       During the past year, Kagan has honored the finest \n     traditions of the Office of the Solicitor General and has \n     served the government well before the Supreme Court. The job \n     of Solicitor General provides an opportunity to grapple with \n     almost the full gamut of issues that come before the Supreme \n     Court and requires an understanding of the Court's approach \n     to numerous issues from the criteria for certiorari review to \n     the Justices' approach to oral argument. The constant \n     interaction with the Supreme Court that comes with being the \n     most-frequent litigator before the Court also ensures an \n     appreciation for the rhythms and traditions of the Court and \n     its workload. Moreover, as Solicitor General, Kagan had the \n     opportunity to work with the immensely talented career \n     lawyers in the Office of the Solicitor General, who have a \n     deep understanding of and appreciation for the Court. Kagan's \n     most recent experience as Solicitor General will serve her \n     well as she wrestles with the difficult questions that come \n     before the Court.\n       The Constitution gives the President broad leeway in \n     fulfilling the enormously important responsibility of \n     determining who to nominate for seat on the Supreme Court of \n     the United States. In that spirit, we support the nomination \n     of Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice and believe that, if \n     confirmed, she will serve on the Court with distinction, as \n     have prior Solicitor Generals who have had that great honor.\n           Respectfully,\n     Walter Dellinger;\n     Theodore B.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Nomination of Elena Kagan.\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: I write in \n     support of Elena Kagan's confirmation as an Associate Justice \n     of the Supreme Court of the United States. I have known Elena \n     for 27 years. We met as first-year law students at Harvard, \n     where we were assigned seats next to each other for our \n     classes. We were later colleagues as editors of the Law \n     Review and as law clerks to different Supreme Court Justices; \n     and we have been friends since.\n       Elena possesses a formidable intellect, an exemplary \n     temperament and a rare ability to disagree with others \n     without being disagreeable. She is calm under fire and mature \n     and deliberate in her judgments. Elena would also bring to \n     the Court a wealth of experience at the highest levels of our \n     government and of academia, including teaching at the \n     University of Chicago, serving as the Dean of the Harvard Law \n     School and experience at the White House and as the current \n     Solicitor General of the United States. If such a person, who \n     has demonstrated great intellect, high accomplishments and an \n     upright life, is not easily confirmable, I fear we will have \n     reached a point where no capable person will readily accept a \n     nomination for judicial service.\n       I appreciate that considerations of this type are \n     frequently extolled but rarely honored by one side or the \n     other when the opposing party holds the White House. I was \n     dismayed to watch the confirmation hearings for then-Judge \n     Alito, at the time one of our most distinguished appellate \n     judges, and find that they ranged from the anodyne and \n     uninformative to the utterly disgraceful. And one could \n     readily identify members of the current Senate majority, \n     including several who serve on the Judiciary Committee, who, \n     when they previously assessed the judicial nominees of the \n     other party, earnestly articulated many of the same \n     objections that doubtless will be raised against Elena (such \n     as a lack of judicial experience, a perceived absence of a \n     ``paper trail,'' or whether the nominee's views truly are in \n     the legal mainstream). I respectfully submit that it brings \n     no credit to our government, and risks affirmative harm to \n     our courts, when our elected representatives simply swap \n     talking points--emphasizing the same considerations they \n     previously minimized or derided--only to revert to their \n     former arguments as soon as electoral fortunes turn.\n       Lest my endorsement of Elena's nomination erode the support \n     she should receive from her own party, I should make clear \n     that I believe her views on the subjects that are relevant to \n     her pending nomination--including the scope of the judicial \n     role, interpretive approaches to the procedural and \n     substantive law, and the balance of powers among the various \n     institutions of government--are as firmly center-left as my \n     own are center-right. If Elena is confirmed, I would expect \n     her rulings to fall well within the mainstream of current \n     legal thought, although on the side of what is popularly \n     conceived of as ``progressive.'' This should come as a \n     surprise to exactly no one: One of the prerogatives of the \n     President under our Constitution is to nominate high federal \n     officers, including judges, who share his (or her) governing \n     philosophies. As has often been said, though rarely by \n     senators whose party did not control the White House at the \n     time, elections have consequences.\n       Elena Kagan is an impeccably qualified nominee. Like Louis \n     Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Robert Jackson, Byron White, \n     Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist--none of whom arrived at \n     the Court with prior judicial service--she could become one \n     of our great Justices. I strongly urge you to confirm her \n     nomination without delay.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Miguel A. Estrada.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Having served on the Senate Judiciary Committee now for 17 years, I \nhave seen the impact that new Justices have on the Court, and I \nstrongly believe these votes are among the most important we cast in \nthis Chamber.\n  There is no question that the confirmation process has become heated \nin recent years. Outside interest groups and the 24-hour news cycle \nhave placed far too much emphasis on sound bites, half truths, and \nhyperbole. But none of this should obscure the fact that these are, in \nfact, important votes because the stakes are high.\n  A Supreme Court Justice, once confirmed, will serve a life \nappointment on a Court that is truly foundational to our democratic \nsystem.\n  For over 200 years, our independent judiciary has served as a model \nto the world. We have watched as other countries have struggled with \ncourts that have become beholden to political pressures or fallen \nsubject to corruption.\n  I think of Pakistan, where in 2007 President Musharraf proclaimed a \nstate of emergency and used it to suspend the country's constitution \nand remove justices from the supreme court; or Mexico, where corruption \nis so bad that in 2008 President Calderon called for a fundamental \nredesign of the entire judicial system.\n  In the United States we have guarded our judiciary, and it has served \nus well. Our Supreme Court has acted as a true check on government \nabuses, as a reliable and impartial tribunal for the resolution of \nprivate disputes, and as a final arbiter where the American people can \ncome to seek protection of their fundamental constitutional rights.\n  As Justice Breyer said in a recent public address, the virtue is that \n``a country of 300 million very diverse people will resolve their \ndifferences under law and not with guns on the street or through \nriots.''\n  In the context of world history, this is most impressive.\n  When it comes to the Supreme Court, nominations merit careful \nattention as well because any one Justice can have a substantial effect \non the Court's rulings.\n  The cases that reach the Supreme Court are not easy ones. When the \nlaw is clear, a case is settled by the parties or resolved by the \ndistrict courts or the courts of appeal. It is when the law is open to \nmultiple interpretations or when constitutional values must be weighed \nagainst each other that a case is likely to reach the Supreme Court.\n  In these cases, decisions are not automatic. Instead, each of the \nnine Justices must examine the facts, study\n\n[[Page S6609]]\n\nthe law, and reach his or her best conclusion about what the law \nrequires. The Court's rulings stand not just as abstract statements for \nthe law books but binding decisions with lasting impact on the lives of \nthe American people.\n  There are examples in the newspaper every day. In 2005, the Justices \nheld that a school district in Seattle had violated the equal \nprotection clause by using race as one of a series of factors in \nassigning students to schools within that district. The real impact of \nthis will be to make it far more difficult for school administrators to \nmaintain racial diversity in our public schools.\n  Another example: In a recent antitrust case--Leegin Creative Leather \nProducts v. PSKS--the Justices put forth a new interpretation of the \nlaw that will allow manufacturers to set minimum prices for certain \nproducts. What this means for Americans is, when they go to the store, \nthey may find that a particular electronic device or even a shampoo has \nthe same price at every store and can never be put on sale. Legislation \nto overturn this decision is still pending before the Senate.\n  In each of these cases, Justices were divided on the law. Five \nJustices agreed on the Court's ruling, but the remaining four Justices \ndissented and explained in vehement terms why they disagreed with their \ncolleagues' reasoning and result. The decisions, in other words, were \nnot formulaic.\n\n  So when I undertake my constitutional role of providing advice and \nconsent, I do so with the understanding that every nominee to the Court \nis not the same, and each and every one could have a lasting impact on \nthe future of our country.\n  With this in mind, I am very pleased to support the nomination of \nElena Kagan to be the next Associate Justice of the United States \nSupreme Court.\n  Look at her professional record. Summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa \nfrom Princeton; a master's degree in philosophy from Oxford University; \nmagna cum laude from Harvard Law School; a supervising editor of the \nHarvard Law Review; legal clerkships with U.S. Circuit Court Judge \nAbner Mikva and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; two years at \nthe law firm of Williams and Connolly; a professor of constitutional \nand administrative law at the University of Chicago; a special counsel \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg; an associate White House counsel to President Clinton; \nthe deputy director of President Clinton's Domestic Policy Council; a \nprofessor at Harvard Law School; the first woman dean of Harvard Law \nSchool; the first woman to ever serve as the Solicitor General of the \nUnited States.\n  That is an amazing background. You would think she is 106 instead of \na very young woman.\n  It is easy to see why her name has so often appeared on short lists \nfor the Supreme Court. She is a woman of repeated firsts. If confirmed, \nshe will be the fourth--not the first--woman to sit on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Frankly, I have been surprised to hear some of my colleagues question \nElena Kagan's credentials for the Court.\n  Let me start with the argument made by some that her record is \nsomehow inadequate because she lacks prior judicial experience.\n  It is true that all nine Justices on the current Supreme Court come \ndirectly from the U.S. Court of Appeals. But that is a historic \nanomaly. It has never happened before. In fact, in the history of the \nCourt, approximately one-third of our Justices have come to the bench \nwith no prior experience as a judge.\n  When the President announced this nominee, Justice Scalia, for one, \nsaid he was happy to see that she is not a Federal judge and not a \njudge at all. Justice Felix Frankfurter went much further, stating in a \nspeech in 1957:\n\n       One is entitled to say, without qualification, that the \n     correlation between prior judicial experience and fitness for \n     the functions of a Supreme Court is zero. The significance of \n     the greatest among the justices who have had such experience, \n     Holmes and Cardozo, derived not from that judicial \n     experience, but from the fact they were Holmes and Cardozo.\n\n  In my own view, judicial experience is a useful background, but it is \nonly one of many, and it is a background that is well represented on \nthe Court today. As a matter of fact, it is entirely represented on the \nCourt today.\n  The point is this: When we examine Elena Kagan's records, we should \nnot allow the characteristics of the current Court to make us \nshortsighted. In the course of American history, the Senate has \nconfirmed Justices with a broad variety of backgrounds--Justices who \nwere law professors, such as Felix Frankfurter; attorneys in private \npractice, such as Warren Burger; elected officials, such as John \nMcKinley, Earl Warren, and James Byrnes; and over 10 percent of our \nJustices have--like Elena Kagan--come directly from the executive \nbranch, with no judicial experience in between. These include Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist, who was Assistant Attorney General; Justice \nByron White, who was Deputy Attorney General; Justice Robert Jackson \nand Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, who were both the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States; and Chief Justice John Marshall, who was \nthe Secretary of State.\n  Again, these are Justices who distinguished themselves on the Court, \nwho came directly from the political experience. In my mind, the \nPresident has made a wise choice with this nomination because, in \naddition to this woman's impressive brain power--and I sat there and \nlistened to her hour after hour keep her calm, show humor, and display \nan impressive ability to cite cases, and even footnotes of those \ncases--she brings the valuable attribute of having first-hand working \nknowledge of all three branches of government. If confirmed, she, \nJustice Breyer, and Justice Thomas, will be the only Justices to share \nthat distinction.\n  Take her experience with the Supreme Court itself. As a ``27-year-old \npipsqueak,'' as she said before the committee, Elena Kagan had the \nprivilege of working as a law clerk on the Supreme Court to Justice \nThurgood Marshall. The job itself is prestigious, and it is impressive \nthat Kagan was selected. The real value, however, was in giving Kagan \nan inside view of the Court through the eyes of one of our great \nJustices, the lawyer who argued Brown v. Board of Education, the first \nAfrican-American Justice on the Supreme Court, and a man who brought to \nlife the Court's most basic promise of ``equal justice under law.'' She \nhad that experience.\n  As Elena Kagan said at her confirmation hearing, through Justice \nMarshall, she learned that our courts are ``special as compared with \nother branches of government. In other words, that it is the courts' \nrole to make sure that even when people have no place else to go, they \ncan come to the courts and the courts will hear their claim fairly. \nThat is a valuable lesson indeed for both a young lawyer and a new \nSupreme Court Associate Justice.''\n  Today, Kagan has an equally unique perspective on the Court. As the \nSolicitor General, she sometimes is referred to as the ``tenth \njustice,'' because there is no other lawyer who interacts as frequently \nwith the Justices. In her time as Solicitor General, she has filed \nhundreds of briefs and argued six cases before the Supreme Court \nitself. If confirmed, she will be one of only five sitting Justices who \nhave appeared on the advocate's side of the Supreme Court bench.\n  Solicitor General Kagan also brings practical experience with the \nlegislative branch. She worked in the halls of the Senate as a special \ncounsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee for the Ginsburg nomination, \nand during the Clinton administration, she bore responsibility for \nadvancing President Clinton's domestic policy agenda as the Deputy \nDirector of the Domestic Policy Council. She served, for example, as \nthe administration's chief negotiator for tobacco reform legislation. \nSo she knows the ins and outs of the legislative process.\n  This position enabled her to experience firsthand the hard work, \nnegotiation, collaboration, and navigation of procedural obstacles that \nare required to move a difficult bill through Congress.\n  When the Justices are called upon to interpret a statute, or \ndetermine its constitutionality, it is essential that they have some \nappreciation for the process by which that law came to be and the \nintent of Congress in writing and shaping that law. Elena Kagan knows \nthe legislative process, and I believe that will serve our Nation well.\n\n[[Page S6610]]\n\n  Finally, Elena Kagan also brings experience as a participant in the \nexecutive branch. As the Solicitor General, she has represented the \nU.S. Government before the Supreme Court; as an associate White House \ncounsel, she had to advise President Clinton on the scope of \nPresidential powers and privileges; and as a Deputy Director of the \nDomestic Policy Council, she supervised the President's policy \ninitiatives not only by advancing legislation in Congress but also in \ncooperation with Federal agencies.\n  Already, the debate has begun among legal commentators about whether \nKagan's work on the executive branch will skew her rulings in key \ncases--we heard this earlier this morning--dealing with the scope of \nthe President's powers with respect to indefinite detention, \nwarrantless surveillance, or the use of force outside of a declaration \nof war.\n  The lessons of history again provide perspective here. I think of \nJustice Robert Jackson, a former Attorney General of the United States, \nwho wrote an opinion that now stands as the cornerstone for all \nanalysis--and I mean that--of limits on executive power. We have heard \nthis quoted by virtually every nominee before the Judiciary Committee \nwhen a question of executive power is levied.\n  In the famous Youngstown case, in 1952, the Court was called upon to \ndecide whether the President's authority as Commander in Chief allowed \nhim to seize the Nation's steel mills in order to ensure sufficient \nwartime production to meet the Defense Department's needs for the \nKorean war.\n  In his prior role as the Attorney General of the United States, \nRobert Jackson had vigorously defended the President's prerogative to \ntake steps necessary to advance the Nation's war effort. But as Justice \nJackson, he took a different tack. He agreed with the majority that the \nPresident did not have the authority to seize the private steel mills, \nbut in doing so, he set forth a compromise framework, stating that the \nPresident's power was greatest when he acted pursuant to an act of \nCongress, in a zone of ``twilight'' when the Congress has not spoken, \nand at its lowest ebb, when he acted contrary to the stated will of the \nCongress.\n  When a colleague pointed out that Justice Jackson's compromise \nframework differed from the position he had taken as Attorney General, \nhe replied that a Justice does not ``bind present judicial judgment by \nearlier partisan advocacy.'' That is a very profound statement from a \ngreat Justice, who wrote an opinion that has stood the test of time.\n  I tell this story to make this point: Elena Kagan's clerkship for \nJustice Marshall, her work with the Congress in the 1990s, and the \npositions she takes now as Solicitor General cannot forecast, with any \ncertainty, what results she will reach in cases before the Court. I \nthink Justice Jackson is living proof of that. However, they do provide \nimportant assurance that she will appreciate the core principles and \nperspectives that undergird the work of each and every branch of this \ngovernment. Like Justice Jackson, this has the potential to make her a \nvery persuasive and impressive Justice.\n\n  In sum, I believe Elena Kagan's professional background makes her \nsuperbly qualified to sit on the Supreme Court.\n  An excellent professional background is, of course, a necessary \nqualification, but a nominee must also show that he or she has the \nappropriate judicial temperament, has a commitment to follow the law, \nand brings a judicial philosophy that will not pull the Court outside \nof the mainstream. And I have confidence in her in each of these areas.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has received over 170,000 pages of \ndocuments spanning Kagan's entire career. She testified before us for \n18 hours over a space of 3 days. She has answered over 200 additional \nquestions for the record, and scores of letters have been sent to us \nregarding her qualifications. What repeatedly emerges from all of this \nis that Elena Kagan is a pragmatist, a problem-solver, and a \nconciliator.\n  Her time as dean of Harvard Law School--misinterpreted often--paints \na vivid picture. Elena Kagan arrived at Harvard in 1999. She was \nselected to be dean only 4 years later. She was the first woman ever \nnamed so--a significant accomplishment in itself.\n  What is most important, however, is that during her time at Harvard, \nshe developed a reputation as a steady leader who would bring all sides \nto the table and work to solve a problem. As described in a letter from \n69 former deans supporting her nomination, she had a unique \n``willingness to listen to diverse viewpoints and give them all serious \nconsideration. She revealed a strong and consistent aptitude for \nforging coalitions that achieved smart and sensible solutions, often in \nthe face of seemingly insoluble conflict.'' Quite a statement from 69 \ndeans of law schools.\n  She brought conservative faculty, such as Bush administration lawyer \nJack Goldsmith, to the school and rallied the faculty to come together \nto support them. Former Solicitor General Charles Fried described her \neffect this way: ``The place is like it's never been before.'' She \n``managed to calm the factionalism, so it's completely disappeared.'' \nThat is according to former Solicitor General Charles Fried. The Boston \nGlobe stated it more simply, saying that she ``thawed Harvard law.''\n  This same knack for the pragmatic and drive toward consensus echoes \nthroughout her career.\n  A liberal scholar from the University of Chicago has characterized \nher academic work this way:\n\n       She is much more of a lawyer than a partisan. She is more \n     interested as a scholar in thinking through hard issues than \n     advocating particular ideological or political perspectives.\n\n  Former Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta has written that during \nthe Clinton administration, Kagan ``distinguished herself as deeply \nloyal to the Constitution and the law'' and said that ``on issues \nranging from adoption to religious freedom to tobacco regulation, [she] \neschewed ideology in favor of practical solutions.''\n  Her friends, her admirers, her colleagues repeatedly describe her in \nthose terms: a problem-solver, a conciliator, someone who brings people \ntogether even when they have very different views.\n  What really impresses me, though, is what we have heard from \nconservatives. Let me note that the very fact we have heard from these \nconservatives is impressive. In today's political atmosphere, lawyers \ntake a risk when they cross party lines to support Supreme Court \nnominees. Key people have done so for Kagan.\n  Former Bush appointee to the Tenth Circuit and current Stanford law \nprofessor Michael McConnell sent us an 8-page letter outlining the \nreasons for his strong support for Kagan's nomination. Elena Kagan, he \nsaid, shows ``respect for opposing argument, fairmindedness, and \nwillingness to reach across ideologic divides, independence, and \ncourage to buck the norm.'' ``No one,'' he said, ``can foresee the \nfuture, but I would not be surprised to find that Elena Kagan, as a \nJustice, serves more as a bridge between the factions of the Court than \nas a reliably progressive vote.''\n  Senator Graham, my colleague on the committee, has pointed to the \nwords of Miguel Estrada, a deeply conservative lawyer who has known \nKagan for 27 years. He describes her as having ``a formidable \nintellect, an exemplary temperament, and a rare ability to disagree \nwith others without being disagreeable. She is calm under fire and \nmature and deliberate in her judgments.''\n  Today, we have a divided Court--a Court in which the Justices are \nrepeatedly split five to four on major rulings of the day. These \nrulings determine what kinds of gun laws legislatures can pass to \nprotect the public safety in our cities, how much money will be spent \nin Federal elections, what school districts can and cannot do to \nmaintain racial diversity in our schools, what remedy our older and \nwomen workers have when their employers discriminate against them, what \nthe appropriate role for religion is in our public life, or how much a \ncompany can be required to pay for causing significant harm to our \nenvironment. And these Justices are split down the middle on these \nmajor questions. They cannot find compromise or agreement. Major \nquestions of the day are adjudicated on a bare majority.\n  We badly need a Justice who can drive this Court toward consensus, \nand\n\n[[Page S6611]]\n\nI have high hopes Elena Kagan will be just such a Justice.\n  Her record also gives me confidence that she will follow the law and \nput aside any personal policy preference when deciding cases on the \nCourt. In the course of her career, whether working on policy or on \nlaw, law has always come first. And as Solicitor General, she has \nproven quite clearly that she can put her personal views aside, filing, \nfor example, a brief that defended the constitutionality of don't ask, \ndon't tell. Although she is known to strongly disagree with that \npolicy, she defended it and stated that the Court should let stand a \nFirst Circuit decision that upheld the policy because it properly \ndeferred to the reasoned military judgment of the executive and \nlegislative branches.\n  Finally, I believe she has set forth an appropriate judicial \nphilosophy. In 3 days of hearings before our committee, she has \nrevealed herself as a person who believes that judges should follow \nprecedent, stare decisis, and exercise restraint in their rulings. She \nsaid:\n\n       [N]o judge should look at a case and say, ``Oh, I would \n     have decided it differently; I'm going to decide it \n     differently.'' [A] judge should view prior decisions with a \n     great deal of humility and deference.\n\n  She told us:\n\n       The time I spent in the other branches of government remind \n     me that [the role of the Court] must also be a modest one--\n     properly deferential to the decisions of the American people \n     and their elected representatives.\n\n  Hers will be a welcome voice on the Court.\n  I wish to take one last moment, if I may, to address questions about \nher actions related to military recruiting at Harvard Law School \nbecause I believe, to some extent, they have been inaccurately \ndepicted. While each Member will have to draw his or her own \nconclusions about whether Dean Kagan took the wisest course, I believe \nit is essential that we get the facts straight.\n  As dean, Elena Kagan never barred military recruiters from the \nHarvard Law School campus. For one semester, after the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit held that the Solomon amendment was \nunconstitutional, Kagan reverted to an earlier school policy that had \nbeen used for many years before she became dean. That is fact. Under \nthat policy, the military recruited through the Harvard Law School \nVeterans Association but was excluded from the Office of Career \nServices. At all times, the military had access to students. In fact, \nmilitary recruitment levels at Harvard remained steady and even \nincreased at times during Kagan's tenure as dean.\n  But what is most striking to me in reviewing all of this is that \nalthough the judiciary has heard from servicemembers on both sides of \nthis issue, every report we have received from a veteran or \nservicemember who actually attended Harvard at the time has been in \nstrong support of Kagan's nomination to the Court.\n  Marine Corps CPT Bob Merrill graduated from Harvard Law School in \n2008. He is currently serving in Afghanistan. He writes:\n\n       Kagan's positions never affected the services' ability to \n     recruit at Harvard. Behind the scenes the dean assured that \n     our tiny Harvard Law School Veterans Association never lacked \n     for funds or access to facilities.\n       She treated the veterans at Harvard like VIPs, and she was \n     a fervent advocate of our veterans association.\n\n  First Lieutenant David Tressler graduated from Harvard Law School in \n2007 and is currently serving in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army \nReserves. He wrote that ``while Dean of Harvard Law School, [Kagan] \nadequately proved her support for those who had served, were currently \nserving, and all those who felt called to serve.''\n  Navy Judge Advocate General Corps LT Zachary Prager graduated in 2006 \nand wrote that ``Dean Kagan set a standard at Harvard of respect for \nmilitary servicemembers'' and that without Kagan's ``leadership and \nevenhandedness as Dean,'' he would not have joined the military.\n  Like Admiral Mike Mullen, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, \nSecretary of the Navy Ray Maybus, retired General Colin Powell, myself, \nand many others in this Chamber, Kagan has said she personally \ndisagrees with the don't ask, don't tell policy. And she is not alone.\n  At certain dark moments in our history, institutions of higher \neducation have shown a hostility in this sense, but those contexts \nshould not be confused.\n  To oppose the exclusionary policy of don't ask, don't tell is not to \noppose or show hostility toward the military; it is instead to say that \nthe time has come for all willing and able Americans to be able to \nserve. Like Elena Kagan, I strongly believe the criteria for military \nservice in our country should be competence, courage, and a willingness \nto serve, not race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n  Members should draw their own conclusions about whether Kagan made \nthe right choice as dean in returning to Harvard's old recruiting \npolicy in 2005, but I want to be clear that nothing in her record shows \nany hostility toward the military or the men and women who serve our \ncountry. In fact, servicemen and women who were there at the time have \ncome forward, and the evidence is to the contrary.\n  In sum, and in conclusion, I believe Elena Kagan will be a fine \nJustice on the U.S. Supreme Court, and I look forward to the day soon \nwhen she takes her seat as the fourth woman in history to serve on that \nCourt. I am very proud to support her nomination.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Elena Kagan is intelligent, well spoken, \npersonable, and schooled in the law. She is skilled in the art of \nargument, perhaps to a fault. Ignoring her own advice in the now famous \nUniversity of Chicago Law Review article, she did not testify \nmeaningfully before the Judiciary Committee, concealing and disguising \nher views and playing the same game of ``hide the ball'' as some who \nwent before her, albeit with more skill. Probably because she \ncriticized the practice so directly, many expected her to set a \ndifferent standard.\n  Others have asked whether Judiciary Committee hearings have been \nrendered largely free of substance and what, if anything, can be done \nabout it. The former Judiciary Committee chairman, Arlen Specter, who \nlamented that Ms. Kagan, during her testimony, had not ``answered much \nof anything,'' went on to say this:\n\n       It would be my hope that we could find some place between \n     voting no and having some sort of substantive answers. But I \n     think we are searching for a way how Senators can succeed in \n     getting substantive answers, as you advocated in the Chicago \n     Law Review, short of voting no.\n\n  I confess that, similar to Senator Specter, I don't know how we can \nforce nominees to be forthcoming except through our votes.\n  To be clear, my threshold for supporting a nominee does not require \nanswering how one would vote on issues sure to come before the Court, \nnor necessarily expressing agreement or disagreement with decisions or \nCourt opinions. It is possible to learn much about a nominee's approach \nto judging without committing one to a specific position in future \ncases. What we should expect, however, is candor and a willingness to \nhonestly discuss background and general constitutional principles, \napproaches to judging and writings and matters within the nominee's \nbackground that bear on the nominee's suitability for the bench.\n  In explaining why I could not vote for now-Justice Sotomayor, I said \nI thought she was disingenuous with the Judiciary Committee. Obviously, \nreaching such a conclusion precludes support, notwithstanding other \nqualifications for the position. Reluctantly, after analysis of her \ntestimony, weighed with her past writings, statements, and actions, I \nhave reached the same conclusion regarding Elena Kagan.\n  Exhibit A is her insistence on redefining her position on military \nrecruiting on Harvard campus. Her ``separate but equal'' defense and \nattempt to downplay the steps she took to undermine the legal policy of \ndon't ask, don't tell were, ultimately, unbelievable. It is almost \nunfathomable, for example, that someone with Ms. Kagan's considerable \nlegal acumen could have, as she asserted, always thought we were acting \nin compliance with the Solomon amendment.\n  Ms. Kagan tried to convince the Judiciary Committee that her actions \nagainst the military were a justifiable response to a policy she viewed \nas discriminating against homosexuals. But\n\n[[Page S6612]]\n\nas Senator Sessions noted, her stand against homosexual discrimination \nwas not universal. She did not speak out, for example, when Harvard \naccepted $20 million from a member of the Saudi royal family to \nestablish a center for the study of Sharia law, even though under \nSharia law ``sexual activity between two persons of the same gender is \npunishable by death or flogging.'' Her decision to punish the military \nfor a policy adopted by Congress is especially perplexing, given her \nfailure to express concern over or take action against the \nestablishment of a center to promote a legal system linked to the abuse \nof homosexuals, women, and others.\n  Exhibit B is her astonishing legal definition of what she meant in \nher effusive praise for Justice Marshall's vision of the role of the \nCourt, presumably to avoid the obvious conclusion that she agreed with \nhis activist approach to judging. Justice Marshall had an enormous \ninfluence on our jurisprudence, starting with his advocacy before--and \nmost especially with--Brown v. Board of Education. But no serious \nstudent would argue that he didn't try to push the law as far as he \ncould in furtherance of his philosophy.\n  Indeed, consider the comments of another former Marshall clerk, \nliberal law professor Cass Sunstein, who now serves in the Obama \nadministration, who has said this:\n\n       A serious commitment to Marshall's vision of constitutional \n     liberty would entail an extraordinary judicial role, one for \n     which courts are quite ill suited.\n\n  He has also acknowledged:\n\n       Even if the best substantive theory calls for something \n     like Marshall's vision, institutional considerations would \n     argue powerfully against it.\n\n  Ms. Kagan's attempt to define Justice Marshall's philosophy as \nmeaning only that he wanted everyone to have equal access to the courts \nis--there is no other word for it--disingenuous.\n  Because Ms. Kagan apparently embraces his philosophy but feared \npublic acknowledgment of that would confirm the concern that she would \nbe a results-oriented judge, she fudged. In doing so, she confirmed the \nsuspicion and compounded the problem with deceptive testimony.\n  Exhibit C is the explanation of several of her bench memos to Justice \nMarshall, insisting they did not contain her views but were merely a \nchanneling of his. Ms. Kagan offered this explanation of her memo \ncategorizing litigants as ``good guys'' and ``bad guys,'' another memo \nstating that the government was ``for once on the side of the angels,'' \nand a memo expressing fear that the Court might ``create some very bad \nlaw on abortion and/or prisoners' rights.'' Reading these memos, one \ngets the sense that Ms. Kagan was not simply channeling her boss but \nwas instead expressing her own personal policy views on matters before \nthe Court and that they had as much to do with who the litigants were \nas what the issues were.\n  Ms. Kagan also attempted to recast her praise of Israeli Supreme \nCourt Justice Aharon Barak, who, in the words of the Associated Press, \nis widely acknowledged as someone who took an activist approach to \njudging. Well, that is exhibit D. Judge Richard Posner described Judge \nBarak's history on the Israeli Supreme Court as ``creating a degree of \njudicial power undreamed of even by our most aggressive Supreme Court \njustices.''\n  Under his leadership, the Israeli Supreme Court aggrandized its own \npower far beyond what even many of those on the left would view as \nacceptable in America. To cite one example of Justice Barak's judicial \nphilosophy, he wrote a judge's role ``is not restricted to adjudicating \ndisputes in which parties claim that their personal rights have been \nviolated'' but rather ``to bridge the gap between law and society.''\n  Well, bridging gaps, clearly, and using the law to address societal \nproblems is not the job of the courts. That is a political approach.\n  Ms. Kagan claimed, during her hearing, that her praise for Justice \nBarak had nothing to do with his leftwing judicial philosophy. But an \nexamination of her statements tells a different story. In 2002, Ms. \nKagan praised Aharon Barak for ``presiding over the development of one \nof the most principled legal systems in the world.''\n  In 2006, she again heaped professional praise on Justice Barak, \ncalling him her ``judicial hero.'' Ed Whelan, who is a noted legal \ncommentator, summarized this event well:\n\n       Kagan begins by referring to the portraits of four ``great \n     justices'' with whom Harvard Law School has been associated--\n     Brandeis, Holmes, Brennan, and Frankfurter. But, she says, \n     ``the Harvard Law School association of which I'm most \n     proud''--more proud, that is, than of the associations with \n     Brandeis, Holmes, Brennan, or Frankfurter--``is the one we \n     have with President Barak of the Israeli Supreme Court.\n\n  And then she continued:\n\n       I told President Barak, and I want to repeat in public, \n     that he is my judicial hero. He is the judge or justice in my \n     lifetime whom [sic], I think, best represents and has best \n     advanced the values of democracy and human rights, of the \n     rule of law and of justice.\n\n  During her confirmation hearing, Ms. Kagan, under oath, testified \nthat she admired Justice Barak for his role in:\n\n       . . . creating an independent judiciary for Israel. . . . \n     not for his particular judicial philosophy, not for any of \n     his particular decisions.\n\n  That testimony cannot be squared with her public declaration that \nJustice Barak ``is the judge or justice in my lifetime whom [sic], I \nthink, best represents and has best advanced the values of democracy \nand human rights, of the rule of law and of justice.''\n  Exhibit E is Ms. Kagan's answer to whether she is a legal \nprogressive. Her statements, again, were designed to cloud her views. \nVice President Biden's Chief of Staff, Ron Klain--who served as chief \ncounsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chief of Staff to Attorney \nGeneral Reno, and Chief of Staff to Vice President Gore--has known Ms. \nKagan as far back as 1993, when they worked together on the Ginsburg \nhearings. At Ms. Kagan's hearing, Senator Sessions pointed out that \nafter Ms. Kagan was nominated, Mr. Klain said:\n\n       Elena [Kagan] is clearly a legal progressive. I think Elena \n     is someone who comes from the progressive side of the \n     spectrum. She clerked for Judge Mikva, clerked for Justice \n     Marshall, worked in the Clinton administration, worked in the \n     Obama administration. I don't think there's any mystery of \n     the fact that she is, as I said, of more of the progressive \n     role than not.\n\n  Senator Sessions then asked Ms. Kagan:\n\n       Do you agree with the characterization that you're a legal \n     progressive?\n\n  She replied:\n\n       I honestly don't know what that label means.\n\n  So Senator Sessions pressed Ms. Kagan:\n\n       I'm asking about his firm statement that you are a legal \n     progressive, which means something. I think he knew what he \n     was talking about. He's a skilled lawyer who's been in the \n     midst of the great debates of this country about law and \n     politics, just as you have. And so I ask you again: Do you \n     think that is a fair characterization of your views? \n     Certainly, you don't think he was attempting to embarrass you \n     or hurt you in that process.\n\n  She again dodged with an answer that strains credulity.\n\n       I love my good friend, Ron Klain, but I guess I think that \n     people should be allowed to label themselves. And that's--you \n     know, I don't know what that label means and so I guess I'm \n     not going to characterize it one way or the other.\n\n  So a nominee to the highest Court in the land and a former dean of \none of the Nation's most prestigious law schools insists that she \ndoesn't know what the term ``legal progressive'' means.\n  But later in the hearing, Senator Graham mentioned that Greg Craig, \nPresident Obama's first White House Counsel, had praised Ms. Kagan. Mr. \nCraig said:\n\n       [Elena Kagan] is largely a progressive in the mold of Obama \n     himself.\n\n  So Senator Graham asked:\n\n       Would you consider them, your political views, progressive?\n\n  Then Ms. Kagan acknowledged that, yes, her ``political views are \ngenerally progressive.''\n  It is hard to believe Ms. Kagan knows what a political progressive is \nbut not a legal progressive.\n  Exhibit F: Her attempt to redefine her views in the letter sent to \nJudiciary Committee on November 14, 2005, in which she objected to the \nGraham-Kyl-Cornyn amendment dealing with treatment of enemy detainees. \nHer characterization of our approach as being similar to the \n``fundamentally lawless'' actions of ``dictatorships'' was clearly, I \nbelieve, injudicious and revealed the fervor of her position, much like \nher\n\n[[Page S6613]]\n\ncharacterization of the don't ask, don't tell policy as ``a moral \ninjustice of the first order,'' and it could suggest a viewpoint that \nshe would have a hard time laying aside if similar questions ever came \nbefore her as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Her attempt to distance herself from the obvious application of her \nviews to places other than Gitmo--obvious because her letter bemoaned \nthe ``serious and disturbing reports of the abuse of prisoners in \nGuantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan''--and issues other than conviction \nand sentencing--even though her letter stated that our amendment \n``unfortunately'' would ``prohibit challenges to detention practices, \ntreatment of prisoners, adjudications of their guilt and their \npunishment''--suggests either that she was uncomfortable defending her \nposition or she wanted to preserve her right to sit on such cases in \nthe future or both. The attempt to obscure positions she had previously \nstated was, I believe, an attempt to run away from those positions and \nmislead the committee.\n  Exhibit G: Ms. Kagan's doublespeak on the question of same-sex \nmarriage. Prior to her confirmation as Solicitor General, when she was \nnot restricted, as judicial nominees are, in her ability to comment on \nissues that may come before the courts, Senator Cornyn asked Ms. Kagan \na direct question about her personal views:\n\n       Do you believe that there is a fundamental constitutional \n     right to same-sex marriage?\n\n  Her answer then seemed clear. She wrote:\n\n       There is no Federal constitutional right to same-sex \n     marriage.\n\n  But at the hearing, when I asked Ms. Kagan to confirm her views on \nthis subject, she distorted both Senator Cornyn's question and her \nanswer. She told me Senator Cornyn had asked whether she could \n``perform the role of the Solicitor General'' and vigorously defend \nDOMA, given her opposition to don't ask, don't tell. When I pointed out \nthat Senator Cornyn's question was about a constitutional right to \nsame-sex marriage, not DOMA, Ms. Kagan then asserted that her answer to \nSenator Cornyn--that ``there is no Federal constitutional right to \nsame-sex marriage''--intended to convey that she ``understood the state \nof the law and accepted the state of the law.'' Having reinterpreted \nher previous answer, she then told me that, as a Supreme Court nominee, \nit would not be ``appropriate'' for her to share her personal views on \nthe subject, since such a case may come before the Court.\n  It strikes me that Ms. Kagan was, at the time of her nomination to be \nSolicitor General, trying to create an impression--apparently a false \none--that she did not personally believe the Constitution could be read \nto include a right to same-sex marriage.\n  That leads to Exhibit H: her involvement, while serving as Solicitor \nGeneral, in a case concerning the constitutionality of the Defense of \nMarriage Act, DOMA.\n  When nominated for the job of Solicitor General, Ms. Kagan emphasized \nin her opening statement the ``critical responsibilities'' that the \nSolicitor General owes to Congress, ``most notably the vigorous defense \nof the statutes of this country against constitutional attack.'' Later, \nMs. Kagan reiterated that she could represent the interests of the \nUnited States ``with vigor, even when they conflict with my own \nopinions. I believe deeply that specific roles carry with them specific \nresponsibilities and that the ethical performance of a role demands \ncarrying out these responsibilities as well and completely as \npossible.''\n  Ms. Kagan even cited former Solicitor General Ted Olson's defense of \nthe campaign finance laws as an example of the way a Solicitor General \nshould approach the job. She said, ``I know that Ted Olson would not \nhave voted for the McCain-Feingold bill, but he . . . did an \nextraordinary job of defending that piece of legislation. . . . And \nthat's what a solicitor general does.''\n  Yet, there is substantial reason to doubt that Ms. Kagan genuinely \ncarried out her obligation to ``vigorously defend'' a Federal statute \nin district court, the Defense of Marriage Act. In response to \nquestions at her Supreme Court hearing, Ms. Kagan acknowledged that she \nwas involved in two district court cases involving DOMA. Her personal \ninvolvement in these cases was itself unusual as she admitted in \nresponse to written questions: ``In the normal course, the [Solicitor \nGeneral's] Office does not participate in district court litigation.''\n  Her involvement would not have necessarily raised concerns were it \nnot for the position that the government advocated in the cases. In the \nfirst case, Smelt v. United States, the Department of Justice filed a \nbrief that, as part of its so-called ``defense'' of the DOMA statute, \nadmitted to the court that ``this Administration does not support DOMA \nas/matter of policy, believes that it is discriminatory, and supports \nits repeal.'' How can a lawyer mount a ``vigorous'' defense of a \nstatute while declaring the statute to be discriminatory? But it gets \nworse. The Justice Department's brief also asked the court to ignore \none of the strongest arguments in support of DOMA--namely that \ntraditional marriage serves as a valuable vehicle for encouraging \nresponsible procreation and childbearing. The brief asserted that the \ngovernment ``does not believe that DOMA is rationally related to any \nlegitimate government interests in procreation and child-rearing.''\n  It is clear that the Justice Department's brief, which was supposed \nto be filed in support of the DOMA statute, in fact undercut the law's \nconstitutionality. As one legal scholar and proponent of same-sex \nmarriage said about the Justice Department's argument:\n\n       This new position is a gift to the gay-marriage movement, \n     since it was not necessary to support the government's \n     position. It will be cited by litigants in state and federal \n     litigation, and will no doubt make its way into judicial \n     opinions. Indeed, some state court decisions have relied very \n     heavily on procreation and child-rearing rationales to reject \n     SSM [same-sex marriage] claims. The DOJ is helping knock out \n     a leg from under the opposition to gay marriage.\n\n  The Smelt case was later dismissed by the district court for other \nreasons. And that brings us to the second DOMA case in which Ms. Kagan \nwas involved--Gill v. Office of Personnel Management. In Gill, the \nJustice Department again offered the same half-hearted defense of DOMA \nand repudiated its strongest legal arguments. This time, however, the \ndistrict court seized on the Justice Department's rejection of the \nprocreation and child-bearing rationales and found that DOMA was \nunconstitutional. Ed Whelan, the noted legal commentator and a former \nprincipal deputy of the Office of Legal Counsel, has explained that the \ndecision in Gill ``would be ridiculous but for DOJ's abandonment of \nCongress's stated justifications for DOMA. Under proper application of \nthe very deferential `rational basis' review, for example, it would be \nenough to recognize that it would have been reasonable for Congress in \n1996 to regard traditional marriage as a valuable vehicle for \nencouraging responsible procreation and childbearing.''\n  Although Ms. Kagan admitted being involved in both Smelt and Gill, \nshe refused to tell us her role in the deliberations. In response to \nwritten questions, Ms. Kagan did admit that her participation in Smelt \nwas ``sufficiently substantial'' that she would recuse herself should \nthe case come before the Supreme Court. But this promise itself was \ndisingenuous because the Smelt case had already been dismissed, so \nthere was no chance that it would come before the Supreme Court. On the \nother hand, the Gill case may very well make its way to the Supreme \nCourt, but Ms. Kagan did not promise to recuse herself from \nparticipating in it, despite her involvement in formulating the Justice \nDepartment's flawed defense of DOMA in the case.\n  We will likely never know what Ms. Kagan's advice was in these cases. \nWhat we do know is that Ms. Kagan has a history of ignoring the law \nwhen it conflicts with the gay rights agenda. We also know that she \ntook the unusual step of getting involved in these district court cases \nchallenging DOMA. And we know that the Justice Department went out of \nits way to abandon one of the fundamental rationales for the DOMA \nstatute, which resulted in a court, for the first time ever, ruling \nthat DOMA was unconstitutional. On the basis of these facts, I believe \nthat any reasonable observer would question whether Ms. Kagan kept her \npromise to us that she would ``vigorously defend'' Federal statute as \nSolicitor General.\n\n  Exhibit I is her dubious explanation of why, in another case that she \nhandled as Solicitor General, she declined\n\n[[Page S6614]]\n\nto appeal the Ninth Circuit's adverse ruling in Witt v. Department of \nthe Air Force, a case challenging the constitutionality of the \ngovernment's don't ask, don't tell statute. At her hearing, Ms. Kagan \nclaimed that allowing the Ninth Circuit decision to stand, and \naccepting a remand and trial in district court, would provide the \nSupreme Court with a ``fuller record'' and would help the government \n``show what the Ninth Circuit was demanding that the government do'' to \ndefend don't ask, don't tell.\n  But a review of the Ninth Circuit opinion and the record in the case \nshows that Ms. Kagan's explanation was disingenuous. The Ninth Circuit \nitself had already said what the government would need to prove for the \nFederal law to survive--there was no need to develop a ``fuller \nrecord'' or seek further clarification from the courts.\n  Ms. Kagan's decision to let the case return to the district court \nensured that members of the military would be subjected to invasive and \nhumiliating trials in the Witt case and in all other challenges against \ndon't ask, don't tell--trials in which soldiers would be compelled to \ntestify against their comrades, discuss their views of a fellow \nsoldier's sexual practices, and watch as the unit's personnel files \nbecome fodder for lawyers trying to condemn what is supposed to be a \nmilitary-wide policy. The government rightly argued before the trial \ncourt that such trials are guaranteed to destroy unit cohesion--the \nvery thing that Congress sought to protect when it passed the don't \nask, don't tell statute. And the trial court records show that Kagan \nknew in advance that the trial process would harm the military's \ninterests. But she decided to thrust the government into exactly the \nposition the military's lawyers most wanted to avoid, perhaps to keep \nin place, and insulate from Supreme Court review, a Ninth Circuit \nruling that places don't ask, don't tell policy in jeopardy.\n  In addition to my concerns that Ms. Kagan was less than candid with \nthe Judiciary Committee, I am also concerned about her leftist ideology \nand the potential it will influence her judging. I will discuss three \nareas of concern.\n  First, is her defense of the brief filed in Chamber of Commerce v. \nCandelaria. It takes a clever lawyer to argue that the Court should \ntake this immigration case, but not Lopez-Rodriguez v. Holder on the \ntraditional reasons for granting certiorari. In Candelaria, she asked \nthe Supreme Court to strike down an Arizona law that permits the State \nto suspend or revoke the business licenses of companies that knowingly \nemploy illegal aliens. She did this even though Federal law expressly \nauthorizes States to enforce immigration laws ``through licensing'' and \neven though the courts that have considered the issue have determined \nthat States could do precisely what Arizona did. Yet, in Lopez-\nRodriguez, another immigration case, she refused to appeal a decision \nby the Ninth Circuit that permits ordinary deportation hearings to be \nbogged down by long legal fights over the admissibility of clear \nevidence that a person is illegally here. Unlike Candelaria, the Ninth \nCircuit's decision in Lopez-Rodriguez was in conflict with the \ndecisions of other courts--including the Supreme Court--involved a \nsignificant constitutional issue. It is difficult not to conclude that \nMs. Kagan's actions in these two cases were driven less by the law, and \nmore by political expediency.\n  My second concern about ideology is that Ms. Kagan has shown she may \nhold a limited reading of the second amendment, even after the Heller \nand McDonald cases. When asked whether the right to bear arms was a \n``fundamental right,'' Ms. Kagan said, ``I think that that's what the \ncourt held in McDonald.'' She also said that the holding was ``[g]ood \nprecedent going forward.'' Of course, there is a record of nominees \ndescribing the holding of a case and proclaiming that it is ``good \nprecedent,'' only to vote to overturn or distinguish that precedent \nonce they ascend to the bench. Justice Sotomayor did just that on this \nissue.\n  But we need not rely on cynicism to demonstrate that Ms. Kagan may \nnot view the recent second amendment precedents as settling the \nquestion of whether gun ownership is a ``fundamental right.''\n  Generally speaking, when a constitutional right is ``fundamental,'' \nany government restriction of that right is subject to ``strict \nscrutiny'' by the courts. But at her hearing, Ms. Kagan left open the \npossibility that some other, lesser standard of scrutiny should apply \nto second amendment restrictions. She said that ``going forward the \nSupreme Court will need to decide what level of constitutional scrutiny \nto apply to gun regulations.'' This does not sound like a commitment to \nthe principle that the second amendment guarantees a fundamental right. \nWhen weighed with her well-documented work in the Clinton \nadministration to advance gun control legislation, I believe there is a \njustifiable concern that Ms. Kagan would vote to construe Heller and \nMcDonald as narrowly as possible.\n  Third, I am concerned that Ms. Kagan sees few, if any, limitations on \nCongress's authority to regulate behavior, or interstate commerce. In a \nremarkable exchange, Senator Coburn asked Ms. Kagan whether it would be \nconstitutional for Congress to pass a law requiring Americans ``to eat \nthree vegetables and three fruits every day.'' Although Ms. Kagan said \nthat such a law sounded ``dumb,'' she refused to say that such a law \nwould be unconstitutional. In fact, during the course of the exchange, \nMs. Kagan repeatedly emphasized that a court analyzing such a statute \nshould ``read the [commerce] clause broadly'' and give ``real \ndeference'' to Congress.\n  I agree that the commerce clause gives the Congress substantial \nauthority, but it does not give Congress unlimited authority. That Ms. \nKagan was unwilling to say a law requiring the consumption of produce \nis beyond Congress's authority suggests she would vote to uphold \nstatutes that exceed the boundaries of the commerce clause. Stretching \nthe commerce clause gives too much power to Congress.\n  Finally, it is worth noting that Ms. Kagan came to the Senate with a \nlack of legal and judicial experience, especially when compared to \nother recent nominees. Some have reached back 40 years to compare Ms. \nKagan's experience to that of Chief Justice Rehnquist, the last nominee \nwithout prior judicial experience confirmed to the Supreme Court in \n1972. William Rehnquist, however, spent 16 years as a practicing \nlitigator in my home State of Arizona and 2 more years as Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, a position that was later \nheld Justice Scalia 1974-1977 and that, according to the Department of \nJustice, ``typically deal[s] with legal issues of particular \ncomplexity'' and ``provides authoritative legal advice to the President \nand all the executive branch agencies.'' In contrast, Ms. Kagan's law \npractice is confined to two years in private practice shortly after law \nschool and 1 year as the Solicitor General.\n  Her limited experience is not by itself disqualifying, but it did \nincrease the importance of her hearing. Had she answered questions in \nan honest and straightforward manner, we might have a better basis to \nknow what kind of judge she would be. But instead, Ms. Kagan either \ndodged questions or gave what were clearly disingenuous answers \nintended to mask her views. She also failed to make the case that her \npolitical ideology would not influence her judging. For all of the \nreasons I have discussed, I cannot support her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I certainly could not improve upon the \nstatements and arguments that have been made by my good friend from \nArizona. I come from a little different perspective. There are six \nthings I think any one of which would seriously make us consider voting \nagainst her.\n  I want to say this, first, though. Back when she was first nominated \nI was the first one to say I was opposed to her. The main reason was \nthese things came up, most of them, when she was up to be confirmed for \nSolicitor General. At that time I objected to her being in that \nposition.\n  I have a policy--I think it is good; people in Oklahoma know it--and \nthat is, if you oppose someone's confirmation for a position and then \nthey come back later for a higher position, it is automatic because the \nbar should be higher.\n  Anyway, today I want to reemphasize a couple of things that were \nmentioned\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\nby my friend from Arizona. One objection to the Kagan nomination is \nthat she undeniably lacks the experience.\n  I think Senator Kyl said it very well. People say there have been \nothers in history that didn't have any judicial experience, but in \nthose cases, they averaged 21 years of practicing law. They had that \nexperience. This would be the first time in history we have someone \nwith less than 2 years' experience and no judicial experience. That \nwould be reason enough, but that is not my major objection.\n  My major objection is her disdain for the U.S. military. While dean \nat Harvard, Kagan banned the military during a time of war from \nrecruiting on campus due to her objection over the don't ask, don't \ntell policy. That was the policy put together during the Clinton \nadministration while she was in the administration. She did not object \nto it at that time, but she objects to it now.\n  There has been much made by her supporters about her role in this \nincident, but the truth is that in November of 2004, after the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals struck down the Solomon amendment--I was there \nwhen the Solomon amendment was passed in the House--Kagan affirmatively \ndisallowed the military from recruiting at the school's office of \ncareer services. Subsequently, she joined 40 other schools in filing an \namicus brief with the Supreme Court in the case opposing the Solomon \namendment which was then overwhelmingly opposed and reversed by the \nSupreme Court unanimously. She was taking advantage of that opportunity \nwhen she didn't allow recruiters at the university. We have seen this \nhappen around the country, not only Harvard but in California. This is \nsomething that is definitely in opposition to the law that is still in \nplace, referred to as the Solomon amendment.\n  Equally alarming to these actions is her misrepresentation of the \nfacts before the Judiciary Committee. I wasn't aware of this, certainly \nnot back when she was up for Solicitor General. She testified that \nmilitary recruiters had ``full and good access'' to Harvard's campus. \nMilitary recruiters clearly did not have full and good access, as they \nhad to work through the school's veterans group as opposed to being \nallowed to go through the office of career services, a part of the \nuniversity.\n  Internal Pentagon documents reveal that under her deanship ``The Army \nwas stonewalled at Harvard.'' Furthermore, Kagan told the committee \nthat in banning recruiters she ``always thought we were acting in \ncompliance'' with Federal law. Yet in her own e-mail to Harvard \nstudents and faculty, she wrote that she had ``hope'' that the \ngovernment ``would choose not to enforce'' the law.\n  I am alarmed that Kagan would not only ban military recruiters on \ncampus in a time of war but that she would do it to advance her own \nliberal and social agenda, then mislead the committee with her \nstatements.\n  During her tenure as dean of Harvard, Kagan sent a letter with three \nother law school deans to the Senate in 2005 opposing legislation that \nsought to prevent terrorists convicted in military tribunals from \nappealing their convictions in Federal courts. She compared this \nlegislation to the ``fundamentally flawless'' actions of a \n``dictatorship'' that has ``passed laws stripping courts of power to \nreview executive detention or punishment of prisoners.'' That is not \nwhat I said. That is what Ms. Kagan said.\n  We have the best judicial system in the world. Equating our laws \nrelating to the war on terror to that of a dictatorship would be \nlaughable, were it not so pervasive in liberal academia.\n  Kagan has a history of misrepresenting facts to push her liberal \nagenda, including her efforts while working in the Clinton \nadministration to change statements of two medical associations to \nwithhold the truth about partial-birth abortion. This is interesting. \nBoth groups had a firm position, and she influenced a change in that \nposition. During the debate over the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, \nKagan wrote a memo to President Clinton in December 1996 objecting to \nthe release of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists--ACOG--proposed statement that partial-birth abortion is \nnever medically necessary. This is what their position was. They came \nout and said that it was never necessary.\n  ``The release of the statement would, of course, be a disaster.'' \nThose are her words, talking at that time to the Clinton \nadministration. We have evidence from Kagan's handwritten notes that \nshe advocated a change in the statement to reflect that partial-birth \nabortion may be medically necessary. One month later, ACOG released a \nstatement with language nearly identical to Kagan's language that such \nabortions may be medically necessary to save the life and preserve the \nhealth of the mother. In addition to seeking to change ACOG's position, \nKagan also sought to alter the American Medical Association position on \npartial-birth abortion. She once again tried to alter the facts and \nencourage AMA to change its medical policy on partial-birth abortion.\n  What is perhaps more concerning about Kagan's efforts to manipulate \nthe medical policy of ACOG and AMA is that these medical policy \nstatements were then used, sometimes successfully, in Federal courts to \ninvalidate State laws and the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. She \nmanipulated medical facts to advance a barbaric practice and push a \npolitical agenda.\n  We are talking about two highly respected medical associations that \nsaid partial-birth abortion was not something that was necessary, \nchanging their positions. Then that was later used in court cases. \nMoreover, Kagan criticized the Supreme Court decision of Rust v. \nSullivan which upheld the Department of Health and Human Services \nregulations prohibiting title X family planning funds from being \ndirected toward programs where abortion is a method of family planning.\n  Additionally, while clerking for Justice Marshall, she authored a \nmemo arguing that all religious organizations should be off limits from \nreceiving Federal funds for programs authorized by the Adolescent \nFamily Life Act such as pregnancy testing, prenatal/postnatal care, \nadoption counseling, and childcare, because these programs are so close \nto the central concerns of religion.\n  I also seriously question Kagan's willingness to honor and defend the \nsecond amendment, getting into an area that is probably more sensitive \nto a lot of my friends, including my son and members of the family, who \nare active and strong believers in second amendment rights. While \nclerking for Justice Marshall, Kagan wrote a memo about a case \nchallenging Washington, DC's strict gun control laws. In only four \nsentences she was dismissive of the case, writing that she was ``not \nsympathetic'' to an individual-rights view of the second amendment. As \neveryone knows, the Supreme Court has since upheld the individual right \nto keep and bear arms. Kagan also used her position with the Clinton \nadministration to advocate various anti-second amendment initiatives. \nDocuments from the Clinton library illustrate that she supported \nbackground checks for secondary market gun purchases as well as \nmunicipal liability suits against gun manufacturers.\n  She helped develop an executive order banning the importation of \ncertain types of semiautomatic weapons that were not covered by the \n1994 assaults weapons ban. She also sought to permit law enforcement to \nretain Brady background checks information on lawful gun sales.\n  Finally, in an internal document regarding the Volunteer Protection \nAct, she described the NRA as ``a bad guy organization.''\n  She might get by with that in this Chamber, but she wouldn't get by \nwith it in Oklahoma. We read the Constitution. We know what it says. \nShe has no respect for the second amendment.\n  I am also gravely concerned, based on Kagan's writings and \nstatements, that she would be a judicial activist who would seek to \nlegislate from the bench. In her 1998 masters thesis at Oxford she \nwrote:\n\n       As participants in American life, judges will have \n     opinions, prejudices, and values. Perhaps more important, \n     judges will have goals. And because this is so, judges will \n     often try to mold and steer the law in order to promote \n     certain ethical values and achieve social ends. Such activity \n     is not necessarily wrong or invalid.\n\n  She is stating, not just from today but going all the way back to her \nOxford days, that judicial activism is appropriate. Rather than affirm \nthe role\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\nof judges as the faithful interpreters of the law, Kagan voiced her \nsupport for judges who seek to serve as legislators, who develop their \nown empathy standards and apply the law in a matter they personally see \nfit. Her self-acknowledged judicial hero, Aharon Barak, perfectly fits \nthis mold. In her testimony before the committee, she even affirmed \nthat she would consider foreign law when she decides cases. She said:\n\n       I guess I'm in favor of good ideas from wherever they come.\n\n  We are talking about referring to other countries that have a \ndifferent judicial system and saying maybe they are right and maybe we \nare wrong. I simply cannot support a nominee who looks to other \njudicial systems or judicial philosophies or evolving standards of \ndecency rather than the text of the Constitution to interpret law.\n  I have thoroughly reviewed the record of Elena Kagan and have come to \nthe firm conclusion that she lacks the qualification and experience to \nbe a Supreme Court Justice.\n  I have named six things. Any one of these six should be \ndisqualifying. One is, she wants to consider foreign judiciaries. Two, \nshe has no judicial or trial experience. Third, she is a judicial \nactivist. Four, she is extreme in her philosophy on abortion and anti-\nsecond amendment views, and she is antimilitary.\n  I think of all the things I have mentioned, probably the part that \nconcerns me most is her position that if we are trying someone in a \nmilitary trial, maybe a terrorist or an activist, that they would be \ngiven the right to appeal to our court system and inherit all the \nbenefits any citizen of the United States has.\n  I can only say what I said several months ago when she was first \nnominated. In my opinion, as 1 of 100 Senators, if she is not qualified \nto be Solicitor General, she is certainly not qualified for the higher \njob of Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n                          Hydraulic Fracturing\n\n  I also wish to discuss one of the problems that is going to come up \ntomorrow, and that is with the Democratic and Republican energy bills. \nI am very concerned about a process that has been successful in \nextracting oil and primarily gas out of tight formations, known as \nhydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing started in Oklahoma in 1949. \nWe have used hydraulic fracturing to get at these tight formations for \n60 years, and there has never been one case of any kind of \ncontamination of water.\n  There are people who want to do away with our ability to run this \nmachine called America. They don't want oil, gas, coal, or nuclear. \nThat kind of gives an idea of what might be behind this.\n  Some say: No, we are not against hydraulic fracturing. This bill \nmerely says we want the Federal Government to know what chemicals are \nused.\n  This is already being done on a State-by-State basis. Things aren't \nthe same in Oklahoma as they are in New York. In Oklahoma, we have very \nstrict rules. They know exactly what chemicals are used. By the way, 99 \npercent of what is used on these formations is water and sand.\n  I am looking forward to talking in more detail with my good friend \nSenator Casey. He is kind of the author of this portion of the bill. \nYet his State of Pennsylvania has huge opportunities for natural gas. I \nthink we need to talk about that. We have enough natural gas that if we \nwould take away all the inhibitions we have and keep hydraulic \nfracturing as a process to be used, we could run the country for 100 \nyears. I think it is our job to make sure we protect that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6616-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 8:15 \np.m. will be divided in alternating 1-hour blocks, with the majority \ncontrolling the first block.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in congratulating \nChairman Leahy and Senator Sessions for conducting fair and impartial \nhearings for Solicitor General Kagan. I am here today to support \nGeneral Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court. Her confirmation will \nbe a milestone that we can all be proud of. For the first time in \nhistory, three women will be serving on the Supreme Court at one time.\n  General Kagan came before the Judiciary Committee with an impressive \nresume that had all the trappings of an accomplished lawyer worthy of \nappointment to the Supreme Court. During her hearings, she proved \nherself to be very well qualified for the job.\n  She impressed us with her sharp and keen mind, her intellect, and \ncomprehensive knowledge of the Constitution and the law. She pledged to \nconsider each case with an open mind and to impartially uphold the rule \nof law. She appeared mindful of the need for judicial modesty and \nfidelity to precedent, but not when it stands in the way of ending \ninjustice or guaranteeing our fundamental rights.\n  At times during the hearings, Solicitor General Kagan seemed to be \nsomewhat more candid than previous nominees. She disavowed a purely \noriginalist interpretation of the Constitution, recognizing that such a \nlimited approach will not always solve our 21st-century problems. I was \npleased she unequivocally expressed her support for opening the Supreme \nCourt to cameras. So I believe with General Kagan's confirmation, the \nAmerican people will be one step closer to seeing for themselves the \nSupreme Court debate our most pressing legal and constitutional issues.\n  But despite the strength of her qualifications, like so many nominees \nbefore her, General Kagan often retreated to the generalities and \nplatitudes she once criticized. I am pleased she rejected the analogy \nthat Supreme Court Justices are like umpires, simply calling balls and \nstrikes. Instead, she acknowledges that each Justice's legal judgment \ndetermines the outcome of close cases. But at times her answers gave us \ntoo little insight into what informs her unique legal judgment and how \nit will impact those close cases.\n  As I have said before, the confirmation process demands more than \nthat. This was the public's only opportunity to hear from General \nKagan. In my opinion, she made small inroads, but we still have a long \nway to go in meeting the high standard to which we should hold Supreme \nCourt nominees during their confirmation hearings.\n  In sum, I am voting for General Kagan because she is unquestionably \nwell qualified, has a record of being a principled, consensus-building \nlawyer, and because I believe her judicial philosophy is within the \nmainstream of our country's legal thought. I am confident she will make \na superb Supreme Court Justice and is a worthy nominee to carry on \nJustice Stevens' long legacy of exemplary public service to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, above the entrance of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt are four words, and four words only: ``Equal Justice Under Law.''\n  I rise today to support the nomination of Solicitor General Elena \nKagan to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. But I also \nrise today to put General Kagan's nomination in the context of the \nhistory of the Supreme Court and how that Court has affected the lives, \nthe jobs, and the safety of working Americans.\n  I want to ask if working Americans are actually getting equal justice \nunder law in the highest Court of our land. And I do not want to talk \nabout the Court's impact on working Americans in terms of stare decisis \nor deference to the political branches or judicial modesty. I want to \ntalk about this in terms of the real things that are happening to real \npeople--real working people--right here in the United States.\n  In 2003, a 54-year-old man named Jack Gross was working for an \ninsurance company in Iowa. A few years earlier, his company had chosen \nhim to rewrite all of their policies in 1 year. And\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nhe did it. In fact, he was one of the company's top employees. His 13 \nyears of performance reviews placed him in the top 3 to 5 percent of \nthe company.\n  But when his company merged with another company, Jack Gross got \ndemoted. In fact, so did all of the other Iowa employees who were 50 or \nolder. So Mr. Gross sued for age discrimination under a Federal law \ncalled the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. He went to trial \nbefore a jury of his peers, and he won.\n  The Roberts Court overturned that verdict. They said the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act did not ban all kinds of age \ndiscrimination, only age discrimination where age was the single \ndeterminative reason for a firing or a demotion.\n  The funny thing is that before the Roberts Court decided this, no one \nhad made that argument--not Gross, not the company, not Congress, no \none. The Court just pulled it out of thin air in favor of the company.\n  Is that equal justice under law?\n  In 1979, Lilly Ledbetter went to work at a Goodyear tire plant in \nGadsden, AL. She was also very good at her job. She even earned the \ncompany's top performance award. Being one of just a few women at the \nplant, she endured harassment that her male colleagues never faced.\n  But one day, after 19 years on the job, she found a note in her \nlocker which told her she was making much less than her male coworkers. \nSo she went to court and tried to get Goodyear to pay her the same \nthing they had paid the men who had her same job. She went to trial \nbefore a jury of her peers, and she won. The jury awarded Ms. Ledbetter \n$3 million.\n  But the Roberts Court struck down the award. Why? Because Lilly \nLedbetter had not gone to court within 180 days of her first \ndiscriminatory paycheck decades earlier, even though she had no way of \nknowing what her male coworkers were making back then, even though the \ncompany continued to discriminate against her for decades after that, \neven though the Congress did not write the law that way.\n  Is that equal justice under law?\n  In February 1989, a man named Joe Banta was preparing for the herring \nfishing season in his hometown of Cordova, AK. For three generations, \nthe Banta family had made their living fishing herring--as the \nPresiding Officer well knows this story--and digging for clams in \nPrince William Sound.\n  All of that ended on March 24, 1989, when the Exxon Valdez--the oil \ntanker--crashed into a reef and spilled hundreds of thousands of \nbarrels of crude oil into the sound in the Presiding Officer's home \nState.\n  Shortly before leaving port, the captain of the Valdez had downed not \none, not two, but five double Vodka shots. There was proof that Exxon \nknew full well about his alcohol problem. To this day we can find oil \nfrom the Exxon Valdez in the waters of Prince William Sound. To this \nday the herring in Prince William Sound have not come back. To this day \ngenerations of fishermen such as Joe Banta are out of work.\n  With the help of a Minnesota attorney, Brian O'Neill, the fishermen \nof Prince William Sound took Exxon to court. They took Exxon before a \njury of their peers, and they won. The jury awarded them $5 billion. \nThat is a fraction of Exxon's $45 billion in profit in 2008. But the \nRoberts Court slashed the verdict to one-tenth of its original size. \nFive million dollars is, of course, a lot of money, but it had to be \ndivided among 32,000 people.\n  Here is the other thing: There was not a rule that called for this. \nThere is no statute or precedent that said the Court had to cap the \nfishermen's damages. So the Roberts Court just made one up. They made \nup a cap for what the fishermen could recover--after the fishermen sued \nand got a verdict from a jury of their peers.\n  When the Court needed to justify that cap, it said jury verdicts were \ntoo unpredictable for companies and that even a ``bad man'' deserves \nreasonably predictable jury verdicts. This is the standard that will \nsoon be applied to the fishermen of the gulf coast.\n\n  Is this equal justice under law?\n  Jack Gross, Lilly Ledbetter, and Joe Banta are not alone.\n  Since 2005, the Roberts Court has also struck down a century-old \nprecedent that protected small business owners from price fixing. It \nhas made it harder for investors to sue the firms that knowingly \nparticipated in a scheme to defraud them. In fact, it has made it \nharder for everyone to get their day in court, especially individual \nemployees and investors.\n  It has removed half of the Nation's largest known polluters from \ncoverage under the Clean Water Act. It has found that corporations--\ncorporations--have the same free speech rights in our elections as \nhuman beings.\n  When the Roberts Court chooses between corporate America and working \nAmericans, it goes with corporate America almost every time, even when \nthe citizens of this country, sitting in a duly appointed jury, have \ndecided it the other way.\n  That is not right. It is not equal justice under the law.\n  Today we consider the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to \na Court that has made those words an empty promise to most working \nAmericans. It is fitting that General Kagan has been nominated for \nJustice Stevens' seat because the last three Justices to occupy this \nseat--Justice Stevens, Justice Douglas, and Justice Brandeis--were all \ndeeply skeptical of corporate power. All three Justices rejected the \nidea that the Constitution cannot tell the difference between \ncorporations and human beings.\n  Justice Louis Brandeis argued throughout his career that the massive \nwealth held by corporations was dangerous to democracy; that corporate \ninterests could wield far too much influence, not because of the \nstrength of their arguments but because of the size of their bank \naccounts. In fact, he wrote a book about this. It is called ``Other \nPeople's Money--and How Bankers Use It.'' In that book, Brandeis \ncatalogued example after example of how Wall Street bankers took \nadvantage of their position to enrich themselves at the expense of the \nAmerican people. Does this sound familiar? And it was in this book that \nhe famously stated that ``sunlight is said to be the best of \ndisinfectants''--that you have to train an unwavering spotlight on the \nschemes and machinations of corporate America.\n\n  After he joined the Supreme Court, Justice Brandeis wrote in a \ndissent in a 1933 case that our Nation's Founders understood the \n``insidious menace inherent in large aggregations of capital, \nparticularly when held by corporations,'' and that this ``difference in \npower between corporations and natural persons is ample basis''--ample \nbasis--for treating them differently under the law.\n  Justice William Douglas joined the Supreme Court upon Justice \nBrandeis's retirement. Before joining the Court, Justice Douglas was \nChairman of the SEC, where he crusaded for investor protections and led \ninvestigations into unethical corporations. While Chairman of the SEC, \nin an address to the Fordham University Alumni Association, Douglas \nwarned that ``one aspect of modern life which has gone far to stifle \nmen is the rapid growth of the tremendous corporation'' and that in \nthese conglomerates, ``service to human beings becomes subordinate to \nprofits.''\n  In a 1949 case, Justice Douglas wrote that if Americans ``want \ncorporations to be treated as humans are treated, if they want to grant \ncorporations this large degree of emancipation from state regulation, \nthey should say so. [ . . . ] We should not do it for them through the \nguise of interpretation.'' Justice Douglas understood that corporations \nare not people, don't have the same rights as people, and that our laws \nare critical in keeping their power in check.\n  Justice Stevens continued this tradition. In Ledbetter, in Gross, in \nExxon, in Stoneridge, in Rapanos, and in Citizens United, Justice \nStevens fought the empowerment of big business at the expense of \nworking Americans. In fact, in most of these cases, Justice Stevens led \nthe dissent. He is the Justice who said in no uncertain terms that \n``corporations are not a part of `We, the People,' by whom and for whom \nour Constitution was established.''\n  I have said it before--General Kagan has big shoes to fill. But after \nmonths of learning more about General Kagan and a week of confirmation \nhearings, I think it is safe to say there is no question she can do it.\n  Some have criticized General Kagan because she lacks experience as a\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\njudge, even though 40 out of the 111 Justices in the Supreme Court's \nhistory had not been judges before they served on the High Court and \neven though Justice Scalia said only this January in a speech in \nJackson, MS, that the Court needs Justices who haven't been judges.\n  It seems to me that Senators have been going to absurd lengths to \ndiscount General Kagan's qualifications. We even had a Senator in the \nhearings who acknowledged that, yes, there has been a long history of \nJustices who have never served previously as judges but that those \nJustices averaged more than 20 years of private practice experience, \nwhereas General Kagan only worked for 2 years in a law firm. To me, \nthis has a tortured ring of someone arguing that every southpaw Cy \nYoung winner in the American League since the advent of the designated \nhitter has had a lower ERA in away games on AstroTurf than any right-\nhander.\n  To people making these kinds of arguments, I wish to say this: You \nonly have one life. I think that in her 50 years, General Kagan has \namassed an incredible record of service and accomplishment. She has \nbeen a clerk for a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; special counsel \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee; a top adviser to the 42nd President \nof the United States; the first woman dean of Harvard Law School; and \nthe first woman to be Solicitor General in the history of the United \nStates. So is she qualified for the job? Of course. Of course she is. \nBut General Kagan has done more than show she is qualified for the job; \nshe has also shown she understands it. She has shown she understands \nthe obligation of the Supreme Court to the American people and to the \nCongress that represents them.\n  For years, conservatives have warned that we should beware of \nactivist judges who overreach their powers, that we should beware of \njudges who legislate from the bench. Now that the Roberts Court is in \npower, suddenly these same conservatives are saying there is really no \nsuch thing as judicial activism, it is all in the eye of the beholder, \nand that an activist judge is just a judge who issues decisions you \ndon't like. But General Kagan hasn't taken the bait. General Kagan said \nthere is such a thing as activism. She said it herself: An activist \njudge is a judge who doesn't defer to the policy decisions of the \npolitical branches, who doesn't respect precedent, and who doesn't \ndecide cases narrowly, avoiding constitutional questions when possible. \nAnd when she said that, I think most people sitting in the committee \nroom at her confirmation hearing liked that definition.\n  When you apply that definition to the Roberts Court--to the cases \nupon cases where the Roberts Court has limited the rights of workers or \npensioners or investors or small business owners or voters--you find \nthere is no question, no question whatsoever that this is an activist \nCourt. It is a Court that has replaced Congress's policy judgments with \nits own perspective, with its own prejudices, a Court that has \nlegislated from the bench.\n  But, as I said, in her confirmation hearings, General Kagan didn't \njust define activism, she didn't just acknowledge its existence, she \nalso said clearly and repeatedly that she would avoid it. If she is \nconfirmed and if we have a Justice Kagan, as I am certain we will, she \nwill continue a long tradition of protecting and serving the American \npeople. She will serve them with equal justice under law.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota. I certainly concur with his conclusion. We serve on the \nJudiciary Committee together. We both heard the testimony of Elena \nKagan as well as had a chance to ask her questions and listen to her \nresponses to other Senators. She is an extraordinarily talented woman \nwho could bring to the Supreme Court a wealth of experience. I couldn't \nagree with the Senator from Minnesota more that the fact that she has \nnot worn a judicial robe before does not in any way disqualify her. She \nhas an exemplary resume.\n  I thank the Senator for noting the most important element here is \nthat many of the arguments that have been used against judicial \nnominees in the past have evaporated on the other side of the aisle \nbecause the Roberts Court is in the midst of an activist phase--\nsomething they promised would never happen, and it has happened, but it \nhas happened to the satisfaction of one part of the political spectrum, \nwhere there are fewer critics as a result.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his eloquent remarks in \nrelation to Elena Kagan.\n\n\n                           Credit Card Reform\n\n  Mr. President, this morning I took a look at the Wall Street Journal \nWeb site, and there was an article entitled ``The New Credit Card \nTricks.'' I thought to myself, I hope my wife doesn't get a chance to \nsee this because ever since last year when we reformed credit cards in \nAmerica, I come home on the weekends to Springfield, IL, and my wife \nhands me a new envelope she has opened.\n  Guess what they are doing, Mr. Senator.\n  In that envelope will be the latest changes in our credit cards from \nthese companies. I have to say we pay off our credit cards. We do our \nbest and almost always pay them off on a monthly basis. We have a \npretty good credit rating--maybe not the best but a pretty good one. \nYet we have been receiving notices for the last year from these credit \ncard companies about changes and to read the contract. I wear these \nglasses, but I need a magnifying glass to read the contract, and I am a \nlawyer. Trying to understand what they are doing to me is very hard. \nBut then in bold print you will see an interest rate number that has \njust gone up or a charge that has just gone up.\n  My wife said to me: What is this all about? I thought you reformed \ncredit cards.\n  This morning's Wall Street Journal, in an article entitled ``The New \nCredit Card Tricks,'' tells the story about what has been happening \nsince 2009 when we decided to reform credit cards. Well, as one man \nsaid, whose name is Victor Stango and who is an associate economist \nwith the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago--he has been analyzing the \nCredit Card Reform Act, and he said it is a race between regulators \nwriting ever more complex laws and credit card companies setting up \nevermore complex fees.\n\n  Just to give an idea of what we are talking about, the article says:\n\n       So the banks are getting aggressive. According to a July 22 \n     report from Pew Charitable Trust, a nonpartisan research \n     group, the industry's median annual fee on bank credit cards \n     jumped 18 percent to $59 between July of 2009 and March of \n     this year, 2010.\n\n  Credit unions, which are often viewed as the hometown, smalltown mom-\nand-pop, closest to the people, your best friends when it comes to \nbanking--listen to this:\n  At credit unions, annual fees soared 67 percent in that same period \nto $25. During the same period, the median cash-advance and balance-\ntransfer fees jumped by 33 percent.\n  So it isn't just a matter of raising fees; it turns out they are \nraising them at a gallop, at a fast rate, trying to get ahead of the \ncredit card reform bill.\n  They have also dreamed up a dozen different ways to beat the law. \nGive us a year, they said, so we can change our books and get \neverything ready for the new credit card reform. They spent their year \nwith their lawyers and accountants dreaming up new ways to avoid the \nlaw. We should have known it. We shouldn't have given them all this \ntime.\n  They have dreamed up something called professional cards. These are \nlike corporate cards but carry the same terms as consumer cards and \nthey aren't covered under the new law. They are reinventing the credit \ncard with a new name and a higher fee and a higher interest rate, and \nthey skirt around the laws we passed.\n  We said in the law--incidentally, we stipulate that late-payment fees \nshouldn't be triggered on a Sunday or a holiday because you couldn't \nput anything in the mail. Well, here is a man, whom they talk about in \nthis article, by the name of Alan Condon of Woodstock, GA. He ended up \nfacing one of these penalty fees, and he noticed that the day it was \ntriggered was a Sunday. He has read the new Credit CARD Act. That is \nnot supposed to happen. You can imagine what it took for Mr.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nCondon to challenge the Discover Card, which eventually, after all of \nhis protests, waived the late fee they charged him. How many people \nhave that kind of determination to stick with it, as he did?\n  They have new cards such as a rebate card which, if you don't read it \ncarefully, sounds like a great deal on a credit card and ends up taking \nmoney away from you.\n  I could go on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the WSJ.com, Aug. 3, 2010]\n\n                     (By Jessica Silver-Greenberg)\n\n       Whomever President Barack Obama taps to head the new Bureau \n     of Consumer Financial Protection could find it difficult to \n     keep ahead of the credit-card industry.\n       The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and \n     Disclosure Act of 2009, known as the Card Act, was intended \n     to reshape the contours of consumer finance. Among other \n     things, it forces card issuers to give customers more notice \n     about interest-rate increases and restricts certain \n     controversial billing practices such as inactivity fees.\n       Yet some of the biggest card issuers in the U.S., including \n     Citigroup Inc., J.P Morgan Chase & Co. and Discover Financial \n     Services, are already rolling out a slew of fees designed to \n     recapture some of their lost income, in part by skirting the \n     new rules. Some banks may even be violating the law outright, \n     say consumer advocates.\n       ``Card companies are figuring out how to replace old fees \n     with new ones,'' says Victor Stango, an associate economist \n     with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and a professor at \n     the University of California, Davis, who has been analyzing \n     how the Card Act will affect consumer banking. ``It's a race \n     between regulators writing ever-more-complex laws and credit-\n     card companies setting up ever-more-complex fees.''\n       The banks have a big gap to fill. The Card Act is expected \n     to wipe out about $390 million a year in fee revenue, \n     according to David Robertson, the publisher of industry \n     newsletter Nilson Report. On July 16, during its second-\n     quarter earnings call with analysts, Bank of America Corp. \n     Chief Financial Officer Charles Noski warned that the Card \n     Act and other regulatory changes would prompt the bank, the \n     nation's largest in assets, to write off up to $10 billion in \n     the third quarter.\n       ``If you have every major issuer saying that we are losing \n     our shirt, then that speaks volumes,'' Mr. Robertson says. \n     ``Proportionately, these fees should be understood as almost \n     inconsequential compared to the losses.''\n       So the banks are getting aggressive. According to a July 22 \n     report from Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan research \n     group, the industry's median annual fee on bank credit cards \n     jumped 18% to $59 between July 2009 and March 2010. At credit \n     unions, annual fees soared 67% to $25. During the same \n     period, the median cash-advance and balance-transfer fees \n     jumped by 33%.\n       All of these increases are perfectly legal, of course. \n     Banks and other issuers would have a difficult time extending \n     credit to consumers, even at high interest rates, if they \n     couldn't augment those revenues with fee income. ``We're \n     coming out of a deep recession that issuers are still working \n     through,'' says Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for the American \n     Bankers Association.\n       But some banks may be going too far. In a July 7 letter to \n     the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which \n     regulates many of the biggest U.S. banks, a coalition of \n     consumer groups including the National Consumer Law Center, \n     the Consumer Federation of America and Consumer Action \n     flagged several ``potential violations of the Credit Card \n     Act.''\n       Other banks are ramping up their marketing of so-called \n     professional cards. These are like corporate cards but can \n     carry the same terms as consumer cards--and aren't covered \n     under the new law. In the first quarter of this year, issuers \n     sent out 47 million professional-card offers to U.S. \n     households, up from 13.2 million in the corresponding period \n     last year, according to research firm Synovate.\n       ``This can be a very easy way around the Card Act,'' says \n     Josh Frank, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsible \n     Lending, a consumer group.\n       The upshot: Borrowers must be more vigilant than ever--even \n     before they make their first charge on a new credit card.\n\n\n                         Saddled With Late Fees\n\n       Alan Condon of Woodstock, Ga., says he carefully reviews \n     his card statements each month, and even read the Card Act--\n     all 33 pages--after it was passed in May 2009.\n       Among other things, the Card Act stipulates that late-\n     payment fees shouldn't be triggered on a Sunday or holiday, \n     when there is no mail delivery.\n       The rule ``is clearly meant to offer cardholders some \n     semblance of relief so that they don't get saddled with late \n     fees for making a reasonable payment on the next business \n     day,'' says Chi Chi Wu, a consumer credit lawyer at the \n     National Consumer Law Center.\n       Mr. Condon says he was shocked when he opened his credit-\n     card statement dated June 18 and saw that Discover had \n     charged him $39 for a late payment--and had upped his \n     interest rate on future purchases from 17% to 24.99%. He says \n     the company considered him late because he paid on June 14, \n     instead of June 13, a Sunday.\n       ``I just got mad,'' says the 56-year-old computer-software \n     developer, who says he had never before been late on a \n     Discover payment.\n       ``We were in compliance with the Card Act,'' says Discover \n     spokesman Matthew Towson. ``The law states that if a creditor \n     does not receive or accept payments on weekends or holidays, \n     then the date is extended. But we accept payments seven days \n     a week.''\n       Nevertheless, Discover reviewed Mr. Condon's account at The \n     Wall Street Journal's request and decided to waive the late \n     fee and reduce Mr. Condon's interest rate to its earlier \n     level.\n       The Card Act also stipulates that issuers can't jack up \n     rates on existing balances unless a cardholder is at least 60 \n     days late. But there is a creative maneuver around that: the \n     so-called rebate card.\n       Citibank rolled out rebate-card offers to some of its \n     customers last fall, offering to refund up to 70% of finance \n     charges when customers pay on time. The problem: Rebate \n     offers aren't governed by the Card Act, and an issuer can \n     revoke them suddenly and hit cardholders with high charges.\n       The net result is the same as raising rates--and because it \n     is perfectly legal, customers have little recourse. ``Rebates \n     on finance payments may seem like a good deal, but you could \n     end up with a very high interest rate suddenly,'' says Mr. \n     Frank, of the Center for Responsible Lending.\n       ``The rebate offer is clear, transparent, and we believe \n     fully within the spirit of the Card Act,'' says Citigroup \n     spokesman Samuel Wang.\n       Shortening the billing cycle is another new tactic some \n     banks may be using. The Card Act requires companies to \n     provide a window of at least 21 days from when a statement is \n     mailed and when payment is due.\n       Yet the National Consumer Law Center and Consumer Action \n     say they have received complaints from borrowers who allege \n     that their billing cycles have been shortened to fewer than \n     21 days.\n       ``Since the passage of the act, we've heard from numerous \n     borrowers alleging that they are shortchanged on billing \n     cycle time,'' says Joe Ridout, a consumer-services manager at \n     Consumer Action.\n\n\n                         Inactivity Fees Return\n\n       As expected, issuers also are raising basic fees in the \n     wake of the Card Act, in some cases significantly. Many \n     credit-card companies, for example, are increasing their \n     balance-transfer charges sharply. ``We are seeing an increase \n     across the board in fees because card companies are sensitive \n     about their ability to price for risk,'' says Mr. Robertson \n     of the Nilson Report.\n       Last June, for example, J.P. Morgan's Chase unit alerted \n     customers that its maximum balance-transfer fee was rising to \n     5% from 2% on a wide range of its cards.\n       ``In a higher-loss environment, it's important that we are \n     prudent with our balance-transfer offers,'' says Stephanie \n     Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the bank. She adds that ``We \n     often do have lower rates in a competitive marketplace.''\n       Companies are raising their minimum finance charges, too. \n     Before the Card Act, the average minimum monthly finance \n     charge was about 50 cents, according to Nick Bourke, director \n     of the Safe Credit Card Project at Pew. Now, he says, those \n     fees can reach $1.50.\n       That difference might not seem like a lot, but it adds up. \n     Borrowers pay $430 million a year in minimum-finance charges \n     alone, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.\n       The Card Act's provisions are being implemented in stages, \n     with the last phase taking effect on Aug. 22. After that, \n     issuers will no longer be able to charge ``inactivity fees,'' \n     or extra charges for people who don't spend a certain amount \n     each year.\n       So companies are dressing them up in other ways.\n       Citigroup, for example, has started charging some of its \n     customers an annual fee, which can be waived if a customer's \n     card activity exceeds $2,400 a year.\n       Tristan Denyer of San Francisco says he was surprised when \n     he got a notice that Citigroup was instituting a $60 annual \n     fee on his card. Mr. Denyer, 37, a senior Web designer, says \n     he rarely carried a balance on his card, and refused to rack \n     up the $2,400 in charges necessary to erase the fee.\n       ``I figured this was just a tactic to get me to spend more \n     and give them more money,'' Mr. Denyer says. He says he \n     decided to close his account.\n       Citigroup's Mr. Wang acknowledges that Card Act rules \n     forbid the waiving of annual fees based on ``a customer's \n     annual spending on the card.'' He adds, however, that ``the \n     rules will not prohibit cash-back rewards or similar \n     incentives that encourage account usage.''\n       Another potential trap: low-credit-limit cards, which are \n     popular among college students.\n       The Card Act says a card's total annual fees can't exceed \n     25% of a borrower's credit line. But some issuers may be \n     evading the fee restrictions by charging an \n     upfront processing fee that doesn't fall under the 25% \n     cap.\n       First Premier Bank, headquartered in Sioux Falls, S.D., \n     offers several low-credit-\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n     limit cards. Its Centennial card comes with a $300 limit and \n     a $95 upfront processing fee.\n       Melinda Robinson of Lorena, Texas, learned firsthand how \n     rapidly fees could eat into her credit limit. After receiving \n     a card with a $250 credit limit from First Premier, she says, \n     she was immediately charged $170 in combined fees. When she \n     tried to use the card for the first time, she exceeded her \n     credit limit, triggering more fees.\n       ``When they first send you the card, they automatically \n     charge you fees that eat up half of it,'' says Ms. Robinson.\n       First Premier Bank's president and chief executive, Miles \n     Beacom, says the $95 processing fee doesn't violate the Card \n     Act because it is assessed before the account is opened. He \n     adds that the fee offsets the risk associated with offering \n     these cards to ``high-risk individuals.''\n       Foreign-transaction fees are on the march as well. The \n     average fee for foreign transactions has jumped to 3% of the \n     transaction from roughly 2% in 2008, according to Ben \n     Woolsey, director of marketing and consumer research at \n     Creditcards.com.\n       Some card holders are finding they don't even need to leave \n     their living room to get hit with a foreign-transaction fee. \n     Ruth Ann Sando, a small-business owner in Washington, says \n     she has been burned repeatedly on her Visa card issued by \n     Pentagon Federal Credit Union, the third-largest credit union \n     in the U.S.\n       Ms. Sando used to do a lot of business with AbeBooks, an \n     online retailer. But she found that she was getting hit with \n     foreign-transaction fees even though her purchases were in \n     dollars. That is because while the seller and shipper were \n     based in the U.S., Abe, headquartered in Canada, provides the \n     forum for book sellers and collects a portion of the proceeds \n     from all sales.\n       So late last year, Ms. Sando says, she decided to stop \n     buying from the site altogether. ``Not buying books is the \n     only way I can protest the fee,'' she says.\n       ``The fee is legal, but all these fees circumvent the [Card \n     Act's] goal of clear and straightforward pricing,'' Mr. \n     Woolsey says.\n       Pentagon Federal Credit Union says some of its cards carry \n     a foreign-transaction fee of 2% of the U.S. dollar amount of \n     the transaction.\n\n\n                             Fighting Back\n\n       While the credit-card landscape may seem littered with \n     landmines, there are ways to guard against some of the worst \n     pitfalls. The first and simplest: Make your card payments on \n     time.\n       Second, say consumer advocates, people should dispute fees \n     directly with the issuer when they believe something is \n     amiss.\n       ``Cardholders would be surprised at how much they can raise \n     hell and get a change,'' says Mr. Condon, who says he \n     immediately contacted Discover after the late charge appeared \n     on his statement.\n       They might have to make repeated calls, however.\n       ``While the Credit Card Act did make great strides in \n     protecting consumers, it in no way closed all avenues for \n     cardholders to get hit with fees,'' says Ms. Wu, from the \n     National Consumer Law Center. ``It's a first step.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to those who will be critical of the \nremarks I am about to make, this is not from some French Socialist \njournal; this is not from some left-leaning magazine; this is a news \nstory in the Wall Street Journal this morning which is talking about \nwhat the credit card companies are doing.\n  So the obvious question one would ask if you live in Illinois or any \nother place, for that matter, and which we should ask ourselves is, Are \nwe powerless to stop this? Are we powerless to stop these banks, credit \nunions, and credit card companies from basically ignoring reform in the \nlaw, from finding ways to skirt the law and charge even more?\n  Well, the answer is we are not. I will tell you why. Because last \nweek President Obama signed into law the strongest consumer financial \nprotections in the history of the United States. The bill, which was \nauthored by Senator Chris Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, and Congressman Barney Frank, his counterpart in the House, \nthe Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included many \nprovisions that will help consumers immediately--especially regarding \nmortgages and credit cards. Make no mistake, as this article tells us, \nthe big banks on Wall Street are working overtime already to dream up \nways to avoid this new law as well. The law will never keep up with \ntheir lawyers and accountants. They will always find a way around it.\n  That is why the bill included something we have never had before in \nthe United States: a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.\n  This bureau has one responsibility: to make consumer financial \nmarkets work for American families, not just for the banks. The bureau \nwill ensure that sellers of mortgages, credit cards, private student \nloans, pay-day lenders, and other types of financial products must \ncompete for customers based on the quality of their products, rather \nthan the number of tricks and traps they can hide in the fine print \nthey stick behind your monthly statement.\n  Here is the thing. This agency is only going to be as effective as \nthe people who run it and work for it. That is even more true for a \nbrandnew agency such as this one. The person who is chosen as the first \nleader will set the tone for the regulators for years to come, even \ndecades.\n  It is critical that the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection be \nput in place with a director who is aggressive, intelligent, and \nunderstands the challenge they will face; a director who is fair, one \nwho believes in the power of the marketplace but understands that \nmarkets work better if everybody participating in those markets \nbenefits; a director who will listen to what bankers are saying but can \nsee through them when they try to slant lending markets too far in \ntheir favor; a director who thinks, first and foremost, about how \nAmerican families can thrive in today's complicated economy.\n  Fortunately, there is a person who can fill that job effectively. Her \nname is Elizabeth Warren.\n  Professor Elizabeth Warren first proposed the creation of an \nindependent financial regulator to look out for consumers 3 years ago, \nin 2007. In 2008, she helped me draft a bill based on her idea. We \ncalled it the Consumer Credit Safety Commission back then.\n  In the spring of last year, she worked to change the bill, and we \nrenamed it the Financial Product Safety Commission.\n  Last summer, when the Obama administration released its plan for \nreforming Wall Street, our idea was rechristened as the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Agency.\n  It is now officially called the Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection, and it is now the law of the land. Whatever the name, \nProfessor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School, more than any person \nin this country, was the driving force behind the creation of this \nagency.\n  Years ago, Professor Warren made a name for herself when she wrote a \nbook called ``The Two-Income Trap,'' in which she described how hard it \nis for working families to get by in today's economy. She taught a \npopular course at Harvard on bankruptcy and has written extensively on \nhow difficult it is for many families to start over when their lives \ntake a turn for the worse.\n  She has most recently last served as a watchdog, a chairwoman of the \ncongressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \notherwise known as TARP. She has taken a look at the money--the \ntaxpayer dollars--given to these banks to make sure we weren't cheated \nand to blow the whistle on banks that didn't do the right thing.\n  She has done that and done it extremely well. For the past 3 years, \nshe has advocated tirelessly for the creation of this agency. The \npurpose of this agency is to empower every single one of us, as \nconsumers, to get the right information and not be tricked or deceived, \nso we can do the right thing for ourselves and our families and our \nsmall businesses.\n  Throughout her work, a common theme has emerged: Government should \nwork for the American people and not the other way around. Elizabeth \nWarren is the right person to head this new agency.\n  Much has been written--some of it critical--on the prospect of \nProfessor Warren being nominated as Director of this new consumer \nbureau. Wall Street banks anonymously argue to the media--and even to \nSenators--that she would restrict access to credit. Nonsense. The only \ntypes of credit she would restrict are predatory loans. That is just a \nsmokescreen for saying the banks are going to face their \nresponsibilities and perhaps not take all the profit they want at the \nexpense of consumers who are deceived.\n  Professor Warren has said publicly--and I believe her--that she \ndoesn't begrudge banks making profits; they are in business. She would \nprefer--as I and I think most Americans would--that banks make money by \nproviding American families with good products, good credit cards, good \nmortgages, and good student loans.\n  The banks also argue she doesn't understand their business well \nenough to\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nregulate it. They are afraid of her. They know how smart she is and \nthat she would not be teaching at Harvard Law School successfully and \nleading so many efforts forward for this country if she didn't have the \nskill and intelligence it takes.\n  Professor Warren will bring to the bureau passion and compassion, a \nbig-picture vision and nuts-and-bolts knowledge. She is the right \nperson for the most important job in the country.\n  I say to my wife and to anybody who read the Wall Street Journal this \nmorning, with the right person at this new Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, help is on the way. We need to put into place \nsomeone who will blow the whistle on those who break the law, abuse the \nlaw, and engage in practices that deceive Americans and American \nfamilies. We need somebody at that agency who empowers us, as \nconsumers, to make the right decisions for our families. Elizabeth \nWarren, professor of Harvard Law School, is the right person.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of our Solicitor General, Elena Kagan, as Associate Justice \nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The power the Constitution gives the Senate to advise and consent to \nPresidential nominations is a very important one but never more \nsignificant than when we are called upon to respond to a President's \nnomination of a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court because this \nnomination is for a lifetime to the Court, from which there is no \nappeal. It is the final arbiter of justice in our system of justice, in \nour system of government. So these are important moments, when we are \ncalled upon to respond to a President's nomination to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I remember once, early on, after I came to the Senate, during a \ncontroversial nomination to the Supreme Court, and our late and truly \ngreat colleague, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, said something I will \nnever forget. He said that, normally, when we consider whether to \nadvise and consent to a President's nomination to a Federal position, \nwe give, understandably, the benefit of the doubt to the nominee, the \nperson whom the President has nominated; when it comes to the Supreme \nCourt--Senator Byrd said and counseled--the benefit of the doubt should \ngo to the Supreme Court because of the lifetime tenure of Justices of \nthe Supreme Court and their beyond-appeal role in our system of \ngovernment.\n  I have that in mind by way of saying, beyond any doubt, I feel \ncertain Elena Kagan, Solicitor General, will serve the cause of justice \nand our Nation very well as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n\n  Those either in the galleries or watching the debate on C-SPAN may \nwonder, occasionally, when they hear us refer to the nominee as \n``general''--General Kagan. It reminds me of when I was privileged to \nbe elected attorney general of Connecticut. I went to an orientation \nfor new attorneys general and I walked in and somebody said, ``Hello, \nGeneral.'' I turned around, thinking somebody was behind me. It was the \nfirst time I had been addressed that way. Solicitors General are \nreferred to as ``general'' as well.\n  So establishing the standard as I have, I would say General Elena \nKagan possesses impressive academic and professional qualifications, \nwith her broad range of experiences as a clerk for a Supreme Court \nJustice, a lawyer in private practice, a legal and policy adviser to \nPresident Clinton, a law professor at the University of Chicago, and \nthen at Harvard, where she ultimately became dean, and most recently as \nSolicitor General of the United States, which will enable her to serve \nour Nation and the cause of justice well if--and I hope when--she is \nconfirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  General Kagan showed, on the day the President nominated her, that \nshe understands the importance and unique importance of the Supreme \nCourt. She said:\n\n       The Court is an extraordinary institution in the work it \n     does and in the work it can do for the American people by \n     advancing the tenets of our Constitution, by upholding the \n     rule of law, and by enabling all Americans, regardless of \n     their background or their beliefs, to get a fair hearing and \n     an equal chance at justice.\n\n  General Kagan then continued by complimenting retiring Justice John \nPaul Stevens, whose seat she will fill if confirmed to this position, \nfor the ``distinguished and exemplary role'' Justice Stevens has played \non the Supreme Court for the last 35 years.\n  I wish to say that, in my opinion, the most significant thing about \nJustice Stevens' service has been his independence of mind, his single-\nminded focus and commitment to the cause of justice because this is the \nbranch of our government that must be beyond politics and even rigid \nideology.\n  The Founders, in all their genius, when they put together the form of \nthe American Government, coming from England as so many of them did, \nworried about the autocratic power of the King, wanted to create a \ndemocracy and yet wanted to make sure there were checks and balances. \nThe Supreme Court was set up as one of the three branches of our \ngovernment that was not accountable to the people; its accountability \nwas solely to the Constitution. I think Justice Stevens, whether you \nagreed with every decision he wrote or not--and I agreed with some but \nnot others--always demonstrated an ability to transcend politics and \nideology and put the requirements of justice and the law, as he saw \nthem, above all else.\n  I am confident General Kagan, as a Supreme Court Justice, will follow \nJustice Stevens' example. I predict today that, in the years ahead, if \nand when confirmed, Justice Kagan will surprise many people, including \nSenators who on this vote will vote for her and those who will vote \nagainst her. She will not be predictable. That is one of the best \nthings I think we can say about a Supreme Court nominee. She will be \njudicial and independent-minded. She will serve the Constitution and \nthe national interest, not any party or people or rigid ideology.\n  I must say I have been encouraged in this view by the way in which \nGeneral Kagan has carried out her duties as Solicitor General of the \nUnited States. She has consistently demonstrated her commitment to \nupholding the Constitution, as well as her understanding of and respect \nfor the appropriate roles of Congress, the executive branch, and the \ncourts. She has not shied away from difficult cases or taking difficult \npositions when she has come to the conclusion that those positions were \ndemanded by the Nation's needs and by the law's requirements.\n  I wish to cite one powerful example, to me, which I discussed with \nher when I met her on her rounds in the Senate; that is, her case \nbefore the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in the \ncase of Al Maqaleh v. Gates. It was a Federal district court judgment, \nwhere the court ruled it had jurisdiction to consider the habeas \npetitions of prisoners of war being held by the U.S. military at Bagram \nAir Force Base in Afghanistan. In other words, the court said that if \nwe captured an enemy terrorist or soldier in Afghanistan and put them \nin the U.S. prison facility or detention facility at Bagram Air Force \nBase in Afghanistan, that individual could file a habeas petition \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States in Washington to have his \nor her detention reviewed by our highest Court. To me it is an \nunbelievable decision and a harmful decision.\n\n  The Solicitor General typically represents our government only in \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court. I asked General Kagan why she got \ninvolved in this case. She told me that she felt so strongly about how \nharmful the District Court decision would be to our Nation's ability to \nsucceed in the wars against radical Islamist extremism we are involved \nin now that she made this case the exception in which she felt it \nappropriate and necessary for her as Solicitor General to argue on \nbehalf of the United States in the Court of Appeals, not just in the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  I could not agree more with General Kagan's assessment of the \nimportance of the case and wrongness of the District Court decision. I \nagree with her assessment of the merits of the case. I appreciate that \nshe chose to get involved. And I was extremely pleased when the DC \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the position argued by General Kagan and \nreversed the decision of the District Court. That, I think, tells us a\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nlot about the independence of mind and commitment to the higher \nnational interests of General Elena Kagan.\n  In reviewing the respective backgrounds of Justice Stevens and \nGeneral Kagan as his proposed replacement, I was pleased to see some \nsimilarities in their careers. I suppose it is true of many nominated \nto the Supreme Court. They both have impeccable academic credentials. \nThey both clerked for Supreme Court Justices at the beginning of their \nlegal careers. They both then served in private practice, followed by \ntimes in academia and then the government.\n  The important point I am making and what I believe would be a \nsimilarity between these two great Americans is that General Kagan, \nlike the jurist she will be replacing, will be viewed at the end of her \ncareer as a Justice who put partisanship, politics, and ideology aside \nand put justice first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I, therefore, say in conclusion that I support Elena \nKagan. I urge my colleagues to give her a strong vote of confirmation \nto be our next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have also come to support the \nnomination of Elena Kagan. She has an impressive background. I was very \npleased with her nomination by the President for a lifetime term on the \nSupreme Court.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with her in my office, and I found her \nengaging and interesting, with a lively sense of humor. I found her to \nbe a very interesting person. I had the opportunity to interview and \ntalk with a number of folks who have been nominated to the Supreme \nCourt. She stands out to me.\n  She has a very impressive background: bachelor's degree in history \nfrom Princeton; master of philosophy from Oxford; a law degree from \nHarvard. She has done a lot of things--associate White House counsel \nfor President Clinton. She was a professor at Harvard Law School and \nthen dean of the Harvard Law School. She was confirmed by the Senate as \nSolicitor General on March 19 of last year. I voted for that \nconfirmation. I think she will make an excellent Justice of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I want to say that some of the criticism of Elena Kagan has been that \nshe does not have judicial experience. In other words, she has not been \na judge. That is true, in fact. Forty of the 111 Supreme Court \nJustices, including Justices John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, Felix \nFrankfurter, and the previous Supreme Court Chief Justice William \nRehnquist, had no judicial experience either. In many ways, that was \nconsidered a significant asset.\n  My colleagues who now criticize Elena Kagan for not having judicial \nexperience extolled the virtue of that very thing when the Senate was \nconsidering the nomination of William Rehnquist who similarly had no \njudicial experience.\n  I find it a significant asset for Elena Kagan. She brings different \nkinds of experiences to the Federal bench, and I think she will make an \nexceptional Supreme Court Justice.\n  I might say, every Solicitor General, the position Elena Kagan now \noccupies, since 1985, including Kenneth Starr and Ted Olson, have said \nthat Kagan ``would bring to the Supreme Court a breadth of experience \nand a history of great accomplishment in the law . . . We support the \nnomination of Elena Kagan . . . and believe that, if confirmed, she \nwill serve on the Court with distinction.'' That is from every former \nSolicitor General going back to the mid-1980s. That is, in my judgment, \nsome support.\n  The determination of who sits on the Supreme Court in this Nation is \none of the most important decisions the Senate makes. It is a judgment \nby the President, first of all, to send a nomination to the Senate, and \nthen the advise-and-consent responsibility of the Senate is to make a \njudgment about that nomination.\n  The decisions the Court makes have a profound impact on the lives of \nthe American people, have an impact on the questions of what kind of \nfreedoms exist in this country. We have at this moment one of the most \nconservative courts we have had in a long time in this country, perhaps \nin this country's history the most conservative court.\n  A recent study by Richard Posner, who sits on the Seventh Court of \nAppeals, and William Landes, University of Chicago law professors, \nranked all 43 Supreme Court Justices who have served since 1937 on \ntheir ideology and their decisions. Their conclusion was that four of \nthe five most conservative Justices since Franklin Roosevelt sit on \nthis Supreme Court right now.\n  I do not think we ought to be thinking of this in terms of \nconservative versus liberal. I only use that category because so many \nof my colleagues said it is very important to have a conservative \nJustice. What I want on the Supreme Court is a Justice who will use \ncommon sense in interpreting the Constitution and do so without an \nunderstanding that they are on one team or another.\n  Frankly, it is disappointing not just to me but most Americans to see \nthat the Supreme Court has become a court of nine Justices who break \ninto teams: Our side, your side; five on one side, four on the other. \nThat is not what we would expect of the Supreme Court.\n  My hope would be that the Supreme Court would take a look at issues \nnot as conservatives or liberals, but as Supreme Court Justices who \nhave studied the law and who would make a commonsense judgment about \nwhat the Constitution of this country means.\n  So often I find that the Supreme Court stands logic on its head. The \nrecent decision in Citizens United is an unbelievable decision to me: \nthat corporations should be treated as individuals for the purpose of \ncampaign financing without any precedent or plain text basis. They \noverturned a statute by Congress because they said corporations are \npeople.\n  Oh, really? Most of us understand corporations are artificial people \ncreated by the State for the purpose of allowing an entity to be \ncreated, to sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with. But no \none ever suggested corporations represent a real person. If so, I \nassume one of these days we will have corporations running for office, \nperhaps a corporate candidate for the Senate. We can have General \nMotors running against IBM. Get your money together because it is going \nto be expensive. Which desk in the Senate chamber will belong to which \ncorporation?\n  If corporations are, in fact, real people, as the Supreme Court has \nruled, then it will not be long before we have that kind of political \nrace in our country. It is an absurd decision.\n  The 5-to-4 decision in the Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear is another \nshocking example of standing common sense and a commonsense reading of \nthe Constitution on its head. Lilly Ledbetter worked 19 years at \nGoodyear and had consistently gotten sterling, very high performance \nevaluations by her supervisors. Once she learned she had been paid much \nless than other workers who happened to be male--she learned this after \n19 years, by the way. For 19 years, she worked hard, got paid, and then \ndiscovered all of those years she had been paid much less than the \nmale counterparts doing exactly the same job.\n\n  She finally sued, and the Federal courts said: You are right; \nGoodyear, you have to make back payments. The appeals court then \noverturned it, and the Supreme Court ruled that this woman had to have \ntaken action within 180 days of the discrimination beginning.\n  The fact is, she could not have done that in the first 180 days. She \ndid not have the foggiest idea they were mistreating her, saying: If \nyou are a man, you get this salary, and if you are a woman, you get \nthis salary for doing the same thing, working side by side. She did not \ndiscover they were mistreating her for 19 years.\n  The Supreme Court did not care about that. They just said that if she \ndid not pick it up in 180 days, sorry, out of luck, tough luck. It \nstands logic on its head once again.\n  The fact is, the Supreme Court has a profound impact in terms of the \nway they interpret the Constitution of the\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nUnited States. What I have seen recently and certainly in the case of \nCitizens United--and I believe it is the case in Ledbetter v. \nGoodyear--the Supreme Court too often these days divides into teams. By \nthe way, the team that seems to be winning is the team on the side of \nthe powerful, the team on the side of the big interests, the team on \nthe side of the corporate interests. That ought not be the way the \nSupreme Court operates.\n  I came to support the Kagan nomination because I think she is someone \nwith a facile, interesting mind who is going to bring a new spark to \nthe debate among Justices about what this Constitution means. I do not \nknow if she is a liberal or a conservative. I don't care very much. \nWhat I care is that we put some people on the Supreme Court we believe \nhave the capability to make good decisions--decisions that will make \nlife in this country better, that will reflect accurately the \ninterpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I hope very much when the dust settles and the vote is taken that we \nwill have a very strong vote in support of Elena Kagan to become the \nnext Supreme Court Justice. I think her background, her skill, her \ncapability will make her an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. I will \nbe proud to vote for her nomination when we have that vote this week.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, Solicitor General Elena Kagan has been \nnominated to fill the upcoming Supreme court vacancy left by the \nretirement of Justice John Paul Stevens.\n  I know of few, if any, responsibilities of the Senate that are more \nimportant than the confirmation process providing, in the terms of the \nConstitution, ``Advice and Consent'' to the nomination of an individual \nto serve for life on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  There are two constitutional responsibilities that are invoked every \ntime a nominee is chosen. One is by the President of the United States. \nIt is his prerogative to choose whomsoever he wishes. But that is not \nthe end of it. The second constitutional duty that is invoked anytime a \nvacancy occurs and a nomination is made is that of the Senate to \nprovide, again in the terms of the Constitution, ``Advice and Consent'' \non the nomination. That is what we are engaged in doing now--in \ndeciding whether that advice and consent should be, yes, she shall \nserve, she shall be confirmed or, no, she should not be confirmed.\n\n  We know judges are different. In the words of the high school civics \nclass, we are called the three branches of government, and all three \nserve different functions. But the role of the judge is entirely \ndifferent from the role of a Senator or the role of the President \nbecause they are nominated and appointed to serve for life and \nprotected from having to run for office and seek election. They are \ngiven a limited but very important role in our government; that is, to \nrender impartial justice, to make decisions based on the law, not based \non perhaps their own political or ideological preference or a political \nagenda.\n  I think it is very important that this process be fair and dignified, \nand I commend not just the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, but the ranking member, Senator Sessions of Alabama, who is in \nthe Chamber, for making sure this nominee got the kind of confirmation \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee that, frankly, she deserves and that \nevery nominee deserves whether or not they are confirmed. But at the \nsame time, we need to make sure in addition to a dignified and fair \nprocess that it is thorough and it is careful and it is comprehensive.\n  It is vital, in my view, to recall the core principles that should \nguide the Senate in carrying out its constitutional duty because I \nthink today there is more of a sense than there has been at any other \ntime in my adult life that the Federal Government simply does not \nrecognize any constraints imposed upon its authority under the \nConstitution. Frankly, I think there is a widespread feeling across the \ncountry that the Federal Government--the National Government--believes \nit is, in effect, the only government in our country anymore and that \nthe States and local governments are just the servants of the National \nGovernment.\n  But that isn't, of course, how our Framers of the Constitution \nconceived of this unique form of government known as federalism, where \nthe Federal Government, under our Constitution, is a government of \ndelegated--or sometimes it is called enumerated--powers, and all \nrights--or all power--not given to the Federal Government are reserved, \nunder the terms of the tenth amendment of the Constitution, to the \npeople and to the States.\n  I am afraid that Washington, DC, and particularly this Congress at \nthis particular time, seem to have that turned around. Unfortunately, I \nworry that a Supreme Court Justice who does not recognize the limited \nnature of the authority given to the Federal Government, and who isn't \nwilling to enforce it, is not qualified to serve on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  As the Federalist Papers remind us in Federalist 78:\n\n       The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they \n     should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the \n     consequence would equally be the substitution of their \n     pleasure to that of the legislative body.\n\n  That is a little archaic--that kind of language, of course, going \nback a couple of centuries--but, basically, it means the people who are \nresponsible for making policy are those who are elected and who have to \nstand before the people and ask for their vote; namely, the Members of \nCongress or the Chief Executive, the President, and not judges who are \ncompletely insulated from any political accountability for their \ndecisions.\n  The only reason the Constitution gives that sort of lifetime tenure \nand protection from the voters is because under the Constitution judges \nare not supposed to be making policy but merely enforcing the law that \nis made by the Congress and the President. It is very important that \nthe power to make new laws belongs to the people--we the people--and \nnot to unelected judges.\n  When the Supreme Court presumes to create new rights, the Justices \ntake away the power of the people to govern themselves through their \nelected representatives. It is completely turning democracy on its \nhead--this idea of saying judges ought to be making policy even though \nunelected and serving with lifetime tenure and substituting their view \nfor the views of the people and their elected representatives. That is \nnot the way our democracy is supposed to work.\n  Some have disagreed over the years and embraced this concept of \njudicial activism. According to those who subscribe to this view, the \nConstitution is somehow not a written document that we can read and \nunderstand what is in it, but it has become a ``living document,'' \nwhich has changed over time, even though the words on the paper remain \nthe same. Unfortunately, this notion of a living document often is an \nexcuse for judges to reach a desired outcome or a result in a lawsuit. \nThis activist view takes the power to make and change the law away from \nwe the people and gives that power to unelected judges who are \ninsulated from any kind of accountability for their decisions, and it \nlets the Supreme Court decide what rights we have and what rights we \ndon't have, which is the opposite of what the Framers thought they were \ndoing when they wrote our constitution and when the States ratified it.\n  The question raised by every Supreme Court nomination is whether the \nnominee believes in this activist vision for judges or whether, in \ncontrast, they believe in a traditional role for judges. The question \nis, Will the nominee enforce a written constitution and laws passed by \nCongress or will they presume to be able to invent new rights according \nto their subjective view of the law? Will the nominee enforce a written \nconstitution or will he or she see that it is their job to change the \nConstitution to match their policy preferences when they do not like \nthe outcome?\n  To be confirmed, I believe a nominee must establish that he or she \nshould embrace the role of a traditional vision of a judge. I believe \nthat is absolutely critical because someone who presumes to say: After \nI get confirmed, I am going to call cases the way I see them; and if I \ndon't like the way the Constitution calls for those cases to be \ndecided, or the way Congress has written\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nthe law, I am going to substitute my opinion for that and I am going to \ntwist the law to reach a particular result--in my view, a judge who \npresumes to be a lawmaker by twisting the law to accomplish a \nparticular result, in effect, becomes a lawbreaker. A judge who \npresumes to be a lawmaker, I believe, is a lawbreaker.\n  Elena Kagan, our nominee, is obviously enormously bright. She has \nexcellent academic credentials and has had an accomplished career. Her \ntestimony before the committee, however, did not persuade me that she \nagrees with this traditional role for a judge. In fact, her testimony \nabout judicial philosophy is open to multiple interpretations and was \nintentionally vague. In her own responses following the hearing, for \nexample, Solicitor General Kagan indicated that she would decide cases \nbased on not the written Constitution, not the laws passed by Congress, \nbut based on her ``constitutional values.'' But she acknowledged that \nher constitutional values can point in different directions at \ndifferent times and claimed that she would exercise prudence and \njudgment in resolving the tension between them.\n  Well, that all sounds pretty fine and well, but what that means is \nshe would not agree that her decisions should be confined to the \nwritten Constitution that has been ratified by we the people and the \nlaws passed by the elected representatives of the American people, for \nwhich we are electorally accountable every election. She presumes, it \nseems to me, by her vague and subjective language, to suggest that her \nconstitutional values--which point in different directions depending on \nthe case--and the fact that she says she would exercise prudence and \njudgment in resolving tensions is somehow a substitute for taking an \noath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. That is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  In voting on a Supreme Court nominee, I think we need more certainty \nthan the simple assurance that a nominee would exercise their judgment. \nOf course, we expect for the nominee to exercise judgment, but that is \nnot sufficient. We need a Justice who will follow the law, someone who \nwill follow and enforce the Constitution of the United States. You know \nwhat. If we don't like the Constitution as written, and we think it \nneeds to be amended, well, under article V of the Constitution there is \na process to do that. And you know what. If we don't like the law \nCongress makes, well, Congress, of course, is free to change it. But if \nwe the people still don't like the way Congress writes the law, and \nthey refuse to respond to the will of the people, we have a right to \nreplace Members of Congress. That is the way a democracy is run, not by \na judge dictating to us what he or she thinks is good for us.\n\n  In voting on a nominee, I think we need more assurance from the \nnominee than she will simply exercise her judgment and she will \nexercise prudence in resolving tensions in the constitutional values.\n  Solicitor General Kagan also testified the Constitution is written in \ngeneral terms that enable the courts to change the law in response to \n``new conditions and new circumstances''--changes that she testified \noccur ``all the time.''\n  She says that because the Constitution is written in general terms, \nthe courts are empowered to change the law in response to new \nconditions and new circumstances--changes that she testified ``occur \nall the time.''\n  Well, I have an alternative suggestion. Rather than ceding to an \nunelected Supreme Court or a Federal judiciary, why isn't it that we \nthe people have the right to petition Congress to change the law? That \nis the way democracies are supposed to work. It is the job of a judge \nto enforce that law, and if we don't like the way the Constitution is \nwritten, well, we have passed 27 amendments during the course of our \nhistory amending the Constitution. But that reserves the right to we \nthe people and does not cede that authority to any unelected, lifetime-\ntenured judge.\n  I was also troubled by a couple of other specific areas and her \ninterpretation of the law--one that has to do with the power of the \nFederal Government. I mentioned that a moment ago. Under the commerce \nclause of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has previously basically \ngiven the Federal Government almost limitless powers.\n  We have seen that at play in the debate over the individual mandate \nin the health insurance bill that was recently passed, with an \nunprecedented reach of Federal power into your living rooms, where we \nare sitting on our couches, and which says: You know what. The Federal \nGovernment demands that you purchase a government-approved health \ninsurance policy. If you don't, we are going to penalize you.\n  That power is unprecedented. That is why it is being litigated now.\n  But Solicitor General Kagan did not seem to recognize that the \nFederal Government's powers are one of enumerated powers, delegated by \nthe States and by the people, and all rights not delegated were \nreserved to the people and to the States.\n  I was also troubled by her testimony with regard to the second \namendment--the right to keep and bear arms. She did say the recent \ndecisions in Heller and McDonald are ``settled law,'' but I worry that \nher interpretation of settled law means until there are five new \nJustices who take a look at that settled law and just decide to change \nit.\n  Unfortunately, we saw the same sleight of hand with Justice \nSotomayor's testimony regarding the second amendment. Last year, she \ntestified that Heller was settled law. But last month, she joined in a \ndissenting opinion in McDonald urging it be overturned, saying she did \nnot believe the second amendment conferred a fundamental individual \nright to keep and bear arms. I think the second amendment, and all of \nthe amendments of the Constitution, in the entire Constitution, are too \nimportant to leave to such an empty promise.\n  Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from Utah here to \nspeak. Let me just say that the last thing I wanted to address--and I \nwill plan on coming back, assuming we have enough time to talk about \nit--is, frankly, the stigma that Ms. Kagan and the folks at Harvard \nimposed on our men and women of the military by banning them from the \nCareer Services Office at Harvard Law School and, in effect, \nstigmatizing them and causing people to disrespect them, even though \nthey were merely applying the law that Congress passed and over which \nthey had no control.\n  I am very troubled by that, and I will come back to talk about that \nmore as time permits. But for these reasons I have given, and others I \nwill expand upon later, I oppose the nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas. There is hardly anybody in this body who can equal the \nexpertise and experience he has, not only as an attorney general in his \nState but also as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court. With that \nexperience, he is someone we should all listen to. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator for his comments.\n  I rise today to discuss the appointment of Elena Kagan to be \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate's role of \nadvice and consent is a check on the President's power to appoint--not \na substitute for it. At the same time, the Senate's role must be more \nthan an empty formality or a mere rubberstamp.\n  I have examined Ms. Kagan's record, I participated in her entire \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee, and I have listened to \nsupporters and opponents both in Utah and across the country.\n  I can say this: I lectured at Harvard when she was dean at Harvard. I \nappreciated the way I was treated while I was there. It was clear she \nprobably did not agree with some of the things I was saying, but she \nwas courteous and decent. I like her personally. But if I apply the \nstandard I have consistently used for judicial nominees, that standard \nleads me to conclude that I just cannot support her appointment.\n  Qualifications for judicial service include both legal experience, \nwhich summarizes the past, and judicial philosophy, which describes the \nfuture. Two categories of legal experience stand out among the 111 men \nand women who have served on the U.S. Supreme Court. Two-thirds of \nthem, including every current Justice and the\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\nJustice Ms. Kagan has been nominated to replace, had previously been a \njudge. The 39 previous Justices who lacked judicial experience had an \naverage of 21 years of legal practice. In other words, Supreme Court \nJustices have had experience behind the bench as a judge, before the \nbench as a lawyer, or both.\n  Ms. Kagan has neither. She was a junior associate in a large law firm \nfor only 2 years. She has never tried a case, never argued before any \nappellate court before becoming Solicitor General just last year. I am \nsure the reason they made her Solicitor General was to give her some \nexperience so they could do what they have now done and nominate her to \nthe Supreme Court. Although Harvard law students must contribute at \nleast 40 hours of law-related pro bono service as a condition of \ngraduation, Harvard's former Dean Kagan appears to have done none at \nall.\n  Ms. Kagan's experience is, instead, academic and political. One of my \nDemocratic colleagues said here on the floor that Ms. Kagan's best \nqualifications for the Supreme Court are her experience making policy \nand her ability to build consensus. I, for one, believe that the line \nbetween the political and the judicial is already too blurred. While \nthe political or policy mindset focuses on achieving desirable results, \njudges must focus on following the right process.\n  Without any real experience or grounding in the actual practice of \nlaw, Ms. Kagan's experience makes me more, not less, skeptical of her \nsuitability for the Supreme Court. It puts even more emphasis on her \njudicial philosophy, which is the second and more important \nqualification for judicial service.\n  As I said at the confirmation hearing for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \nin 1993, there must be clear and convincing evidence that a nominee \nunderstands the proper role of the judiciary in our system of \ngovernment. What is the proper role of judges in our system of \ngovernment? One of my predecessors as Senator from Utah, George \nSutherland, served on the Supreme Court for 16 years. He distinguished \nbetween interpreting the Constitution and amending it in the guise of \ninterpretation. Confusing the two, he wrote, converts ``what was \nintended as inescapable and enduring mandates into mere moral \nreflections.'' These are fundamentally different judicial philosophies \nthat identify inherently different relationships between the judge and \nthe law.\n  The central confirmation question before us today is what kind of a \nJustice Ms. Kagan would be. The answer begins with the President who \nnominated Ms. Kagan. When he was a Senator, President Obama said judges \ndecide cases based on their deepest values, their core concerns, and \nwhat is in their heart. As a Presidential candidate, he said he would \nappoint judges who have empathy for certain groups. As President, he \nhas nominated judges who believe they may find the Constitution's \nmeaning in such things as social practices, evolving norms, practical \nconsequences, and even foreign law. President Obama has clearly taken \nsides in the judicial philosophy debate.\n  Ms. Kagan has identified a general and a specific source of evidence \nfor us to examine. She told the Judiciary Committee generally that \n``you can look to my whole life for indications of what kind of judge \nor justice I would be.'' And she told one of my Judiciary Committee \ncolleagues specifically that we can learn a lot about her ``by seeing \nhow I did when I worked at the White House.''\n  In graduate school, Ms. Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court may \noverturn previous decisions because, as she put it, ``new times and \ncircumstances demand a different interpretation of the Constitution.'' \nShe wrote that judges may ``mold and steer the law in order to promote \ncertain ethical values and achieve certain social ends.'' Ms. Kagan was \ndescribing a judicial philosophy guided by moral reflections rather \nthan by enduring mandates.\n  When asked about this thesis at her hearing, Ms. Kagan said, ``Let us \njust throw that piece of work in the trash, why don't we?'' I cannot do \nthat. While every piece of a nominee's record must be viewed in its \nproper context, I cannot simply ignore whatever may raise questions or \ndoubts about Ms. Kagan's judicial philosophy. It was Ms. Kagan, after \nall, who told us to examine her whole life for evidence of the kind of \nJustice she would be. This obviously includes writings such as her \nOxford graduate thesis.\n  Writing as a law professor several years later, Ms. Kagan agreed that \nin most cases that come before the Supreme Court, the Justice's own \nexperience and values are the most important elements in the decision. \nIf that is too results-oriented, Ms. Kagan wrote, so be it. Well, to be \ncandid about it, it is indeed too results-oriented and echoes the same \nactivist approach Ms Kagan embraced in her graduate thesis.\n  While Ms. Kagan has not herself been a judge, she has singled out for \nparticular praise judges who share this activist judicial philosophy. \nIn a tribute she wrote for her mentor, Justice Thurgood Marshall, for \nexample, she described his belief that the Supreme Court today has a \nmission to ``safeguard the interests of people who had no other \nchampion.'' Ms. Kagan did more than simply describe Justice Marshall's \njudicial philosophy but wrote: ``And however much some recent Justices \nhave sniped at that vision, it remains a thing of glory.''\n  Justice Marshall was a pioneering leader in the civil rights \nmovement. He blazed trails, he empowered generations, he led crusades. \nBut he was also an activist Supreme Court Justice. He proudly took the \nactivist side in the judicial philosophy debate. Some on the other side \nhave suggested that honestly identifying Justice Marshall's judicial \nphilosophy for what it is somehow disparages Justice Marshall himself. \nI assume that this ridiculous and offensive notion is their way of \nchanging the subject because they cannot defend an activist, \npoliticized role for judges.\n  In 2006, when she was dean of the Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan \npraised as her judicial hero Aharon Barak, who served for many years on \nthe Supreme Court of Israel. Aharon Barak has been described by U.S. \ncircuit judge Richard Posner, one of the leading lights on the \njudiciary in this country, as an aggressively interventionist judge who \nhas ``created a degree of judicial power undreamt of by our most \naggressive Supreme Court Justices'' and for whom ``the judiciary is a \nlaw unto itself.'' Ms. Kagan did not simply describe Justice Barak's \njudicial philosophy or praise him as a person; she called him ``the \njudge or justice in my lifetime whom I think best represents and has \nbest advanced the values of democracy and human rights, of the rule of \nlaw, and of justice.''\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle try to spin away Ms. \nKagan's praise of Justice Barak by noting that Justice Antonin Scalia \nonce warmly introduced him. But while Justice Scalia said he had \n``respect for the man,'' he made clear that he and Justice Barak had \n``fundamental philosophical, legal and constitutional disagreements.'' \nMs. Kagan, in contrast, said that Justice Barak was her judicial hero \nand represented the rule of law better than any other judge. It appears \nthat the very first time she distanced herself from his judicial \nphilosophy was at her confirmation hearing.\n  When she was dean, Ms. Kagan had opportunities to choose between her \npersonal views and the law. Federal law, known as the Solomon \nAmendment, requires that military recruiters have equal access to \nstudents as other employers. Harvard protested the don't ask, don't \ntell law regarding military service by homosexuals by allowing military \nrecruiters access not through its Office of Career Services but through \nthe Harvard Law School Veterans Association, a private group with no \noffice, no staff, and no budget. The Defense Department told Harvard in \n2002 that this policy did not comply with the Solomon Amendment.\n  Ms. Kagan, who had very publicly denounced the military service law, \njoined a lawsuit challenging the Solomon Amendment. Within 24 hours of \nthe decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit \nenjoining it, she again banned military recruiters from the career \noffice even though the ruling did not apply to Harvard, which is in the \nFirst Circuit. In other words, she reinstated a policy that she knew \nviolated Federal law and even kept that policy in place when the Third \nCircuit stayed its own injunction. Ms. Kagan could have opposed the law \nin various ways but chose to do so in a\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\nway that undermined the military and defied Federal law. Her personal \nviews drove her legal views.\n  Ms. Kagan also told us to examine her service in the Clinton \nadministration, a period during which she has said she acted as a \npolicy adviser rather than as a lawyer. She was, for example, a key \nplayer behind the Clinton administration's extreme abortion policy, \nincluding its defense of the barbaric practice of partial-birth \nabortion. In a 1996 legislative strategy memo, she labeled as a \ndisaster a proposed statement by a key medical group that there exists \nno circumstances in which partial-birth abortion is the only option for \ndoctors to take. That was the organization representing the \nobstetricians and gynecologists. She drafted and persuaded that group \nto adopt language with a much different political spin. At her hearing, \nMs. Kagan offered the implausible claim that she was merely trying to \nensure that the medical group accurately expressed its own medical \nopinion. In other words, the disaster she identified was a PR disaster \nfor the medical group, not a political disaster for the Clinton \nadministration. That is too hard to believe, especially in light of \nevidence that Ms. Kagan also sought to persuade the American Medical \nAssociation to change its similar conclusion that partial-birth \nabortion is not medically necessary. Political objectives appear to \nhave trumped medical science.\n  Let's understand what partial-birth abortion is, this barbaric \npractice. It is where they turn the child around, even a child capable \nof living on its own outside the womb, until its head is coming first. \nThen they ram scissors or some other sharp instrument into the back of \nthe skull, suck out the brains, then pull the baby out and say it is \nnot a human being. I don't know anybody who should not consider that \ntremendously offensive and barbaric.\n  In May 1997, after President Clinton had vetoed the Partial Birth \nAbortion Ban Act, Ms. Kagan wrote a memo recommending that he support a \nsham ban offered by Democratic Senators. Everybody here knew it was a \nsham. She argued that this step might attract votes from Senators who \notherwise would vote to override President Clinton's veto. Since the \nsubstitutes would not pass--she knew they would not--partial-birth \nabortion would remain legal. Whether you are for or against abortion, \nmost people find that practice barbaric.\n  Significantly, however, Ms. Kagan noted that the Office of Legal \nCounsel had concluded that these substitute bans were unconstitutional \nunder the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. There is no indication \nthat she disagreed with this conclusion. The point is that Ms. Kagan \nurged a purely political position on abortion that was at odds with \nwhat the Clinton administration then believed the Constitution \nrequired. That is something that really bothered me and I do not think \nshe was forthcoming about it at the hearing. It especially bothered me \nbecause it looked once again like politics trumped the law.\n  Ms. Kagan's hearing did nothing to temper the activist picture that \nemerges from her record. She chose an approach to answering questions \nthat was far different from what she once argued was necessary for the \nSenate properly to evaluate nominees and educate the public. I asked \nthree times, for example, if she had written the 1996 memo I discussed \na minute ago. Mind you, the memo has her name on it and includes a page \nof her own handwritten notes. After three tries, Ms. Kagan would say \nonly that it was in her handwriting which I suppose leaves open the \npossibility that it was forged. It was certainly her prerogative not to \ngive Senators anything meaningful during her hearing, but it leaves the \nrest of her record as the basis for determining what kind of Justice \nshe would be.\n  Other Senators will discuss in more depth additional troubling issues \nraised by her record. These certainly include positions she has taken \nand arguments she has made that signal a sweeping, unprecedented view \nof Federal Government power. At the hearing, for example, I questioned \nher about the troubling position she took before the Supreme Court in \nthe Citizens United v. FEC case. She argued that the first amendment \nallows the Federal Government to determine who may say what, when, and \nin what manner about political candidates. She argued that the \ngovernment may ban certain print or electronic books, movies, and \npamphlets that mention candidates close to an election. Political \nspeech is the speech perhaps most protected by the Constitution. Yet \nshe argued that the government may silence unions, for-profit \ncorporations, nonprofit groups and even tiny mom-and-pop businesses, if \nthey organize legally as a corporation. Thankfully the Supreme Court \nsided with freedom of speech.\n  As if that breathtaking degree of Federal power were not bad enough, \nMs. Kagan also worked in the Clinton administration to weaken and limit \nother individual rights such as the second amendment right to keep and \nbear arms. In her hearing, Ms. Kagan refused to acknowledge any real \nlimits on the Federal Government's power, which the Supreme Court has \nalready expanded far beyond anything America's Founders intended, to \nregulate everything imaginable in the name of interstate commerce.\n  I will summarize. Ms. Kagan's academic and primarily political \nexperience make critical the need for clear and convincing evidence \nthat she is committed to the proper role of judges in our system of \ngovernment. The critical confirmation question is the kind of Justice \nMs. Kagan would be. Will the Constitution control her, or does she \nbelieve she may control the Constitution? Looking where she directed me \nto look, I believe the evidence shows she embraces an essentially \nactivist view of judicial power.\n  This is a grave decision and it is about more than simply one person. \nThe liberty we enjoy in America requires that the people govern \nthemselves and that, in turn, depends upon the kind of Justices who sit \non the highest Court in the land.\n  George Washington said in his Farewell Address:\n\n       The basis of our political systems is the right of the \n     people to make and to alter their constitutions of \n     government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, \n     till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole \n     people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.\n\n  Judges who bend the Constitution to their own values, who use the \nConstitution to pursue their own vision for society, take this right \naway from the people and undermine liberty itself.\n  As my colleagues can see, I am very worried about this nomination. I \nnever voted against a Supreme Court nominee before when I voted against \nnow Justice Sonia Sotomayor but I think I have been proven right in a \nnumber of instances. Let me mention one. She basically said that the \nHeller case on the right to keep and bear arms was settled law. Yet \nwithin a year or so, she voted that the right to keep and bear arms is \nnot a fundamental right.\n  I hope that soon-to-be Justice Kagan proves me wrong. I hope that she \nwill use her legal mind and the abilities she has to uphold rather than \ntear down the Constitution. I hope she will do what the Founding \nFathers expected all Justices on the Court to do. But like Justice \nSotomayor, I think the evidence about her judicial philosophy shows \nthat I am right.\n\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I will not support General Kagan's nomination. I did not \ncome to this decision lightly. As I said last August during the debate \non Justice Sotomayor, the role of the Senate in the nomination of a \nSupreme Court Justice is to give its advice and consent on the \nPresident's nomination, with the Senate to judge whether an individual \nis qualified based on a number of factors. Among these factors are the \nnominee's education, legal experience, prior judicial experience, \nwritten record, judicial temperament, commitment to the rule of law, \nand overall contributions to the law. Based on my review of Elena \nKagan's record and using these factors, I have determined General Kagan \nat this time does not meet the criteria for membership on our Nation's \nhighest Court.\n  The President deserves deference in his nominations and, of course, \nPresidential elections have a direct impact on the makeup of our \njudiciary; that is to say, elections do have consequences.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nBut Senate confirmation should not be a simple mechanical affirmation \nof the President's selection, especially when the nominee will enjoy a \nlifetime appointment. A Senator is duty bound to conscientiously review \nthe qualifications of the President's nominee and make an independent \nassessment of the nominee's qualifications.\n  General Kagan is well educated, intelligent, bright, and engaging, \nand advanced quite rapidly in her career of teaching and law school \nadministration. But one must ask, is that enough? I believe it is not. \nI believe a judicial nominee must have substantial experience in the \nlaw, especially when the nominee is seeking a lifetime appointment to \nthe highest Court in the land.\n  After reviewing her background, I believe General Kagan does not have \nthat relevant experience. General Kagan is the first nominee to the \nSupreme Court with no prior judicial experience since 1971, almost 40 \nyears ago. While I do not believe a lack of judicial experience should \nbar one from serving on the Supreme Court, I note that reviewing prior \njudicial service is obviously the easiest way to assess a nominee's \nfitness for the Court. This lack of judicial experience does not \nprevent her nomination, but in my opinion it does shift the burden to \nthe nominee to demonstrate her relevant experience.\n\n  For example, when the Senate considered Justice Sotomayor's \nnomination, there were over 1,000 prior opinions one could review to \ndecide if she was ready for the job. With General Kagan, there are \nnone. When I asked her to name opinions she worked on with Justice \nMarshall with which she disagreed, she stated she could not remember \nany individual opinion she worked on, much less whether she disagreed \nwith Justice Marshall on any of them. She could not remember.\n  During our meeting, General Kagan noted her service as Solicitor \nGeneral, another job I did not think she was qualified to hold, and \nsaid it was relevant because she was the Solicitor General. I agree it \nis relevant, but her time as Solicitor General has been too short. \nSince President Kennedy's Solicitor General, Archibald Cox, only one \nconfirmed Solicitor General has served for a shorter period of time \nthan General Kagan.\n  General Kagan argued her first case before the Supreme Court less \nthan a year ago, and now we are going to confirm her as a member of \nthat Court?\n  If we base her qualifications on her earlier legal experience, her \nexperience is particularly limited. General Kagan worked for 2 years as \na practicing attorney. Justices Rehnquist and Powell, the last two \nSupreme Court nominees without prior judicial experience, each spent \nmany years in the active practice of law. Justice Rehnquist practiced \nin Arizona for over 16 years. Justice Powell was a partner in a major \nVirginia law firm for over 25 years and in practice for 38 years. \nGeneral Kagan has 2 years of experience in private practice and 1 as \nSolicitor General.\n  I also think it is worth noting that the independent Congressional \nResearch Service has found that, on average, the 39 Justices who lacked \nprior judicial experience had over 20 years of experience in the \npractice of law. General Kagan's experience pales in comparison.\n  During Justice Sotomayor's confirmation, I spoke about how President \nObama's standard for selecting judicial nominees based on what was in \ntheir heart flew in the face of meritocracy--flew in the face of \nmeritocracy. We, as a nation, aspire to hire people for jobs based on \ntheir skill, not on where they are from or who they know. Justice \nSotomayor, in addition to her 17 years of total service on the trial \nand appellate benches, was in private practice for 8 years and was a \ndistrict attorney for 4 years. Justice Sotomayor's experience as a \nlawyer and a judge, her judicial temperament, and the fact that her \nopinions were within the judicial mainstream gave me confidence that \nshe had the relevant experience to sit on the Supreme Court.\n  Because there is such a limited record with General Kagan and because \nshe has gone out of her way, quite frankly, not to answer questions, I \nhave no idea what she will do on the bench and whether she will be able \nto suppress her own values to apply the law. The fact is, we really do \nnot know much about her views.\n  Frankly, I have been surprised by some of my colleagues who attempt \nto compare her to the famous Justice Brandeis, another Justice with no \nprior judicial experience. Justice Brandeis practiced the law for \nalmost 30 years before his nomination, much of his practice being pro \nbono in his later years. Furthermore, Justice Brandeis is widely \nregarded as one of the great legal minds of not just his time but of \nAmerican history, having developed numerous areas of modern law from \nscratch. Yet, again, General Kagan pales in comparison.\n  In my meeting with General Kagan, I asked her about how little \nwriting she had published, and she responded that she had more academic \nwriting than other members of the Supreme Court. This is factually \nincorrect and misleading. First, this is incorrect. Justice Scalia is \nwidely published with numerous articles and books. Justice Ginsburg \nwent so far as to learn Swedish to coauthor a book on Swedish judicial \nprocedure. And Justice Breyer was one of the most foremost authorities \non administrative law, with many books and articles to his name before \njoining the Court. Second, it is misleading because each Justice \npublishes hundreds of pages a year in the form of opinions, greatly \neclipsing General Kagan's academic production.\n  There are over 800 Federal judges, many of whom clearly have the \nexperience, intelligence, and legal skill to serve on our Supreme \nCourt. Additionally, if one believes, which I do not, that the Federal \njudiciary is somehow out of touch with our society, thousands, if not \ntens of thousands, of State court judges are out there with lengthy \njudicial records, many ready to serve on the Supreme Court. I think \nback to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was on the supreme court of \nthe State of Arizona for 8 years before she became a member of the \nSupreme Court.\n  As an aside, only a former law professor would think that the dean of \na law school is somehow more in touch with everyday people than a \njudge. Every day, a judge is presented with the facts of everyday life \nand must apply them to the law. A dean at a law school, surrounded by \nprofessors earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and donors \nworth millions and students soon to enter into a professional career, \nnever gets to see everyday life and is never faced with the factory \nworker, the farmer, or any other hardworking blue-collar Americans. How \nis a law school dean more in touch--more in touch--with everyday \npeople?\n  Some of my colleagues would like to have had a less liberal person \nnominated by the President. My position is, the President will surely \nnominate a liberal. The most important question is, Is that liberal \nnominee qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court? I would argue \nthat General Kagan has been nominated based on her friendships and \npersonal attachments with President Obama and others at the White \nHouse, not based on objective qualities that would indicate she is \nqualified to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In closing, lack of judicial experience should not be an absolute bar \nto serving on the Supreme Court. However, Solicitor General Kagan not \nonly lacks judicial experience but has limited experience as a \npracticing attorney with only the last year as Solicitor General and 2 \nyears as a junior associate making up her entire practice.\n  Additionally, General Kagan has had an extremely limited written \nrecord--I mean limited written record--which should make all of us \nunsure as to what sort of Justice General Kagan will be.\n  For these reasons, I cannot in good conscience support the nomination \nof General Kagan to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a number of comments have been made \nabout Ms. Elena Kagan's actions at Harvard in barring the military from \nutilizing or having access to the Career Services Office and asking the \nveterans\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\ngroup--that was not able, as they said--to somehow fill that role.\n  I will take a few minutes, as we have a few minutes left, to deal \nwith one of the arguments I have heard my colleagues repeat; that, \nwell, she did not reduce recruiting, therefore, no harm, no foul. I do \nnot agree. There was a foul and there was a harm. But even if there had \nnot been a harm, there was a foul.\n  It was very wrong to blame the U.S. military for the don't ask, don't \ntell policy, and very, very, very wrong to blame some young officer who \nwas there to recruit people to serve in the JAG Corps of the U.S. \nmilitary, perhaps having just returned from combat duty in Iraq or \nAfghanistan, and to be told: You can't come in the front door of the \nbuilding. You can't use the recruiting services because we don't like \nyour policy.\n  But it was not the military's policy; it was the Congress's policy. \nIt was President Clinton's policy. He signed the bill. I do not believe \nthat Ms. Kagan complained to President Clinton when she was on his \nstaff for 5 years and he signed the bill. Was there any protest to him? \nNo. Her protest was lodged, and the discrimination was directed against \nthe men and women in uniform who defend our country, who had nothing to \ndo with the policy.\n  That is a fact, and I do not think it is a matter that should be \nlightly dismissed. ``Oh, the recruiting didn't go down,'' they say. \nWell, let's just talk about that. They said she merely reinstated \nHarvard Law's pre-2002 policy, which forced the military to work \nthrough this veterans association, and recruiting did not suffer. But \nthat is not true.\n  Harvard's pre-2002 policy--before she became dean--had obstructed \nmilitary recruiting. As an internal memorandum authored by the \nrecruiting chief of the Air Force JAG Corps in 2002 states--this is \nwhat the chief of recruiting for the Air Force JAG said:\n\n       Career Services Offices are the epicenter for all employer \n     hiring activities at a law school. . . . Without the support \n     of the Career Services Office, we are relegated to wandering \n     the halls in hopes that someone will stop and talk to us. . . \n     . [D]enying access to the Career Services Office is \n     tantamount to chaining and locking the front door of the law \n     school--as it has the same impact on our recruiting efforts.\n\n  The military's ``after action reports'' from pre-2002 recruiting \nefforts organized through the veterans association on campus show mixed \nresults, but recruiting clearly improved after her predecessor, Dean \nClark, granted the military equal access through the Career Services \nOffice. This is what the Air Force said:\n\n       Since Harvard's policy change, the Air Force has . . . had \n     very positive responses from a number of students. . . . [I]n \n     the 16 months since Harvard's change in policy, we have \n     attracted at least four Harvard students, when in the prior \n     twelve years, we recruited a total of only nine.\n\n  That is while the discrimination was in effect.\n\n       The statistics reveal that our recruiting efforts have \n     greatly improved since the change in policy by Harvard to \n     comply with the Solomon Amendment. We only assessed 2 Harvard \n     Law students in the 1990s.\n\n  This is not accurate, what we have been hearing. Then she reversed \nthat policy and went back to the policy of discrimination. The reports \nshow it obstructed their recruiting efforts. The chief of recruiting \nfor the Air Force JAG Corps was repeatedly blocked from participating \nin Harvard's spring 2005 recruiting season, after Ms. Kagan changed the \npolicy, saying this:\n\n       Harvard is playing games and won't give us an OCI [On-\n     Campus Interviewing] date; their official window for employer \n     registration has closed. Their recruiting manager told me \n     today that she's still ``waiting to hear'' whether they'll \n     allow us.\n\n  The chief of Air Force JAG recruiting also recounted a conversation \nwith Harvard's dean of career services after the close of the \nrecruiting season, when you are supposed to be recruiting--they missed \nthe whole season--this is what he says, talking about the dean.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 1-hour time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I don't see anyone here--I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The dean of career services told the Air Force JAG:\n\n       He stated that the faculty had still not decided whether to \n     allow us to participate in on-campus interviews. . . . I \n     asked him if I could at least post a job posting via their \n     office and he said no.\n\n  The Army was blunt in their afteraction report:\n\n       The Army was stonewalled at Harvard. Phone calls and e-\n     mails went unanswered and the standard response was--``We're \n     waiting to hear from our higher authority.''\n\n  That certainly would appear to be Dean Kagan, who had reversed the \npolicy, personally.\n  This is what the veterans group said when Dean Kagan reversed the \npolicy and said: We want you to help take care of the military. We are \nnot going to let them in our office. They are not worthy to be in our \noffice. This is what they wrote and sent an e-mail to all the students:\n\n       Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of \n     office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources \n     to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively \n     for outside organizations as is the norm for most recruiting \n     events. . . . [Our effort] falls short of duplicating the \n     excellent assistance provided by the HLS Office of Career \n     Services.\n\n  To claim that 2005 had increased recruiting is inaccurate. The 2005 \nclass at Harvard would have been recruited during the time the military \nenjoyed full access of the career services office before she reversed \nthe policy, not in the spring of 2005, a mere 3 months before \ngraduation. They were counting the graduates, not people who signed up. \nThe recruiting has not been shown to increase after this effort.\n  Finally, I would note: What was the purpose of all this? Why did they \nhave this policy? It was to harm and hamper the U.S. military in their \neffort to recruit on campus. Apparently, it was effective in reducing \ntheir ability. They had a direct intent to punish the military for a \npolicy the military did not establish but Congress and President \nClinton established and it was wrong then and it is wrong now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am so honored to come to the floor \nwith a number of women Senators to discuss the President's nomination \nof Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be the Associate Justice on the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  As is the Presiding Officer, I am a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and we both had the opportunity to question Elena Kagan and \nto listen to her brilliant and insightful responses. Everyone heard \nher, and no matter how anyone is voting on this nomination--although it \nis hard for me to understand how they could oppose her--I think there \nwas very much consensus on this idea that she knew what she was doing, \nthat she has done every job that she has had very well, that she has \nconfronted very difficult situations, and that she has always been a \nleader and someone who can bring consensus. She consistently \ndemonstrated the quality that some of us had already seen in her \nrecords; that is, of pragmatism and reasonableness and a consensus \nbuilder.\n  So I will save my remarks until later because I have been joined by \nthe Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, who is from Elena Kagan's \nhome State. While she may have worked in Massachusetts for quite a \nwhile, she actually came from New York. It is an honor to have Senator \nGillibrand, who is also an attorney, joining us today.\n  I yield for Senator Gillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota \nfor her leadership, for her guidance, for her distinguished career, and \nfor her service on the Judiciary Committee. It is so meaningful to all \nof us to have her ability to review these candidates in such depth.\n  I am so proud to stand in support of Solicitor General Kagan's \nnomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. With his decision, President \nObama has chosen an individual of the highest caliber, a women with an \nenormous history of achievement, a history of service and, perhaps most \nimportantly, a history of bridge building.\n  Elena Kagan is widely regarded as one of the Nation's leading legal \nscholars. She is a stalwart defender of the Constitution, and through \nher sharp intellect, steadfast integrity, sensible\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\njudgment, and extraordinary work ethic, Elena Kagan has made it clear \nshe is eminently qualified to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  Dean of Harvard Law School, magna cum laude from Harvard Law, editor \nof the Harvard Law Review, and summa cum laude from Princeton, these \nare just some of the many accolades she obtained during her vast and \ndistinguished career.\n  Throughout the course of this nomination process, it has been made \nabundantly clear that Solicitor General Elena Kagan has a profound and \nexceptional understanding of the Constitution and our system of law. \nUnfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues are determined to \ncriticize Elena Kagan regardless of these facts. They can no longer \nfind partisan or ideological fodder by which to create a straw man of \nopposition, so they are now questioning her intellect, her clarity of \nmind, and her temperament. It is deeply concerning to me that my \ncolleagues would dismiss the judgment of every Solicitor General of the \npast 25 years and dismiss the views of law professors from all across \nthe United States and even sitting Supreme Court Justices who have \nsuggested that Elena Kagan is eminently qualified to sit on the Court.\n  These distinguished legal experts from across the country and across \nthe ideological spectrum say Elena Kagan is not only an intellectual \ngiant, but she is as qualified to serve on the Nation's highest Court \nas any of her other predecessors. Every Solicitor General over the last \nquarter century--Democrats and Republicans--wrote a letter of support \nfor her nomination as Solicitor General, noting her brilliant \nintellect, her candor, and the ``high regard in which she is held by \npersons of a wide variety of political and social views.''\n  The support of Miguel Estrada, Ken Starr, and Ted Olson, along with \nthe support of some of my Republican colleagues such as Senator Lindsey \nGraham, all speak to her ability to build bridges and to find common \nground. These are the traits we need in a Justice when so many \ndecisions right now are narrowly being decided at the 5-to-4 margin.\n  An attorney with over two decades of experience working in all three \nbranches of the Federal Government, Kagan's breadth of experience will \nbring diversity to a Court consisting entirely of former judges. Many \nof the Justices on both sides of the aisle are quite fond of Elena \nKagan from her time as Solicitor General and have commented on how her \ndistinct professional background is a welcome contribution to the \nCourt.\n  Based on her record of achievement, it is clear Elena Kagan possesses \nthe temperament that will distinguish her as a consensus builder on a \ndeeply divided Court.\n  Narrow 5-to-4 decisions by a conservative majority have become the \nhallmark of the Roberts Court. These decisions have often been \noverreaching in scope and have repeatedly ignored settled law and \ncongressional intent. For example, in the Citizens United case, the \nCourt not only disregarded the extensive record compiled by Congress \nbut abandoned established precedent. Solicitor General Kagan's unique \nability to build coalitions will be very helpful in bridging this very \nserious divide.\n  Since the announcement of her nomination, I know more than a few of \nmy colleagues have struggled to find a viable reason to object to her \nnomination. The bottom line remains that there has yet to be a credible \nreason to oppose this outstanding confirmation.\n  I look forward to enthusiastically casting my vote in support of \nGeneral Kagan's nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States. I urge my colleagues to join me and support her \nnomination as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nthat enthusiastic endorsement. I like how she took on some of these \ncriticisms that have been lodged against Solicitor General Kagan. I \nalso understand that at least one of my colleagues who spoke out in \nopposition has stated that, in his words: ``I believe she does not have \nthe gifts and qualities of mind or temperament that one must have to be \na Justice.'' Well, anyone who sat through those hearings or watched \nthem on TV, as Senator Gillibrand has pointed out, would have to \ndisagree. Anyone would have seen an incredibly smart, intellectually \nengaged person who answered Senators' questions astutely and whose \nenergy never seemed to flag. Neither did her sense of humor, I will \nadd. She had immediate recall about every single case or constitutional \ndoctrine that she was asked about, and to say she doesn't have the gift \nor quality of mind is simply ridiculous.\n  This is a woman who is a trailblazer: the first woman dean of Harvard \nLaw School, first woman Solicitor General. To say she does not have the \ngifts or the qualities of mind to be a Justice is nothing short of \nridiculous.\n  I next will yield for someone who knows something about having a good \ntemperament and a good quality of mind, the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho is also a trailblazer in her own right: the first woman to serve as \nboth a Governor and a Senator, Mrs. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you very much, to my colleague, Senator \nKlobuchar, and a special thanks for bringing us together this afternoon \nto speak on this important nomination.\n  I am very pleased to once again be able to come to the floor and \nspeak in support of the confirmation of Elena Kagan to be the next \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I am happy to join Senators \nKlobuchar, Gillibrand, Mikulski, and Hagan to support this excellent \ncandidate for the High Court.\n  The members of the Senate Judiciary Committee did a thorough job in \nvetting Ms. Kagan, and I thank them all for their hard work. I think \nthe hearings they held on her nomination revealed three things; first, \nthat Elena Kagan is a person of good character; second, that she is \nsomeone who understands and respects the rule of law and the role of \ncourts in our democracy; third, that she is indeed qualified to be a \nSupreme Court Justice. I believe the President chose wisely when he \nnominated her.\n  Back in June, after the nomination, I spoke about Ms. Kagan's \nimpressive list of professional accomplishments, so I am not going to \nrepeat them this afternoon. It is clear Elena Kagan has thrived in a \nnumber of settings and that she will bring a diverse set of experiences \nand abilities to the Court. In her rise to the top of the legal \nprofession, Ms. Kagan gained practical experience that forced her to \nevaluate the impact of laws on people. She also has a track record of \nbuilding bridges across the ideological spectrum, something I saw \nfirsthand when I was the director of the Institute of Politics at the \nKennedy School at Harvard and she was dean of the Harvard Law School. \nShe had that reputation on campus as someone who could work with \neveryone. These are critical skills for a Justice, and I am glad we \nhave a Supreme Court nominee before us who has a variety of real-world \nexperiences and has not been isolated only within the judicial system.\n  Perhaps most impressively, in her latest role as Solicitor General, \nMs. Kagan has served as the representative of the American people \nbefore the Supreme Court. She has represented us forcefully in complex \ncases, including ones that dealt with major issues, such as our ability \nto conduct the war on terror and the amount of influence that big \nbusinesses should have in our elections. As is the case for every \nattorney who regularly appears in court, she won some and she lost \nsome.\n  But above all, Ms. Kagan has shown she is capable of analyzing the \nlaw at the level required by the Nation's highest Court. She has the \ntalent and the intellect to join the Court as a Justice. I think that \nis something on which most of us can agree. Unfortunately, the politics \nthat have come to surround judicial confirmations in modern times mean \nthat Ms. Kagan's qualifications to serve on the Court are just one \npiece of this debate. I wish this weren't the case.\n  These proceedings should force us to take a hard look at the role our \nFounders intended for the Senate in the confirmation process. When we \nprovide advice and consent on judicial nominations, Senators are not \nsupposed to be substituting their individual political judgments for \nthose of the President.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\nWe are collectively supposed to be checking that a nominee is \nqualified, that a nominee falls somewhere in the mainstream of legal \nphilosophy, and that a nominee respects the rule of law and understands \nthat judges are not meant to be politicians.\n  A few weeks ago, Senator Lindsey Graham, as my colleague from New \nYork, Senator Gillibrand, alluded to earlier, gave a powerful reminder \nof this when he spoke at the Judiciary Committee's final hearing on Ms. \nKagan. I appreciated especially his reference to Alexander Hamilton's \nwords in Federalist Paper No. 76: The Senate should have a ``special \nand strong reason for the denial of confirmation.'' We should remain \nfocused on that standard, keep politics to a minimum, and really strive \nto conduct an evenhanded review of nominees.\n  Prior to joining the Senate, I had the privilege of serving as \nGovernor of the State of New Hampshire. New Hampshire is one of those \nStates where judges are not elected but appointed by the Governor. Once \nappointed, they can serve until age 70. So having been in the position \nof appointing judges, I fully understand that making lifetime \nappointments to our courts is a very solemn responsibility.\n  Knowing that, I believe the President has made an excellent \nselection. In Elena Kagan, we have been presented with a nominee who is \na loyal American, an upstanding individual, and a supremely talented \nlawyer. Lawyers are, by definition, legal advocates for others. It is \nto be expected that, as a lawyer, Elena Kagan may have advocated \ncertain positions with which we may not agree. That, however, does not \ndisqualify her from being a judge. It almost goes without saying that \nher record presents no ``special and strong reason'' to vote against \nconfirmation. These facts have been recognized by conservatives both in \nthis body and outside of it who are willing to drop political rhetoric \nand speak candidly. This includes Senator Graham as well as my own \nsenior Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg. I hope more of my \ncolleagues from across the aisle will follow their lead.\n  I intend to proudly cast my vote in favor of Elena Kagan's \nconfirmation, and I am confident that, as a Justice, she will serve \nthis country with honor and distinction.\n  I yield back to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, \nmy neighbor in the Chamber. I thank her for her fine remarks.\n  I was listening when she talked about Senator Graham's comments. I \ntruly believe that was a moment of leadership, where basically he said \nhe had spent a lot of time in the last 2 years trying to elect a \ndifferent person for President, but President Obama won and he \nrespected his nominee and that his job was to look to see if that \nperson was qualified to be on the Supreme Court. Despite political \ndifferences--and he didn't agree with everything she said--he said his \njob was to see if she was qualified. He said at the hearing, which I \nwill never forget, that he was proud to be supporting her.\n  I imagine the Senator from New Hampshire has had similar experiences \nin her State with having to grapple with those kinds of things when \nappointing judges.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is correct. Like the Senator from Minnesota, I am \ncertainly pleased to see people who have been willing to come out and \ntake a leadership position and say: Even though we understand the \nnominee may not be one who is supported by all of the Members of our \nparty, we still believe she is qualified, and we will support her.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. One thing about Elena Kagan: When you look at her \nseries of jobs, you realize she has been in the arena as a manager, a \nteacher, an adviser, a consensus builder, and a lawyer. In every job, \nshe has worked very hard and has done very well.\n  Her work on the front lines tells me she has the practical experience \nin thinking about the impact of the law and policies on ordinary \npeople, and I think sometimes that is missing in some of these \ndecisions. There is a case I dwell on involving prosecutions and what \nkind of evidence can come before the court when you are dealing with \nsome of the DNA tests, and I disagree with the recent Court decision \nthat actually wasn't decided on ideological grounds but I believe was \ndecided in an impractical way. I believe Solicitor General Kagan will \nbring that kind of practicality to the Court. When you are involved in \nconsidering the nitty-gritty details of different policies, when you \nare actually in the game as a decisionmaker, as she has been, you have \nto figure out when to compromise and when to hold firm. You have to \nknow what the consequences of your recommendations will be.\n  As a law school dean, Elena Kagan was widely credited with bringing \ntogether a faculty that was rife with division. Whether she was helping \nrecruit talented professors from across the political spectrum or \nlater, when she was working with Senators from both parties on tobacco \nlegislation, she forged coalitions and found resolution between \nseemingly intractable parties.\n  It strikes me that it takes a pretty extraordinary person who, after \nworking in the Clinton administration, still gets a standing ovation \nfrom the conservative Federalist Society; who inspires a group of 600 \nlaw students, who can be a bit cynical, to show up for a rally wearing \n``I love Elena'' T-shirts; someone who earned the respect of the law \nprofessors she worked with, regardless of their ideology, a group that \nI would say, as I said in the hearing, can be somewhat fearless in the \nface of supervision.\n  In sum, she has had a lot of practical experience reaching out to \npeople who hold very different beliefs, and that is increasingly \nimportant on a very divided Supreme Court. I believe that is why, when \nyou look at the past, all the previous Solicitor Generals from the past \n25 years, under Democratic and Republican administrations, support \nElena Kagan's confirmation. This practical experience is also why she \nhas the support of the National District Attorneys Association, which I \nused to belong to in my previous job. They actually wrote about her, \nsaying that the National District Attorneys Association believes \nSolicitor General Kagan's diverse and impressive life experiences will \nbe a welcome addition to the Court in fashioning theory that will work \nin practice.\n  One of the things that I think show the practicality of her and how \nshe responded to our questions is when I asked her about the metaphor \nChief Justice Roberts made famous at his confirmation hearing. I asked \nwhat she thought about the idea that judges were like umpires who just \nneed to ``call balls and strikes'' and whether that was a useful \nmetaphor. She gave an interesting and insightful response. She said the \nmetaphor is useful in some respects but maybe not in others. It is \nuseful because judges have to be fair and neutral like umpires and \njudges have to be aware that they have a powerful but limited role--\nthat they can't legislate from the bench, they aren't elected \nofficials. But she also said the metaphor has its limits if it suggests \nthat judging is some kind of ``robotic enterprise,'' if it makes people \nthink judging is an easy, automatic kind of thing because issues are \nalways clear-cut. That isn't right, and it definitely isn't right at \nSupreme Court level.\n  Cases that come before the Supreme Court, I say, are by their very \nnature not clear-cut or they would not have ended up there. What is \nnecessary is good judgment. We have to look for nominees who are going \nto bring that kind of good judgment to the Court.\n  I see I have been joined by the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. \nHagan, which rhymes with the name of our nominee, Solicitor General \nKagan. We are pleased to be joined by Senator Hagan.\n  We have now had four women Senators here today in support of \nSolicitor General Kagan's nomination. We are also well aware that if \nshe is confirmed, we will have three women on the Supreme Court when \nthe Court goes into session in the fall--something that has never \nhappened in the history of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am here today to speak in support of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination to be an Associate Justice \nof the Supreme Court of the United States. Solicitor General Kagan's \nbackground\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\ndemonstrates that she is an extremely well-qualified nominee and has a \nbrilliant legal mind. She has the utmost respect for precedent and \nbelieves in fidelity to the law. I believe she will make our Nation \nproud as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  I have always said I do not believe there should be any one litmus \ntest for judicial nominees. We have to look at a nominee's record in \nits entirety. Solicitor General Kagan's record is nothing short of \nremarkable. With over 20 years of legal experience and government \nservice, she has distinguished herself throughout her career with the \nhighest integrity and sound judgment.\n  In the 220-year history of the Supreme Court, 111 Justices have \nserved on the bench. Yet only three have been women. It took almost two \ncenturies--close to 200 years--before the first woman, Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, was confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  Solicitor General Kagan's professional achievements are clear. Let me \nhighlight a few of her triumphs that hold historical significance as \nwell as personal significance for me and many women across America. She \nwas the first woman to serve as dean of Harvard Law School. She was the \nfirst woman to be appointed as U.S. Solicitor General. When confirmed, \nshe will become, as Senator Klobuchar just said, the fourth woman to \nserve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. For the first \ntime in history, the Supreme Court will have three women serving at the \nsame time. Women in America can take pride in Solicitor General Kagan's \nachievements, learn from them, and set their goals just as high.\n  Elena Kagan has a compelling personal story. She was born into a \nfamily of Russian-Jewish immigrants. Her mother was a public school \nteacher, and her father was a tenants' lawyer. She inherited a strong \nwork ethic and a focus on education. She graduated summa cum laude from \nPrinceton University and received a master's degree in philosophy from \nOxford University's Worcester College and a law degree from Harvard Law \nSchool, where she was supervising editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  She went on to clerk for Judge Abner Mikva on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia and then for Justice Thurgood \nMarshall on the Supreme Court. She also became active in her community, \ndemonstrating her strong desire to serve others.\n  In the years following her time as a clerk, Solicitor General Kagan \npracticed law and began her long career in academia as a professor of \nlaw and later as a dean. In addition, she worked under two Presidents--\nfirst under President Clinton as an Associate Counsel and as a Deputy \nAssistant for Domestic Policy and now under President Obama as \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  Her confirmation hearings were a testament to her overwhelming \nqualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. I believe members of the \nJudiciary Committee saw in Solicitor General Kagan the same qualities \nPresident Obama saw: fairness of mind, supreme intellect, and an \nunsurpassed devotion to the law and to our system of government.\n  Some opponents have sought to stir up controversy by quoting \nSolicitor General Kagan out of context, trying to suggest she will not \nbe impartial. However, she has made it clear that her background does \nnot influence her interpretation of the law.\n  If Senators are not persuaded by her statements to the Judiciary \nCommittee, then they should be by her remarkable, impartial, 24-year \nlegal career.\n  As Solicitor General Elena Kagan has said:\n\n       I think a judge should try, to the greatest extent \n     possible, to separate constitutional interpretation from his \n     or her own values and beliefs. In order to accomplish this \n     result, the judge should look to constitutional text, \n     history, structure, and precedent.\n\n  With respect to the military, let me say I am proud to represent the \nmost military-friendly State in the Nation, and I have the fullest \nconfidence in Solicitor General Kagan's respect and admiration for our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  She has said that she respects and, indeed, reveres the military. Her \nfather was a veteran. One of the great privileges of her time at \nHarvard Law School was dealing with the wonderful students there who \nhad served in the military and students who wanted to go into the \nmilitary. She always tried to make sure she conveyed her honor for the \nmilitary, and she always tried to make sure the military had excellent \naccess to their students.\n  Veterans at Harvard Law wrote:\n\n       Kagan has created an environment that is highly supportive \n     of students who have served in the military . . . and under \n     her leadership, Harvard Law School has gone out of its way to \n     highlight our military service.\n\n  Solicitor General Kagan's sensible attitude toward following the law \nand her ability to objectively evaluate all angles of the Constitution \nhas resulted in high ratings and endorsements by numerous \norganizations. The American Bar Association unanimously found Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan to be well qualified, which is the highest rating the ABA \ngives to judicial nominees.\n  Solicitor General Kagan has an impressive list of law organization \nendorsements and supporters, including the National Association of \nWomen Judges, the Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, \nthe National Minority Law Group, the Constitutional Accountability \nCenter, the Hispanic National Bar Association, the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, and the National Association for \nthe Advancement of Colored People.\n  Solicitor General Kagan has also been endorsed by a group of law \nschool deans, who stated:\n\n       Her knowledge of law and skills in legal analysis are first \n     rate. Her writings in constitutional and administrative law \n     are highly respected and widely cited. She is an incisive and \n     astute analyst of law; with a deep understanding of both \n     doctrine and policy . . . Elena Kagan has, over the course of \n     her career, consistently exhibited patience, a willingness to \n     listen, and an ability to lead, alongside enormous \n     intelligence.\n\n  Former Solicitors General recently wrote a letter, including North \nCarolinian Walter Dellinger. In it they said:\n\n       Elena Kagan would bring to the Supreme Court a breadth of \n     experience and a history of great accomplishment in the law . \n     . . The Constitution gives the President broad leeway in \n     fulfilling the enormously important responsibility of \n     determining who to nominate for a seat on the Supreme Court \n     of the United States. In that spirit, we support the \n     nomination of Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice and believe \n     that, if confirmed, she will serve on the Court with the \n     distinction.\n\n  I thank and congratulate the members of the Judiciary Committee for \nholding an extraordinarily civil and open Supreme Court nomination \nprocess. I commend President Obama for selecting an extremely well-\nqualified nominee who will serve this country with distinction. Based \non my conversations with the nominee, her statements at her \nconfirmation hearings, and my review of her record, I intend to support \nher confirmation when it is voted on, hopefully later this week. I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nfor her comments. I like how she pointed out how Solicitor General \nKagan has received support from so many people on both sides of the \naisle, and then also Solicitor General Kagan's support for the \nmilitary.\n  I remember one of the most touching points of the hearing--that long \nand laborious hearing--was when Elena Kagan spoke about reading a \nletter from a student who had been at her law school in which, after \nshe was nominated, he actually wrote a letter to the newspaper. He \nserved in Iraq, and he wrote a letter about how fair she was to him and \nher strong support for him as a soldier. She said it was the only \nmoment during the whole leadup to the hearing, with all those things \nthat happen, that she said she shed some tears. I will never forget \nthat moment in the hearing.\n  As we consider this nomination, I want to reflect on how far we have \ncome.\n  I see I have been joined by the dean of the women Senators, Senator \nMikulski from Maryland.\n  When Sandra Day O'Connor graduated from law school more than 50 years \nago, as the Senator from Maryland knows, the only offer she got back \nthen after she graduated high up in her class from Stanford Law School, \nthe only offer she got at a law firm was as a secretary. Justice \nGinsburg faced similar obstacles. When she entered\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nHarvard, she was only one of nine women in a class of more than 500. \nOne professor actually asked her to justify taking that place in that \nlaw school class from a man.\n  I know we learned during the hearing that Solicitor General Kagan is \nwell aware of the strides women have made. In a 2005 speech, quoting \nJustice Ginsburg, she described a student resolution at the University \nof Pennsylvania Law School. This resolution would have introduced a 25-\ncent per week penalty on all students without mustaches.\n  The women who came before Elena Kagan to be considered by the \nJudiciary Committee helped blaze that trail for Elena Kagan--people \nsuch as Justice Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Sonia Sotomayor. \nAlthough Elena Kagan's record stands on her own, she is also, to borrow \na line from Isaac Newton, ``standing on the shoulders of giants.''\n  All the women Senators I know--both Democratic and Republican--always \nfeel they are standing on the shoulders of giants, maybe somewhat short \ngiants, when they see the dean of the women Senators, Senator Mikulski \nfrom Maryland, who has entered the Senate Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher kind words but also her leadership in terms of a leadership roll on \nthe Judiciary Committee in the usual due diligent way she went about \nlooking at Ms. Kagan's record, becoming an advocate for her and now \nurging us on the floor to speak on her behalf.\n  Also on behalf of myself and the people of Maryland, we extend our \ncondolences to her on the passing of her mother. It is a tribute to \nSenator Klobuchar that she is here today doing her duty. But from what \nI have heard about her mother, that is exactly where she would want her \nto be and exactly with those of us who are speaking today.\n  I come today in strong support of Elena Kagan. I am of the generation \nwhen a woman on the Court was going to be viewed as a novelty. I \nremember very well when Ronald Reagan nominated Sandra Day O'Connor and \nthe world and the United States of America was abuzz: Wow, a woman is \ngoing to go on the Court. She went to the Court, and I think history, \nlegal scholars, and the American people think she did a great job.\n  Then came Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and now Kagan. We are at the point now \nwhere women are being taken seriously--they are being put forth for \nhigh positions in government--and are no longer viewed as a novelty. We \nnever wanted to be novelties. We want to do the job we are either \nelected to do or we are being recommended to do.\n  I can tell my colleagues that Elena Kagan brings that right stuff of \nthe women who are currently on the Court, and Sandra Day O'Connor. She \nwants to be known and respected for what she will bring to the Court.\n  For us women, the reason we are advocating for her is not about \ngender but about the legal agenda before this Supreme Court. We want to \nhave a Justice on that Court who is extremely qualified but brings a \nstrong commitment to civil rights, to equal justice--someone who brings \nnot only legal scholarship but an independent voice.\n  Ms. Kagan is extremely qualified in these areas. Her record \ndemonstrates an understanding of how the Court affects the lives of \nordinary Americans. She clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, another \ndistinguished Marylander, someone who served on the Court, a \ntrailblazer in civil rights and a trailblazer on the Court.\n  Much was made during the Judiciary Committee hearings about her \nclerking for Marshall and somehow or another that was not a good thing. \nI thought it was a fantastic thing for us in Maryland who revere \nThurgood Marshall for his brilliance, his tell-it-like-it-is legal \nstyle, who brought scholarship and yet street corner savvy out from \nsome of the meanest streets in Baltimore to the Court. We thought it \nwas great. We think Justice Thurgood Marshall was a great member of the \nSupreme Court. And they think it is great Kagan mentored and learned \nunder him.\n  During her tenure as dean of Harvard Law School, she, again, not only \ndeveloped the best faculty but made sure there were legal clinics to \nhelp the poor, the left out, the marginalized, but she also wanted to \nmake sure that Harvard was to ensure a more diverse student body.\n  In the face of this current Court that increasingly is on the side of \nbig corporations rather than with the little guy or the little gal, we \nneed a Justice such as Kagan who will understand what is going on in \nour communities.\n  I take my advise-and-consent responsibilities very seriously. It is \none of the most important jobs we have as Senators, and it is one I \napproach with thorough deliberation.\n  I look at three criteria for the Supreme Court: absolute integrity, \njudicial competence and temperament, and a commitment to core \nconstitutional principles. I want someone who is committed to the whole \nConstitution, the entire Constitution, the basic body of the \nConstitution and every single one of its amendments. There is a whole \ncrowd in the Senate who only seems to like the second amendment. I like \nall of them, and I am particularly devoted to the first one and the \n14th one.\n  Every day, the Supreme Court will make decisions that transcend \ngenerations. But today we have a Court that has an increasing \nwillingness to favor corporate interests over the voice of people at \nthe community level.\n  We also have a Court that seems to be increasingly out of touch with \nthe American people. We want to be able to reassure that we have a \nmember of the Court who understands this.\n  During this current Court's deliberations, I was appalled by the \nfamous Lilly Ledbetter case, the wonderful woman who worked at Goodyear \nfor 19 years and was a victim of pay discrimination. She sued Goodyear, \nand the case made it all the way to the Supreme Court. In appeal after \nappeal, she won. But, oh, the big guys with the big guns and the big \nbucks kept appealing, but she persisted. And then before the Court she \nwas turned down. It was so appalling that Justice Ginsburg from the \nbench asked Congress to take action. We did. But we should not be the \nCongress to overturn Supreme Court decisions because they trample on \nthe rights of people, because they trampled on the rights of a woman to \nget equal pay for equal work, trampled on the rights of a woman not to \nface retaliation in sexual harassment and humiliation when she tried to \nspeak up for herself on the floor of the factory or on the courtroom \nfloor.\n  I believe we need someone on the bench who understands the needs of \nthe people but, most of all, understands the laws of the United States \nof America and loves this Constitution--the entire Constitution of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I am here today because of the Constitution. The first amendment \nenabled me to speak up and organize and be able to make it here. There \nwas another amendment of the Constitution that enabled the direct \nelection of the Senate. There is this whole other crowd out there in \nthe community that wants to overturn that. I am here because the \nAmerican people insisted in a constitutional amendment that women have \nthe right to vote. Another constitutional amendment took it away from \nthe State legislature and put it in the hands of the American people.\n  I love the Constitution. I love every single amendment of the \nConstitution. And I want somebody on the Supreme Court who feels the \nway I do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher fine words. She is someone who knew the Court before there were any \nwomen on that Court. She has seen many changes. I thank her for her \nwork.\n  To break the glass ceiling, we have now been joined by one of our \nmale colleagues, after hearing from five female colleagues. But we are \ngoing to let him speak. We have been joined by the senior Senator from \nthe State of New Mexico. We are honored to have Senator Bingaman here \nto speak about Solicitor General Kagan.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the \nDemocratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just commend all my \ncolleagues for their eloquent statements\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nin support of Solicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination, and I join \nthem in that support of her nomination to be an Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I strongly believe Solicitor General Kagan has the skill set, the \nintellect, and the experience necessary to be an exceptional Justice. \nShe has a diverse legal background, with a distinguished career in \ngovernment and academia, and she has served as our Nation's top lawyer \nbefore the Court. After reviewing her record, as Senator Klobuchar \npointed out, I believe Senator Hagan also--and others have pointed out \nin their comments as well--the American Bar Association unanimously \nvoted that she was ``well qualified'' to serve on the Court, which is \nthe highest ranking the American Bar Association bestows.\n  I have also met with Ms. Kagan and closely followed her confirmation \nhearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She clearly \ndemonstrated that she has the right temperament for this position and \nthat her legal views are well within the mainstream of judicial thought \nin this country. Ms. Kagan also affirmed her commitment to interpret \nthe law with fidelity and demonstrated that she understands how the \ndecisions of this High Court have a very real impact on the lives and \nliberties of Americans.\n  Ms. Kagan's wide range of experience will serve the country well. She \nhas served as a faculty member at the University of Chicago Law School, \nas a former dean of the Harvard Law School, as a clerk to former \nJustice Thurgood Marshall, as a White House aide to former President \nBill Clinton, and in her current position as Solicitor General of the \nUnited States. In her current position as Solicitor General, she has \nfiled approximately 100 briefs and argued six cases before the Supreme \nCourt. Ms. Kagan has demonstrated sound judgment and has exhibited \ngreat skill in the cases she has handled before the Supreme Court.\n  She has been lauded by individuals across the political spectrum for \nher ability to build consensus and for her respect for those with \ndiffering views. For example, she has received support from eight \nformer Solicitors General from both parties, including Kenneth Starr \nand Ted Olsen. At Harvard she worked to hire a faculty representing \ndiverse political views, including conservative faculty members in \norder to ensure that students received a broad perspective on the \nissues they were studying.\n  While Ms. Kagan has a great deal of legal experience, much has been \nsaid about her lack of judicial experience. Although she has not served \nas a judge, Ms. Kagan is widely respected in the legal community. She \nwill bring needed diversity to the bench with respect to her legal \nbackground. It is important to note that about 40 of the 111 previous \nSupreme Court Justices who have served did not have judicial experience \nprior to serving on the Supreme Court, including, I would point out, \nformer Chief Justice William Rehnquist.\n  I strongly believe Ms. Kagan has the qualifications necessary to be \nan excellent Justice of the Supreme Court. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her nomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, we have now been joined by the \nSenator from Delaware, and we are pleased to have him here as well as \nwe continue our discussion about the fine qualities of Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan for the job of Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Senator Carper.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator, and I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today in support of Solicitor \nGeneral Elena Kagan's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. I am \nconfident that in the years to come, she will make proud the President \nwho has nominated her as well as those of us who vote to confirm her.\n  I would like to begin today, if I may, first by explaining why I am \nsupporting the nomination, and after I have done that I will outline \nwhy I believe a number of our Republican colleagues shouldn't just \nconsider supporting that nomination but should support her nomination \nalong with the rest of us.\n  This is my fourth opportunity to vote on a nomination to the Supreme \nCourt. As do each of my colleagues, I take seriously our constitutional \nobligation to provide advice and consent to determine whether a \nPresident's judicial nominees truly merit a lifetime appointment. I \nrealize a number of considerations are weighed not just by me but by \neach of us who serve here when making a decision that is as important \nas this one is for our Nation.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I was privileged to have served as \nGovernor of Delaware, and in that role I nominated, over the course of \n8 years, dozens, maybe scores, of men and women to serve as judges in \nour State courts. The qualities I sought then in judicial nominees \nincluded unimpeachable integrity, a keen intellect, a thorough \nunderstanding of the law, sound judicial temperament, a willingness to \nlisten and to consider both sides of an argument, and a strong work \nethic. These qualities are also the ones that guide me today as I \ndecide how to vote on the judicial nominees that come before us in the \nSenate, whether that President is Barack Obama or George W. Bush.\n  In applying each of these standards to Elena Kagan, it has become \nclear to me while examining her record that she meets or exceeds all of \nthem. First, if you will, just consider with me--I know others have \ntouched on this, but I will do it again--her life and experience.\n  As others have reminded us, she graduated summa cum laude from \nPrinceton University. She received a scholarship to pursue her graduate \nstudies at Oxford University, and after that she earned her law degree \nmagna cum laude from Harvard Law School.\n  Following law school, she clerked for DC Circuit Court and then for \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Starting in 1989, Ms. \nKagan spent 2 years in private practice before taking on a position as \nprofessor of law at the University of Chicago. Then in 1995, she went \nto work in the White House and she rose there to the position of Deputy \nAssistant to the President for Domestic Policy. In 2001, with the \nchange in administrations, Ms. Kagan returned to the study of law as a \nprofessor first, and then as Dean of the Harvard Law School. I believe \nshe is the first woman to achieve that.\n  More recently, in 2009, Elena Kagan was confirmed by the Senate, with \nthe support of seven or eight of our Republican colleagues, to serve as \nthe first female Solicitor General of the United States.\n  Ms. Kagan is widely recognized as one of our Nation's leading legal \nminds and has been hailed as a preeminent scholar of administrative \nlaw. The American Bar Association has bestowed upon her their highest \nrating of ``well qualified'' in assessing her record and in evaluating \nher judicial temperament.\n  I realize some have criticized Elena Kagan for not having previously \nserved on the bench. I take a different view. As a nominee from outside \nthe judicial monastery, I believe Ms. Kagan's background and experience \nwill actually bring a valuable perspective and a breath of fresh air to \nthe Supreme Court. As my colleagues consider her nomination, I hope \nthey take into account the fact that in our Nation's history--listen to \nthis--more than one-third of our Supreme Court Justices have had no \nprior experience on the bench, either in Federal Government or outside \nof Federal Government.\n  Others have objected to Ms. Kagan's nomination on the grounds that \nwhile serving as the dean of the Harvard Law School, she allegedly \nlimited military recruiters access to students. This charge of my \nopponents on Ms. Kagan's nomination was one I took very seriously as I \nconsidered her nomination to serve on our highest Court.\n  As some of my colleagues know, I attended Ohio State University as a \nNavy ROTC midshipman and went on to serve 5 years as a naval flight \nofficer during a hot war in Southeast Asia and for another 18 years as \na ready reservist until the end of the Cold War. I deeply appreciate \nall that the military has done for me, and I believe our military \nrecruiters should be allowed to have access to college campuses and to \nthe students there.\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\n  Having examined this issue in some detail, I can say with confidence \nthat I believe Elena Kagan honors and reveres the men and women who \nserve our country in its Armed Forces, as do I. The fact is, military \nrecruiters did continue to have access to students throughout her \ntenure, and in some years recruitment actually rose rather than \ndiminished.\n  Last month, I had the privilege of meeting personally with Elena \nKagan, as a lot of my colleagues have as well. We spoke about many \nmatters. We spoke about her life, her work, her views of the law. It \nwas a revealing conversation for me and actually quite an encouraging \none in no small part because I walked away feeling that Elena Kagan is \nnot just uncommonly bright and a scholar of the law. Perhaps just as \nimportant, she has the potential to become, over time, the kind of \nconsensus-builder that the Supreme Court needs at this time in our \nNation's history.\n  Given the plethora of closely decided 5-to-4 decisions emanating from \nthe Supreme Court in recent years, it is clear, at least to me, that \nthey could use another Justice there who has the experience and the \nability to help them find common ground and work toward sound, \nreasonable, commonsense solutions and opinions. Come to think of it, we \ncould use a few more people like that here in the legislative branch of \nour government and on both sides of the aisle.\n  Fortunately, among her colleagues and in the legal community, Elena \nKagan is known as a consensus builder. Even those who may have a \ndifferent judicial philosophy than Ms. Kagan nonetheless respect her \njudgment and her abilities.\n  One of them is Michael McConnell. He is a constitutional law scholar \nwho was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as a U.S. \ncircuit court judge on the Tenth Circuit. He had this to say about her:\n\n       Publicly and privately, in her scholarly work and in her \n     arguments on behalf of the United States, Elena Kagan has \n     demonstrated a fidelity to legal principle even when it means \n     crossing her political and ideological allies. I urge you to \n     confirm Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  We thank Mr. McConnell for that advice.\n  It is clear to me, and I believe to many others on both sides of the \naisle, that if confirmed, a ``Justice Kagan'' would base her approach \nto deciding cases solely on the law and our constitution, and not on \nany ideological agenda or on the politics of a case.\n  Let me close, if I may, by expressing my appreciation to the handful \nof Republican Senators who have announced publicly in recent days that \nthey intend to support Ms. Kagan's nomination. I am sure it was not an \neasy decision. I do believe, however, it is the right decision for our \ncountry, and I hope those men and women will be joined by a number of \nother Republican Senators when the final vote is taken later this week.\n  Many of us remember when, in 1986, President Reagan nominated William \nRehnquist to serve as Chief Justice of the United States, and his \nsubsequent confirmation by the Senate with the support of 16 Democratic \nSenators. However, not many recall that in 1971, when William Rehnquist \nwas nominated to serve as an Associate Justice on the Court, he had no \nprior experience on the bench. Even so, in 1971, some 29 Democratic \nSenators joined their Republican colleagues in supporting his \nconfirmation. As you know, Justice Rehnquist went on to have a long and \ndistinguished career on the Supreme Court.\n  The fact that Chief Justice Rehnquist's nomination was supported by a \nlarge number of Democratic Senators not just once but twice is an \nimportant testament to the strength of our democratic process and our \nability to work across party lines. I hope we can make a similar \nstatement later this week with the confirmation of Ms. Kagan to the \nSupreme Court with the support of Senators from both sides of the \naisle, including the Senator sitting across this Chamber today from the \nState of South Carolina who I think sets, in this instance, a \nparticularly good example for us all.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I think this concludes our very broad \ndiscussion about all of the fine qualifications of Elena Kagan for this \njob and, again, refuting the words of one of our colleagues--\nunfortunate words--in which he said, I believe, that she doesn't have \nthe gifts and the qualities of mind and the temperament one must have \nto be a Justice.\n  Look at the words of so many people across this country, along so \nmany different ideological lines--69 law school deans who wrote about \nher knowledge of the law and skills in legal analysis as being ``first-\nrate.'' They say:\n\n       Her writings in constitutional law and administrative law \n     are highly respected and widely cited. She is an incisive and \n     astute analyst of law, with a deep understanding of both \n     doctrine and policy.\n\n  Listen at what the National Association of Women Judges has said:\n\n       We recognize the essential qualifications that a justice of \n     our highest court must have: superior intellectual capacity \n     as well as an intimate knowledge and a deep understanding of \n     constitutional law. It cannot be seriously disputed that \n     General Kagan brings these qualifications with her in \n     abundance.\n\n  From the Women's Bar Association:\n\n       Solicitor General Kagan's intellect and legal acumen have \n     been recognized by those across the political spectrum.\n\n  Of course, I already read into the Record the words of the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association.\n  So many people have written in support of Solicitor General Kagan. \nBut I would say that no words meant more to me than the words of our \ncolleague, Senator Graham, who is here across the aisle. He had the \ncourage to stand up and explain why he made the decision to support her \nnomination.\n  He made very clear that he didn't agree with every position she had \never taken or would agree with every decision that she would ever make. \nBut he talked about our role as Members of the Senate to not be \npolitical arbiters in terms of who the judge should be but to have the \nrole of oversight and to figure out what the qualifications are and \ndoes this person meet the qualifications and does the person have the \njudgment to make decisions in very difficult cases. And, as Senator \nGraham so eloquently stated that day during the hearing, Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Makes the grade.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I appreciate the kind comments of the \nSenator from Minnesota. I have enjoyed working with her on the \ncommittee and hope to be able to work with her on a lot of different \ntopics, including confirming judges.\n  My view of Elena Kagan is quite simple. I found her to be a good, \ndecent person; well qualified in terms of her legal background to sit \non the Court. The people who know her the best, who worked with her, \nhave nothing but good things to say about her. She is not someone a \nRepublican President would have picked--she is definitely in the \nliberal camp when it comes to judging--but I think within the \nmainstream of the left wing of the Court.\n  The Court has two wings to it. A lot of decisions are--not a lot, \nsome decisions are 5-4. But you know who the conservatives on the Court \nare and you know who the liberals are. The one thing they have in \ncommon is that they are highly qualified, great Americans who happen to \nview the law a bit differently in terms of philosophy. But they have \nbrought honor to the Court.\n  Justice Ginsburg is definitely in the left wing of the Court. Justice \nScalia is definitely in the right wing of the Court. From what I have \nbeen told, they have a deep personal friendship; that Justices Scalia \nand Ginsburg have become fast friends and admire each other even though \nthey often cancel out each other's vote and they have some real good \ngive and take in their opinions. In that regard I think they represent \nthe best in judging and the best in our democracy, and that is two \ndifferent philosophies competing on the battlefield of ideas but \nunderstanding that neither one of them is the enemy. They have a lot of \nrespect for each other.\n  What brought me to the conclusion to vote for Solicitor General \nKagan? I\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nbelieve the advise and consent clause of the Constitution had a very \ndistinct purpose. Under our Constitution, article 2, it allows the \nPresident of the United States to appoint Supreme Court Justices and \njudges to the Federal bench in general. That is an authority and a \nprivilege given to him by the Constitution. You have to earn that by \ngetting elected President.\n  After having watched Senator McCain literally about kill himself to \ntry to be President, I have a lot of admiration for those who will seek \nthat office. It is very difficult to go through the process of getting \nnominated and winning the office. I daresay that Senator McCain would \nindicate it is one of the highlights of his life to be nominated by his \nparty and to go out and fight for the vote of the American people.\n  Senator Obama was a Member of this body before being elected \nPresident. I can only imagine what he went through, going through the \nprimary process, beating some very qualified, high-profile Democrats to \nget the nomination of his party. When it was all said and done, after \nabout $1 billion and a lot of sweat and probably sleepless nights, he \nwas elected by the people of the United States to be our President. I \nwant to honor elections.\n  My job, as I see it--and I am just speaking for me--each Senator has \nto determine what they believe the advise and consent clause requires. \nFrom my point of view I will tell you what I think my job is in this \nprocess. No. 1, it is not to be a rubberstamp. Why would you even have \nthe Senate involved if the President could pick whomever he or she \nchose? So there is a collaboration that goes on here. There is a check \nand balance in the Constitution where we have to advise and consent. So \nI do not expect myself or any other Senator to feel once the election \nis over, you have to vote for whomever they pick. You do not. There may \nbe a time when I vote ``no'' to a President Obama nominee.\n  But my view of things is sort of defined by the Federalist Paper No. \n76, Alexander Hamilton, who was one of our great minds of this \ncountry's history. He said, ``The Senate should have special and strong \nreasons for denial of confirmation.''\n  I think his comment to us is that, yes, you can say no, but you need \nto have a special and strong reason because the Constitution confers \nupon the President the right to pick. What would those strong and \nspecial reasons be? Whatever you want it to be. That is the fact of \npolitics. Those strong and special reasons can literally be whatever \nyou want it to be as a Senator. But here is what Alexander Hamilton had \nin mind as to strong and special reasons. He continued:\n\n       To what purpose, then, require the cooperation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation.\n\n  I think that powerful and silent operation is meant to be a firm but \nnot overly political check and balance; not a continuation of the \ncampaign. Because the campaign is a loud experience. It is 50 plus 1, \nrah-rah-rah, build yourself up, tear your opponent down. So when \nAlexander Hamilton indicated to the Senate his view of the advise and \nconsent clause, that it would be powerful, though in general a silent \noperation, I think he is telling us: The campaign is over. Now is the \ntime to govern. So when this nominee comes your way from the person the \nConstitution confers the ability to pick and choose, you should have in \nmind a powerful but silent operation.\n  ``It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism. . . .'' \nI think that is pretty self-evident, that one of the things we do not \nwant to have with our judiciary is it becomes an award or prize for \nsomebody who helped in the campaign, picking somebody who is close to \nyou personally, related to you, so that the job of Federal judge \nbecomes sort of political patronage. The Senate could be a good check \nand balance for that. I think that is one of the reasons we are \ninvolved in the process, to make sure that once the election is over, \nthe President himself does not continue the campaign. The campaign is \nover and we have a silent operation in terms of how we deliver our \nadvice and consent. So he is telling the President through the Senate \nthat once the campaign is over, you should not pick someone who will \nhelp you politically or return a favor; you should pick someone who \nwill be a good judge.\n  It ``would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit \ncharacters from State prejudice.'' That is another view that Alexander \nHamilton had, as to how the Senate should use its advise and consent \nduties, to make sure that unfit characters do not go on the Court. I \ncan imagine that has probably been used in the past.\n  ``From family connection,'' that one is obviously self-evident. You \ndon't want to pick someone from your family unless there is a good \nreason to do so. ``[F]rom personal attachment or from a view to \npopularity.''\n  When I add up all these things, I am looking at the necessity of \ntheir concurrence with a: ``powerful, though, in general, silent \noperation. It would be an excellent check upon the spirit of favoritism \n. . . to prevent the appointment of unfit characters . . . from family \nconnection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.''\n  In other words, we are trying to make sure the President, he or she, \npicks a good, qualified judge, not some unfit character, some person \ntied to him or her personally, not someone who would be a popular \nchoice but would be a lousy judge.\n  When I apply that standard to Elena Kagan, I cannot find anything \nabout her that makes her an unfit character to me. Frankly, what I know \nabout her from listening to her for a couple of days and having people \ntell me about her is I think she is a very fine person with stellar \ncharacter.\n  The letter that moved me the most about Elena Kagan the person, I \nwish to share with the Senate and read, if I may. This comes from \nMiguel Estrada. For those of you who may not remember, Miguel Estrada \nwas chosen by President Bush to be on the court of appeals. For a \nvariety of reasons--there is no use retrying the past--he never got a \nvote by the Senate. He never got out of committee. All I can say from \nmy point of view is, it was one of the great mistakes. I am sure there \nhave been times when Republicans have done the same thing or something \nlike it to a well-qualified Democratic selection. But I happened to be \nhere when Miguel Estrada was chosen by President Bush. So he had a very \nunpleasant experience when it came to getting confirmed as a judge. But \nhere is what he wrote about Elena Kagan, a Republican conservative \nlawyer chosen by President Bush to be on the court of appeals, writing \nfor Elena Kagan:\n\n       I write in support of Elena Kagan's confirmation as an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     I have known Elena for 27 years. We met as first year law \n     students at Harvard, where we were assigned seats next to \n     each other for our classes. We were later colleagues as \n     editors of the Law Review and as law clerks to different \n     Supreme Court Justices; and we have been friends since.\n       Elena possesses a formidable intellect, an exemplary \n     temperament, and a rare ability to disagree with others \n     without being disagreeable. She is calm under fire and mature \n     and deliberate in her judgments. Elena would also bring to \n     the Court a wealth of experience at the highest level of our \n     Government and of academia, including teaching at the \n     University of Chicago, serving as the Dean of the Harvard Law \n     School and experience at the White House and as the current \n     Solicitor General of the United States. If such a person, who \n     has demonstrated great intellect, high accomplishments and an \n     upright life, is not easily confirmable, I fear we will have \n     reached a point where no capable person will readily accept a \n     nomination for judicial service.\n       I appreciate that considerations of this type are \n     frequently extolled but rarely honored by one side or the \n     other when the opposing party holds the White House. I was \n     dismayed to watch the confirmation hearings for then-Judge \n     Alito, at the time one of our most distinguished appellate \n     judges, and find that they range from the--\n\n  Well, I am not going to read it all.\n\n     . . . one could readily identify the members of the current \n     Senate majority, including several who serve on the Judiciary \n     Committee [and their partisan views].\n       Lest my endorsement of Elena's nomination erode the support \n     she would see from her own party, I should make it clear that \n     I believe her views on the subjects that are relevant to her \n     pending nomination--including the scope of judicial role, \n     interpretive approaches to the procedure and substantive law, \n     and the balance of powers among the various institutions of \n     government--are as firmly center-left as my own are center-\n     right. If Elena is confirmed, I would expect her rulings to \n     fall well within the mainstream of current legal thought, \n     although on\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\n     the side of what is popularly conceived as ``progressive.'' \n     This should come as a surprise to exactly no one: One of the \n     prerogatives of the President under our Constitution is to \n     nominate high federal officers, including judges, who share \n     his (or her) governing philosophies. As has often been said, \n     though rarely by Senators whose party did not control the \n     White House at the time, elections have consequences.\n       Elena Kagan is an impeccably qualified nominee. Like Louis \n     Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Robert Jackson, Byron White, \n     Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist--none of whom arrived at \n     the Court with prior judicial service--she could become one \n     of our great Justices. I strongly urge you to confirm her \n     nomination without delay.\n\n  I think that says a lot of Elena Kagan. I think it says a lot about \nMiguel Estrada. She wrote a letter basically--I asked her to--to tell \nme what she thought about Miguel Estrada. I will read that in a minute. \nBut at the end of the day, those of us in the Senate have to understand \nthat every branch of government includes human beings and there is a \nrule that stood the test of time. I didn't make this one up. It was \nsomebody far wiser than I am, somebody far more gifted than I ever hope \nto be, somebody I put a lot of trust in.\n  It is called the Golden Rule. ``Do unto others as you would have them \ndo unto you.'' That is probably one of the most powerful statements \never made. It is divine in its orientation, and it is probably \nsomething that would serve us all well if we thought about it at \nmoments such as this.\n  I am going to vote for Elena Kagan because I believe constitutionally \nshe meets the test the Framers envisioned for someone to serve on the \nCourt. I don't think the Framers ever envisioned Lindsey Graham from \nSouth Carolina voting no because President Obama picked someone who is \nclearly different than I would have chosen. Because if that were the \ncase, the campaign never ended. It would undercut the President's \nability to pick someone of like philosophy. My job is to make sure the \nperson he chose is qualified, of fit character, not chosen for \nfavoritism or close connection but chosen based on merit.\n  I have no problem with Elena Kagan as a person. I have no problem \nwith her academic background. I have no problem with her experience as \na lawyer. Even though she has worked for Justices whom I would not have \nruled like, even though she has taken up political causes I oppose, \nthat is part of democracy.\n  Her time as Solicitor General, where she represents the United States \nbefore the Supreme Court, was reassuring to me. She has had frontline \nexperience in the war on terror. She has argued before the Supreme \nCourt that terrorist suspects should be viewed under the law of war. \nShe supports the idea that someone who joins al-Qaida has not committed \na crime. They have taken up arms against the United States, and they \ncan be held indefinitely without trial if, under proper procedures, \nthey have been found to be part of the enemy force. She understands \ndetainees held at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan should not be subject \nto judicial review in the United States because they are prisoners of \nwar in an active theater of combat. If she gets on the Court--and I am \ncertain she will--she will be able to bring to the Court some \nfrontline, real-world experience in the war on terror. She has had an \nopportunity to represent the United States before the Supreme Court, \narguing that this Nation is at war, and the people who attacked us on \n9/11 and who continue to join al-Qaida are not some common criminals \nbut people subject to the law of armed conflict. Her testimony when she \nwas confirmed as Solicitor General was reassuring to me that she \nunderstood that very important concept.\n  How she rules, I don't know. I expect she will be more similar to \nJustice Stevens in the way she decides cases. The person she is \nreplacing is one of the giants of the Court from the progressive side. \nI expect she will follow his lead most of the time. I do believe she is \nan independent-minded person. When it comes to war on terror issues, \nshe will be a valuable member of the Court and may provide a \nperspective other judges would not possess. That is my hope.\n  I don't vote for her expecting her to do anything other than what she \nthinks is right, ruling with the Court most of the time in a way a \nRepublican nominee would not have ruled. It gets back to my point of a \nminute ago. If I can't vote for her, then how can I ask someone on the \nother side to vote for that conservative lawyer, maybe judge, who has \nlived their life on the conservative side of the aisle, fighting for \nconservative causes, fighting for the pro-life movement, standing for \nthe conservative causes I believe in, a strong advocate of a second \namendment right for every American? That day will come. I hope sooner. \nBut one day that day will come. What I hope we can do from this \nexperience is remember that when that day does come, the Constitution \nhas not changed at all. The only thing changed was the American people \nchose a conservative Republican President. I ask my colleagues to honor \nthat choice, when that conservative President, whoever he or she may \nbe, picks someone whom my colleagues on the other side would not have \nchosen. But that has been the way it has been for a couple hundred \nyears now.\n  Justice Ginsburg, the ACLU general counsel, got 96 votes. Justice \nScalia got 96 or 97 votes. Senator Thurmond, my predecessor, voted for \nJustice Ginsburg. There is no way on God's green Earth Strom Thurmond \nwould have voted for Justice Ginsburg if he believed his job was to \npick the nominee. There is no way many of my colleagues on the other \nside would have ever voted for Justice Scalia if they thought it was \ntheir job or they had the ability to make a selection in line with \ntheir philosophy. No one could have been more polar opposite than \nGinsburg and Scalia. But not that long ago, in the 1990s, this body, \nwithout a whole lot of fussing and fighting, was able to put on the \nCourt two people who could not be more different but chose to be good \nfriends.\n  The history of confirming nominees to the Supreme Court is being \nlost. Madam President, 73 of the 123 Justices who served on the Supreme \nCourt were confirmed without even having a rollcall vote. Something is \ngoing on. It is on the left, and it is on the right. I hope this body \nwill understand one thing: The judiciary is the most fragile branch of \ngovernment. They can't go on cable TV and argue with us as to why they \nare qualified. They cannot send out mailings advocating their \npositions. They have no army. All they have is the force of the \nConstitution, the respect of the other branches and, hopefully, the \nsupport of the American people.\n  Having gone to Iraq and Afghanistan many times, the one thing I can \ntell my colleagues that is missing in most countries that are having \ndifficult times is the rule of law. What is it? To me, the rule of law \nis a simple but powerful concept. If you ever find yourself in a \ncourtroom or before a magistrate or a judge, you will be judged based \nnot on what tribe you came from. You will be judged based on what you \ndid, not who you are.\n  The one thing we don't want to lose in this country is an independent \njudiciary. We are putting the men and women who are willing to serve in \nthese jobs sometimes through hell. Judge Alito was poorly treated. I am \nvery proud of what Senator Sessions was able to do as ranking member. \nWe had a good, spirited contest with Sotomayor and Kagan. I thought the \nminority performed their role in an admirable fashion. I appreciate \nwhat Senator Leahy did working with Senator Sessions. I thought these \ntwo hearings were conducted in the best traditions of the Senate.\n  The votes will be in soon. She is going to get a handful of votes on \nour side. I have chosen to be one of those handful. From a conservative \npoint of view, there are 100 things one can find at fault in terms of \nphilosophy and judicial viewpoint with Elena Kagan. I have chosen not \nto go down that road. I have chosen to go down a different path, a path \nthat was cleared and marked for me long before I got here, a path that \nhas a very strong lineage, a path that I believe leads back to the \nConstitution, where the advice and consent clause is used in a way not \nto extend the election that is now over but as a reasonable, powerful \nbut silent check on a President who chose a judge for all the wrong \nreasons. Choosing a liberal lawyer from a President who campaigned and \ngoverns from the left is not a wrong reason. Choosing a conservative \nlawyer or judge once you campaign for the job running right of center, \nin my view, is not the wrong\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nreason. The wrong reason would be if the person you chose was not \nworthy of the job, did not have the background or the moral character \nto administer justice. I cannot find fault with Elena Kagan using that \nstandard.\n  I will vote for her. I will say to anybody in South Carolina and \nthroughout the country who is listening: She is not someone I would \nhave chosen, but it is not my job to choose. It is President's Obama's \njob. He earned that right. I have no problem with Elena Kagan as a \nperson. I think she will do a good job, consistent with her judicial \nphilosophy. I hope and pray that the body over time will get back to \nthe way we used to do business. If we don't watch it, we are going to \nwake one day, and we will politicize the judiciary to the point that \ngood men and women, such as Sam Alito, Justice Roberts, and Elena \nKagan, will not want to come before this body and be a judge. If that \never happened, it would be a great loss to this country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, there has been some suggestion in the \ncourse of the discussion of Elena Kagan's nomination that her decision \nto bar the military from access to Harvard's recruiting office was a \nprincipled one and had no impact on the lives of Harvard law students \nin the military. I think that is not a fair way to describe it. Her \ndecision relegated the military to second-class status at Harvard Law \nSchool. Military recruiters were, as she indicated in one statement, \n``alienating'' to some students and were not welcome, and students who \nmade public their interest in the military service otherwise might be \nostracized in that climate. But she wanted the student veterans to \nquietly help the classmates who might be interested in military service \nto overcome the obstacles there.\n  Well, let me just say it this way: Ms. Kagan protested against don't \nask, don't tell in reality by obstructing the mission of the junior \nmilitary officers who had at that point in their career been assigned \nthe duty of recruitment at law schools around the country, recruiting \nJAG officers for the military. But these junior officers had no control \nwhatsoever over this law. We often refer to it as a military policy, \nbut it is not a policy, it is law passed by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  So her effort to make a political point at the expense of the U.S. \nmilitary and in defiance of clear Federal law passed by this Congress \ncalls into question, really, her willingness to be governed by that law \nbecause she was punishing the military, really demeaning them, not \nallowing them equal access like any other law firm, presumably, in \nAmerica and demeaning them in that fashion. So I really think this \nissue is not a little one. It is a very big one. It says something very \nsignificant about her ability and her objectivity. So for that reason, \nI think it calls into question her ability to serve on the bench as an \nobjective person in justice.\n  I see the majority leader. He just appears out of the blue. I know he \nis busy, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want my friend from Alabama to know that \nwhen I see him on the floor, I do not run to the floor. It just happens \nto work out a lot of times. So I appreciate his yielding.\n  I am going to send a cloture motion to the desk dealing with the \nKagan nomination. I want the ranking member to understand that I have \nspoken to the Republican leader.\n  Could I have the attention of the Senator from Alabama? I want the \nSenator from Alabama to hear this. I am filing a cloture motion on the \nKagan nomination. I have spoken to the Republican leader. This is in no \nway to cut off debate. We have had 20 Senators who have spoken today. I \nwant Senators to have the ability to speak in whatever means they feel \nappropriate, but I just do not want a renegade Senator to stop us from \nbeing able to complete this nomination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will just say this: If it comes time for the cloture vote \nand more time is needed, everyone over here will be happy to make sure \npeople have ample time. We will postpone the cloture vote as long as \nnecessary to make sure people will have the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will just say to the leader, I am a \nbit hurt. I do not think this is a necessary step, that the leader has \nindicated we will move forward in maybe 3 days and finish this debate. \nAnd to file a cloture motion--if it in any way suggests there is a \ndeliberate attempt on this side to block an up-or-down vote, I will \njust say I have tried to make clear that I have a high standard before \nI would attempt to block an up-or-down vote, and I have not suggested \nand I think very few on this side have suggested--a vote at the time \nthat is right should go forward. I would expect that it would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I stated on the floor earlier today that I \nthink the conduct of the chairman and ranking member on this nomination \nhas been exemplary. I said that already. But if my friend from Alabama \nwould listen just for a minute, I have so many things I am trying to \nwork through procedurally so we can leave here at a reasonable time \nthis week. I just do not want someone who gets mad because I have done \nsomething they do not like saying: I am not going to let you have a \nvote on this judge until I get what I want.\n  I want to make sure everyone who wants to has the opportunity to \nspeak on Kagan. No one on the Republican side has even suggested a \nfilibuster. OK. And I understand that. But this is to make sure one \nSenator in this body--not on the nomination of Kagan but on anything--\nthey get their dander up a little bit, and he or she can cause the \nwhole Senate to come to a standstill.\n  So I repeat, if there is more time needed, there will be ample time. \nWhen the time for voting comes up, I will give whatever time is \nnecessary. What I have been trying to get--and I am sure it is too \nearly to have done that--is a time certain to vote on Elena Kagan. But \nI think my friends on the other side of the aisle have told me it is \ntoo early to do that. But I say to my friend, there is no direction to \nprevent anyone from speaking on this nomination for however long they \nwant.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, I just do not want somebody to come back and say \nin the future that we had to file cloture to get a vote on this \nnomination, and you filibustered this nomination. I feel pretty \nstrongly about that and am a bit uneasy that the leader has felt he \nneeded to do this.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I will just repeat what I said before. Any one Senator, as \nwe have learned--those of us who have served in the Senate and those \nwho have not been around here a long time--any one Senator can really \nthrow things into a turmoil, on your side or on my side. And the \npurpose of this is to make sure we finish the Kagan nomination before \nwe leave.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We had this conversation earlier today on the \ntelephone. I think filing a cloture motion is completely unnecessary \nand--\n  Mr. REID. Let me just interrupt my friend. If my two friends feel \nthis way--my concern is that we get locked into the 30-hour time. But I \nguess I could still do it on Thursday. So I know everyone----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I cannot imagine what incentive anyone would have to \ncreate the scenario under which the majority leader is concerned with.\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader and I know the many things we are \ntrying to complete in the next few days. And because I do not do \nsomething, as I have had happen before--that somebody on either side of \nthe aisle gets disturbed because of something I did or did not do--they \nsay: I am not going to let you have a vote on Kagan now. That could be \non my side or on your side.\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\n  So here is what I will do: I have not filed this motion yet. Based on \nthe statement of my friend from Alabama and my friend the Republican \nleader, I will just hold this in abeyance. I just know what is coming \ntomorrow. If we get stuck in a 30-hour time period, realistically, it \nwould take consent to even allow the debate to go forward on Kagan. I \nwould certainly not stand in the way of that. And during the time of \nthe 30 hours pending, as I understand the rules, I cannot file another \ncloture motion.\n  But recognizing that everyone wants to operate in the best way, what \nI would do is ask my two friends here, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee and my friend the Republican leader--would the \nRepublican leader consider allowing, if we get stuck in some procedural \nthing tomorrow, which is Wednesday--we have to complete this by Friday, \nI would think--would my friend consider a unanimous consent request to \nallow me to file tomorrow? Because if we are postcloture with 30 hours, \nI cannot file cloture tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I would say to my friend the majority leader, I \nwould be willing to consider that. The point I am trying to make here \nand the Senator from Alabama has tried to make is we are unaware of \nanybody on our side who does not expect a vote on Kagan on Thursday. As \nyou and I have discussed on and off the floor, the thought was that we \nwould have the Kagan vote. That would be the last vote prior to the \nAugust recess. That is the scenario under which we have been operating, \nand I am perplexed as to why my friend the majority leader feels this \nis a step he needs to take.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I cannot do is guarantee that will be the \nlast vote. There may be something else that comes up. But I will do my \nbest to cooperate, as I know you will. So I will see if this is \nnecessary some other time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I appreciate the majority leader \nwithholding. We can continue to discuss this, even tonight if he would \nlike, the two of us, privately.\n  Mr. REID. We will wait until the vote takes place tomorrow and find \nout what, if anything, we need to do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Fair enough.\n  Mr. REID. I am not filing the motion at this time, and I appreciate \nvery much the sincerity of my friend from Alabama, as usual, and, of \ncourse, my friend from Kentucky. He and I have worked together on a lot \nof things over the years, and I appreciate him being so candid today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, this is the second time since I have \nbecome a U.S. Senator that I have been asked to provide the President \nadvice and consent on a Supreme Court nominee. Last year, almost to the \nday, I spoke on the Senate floor on the nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to be on the Supreme Court. So I come to the floor today to \nspeak on the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan.\n  During the debate in the Senate on Judge Sotomayor's nomination, I \nlaid out the three criteria I use in evaluating an individual to \nfulfill the responsibilities of filling a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt. First, of course, we want to select the best candidate. Second, \nthe Justice must be impartial and allow the facts and the Constitution \nto speak. And, third, a Justice has a responsibility to apply the law, \nnot to write the law. Those are the criteria I have used in evaluating \nElena Kagan's nomination.\n\n  I met with Solicitor General Kagan following her appearance before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. She is personable and she is bright. \nHer career as an attorney has been exceptional. Although she has \nlimited trial experience, she does understand the important role the \njudiciary plays in America. It is the second criteria that causes me \nconcern: Solicitor General Kagan's ability to remain impartial. In \nparticular, her actions and judgment as dean of the Harvard Law School \nas it related to military recruitment is, to me, a serious problem.\n  Military recruitment on college campuses is protected by what is \ncommonly referred to as the Solomon Amendment. The Solomon Amendment is \nlegislation that Congress passed in the mid-1990s. The Solomon \nAmendment directs that institutions of higher learning shall not be \neligible for Federal funding if they refuse to follow Federal law. \nFunding shall be denied--denied--if it is determined that the school, \nas a policy or a practice, either prohibits or, in effect, prevents \nROTC access to campus or military recruiting on campus.\n  In the late 1970s, Harvard Law School adopted a policy that barred \norganizations that discriminated against any group from recruiting on \ncampuses. The ban applied to military recruiters. Other universities \nadopted similar policies. But following the passage of the Solomon \nAmendment, many institutions, including Harvard, adjusted their \npolicies.\n  Ms. Kagan became dean of Harvard Law School in the year 2003. In \n2003, America was fighting two wars. American men and women were \nvoluntarily joining the military to serve and to defend our country. At \na time when military recruiters were being allowed on campuses across \nthe country, Dean Kagan was looking for ways to make it difficult for \nmilitary recruiters to do their job at Harvard Law School. She wrote at \nthe time:\n\n       I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. . \n     . . This is a profound wrong--a moral injustice of the first \n     order.\n\n  Well, eventually, a legal challenge to the Solomon Amendment was \ninitiated. On two occasions, Dean Kagan signed court briefs opposing \nthe Solomon Amendment. In 2004, when a lower court rejected the Solomon \nAmendment, Dean Kagan immediately denied military recruiters the same \naccess afforded to other recruiters on campus. She took this action \neven though the court making the ruling did not have jurisdiction over \nHarvard Law School. Harvard Law School is located in the First Circuit. \nThe court that made the ruling was the Third Circuit.\n  The Pentagon notified Harvard that the restrictions on military \nrecruiters violated the law. In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on \nthe challenge to the Solomon Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected \nthe lawsuit as well as the arguments that were put forth in the brief \nsigned by Dean Kagan, and it did so unanimously. All of the Justices on \nthe Supreme Court, both conservative and liberal--all of them--agreed \nthe Solomon Amendment did not violate the rights of law schools. The \nlaw was unanimously upheld, and that is an extremely rare occurrence \nfrom a Court usually divided.\n  For America's judicial system to work, judges must always remain \nimpartial. I do believe that as dean of one of America's most \nprestigious law schools, Solicitor General Kagan allowed her personal \nbiases to interfere with her judgment. Solicitor General Kagan had very \nstrong opinions about military policies, including President Clinton's \ndon't ask, don't tell policy. Like every American, she is entitled to \nher personal beliefs and the right to express those views. As the dean \nof Harvard Law School, she is also responsible to know the law and to \nnot disregard it.\n  So, then, how can one explain the actions of Elena Kagan while dean \nof the Harvard Law School? No. 1, she didn't know the law; No. 2, she \ndidn't understand the law; or No. 3, she simply chose to ignore the law \nbecause of her strongly held personal beliefs.\n  Many Americans may be able to get away with these explanations. Such \nexplanations don't work for an individual seeking to become a Justice \non the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Elena Kagan has been nominated for a lifetime appointment to the \nSupreme Court. If confirmed, she will be entrusted to make decisions \nthat will impact America for a long time. The decisions she will be \nasked to make on this Court must be based on the law not influenced by \npersonal experiences or personal convictions.\n  In the case involving the Solomon Amendment, Dean Kagan failed to \nmeet that standard. I believe Dean Kagan knew the law. I have no doubt \nshe understood the law and wanted to find ways to get around the law.\n  I will not be supporting Solicitor General Kagan's nomination to the \nSupreme Court. I believe she allowed her personal beliefs to guide her. \nAs a private citizen, that may be acceptable.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nAs a member of the U.S. Supreme Court, it is not.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to add my support to the many voices \ncalling for the confirmation of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to the \nposition of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  At a time when the discussion of our legal system is so often \ndominated by ideological labels, Elena Kagan would bring years of \npractical, pragmatic experience to our highest Court. She is \nextraordinarily well qualified and will bring a valuable new \nperspective to the Court.\n  The highlights of Solicitor General Kagan's career are well known. \nMost recently, in 2009, she was the first woman to be nominated by a \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate to serve as Solicitor General of \nthe United States. In this position in which she represents the \ninterests of the U.S. Government before the Supreme Court, she has \nreceived numerous accolades from a broad range of observers. For \nexample, Professor Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional \nLaw Center at Stanford Law School and former circuit court judge \nnominated by George W. Bush, in urging her confirmation said the \nfollowing:\n\n       Publicly and privately, in her scholarly work and in her \n     arguments on behalf of the United States, Elena Kagan has \n     demonstrated a fidelity to legal principle even when it means \n     crossing her political and ideological allies.\n\n  Miguel Estrada, Assistant Solicitor General in the George H.W. Bush \nadministration, said Solicitor General Kagan:\n\n     . . . possesses a formidable intellect, an exemplary \n     temperament and a rare ability to disagree with others \n     without being disagreeable. She is calm under fire and mature \n     and deliberate in her judgments . . . If [she] is confirmed, \n     I would expect her rulings to fall well within the mainstream \n     of current legal thought. . . .\n\n  Ten former Solicitors General, representing both parties, have \npraised her ``breadth of experience and a history of great \naccomplishment in the law'' and said further that her ``most recent \nexperience as Solicitor General will serve her well as she wrestles \nwith the difficult questions that come before the Court.''\n  Among those former Solicitors General were Kenneth Starr and Drew S. \nDays.\n  In 2003, Elena Kagan was named dean of the Harvard Law School, the \nfirst woman to hold that title. Throughout her distinguished career, \nshe has shown a remarkable knack for reaching out to people across the \nideological spectrum. As Harvard Law School's dean, she broadened the \nschool's diversity of legal points of view, strengthened the academic \nprogram, and improved quality of life for students and faculty alike.\n  Elena Kagan will bring a different perspective to the Court, and we \nshould welcome that. Justice Antonin Scalia put it this way:\n\n       Currently, there is nobody on the Court who has not served \n     as a judge--indeed, as a Federal judge--all nine of us. I am \n     happy to see that this latest nominee is not a Federal \n     judge--and not a judge at all.\n\n  Elena Kagan's sense of fairness, problem-solving ability, and balance \nis illustrated by one of the episodes in her career that some have \ninaccurately criticized her for. During her time as dean of Harvard Law \nSchool, that school, similar to many around the country, had a policy \nto not use the campus to promote discriminatory activities, such as \ndon't ask, don't tell.\n  Some have sought to portray Elena Kagan's actions throughout this \nepisode as antimilitary. I find nothing in her words or actions that \nconstitutes hostility to the military. Quite the opposite. But don't \ntake my word for it. Take the words of former students of hers--for \ninstance, one who when he received his promotion to captain in the \nMassachusetts National Guard asked Elena Kagan to pin on his captain's \nbars at his promotion ceremony--hardly an honor for a soldier to bestow \non someone who is antimilitary.\n  CPT Robert Merrill, who wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post, put it \nthis way:\n\n       She treated the veterans at Harvard like VIPs, and she was \n     a fervent advocate of our veterans association. She was \n     decidedly against ``don't ask, don't tell,'' but that never \n     affected her treatment of those who had served.\n\n  Listen to 1LT David Tressler, who wrote:\n\n       During the brief period when recruiters were not given \n     access to students officially through the law school's Office \n     of Career Services, they still had access to students on \n     campus through other means . . . Kagan's positions on the \n     issue were not antimilitary and did not discriminate against \n     members or potential recruiters of the military. . . . She \n     always expressed her support for those who serve in the \n     military and encouraged students to consider military \n     service.\n\n  Finally, you can take the word of veterans who attended Harvard Law \nSchool who said that ``Elena Kagan has created an environment that is \nhighly supportive of students who have served in the military.''\n  Elena Kagan is smart, she is experienced, she is learned, and she is \nfair. She has the support of a host of organizations, a broad cross-\nsection of organizations, including the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, as well as a broad range of prominent scholars. She will \nmake an excellent Justice of the Supreme Court. I hope she is \noverwhelmingly confirmed.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to support the nomination of \nSolicitor General Elena Kagan as the next Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The Senate has few responsibilities more important than \nour constitutional obligation to advise and consent on the President's \nSupreme Court nominees. Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life, \nand the decisions they make affect the lives and livelihoods of every \nsingle family across the country. From the laws governing the role of \ncorporations and special interests in our electoral process, to the \nrights of women over their own reproductive health--we have seen \nclearly over the years the impact of this Nation's highest court.\n  So I am very glad that President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to fill \nthis critical position. I met with Solicitor General Kagan and talked \nto her about how she envisioned her role on the Court. I asked her \nabout her judicial philosophy, and what she felt the Court's role was \nin protecting ordinary Americans. I followed her testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I was extremely impressed with what she had \nto say. Elena Kagan has proven herself to be someone who understands \nthe importance of a fair and independent approach to rendering justice. \nShe is committed to making sure the voices of families across the \ncountry are represented in the chambers of the Supreme Court. And she \npossesses an evenhanded view of our justice system that gives me every \nassurance that any individual or group from Washington State could \nstand before her and receive fair treatment.\n  Solicitor General Kagan also has a strong legal background and is \nwithout a doubt a highly qualified choice for the Supreme Court. \nFollowing her graduation from Harvard Law School she served as a law \nclerk for Judge Abner Mikva on the U.S Court of Appeals, before moving \non to clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. After spending \nsome time in private practice, Elena Kagan went back into public \nservice to work for President Clinton on the Domestic Policy Council. \nShe then went back to Harvard Law School to teach and ultimately became \nthe first woman to serve as dean of the school, where she cemented her \nreputation as a fairminded leader who reaches out to all sides and \nbuilds consensus. When President Obama was elected he called Elena \nKagan back into public service to serve as Solicitor General. In this \nnew role as the so-called 10th Justice, she argued before the Court on \na broad range of issues, including a vigorous defense of the \ngovernment's right to limit the influence of corporations and special \ninterests in the electoral process.\n  When I hear some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say \nthat Elena Kagan lacks the experience to sit on the Supreme Court \nbecause she has never been a judge, I find that a little\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nhard to believe. Forty-one Justices have served on the Nation's highest \ncourt without having any prior judicial experience. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike have expressed the notion that prior judicial \nexperience is not a prerequisite for serving on the Supreme Court. In \nfact, for most of the Court's history there was a diversity of career \nexperiences represented on the bench. Most recently, Chief Justice \nRehnquist, who never served as a judge before he was nominated to the \nhighest court. Neither did Justice Powell or Justice White. Nor did \nJustices Black, Warren, Jackson, or Marshall. So I find it interesting \nthat the standard was changed with this nomination.\n  Elena Kagan is clearly qualified, and she is going to make an \noutstanding Supreme Court Justice. Her nomination is also another step \nforward toward making sure that we have a Supreme Court that is \nreflective of the country whose laws it safeguards. We are now on the \nverge of having the most women to serve together on the court at any \none time. While we still have work to do to achieve a court that is \ntruly representative of the full diversity of American experiences, I \nam proud that we are taking this strong step forward toward that goal.\n  After meeting with Solicitor General Kagan, hearing her testimony, \nand examining her record, I am confident that she has the judgment and \nimpartiality to serve our Nation honorably on the Supreme Court. She is \nthoughtful and fairminded in her approach to some of the most pressing \nlegal issues we face as a nation. She understands the struggles working \nfamilies face and the role of the Supreme Court in protecting them. And \nshe is committed to protecting the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  I am proud to represent families from my home State of Washington and \nI am proud to join with my Democratic and Republican colleagues to cast \nmy vote to confirm Elena Kagan as the next Associate Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak for \na few moments about the Kagan nomination, and I believe we have about \n20 minutes of time on our side. If somebody wishes to come and speak, I \nwould gladly yield the floor, since I have had the chance to speak on \nher nomination as a member of the Judiciary Committee. But in the \nabsence of somebody who has not had that chance, I wanted to go ahead \nand say a few words because I have been listening off and on throughout \nthe day to the debate that has taken place on the Senate floor \nregarding her nomination and I have heard over and over concerns \nexpressed--particularly from the other side of the aisle--about this \nterrible spectre of judicial activism, the judicial activism that looms \nover the Court and looms over the Kagan nomination.\n  I know it is a familiar tune from the other side. I think most of \nthem could sing it in their sleep, frankly. But if you actually look at \nwhere the activism is coming from, the surprising conclusion that I \nthink objective people would have no choice but to reach is that it is \nthe rightwing of the Supreme Court--the rightwing; the Roberts wing of \nthe Court--that is in fact engaged in all of the activism.\n  I think to a certain extent activism is a term of general criticism \nand that it applies to decisions you don't like. So if it is a decision \nthat goes a way you don't like, it is an activist decision. If it is a \ndecision that goes your way, no matter how much it changes the law, \nthen that is not activism because I agree with it. So I think the \ndiscussion about activism is a little bit flavored by the question of \npoint of view.\n  Trying to set that point of view question aside, I thought a bit \nabout what might the objective indicators of an activist Court--or in \nour case an activist bare majority on the Court--look like. What would \nthe telltales be that you had an activist Court doing its thing? Well, \nI think there are a few, and they seem to be ones that are actually \npretty germane to this activist bloc on the Supreme Court.\n  For instance, if you were an activist Court, or an activist bloc on \nthe Court, you would issue a lot of 5-to-4 decisions, and you would \nissue 5-to-4 decisions in major cases. The reason you would do that is \nbecause the Court is constantly presented with the choice to reach far \nwith a bare majority or dial its aspirations back and achieve a broader \nconsensus on the Court. So every decision presents, to one degree or \nanother, this choice. When you see recurring 5-to-4 decisions, you see \na majority of five that would appear to want to go to a particular \nplace, even if they can't bring the other four judges with them, and \nwho have deliberately chosen not to write a narrower decision, a more \nmodest decision, a more conservative--small ``c''--decision that could \nhave attracted six or seven or eight, or even perhaps all nine members \nof the Court.\n  That is a flag that would fly over an activist Court--a penchant for \n5-to-4 decisions. Sure enough, the Roberts Court is notorious for 5-to-\n4 decisions, particularly in major cases, and particularly in cases \nthat change the law--that change the interpretation of the \nConstitution. So there is one flag, and they seem to be flying that \nwarning flag right now.\n  If you were an activist Court, you would probably tend to break the \ninformal rules of appellate decisionmaking. Because the rules might \nconstrain you from getting where you want to go, and they would be a \nnuisance because you had a purpose--you had a place you wanted to get \nwith your decision, and so that the rules would be less of a hindrance \nfor you, because you would want to get beyond them, you would set them \naside.\n  One of the dangers of the Supreme Court is that it is the court of \nfinal appeal. They have only their own self-restraint that prevents \nthem from going anywhere. They stand above the checks and balances of \nour government in that respect. So these rules the Court tends to \nimpose on itself to keep itself within proper bounds are important \nrules.\n  One of them is that appellate courts do not engage in factfinding. It \nis not their province. Factfinding is done by juries and it is done by \ntrial judges. Those facts are established at the trial court level. \nOnce you get up above that and into the appellate courts you should be \nlooking just at questions of law. The courts should not be engaging in \nfactfinding at those upper levels, certainly not at the Supreme Court \nlevel. The exception to that principle is where the fact is so obvious \nthat the Court can take what they call judicial notice of it. The Court \ncan take judicial notice that San Francisco is west of Denver. It is an \nindisputable fact. It is no big deal. But other than that, factfinding \nis discouraged. So another little telltale would be is where the Court \nis running over those principles that are principles of self-restraint.\n  Sure enough, you see the Roberts Court doing just that. Indeed, in \none of its biggest leaps in which it knocked out enormous amounts of \nprecedent, in which it knocked out enormous amounts of legislative \npractice and made a huge doctrinal shift, was the case of Citizens \nUnited. In that case, the Court made a finding of fact. It made a \nfinding of fact that was critical to getting where it wanted to go in \nthat decision. The finding of fact was the following--the finding of \nfact was that corporate money, the independent expenditure of corporate \nmoney in elections, cannot contribute to the corruption of those \nelections. Corporate money, independently spent in an American \nelection, cannot possibly tend to corrupt that election.\n  It is an interesting finding of fact because I think, as anybody who \nhas been through a contested election would understand, it is a finding \nof fact that is in fact wrong. It is untrue. Yet they made it as a \nfinding of fact. It is also a finding of fact that ran contrary to the \nvast legislative record that had been built up in Congress on this \nquestion when it had come up in previous matters before the Court. But \nbecause of the peculiar manner in which they got to this question in \nCitizens United--it was not a question presented by the parties; they \nadded the question themselves, the Court did, and asked the parties to \nbrief it in, so there had not been a record on this.\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\n  They put themselves in a position where they could ignore the \nprevious record of fact and then they created their own finding of fact \nnotwithstanding that findings of fact are not something an appellate \ncourt is supposed to do, and in doing so they found a fact that was in \nfact not true. It is a false claim to assert that. It is not a fact.\n  When you look at that, another flag goes up. That is the kind of \nthing an activist Court would be doing. They would be trespassing over \nthe self-imposed rules of judicial restraint when necessary to get to \nthe point they wish to achieve. Again, it was 5-4, so you have a ``two-\nfer'' on that decision.\n  If you are an activist Court, you would probably want to keep doing \nwhat you are doing so you would start advancing theories that allowed \nyou to look at the precedents of the Court, the history of its \ndecisions, and selectively knock down precedent you did not like. \nNothing could give a Court more power and more room for activism than \nto be free of the constraint of precedent, of the previous decisions of \nthe Court.\n  The only way you can get yourself free of precedent--because it is \nthere. The previous courts made those decisions. It is in the records. \nYou go to the United States Supreme Court Reporter and you can look \nthem up. So what you have to do is you have to knock it down if you do \nnot like it. In order to do that, if that was your intention, you would \nwant to come up with a theory that allowed you to do that. Sure enough, \nin Citizens United, in his concurring opinion, the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States did that. He came up with a theory that says if a \nprecedent is hotly contested, then over time it clearly will be deemed \nnot as valid as other precedent and ultimately it can be replaced with \nprecedent that is not hotly contested.\n  Who gets to decide on the Supreme Court whether a precedent is hotly \ncontested? Obviously, the Justices themselves. So you can create a \nself-fulfilling prophecy in which Chief Justice Roberts and his bloc of \nfour other conservative voters who make up the group of five that is \nalways steering the Court to the right, can hotly contest any precedent \nthey please. They can hotly contest it, and hotly contest it, until \nthey undermine it more and more and finally they knock it down. Despite \nall the things they said about respect for precedent and judicial \nmodesty when they went through their hearings before the Senate, what \nthey have actually done is create an analytical tool, a device for \nselectively undermining precedent they do not like, hotly contesting \nit, disabling it, and taking it out. They can reshape the precedent of \nthe Court to their liking using this doctrine.\n  There is another flag that goes up. Why would you create a doctrine \nsuch as that, that allows you to selectively disrespect, hotly contest, \nand knock out the precedent of the Courts past if you did not have an \nintention to try to shift the precedent to support a particular \ndirection? If you are an activist Court, you would give Congress very \nlittle deference. And this is a Court that gives Congress very little \ndeference. Jeffrey Toobin, who writes on the Supreme Court frequently, \nin an article entitled ``No More Mr. Nice Guy, The Supreme Court's \nStealth Hard-Liner,'' an article about Chief Justice Roberts, back in \nMay of a year ago--so this is a little bit dated, May 25, 2009--said \nthat:\n\n       In every major case since he became the Nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the \n     prosecution over the defendant, the State over the condemned, \n     the executive branch over legislative, and the corporate \n     defendant over the individual plaintiff. Even more than \n     Justice Scalia has embodied judicial conservatism during a \n     generation of service on the Supreme Court, Roberts has \n     served the interests, and reflected the values, of the \n     contemporary Republican Party.\n\n  ``Served the interests and reflected the values of the contemporary \nRepublican Party''--by, in every major case, siding with the executive \nbranch over the legislative.\n  That is just one piece of it. The other is the disrespect for laws \nthat have been passed by Congress and their intent. Lilly Ledbetter is \nthe perfect case. Congress wanted to protect women from discrimination \nin the workplace, on what they are paid. Rather than read the statute \nto protect Lilly Ledbetter's right to a judgment, they came down with a \nfinding that for so long as the company was successfully able to \nprevent her from finding out that she had been discriminated against, \nthey were able to get away with it. That is not a finding this body \never would have accepted. But it was what the Court came down with. And \nit gave Congress no deference--again, a tradition in these Roberts \nCourt decisions. Why would you want to defer to Congress if you have a \npoint of view that you want to bring to the Court? You wouldn't want \nCongress's point of view involved, you would want your point of view, \nand therefore deferring to Congress would not be part of your goal.\n  So the lack of deference, a striking pattern in the Roberts Court, is \nagain consistent with what you would expect from an activist Court. \nMost of all, if you were an activist Court, a pattern would begin to \nemerge to those decisions as the Court issued them, particularly those \n5-4 decisions. On the Roberts Court, one pattern is striking, the clear \npattern of corporate victories at the Roberts Court. It reaches across \nmany fields--across arbitration, antitrust, employment discrimination, \ncampaign finance, legal pleading standards, and many others. Over and \nover on this current Supreme Court, the Roberts bloc guiding it has \nconsistently, repeatedly rewritten our law in the favor of corporations \nversus ordinary Americans. That is one of the reasons why Jeffrey \nToobin, in his article, was able to say:\n\n       In every major case since he became the nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with \n     the corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff.\n\n  Again, that was only effective May 25 of 2009, so it is a dated \nstatistic. But certainly as of May 25 that was the record when \ncorporations came before this Court.\n  A recent article--not May 25 of 2009; this one is July 24, 2010--was \nwritten by Adam Liptak. The headline was ``Court Under Roberts Has \nBecome Most Conservative in Decades.'' It was published in the New York \nTimes. Here are some of the findings:\n\n       In the 5 years [of the Roberts Court], the court not only \n     moved to the right but also became the most conservative one \n     in living memory, based on analysis of four sets of political \n     science data.\n       The ideological direction of the court's activism has \n     undergone a marked change toward conservative results.\n\n  Another quote from the article.\n\n       The first term of the Roberts court was a sharp jolt to the \n     right.\n\n  Another quote from the article.\n\n       [F]ive years of data are now available, and they point \n     almost uniformly in one direction: to the right.\n\n  That was another quote from the article.\n  A more human reaction was of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:\n\n       ``Gosh,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in the law \n     school forum in January a few days after the Supreme Court \n     undid one of her major achievements by reversing a decision \n     on campaign spending limits. ``I step away for a couple of \n     years and there's no telling what's going to happen.''\n\n  That was the reaction of Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican appointee.\n  They turn things very quickly when they have the chance.\n\n       In 2000, the Court struck down a Nebraska law banning an \n     abortion procedure by vote of 5 to 4, with Justice O'Connor \n     in the majority--\n\nmaking it a 5-to-4 striking down of that statute.\n\n       Seven years later, the court upheld a similar federal law, \n     the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, by the same vote. ``The key \n     to the case was not in the difference in wording between the \n     Federal law and the Nebraska act,'' Erwin Chemerinsky wrote \n     in 2007 in The Green Bag, a law journal.'' It was Justice \n     Alito having replaced Justice O'Connor.\n\n  A new person on the Court, almost identical set of facts, complete \nreversion of decision, 5-4 to 5-4.\n  Similarly, in 2003, Justice O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in a \n5-4 opinion to allow public universities to take account of race in \nuniversity admissions decisions. A month before her retirement in 2006, \na similar decision came up, and because that decision was there on the \nbooks, that opinion, the Court refused to hear a case challenging the \nuse of race to achieve integration in public schools.\n  Almost as soon as she left, the article says, the Court reversed \ncourse. A 2007 decision limited the use of race for such a purpose, \nalso on a 5-4 vote. So I suppose you could add another flag to\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\nthe list of signs of an activist Court and that would be that they \nchange very recent decisions as soon as the majority changes so they \ncontrol the votes, the way we might here in the legislature. It is very \nappropriate in the Senate when the majority shifts.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee. If \nhe were to be the chairman of the Finance Committee, I am sure the \nfocus of the Finance Committee would change from that under Democratic \nleadership, and that is part of majority control, but it is not \nsupposed to be that way on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is \nsupposed to be not dealing with partisan questions, not going for a \nsimple majority, but answering to the Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of PO2 Justin McNeley. Petty \nOfficer McNeley, a member of Assault Craft Unit One, ACU-1, based in \nSan Diego, died from wounds sustained during a firefight that occurred \non July 23, 2010. Petty Officer McNeley was serving in support of \nOperation Enduring Freedom in Logar Province, Afghanistan. He was 30 \nyears old.\n  A native of Wheat Ridge, CO, Petty Officer McNeley enlisted in the \nNavy in 2001, following in his father's footsteps. Although his initial \nterm of service had already finished, Petty Officer McNeley decided to \nstay in the Navy and continue to serve his country.\n  During over 9 years of service, Petty Officer McNeley distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any challenge--no matter how dangerous. Commanders recognized \nhis extraordinary bravery and talent. They described him with the words \n``hardworking'' and ``dedicated,'' and noted that he regularly \nvolunteered for hazardous duty.\n  Petty Officer McNeley worked on the front lines of battle, serving in \nthe most dangerous areas of Afghanistan. He is remembered by those who \nknew him as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to \nexcellence. His family remembers him as a dedicated father, who loved \nto serve his country. Friends and neighbors remember him as a \nmotorcycle enthusiast with undeniable charisma. He even traded pen pal \nletters with students from an elementary school in Arizona, where he \nused to live.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Petty \nOfficer McNeley's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Petty Officer McNeley will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Petty Officer McNeley's entire family, I cannot imagine the sorrow \nyou must be feeling. I hope that, in time, the pain of your loss will \nbe eased by your pride in Justin's service and by your knowledge that \nhis country will never forget him. We are humbled by his service and \nhis sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6642-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PRESIDENT CALVIN COOLIDGE MUSEUM AND EDUCATION CENTER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to call the \nSenate's attention to the imminent opening of the new President Calvin \nCoolidge Museum and Education Center, a wonderful year-round tribute to \nPresident Coolidge, located in the graceful and historic setting of the \nPresident's home town of Plymouth Notch, VT. The center's formal \nopening and dedication ceremony will take place next weekend, on August \n7.\n  Calvin Coolidge, our 30th President, remains the only President born, \nsworn into office and buried in the State of Vermont. President \nCoolidge was originally elected to the Vice Presidency in 1920, winning \nthat election alongside Warren G. Harding.\n  Three years into President Harding's first term, then-Vice President \nCoolidge received an unexpected messenger one evening while he was \nvacationing at his family's home in Plymouth Notch. The messenger \ninformed him of President Harding's sudden and untimely death. It was \nat 2:47 the next morning that Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as \nPresident, in the parlor of his family home, alongside his wife Grace \nCoolidge, a capable and respected First Lady and a leading Vermonter in \nher own right. The oath of office was administered by President \nCoolidge's father, a State notary public official, by the light of a \nkerosene lamp. The new President left for Washington the next morning \nto assume the burdens of his new office.\n  President Coolidge was always known as a man of few words--the \ninspiration for his famous nickname, Silent Cal. Stoic in the New \nEngland tradition, President Coolidge also was an eloquent speaker who \nfelt an obligation to communicate often with the American people to \nexplain his policies.\n  Today, the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation is dedicated to \npreserving the Nation's memory of Calvin Coolidge. Founded in 1960, the \nfoundation is now celebrating its 50th year. By working closely with \nthe Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, the Coolidge Foundation \ncollects and preserves artifacts and resources related to the \nPresident. Many of the buildings within the village have become State-\nowned historical properties, and Plymouth Notch has been named the \nbest-preserved Presidential site in the Nation. The development of the \nnew museum and education center--solid and useful in the Yankee \ntradition--will expand the accessibility of these archives to the \npublic, while providing a venue for students to learn about their \ncountry's history.\n  We Vermonters take pride in our history and heritage, and we feel the \nobligations of stewardship in these things. The Calvin Coolidge \nMemorial Foundation is faithfully tending to the preservation and \ndissemination of this part of Vermont's legacy and our country's \nhistory. It is my pleasure to congratulate the Calvin Coolidge Memorial \nFoundation, in partnership with the State of Vermont, on the occasion \nof the commemoration and dedication of the President Calvin Coolidge \nMuseum and Education Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6642-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6642-S6643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MIKOLE BEDE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, a good measure of the strength of a \ncommunity is how they come together in a crisis. From June 4 to June \n18, 2010, Fremont County, WY, experienced a 100-year flood. The spring \nrunoff from the snowpack in the Wind River Mountains was heavier than \nusual, causing the Big Wind, Little Wind and Popo Agie Rivers to reach \nflood stages. Just when the citizens didn't think it could get worse, a \ncold front passed through, with rain and hail in lower elevations, and \nthree to 6 feet of snow in the mountains. Lander, Riverton, Hudson, and \nthe Wind River Indian Reservation were all threatened.\n  As the flood waters rose, the Fremont County commissioners led by \nChairman Doug Thompson and Vice Chairman Pat Hickerson along with the \nJoint Tribal Councils chaired by Ivan Posey and Harvey Spoonhunter came \ntogether to request a disaster designation from Wyoming's Governor Dave \nFreudenthal.\n  As the 32 square miles of Fremont County were threatened by flood, \nthe citizens rolled up their sleeves and worked together to protect \nlife, livestock, and property. Under the steady guidance of incident \ncommander, Craig Haslam, along with Joe Moore from Wyoming Homeland \nSecurity, 52 local, county, State and Federal agencies coordinated \nflood mitigation efforts. According to Fremont County resident Bill \nSniffin, it was the biggest disaster effort of its type in Wyoming's \nhistory.\n  It was inspiring to see Wyoming's National Guard working side-by-side \nwith the Fremont County folks. The 400 soldiers, under the command of \nGeneral Edward Wright and Colonel Luke Reiner, bagged sand, transported \nfolks from houses, and were at the ready for whatever the community \nneeded. Christian Venhuizen, at the Wyoming National Guard Public \nAffairs, served as information officer keeping the public and media \ninformed throughout the entire flood.\n  Kathi Metzler, director of Fremont County Emergency Management, and \nher assistant Vonda Huish opened a temporary office so they could \nmanage the logistics that is part and parcel with coordinating so many \ndifferent agencies. It was comforting having Kathi and Vonda close by \nto orchestrate the flurry of activity.\n  We can only estimate the number of hours volunteers devoted to \nkeeping the flood waters at bay. Some estimate 35,000 hours, others say \nit might be up to 50,000 hours. Almost a half million sandbags were \nfilled. Folks donated their pickups and trailers to haul property and \nlivestock to higher ground. This is quite an investment for a county \nwith only 36,000 people.\n  While the help of the government agencies was so important, neighbors \nhelping neighbors kept damage to a minimum. Jim Buline and his son \nRobert, Lee Hansen and his son Jace, Travis Becker and his son Lars are \na few of the many neighbors and friends who helped Charlie and Linda \nGriffin save their home on their historic ranch. Students from Wyoming \nCatholic College devoted all their time to help anyone in need. Jeri \nTrebelock and her staff from the Popo Agie Conservation District \norganized and worked with volunteers for bank stabilization to protect \nthe Hunhke and Guschewsky homes as well as a mobile home park. In \naddition, all the Popo Estates landowners came together helping each \nother with sandbagging to protect their homes. These are just a few \nexamples of the community spirit demonstrated by the folks in Fremont \nCounty.\n  On Thursday, August 5, 2010, folks from Fremont County will gather at \nMr. D's Grocery Store for a ``We Survived the Flood of 2010'' party. I \nask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the citizens of Fremont \nCounty and the 52 local, State, and Federal agencies for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6644-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING JOE REBER\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great \nMontanan who led a remarkable life. Joe Reber was deeply involved in \npublic service and the communities he called home in Montana; he passed \naway on July 23 at the age of 91. Joe lived life to the fullest and I \nfeel lucky to have had him as a dear friend for so long.\n  Joe was born in Butte in 1919. He grew up in a working class family \nand is a great symbol of the Montana spirit of hard work and overcoming \nadversity. His first job as a youngster was selling newspapers on the \nstreet in Butte to help support his family. Although Joe never finished \nhigh school or went to college, he was a successful businessman and \ncommunity leader whose experiences gave him many stories to tell over \nhis 91 colorful years.\n  Joe served his country honorably during World War II. He volunteered \nin the Merchant Marine and the Coast Guard, serving as a staff officer \nin the Pacific theater.\n  Despite his humble upbringing in the Mining City, Joe became a \nsuccessful entrepreneur. He started his own plumbing company in Helena, \nwhich he later expanded into electrical and general construction. He \nthen went on to form the Reber Realty and Development Company and the \nCapitol Wholesale Plumbing Supply Company, among other businesses he \nowned. Even with all this success Joe never forgot his working class \nroots, growing up the son of a miner in Butte.\n  Joe was very active in public service on a local and national level. \nHe served as treasurer for the Montana Democratic Party, was a State \nsenator, was chairman of the Montana Board of Natural Resources, served \non the State Board of Investments, and was a delegate to a United \nNations World Food Program conference. One of his proudest \naccomplishments was passing legislation in the State legislature that \ncreated a vocational education program. Joe recognized the importance \nof education and knew how vital the program would be for economic \ndevelopment and to provide meaningful opportunities for young people \nacross Montana.\n  Over the years Joe got to know and befriend some very important \nfolks. He hosted John F. Kennedy at his Helena home during the 1960 \nPresidential campaign. He also accompanied Ted Kennedy at the Eastern \nMontana Fair in Miles City in 1960 where Ted took his famous ride on a \nbronc. He met many other Presidents, dignitaries, and celebrities along \nthe way. These and many other stories are recounted in Joe's \nautobiography, ``The Paperboy,'' which he published in 2007.\n  Joe shared his experiences with his wife of 37 years, Rosalyn, who \npassed away in May. Today I send my heartfelt condolences to Joe's \nchildren--Joe, Bobbie, Dianna, Bryant, and Susie--and the entire Reber \nfamily for their loss. They can truly be proud of the life their father \nlived and take comfort in knowing that he helped so many others along \nthe way.\n  I have always enjoyed visiting with Joe over the years and working \nwith him on issues important to Montana. I will miss his friendship as \nwill folks all across Big Sky country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6644-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6644-S6645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. ROBERT A. CARTLIDGE\n\n Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, every so often, in the pantheon of \nscientific achievement, there comes an individual with both the \nintellect and the drive to further the course of scientific thought, an \nindividual of extraordinary abilities, a truly original mind, which not \nonly contributes to the work of modern science, but steps to the \nforefront and blazes a trail for others to follow.\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n  I wish to recognize and honor the contributions of one such person, \none of the select fine minds who possesses the drive, determination, \nand the extraordinary ability to continually explore and challenge the \nlimits of scientific knowledge.\n  Today I am proud to recognize the important work and achievements of \nDr. Robert A. Cartlidge.\n  Dr. Cartlidge is a leader in the fields of biology, biochemistry, and \ngenetics. He is a brilliant scholar, laboratory researcher, and \neducator.\n  But most important, he has dedicated himself to the advancement and \neducation of others in his field, and he continues to pave the way for \nfuture innovators in biological science to carry the torch even \nfurther.\n  Dr. Cartlidge was educated at one of the most prestigious and well-\nrespected institutions in the world, the University of Cambridge. \nFollowing his undergraduate work, which was marked by academic \nachievement, he was invited by the university's academic administration \nto receive an honorary master's degree in Natural Sciences, joining \nranks with some of the greatest minds in science.\n  Robert Cartlidge was then singled out by the Wellcome Trust, a global \ncharity dedicated to supporting the brightest minds in biomedical \nresearch and the medical humanities, to receive a significant and \nnationally recognized academic award in Scotland: the prestigious \nWellcome Trust PhD Programme.\n  From there, he embarked on a career dedicated to cancer research to \nfocus on unlocking the complexities of this deadly and indiscriminate \ndisease.\n  Dr. Cartlidge's innovative findings have been published in leading \ninternational scientific and academic journals and have been the basis \nfor scientists who have come after him, learning from his publications, \nbuilding upon his work, and advancing the causes of science ever \nfurther.\n  The scientific research tools Dr. Cartlidge has created have since \nbeen developed into commercial products, and his novel cell system \ncontinues to find use in laboratories and universities across the \nUnited States and Canada.\n  By themselves, any of these accomplishments would be worthy of \nrecognition. But Dr. Cartlidge, for all of his extraordinary ability, \nwas not content merely to shut himself in the laboratory and seek \nadvances on his own. Instead, he devoted himself to education and \ncollaboration, working with students and institutions all over the \nworld to broaden his field of his expertise.\n  Across the reaches of three continents, he has taught, judged, \nlectured, assessed performance, or designed courses for innumerable \nfellow scientists, peers, educators, and medical students.\n  And in so doing, Dr. Cartlidge has broadened America's scientific \ninfluence, encouraged ingenuity across the globe, and reaffirmed the \ninnovative spirit that will lead our country to a prosperous future.\n  Dr. Cartlidge seized upon the opportunity to join his natural \nintellect with a world-class education and quickly distinguished \nhimself as a singular figure in modern science.\n  His is an extraordinary ability, the likes of which are rarely seen \nin this or any other field. We are all grateful that he has dedicated \nhimself to such a selfless career in this, most dynamic and innovative \nof nations.\n  I commend Dr. Cartlidge for his extraordinary contributions to \nscience. I celebrate his role in expanding scientific knowledge across \nthe globe. And I thank him for his selfless commitment to the education \nof other professionals in his field, both in the United States and \nacross the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6645-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAITH, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to prohibit the conducting of invasive research on \ngreat apes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nend the use of Great Apes in invasive research and urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support the Great Ape Protection Act.\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n  The Great Ape Protection Act would prohibit invasive research on all \nGreat Apes, including chimpanzees--the only Great Ape used in invasive \nresearch today. The bill would require the retirement of 500 federally-\nowned chimpanzees to appropriate sanctuaries.\n  Today about 1,000 chimpanzees--half of them federally owned--languish \nat great taxpayer expense in 6 research laboratories across the nation.\n  These chimpanzees are being held or used for invasive biomedical \nresearch, research that may cause death, bodily injury, pain, distress, \nfear, and trauma. Invasive research practices include techniques such \nas injecting a chimpanzee with a drug that would be detrimental to its \nhealth, infecting a chimp with a disease, cutting a chimp or removing \nbody parts, and isolation or social deprivation.\n  The vast majority of these animals--between 80 and 90 percent--aren't \nactually being used in research, but instead are warehoused, simply \nwasting away in these facilities. For example, approximately half of \nthe government-owned chimpanzees have been held for the past 9 years in \na facility in New Mexico where no research is being conducted.\n  Some chimpanzees have been in labs for more than 50 years, confined \nin steel cages for most of their lives and enduring sometimes painful \nand distressing experimental procedures.\n  The fact that the vast majority of federally-owned chimpanzees are \nnot being used in active research, but instead are warehoused in labs \nat the taxpayer expense, underlines the futility of their continued \nconfinement.\n  Chimpanzees are poor research models for human illness, and they have \nbeen of limited use in the study of human disease. Despite how similar \nthey are to us, significant differences in their immunology and disease \nprogression make them ineffective models for human diseases like HIV, \ncancer and heart disease research.\n  For example, research published in the Journal of Medical Primatology \nin 2009 on Hepatitis C indicates that use of chimpanzees has produced \npoor results. And the National Center for Research Resources under the \nNational Institutes of Health has prohibited breeding of government-\nowned and supported chimpanzees for research.\n  Significant genetic and physiological differences between nonhuman \nGreat Apes and humans also make chimpanzees a poor research model for \nhuman diseases. We have spent millions of dollars over several decades \non chimpanzee-based HIV and Hepatitis C research with no resulting \nvaccines for those diseases. Chimpanzees largely failed as a model for \nHIV because the virus does not cause illness in chimpanzees as it does \nto humans.\n  These are very social, highly intelligent animals--with the ability, \nfor example, to learn American Sign Language. Their intelligence and \nability to experience emotions so similar to humans underscore how \nchimpanzees suffer intensely under laboratory conditions.\n  Their psychological suffering in laboratories produces human-like \nsymptoms of stress, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder after \ndecades of living in isolation in small cages.\n  Given their social nature and capacity for suffering and boredom due \nto lack of stimulation, the 500 privately-owned chimpanzees and 500 \nfederally-owned chimpanzees being held in research laboratories would \nbe significantly better off in sanctuaries. And by doing so we would \nsave more than $170 million taxpayer dollars throughout the \nchimpanzees' lifetimes. This is because the cost of caring for a \nchimpanzee in a sanctuary is a fraction of the cost of their housing \nand maintenance in a laboratory. And many in the scientific community \nbelieve this money could be allocated to more effective research.\n  In my home State of Washington, I am proud that we have Chimpanzee \nSanctuary Northwest. Chimpanzee-Sanctuary Northwest provides \nsustainable sanctuary for seven chimpanzees retired in 2008 from \ndecades in research facilities.\n  The United States is currently behind the rest of the world in \noutlawing this sad practice.\n  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, \nSweden, and the United Kingdom have all banned or severely limited \nexperiments on Great Apes. And several other countries and the European \nUnion are considering similar bans as well.\n  We are the only country--besides Gabon in West Africa--that is still \nholding or using chimpanzees for invasive research. It's past time for \nthe United States to catch up with the rest of the world by ending this \nantiquated use of this endangered species.\n  We are lagging behind in action, but the desire to end invasive \nresearch on Great Apes has been present for more than a decade. In \n1997, the National Research Council concluded that there should be a \nmoratorium on further chimpanzee breeding. And the National Institutes \nof Health, NIH, has already announced an end to funding for the \nbreeding of federally-owned and supported chimpanzees for research, but \nthis should be codified.\n  Government needs to take action to make invasive research on \nchimpanzees illegal.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Bipartisan Great Ape \nProtection Act, along with my colleagues Senators Susan Collins of \nMaine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n  The Great Ape Protection Act is a common-sense policy reform to \nprotect our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom from \nphysical and psychological harm, and to help reduce government spending \nand our federal deficit.\n  Specifically, this bill will phase out the use of chimpanzees in \ninvasive research over a three-year period, require permanent \nretirement to suitable sanctuaries for the 500 federally-owned \nchimpanzees currently being warehoused in research laboratories, and \ncodifies the current administrative ban on breeding of Government-owned \nand supported chimpanzees.\n  We have been delaying this action for too long. It is time to get \nthis done and end this type of harmful research and end this wasteful \nGovernment spending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 3696. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act with regard to \ncertain exemptions under that Act for direct care workers and to \nimprove the systems for the collection and reporting of data relating \nto the direct care workforce, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Direct Care \nWorkforce Empowerment Act.\n  Next year the baby boom generation will start turning 65 and by 2030, \nall 78 million will have reached that age. We must ensure this \ngeneration that fought in our wars, worked in our factories, taught our \nchildren and who gave us life and love are cared for. This will require \nan investment in the health care workforce that was begun under health \ncare reform and must continue into the coming decades.\n  It is the direct care worker that provides most of this care to our \nloved ones. Unfortunately, they are often not given the respect they \ndeserve for the work they do. Direct care workers help more than \n250,000 Pennsylvanians and their families every day. This is also one \nof the fastest growing professions, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. It is now our responsibility to make sure these jobs, while \noften personally rewarding, provide opportunity for advancement and \neconomic stability for the workers.\n  This bill will do three key things.\n  The bill will ensure that home care workers receive the Federal \nminimum wage and overtime protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act; \nimprove Federal and State data collection and oversight with respect to \nthe direct care workforce; and establish a grant program to help states \nimprove direct care worker recruitment, retention, and training.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6653-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6653-S6654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 605--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 13, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL \n                     CELIAC DISEASE AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n\n\n                              S. Res. 605\n\n       Whereas celiac disease affects approximately 1 in every 130 \n     people in the United States, for a total of 3,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the majority of people with celiac disease have yet \n     to be diagnosed;\n       Whereas celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder \n     that is classified as both an autoimmune condition and a \n     genetic condition;\n       Whereas celiac disease causes damage to the lining of the \n     small intestine, which results in overall malnutrition;\n       Whereas when a person with celiac disease consumes foods \n     that contain certain protein fractions, that person suffers a \n     cell-mediated immune response that damages the villi of the \n     small intestine, interfering with the absorption of nutrients \n     in food and the effectiveness of medications;\n       Whereas such problematic protein fractions are found in \n     wheat, barley, rye, and oats, which are used to produce many \n     foods, medications, and vitamins;\n       Whereas because celiac disease is a genetic disease, there \n     is an increased incidence of celiac disease in families with \n     a known history of celiac disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is underdiagnosed because the \n     symptoms can be attributed to other conditions and are easily \n     overlooked by doctors and patients;\n       Whereas as recently as 2000, the average person with celiac \n     disease waited 11 years for a correct diagnosis;\n       Whereas 1/2 of all people with celiac disease do not show \n     symptoms of the disease;\n       Whereas celiac disease is diagnosed by tests that measure \n     the blood for abnormally high levels of the antibodies of \n     immunoglobulin A, anti-tissue transglutaminase, and IgA anti-\n     endomysium antibodies;\n       Whereas celiac disease can be treated only by implementing \n     a diet free of wheat, barley, rye, and oats, often called a \n     ``gluten-free diet'';\n       Whereas a delay in the diagnosis of celiac disease can \n     result in damage to the small intestine, which leads to an \n     increased risk for malnutrition, anemia, lymphoma, \n     adenocarcinoma, osteoporosis, miscarriage, congenital \n     malformation, short stature, and disorders of skin and other \n     organs;\n       Whereas celiac disease is linked to many autoimmune \n     disorders, including thyroid disease, systemic lupus \n     erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, liver disease, collagen \n     vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren's \n     syndrome;\n       Whereas the connection between celiac disease and diet was \n     first established by Dr. Samuel Gee, who wrote, ``if the \n     patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet'';\n       Whereas Dr. Samuel Gee was born on September 13, 1839; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 13, 2010, as ``National Celiac \n     Disease Awareness Day'';\n       (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should \n     become more informed and aware of celiac disease;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Celiac Disease Awareness Day with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities; and\n       (4) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Celiac Sprue \n     Association, the American Celiac Society, and the Celiac \n     Disease Foundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6654-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4582.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The nonmedical use of prescription drugs is a growing \n     problem in the United States, particularly among teenagers.\n       (2) According to the Department of Justice's 2009 National \n     Prescription Drug Threat Assessment--\n       (A) the number of deaths and treatment admissions for \n     controlled prescription drugs (CPDs) has increased \n     significantly in recent years;\n       (B) unintentional overdose deaths involving prescription \n     opioids, for example, increased 114 percent from 2001 to \n     2005, and the number of treatment admissions for prescription \n     opioids increased 74 percent from 2002 to 2006; and\n       (C) violent crime and property crime associated with abuse \n     and diversion of CPDs has increased in all regions of the \n     United States over the past 5 years.\n       (3) According to the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy's 2008 Report ``Prescription for Danger'', \n     prescription drug abuse is especially on the rise for teens--\n       (A) one-third of all new abusers of prescription drugs in \n     2006 were 12- to 17-year-olds;\n       (B) teens abuse prescription drugs more than any illicit \n     drug except marijuana--more than cocaine, heroin, and \n     methamphetamine combined; and\n       (C) responsible adults are in a unique position to reduce \n     teen access to prescription drugs because the drugs often are \n     found in the home.\n       (4)(A) Many State and local law enforcement agencies have \n     established drug disposal programs (often called ``take-\n     back'' programs) to facilitate the collection and destruction \n     of unused, unwanted, or expired medications. These programs \n     help get outdated or unused medications off household shelves \n     and out of the reach of children and teenagers.\n       (B) However, take-back programs often cannot dispose of the \n     most dangerous pharmaceutical drugs--controlled substance \n     medications--because Federal law does not permit take-back \n     programs to accept controlled substances unless they get \n     specific permission from the Drug Enforcement Administration \n     and arrange for full-time law enforcement officers to receive \n     the controlled substances directly from the member of the \n     public who seeks to dispose of them.\n       (C) Individuals seeking to reduce the amount of unwanted \n     controlled substances in their household consequently have \n     few disposal options beyond discarding or flushing the \n     substances, which may not be appropriate means of disposing \n     of the substances.\n       (D) Long-term care facilities face a distinct set of \n     obstacles to the safe disposal of controlled substances due \n     to the increased volume of controlled substances they handle.\n       (5) This Act gives the Attorney General authority to \n     promulgate new regulations, within the framework of the \n     Controlled Substances Act, that will allow patients to \n     deliver unused pharmaceutical controlled substances to \n     appropriate entities for disposal in a safe and effective \n     manner consistent with effective controls against diversion.\n       (6) The goal of this Act is to encourage the Attorney \n     General to set controlled substance diversion prevention \n     parameters that will allow public and private entities to \n     develop a variety of methods of collection and disposal of \n     controlled substances in a secure and responsible manner.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session to hear the Kagan nomination.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. He is always \nvery courteous to me.\n  Mr. President, I rise to take a few minutes to discuss the reasons \nwhy I am voting against Elena Kagan to be Associate Justice. An \nappointment to the Supreme Court is one of the most important positions \nan individual can hold under our Constitution. It is a lifetime \nposition on the highest Court of the land. I take very seriously my \nconstitutional role of advice and consent. The Senate's job is not only \nto provide advice and consent by confirming nominees who are \nintelligent and accomplished. Our job is to confirm nominees who will \nbe fair and impartial judges, individuals who truly understand the \nproper role of a Justice in our system of government. Our job, then, is \nto confirm nominees who will faithfully interpret the law and the \nConstitution without personal bias or prejudice.\n  When the Senate makes its determination, we must carefully assess the \nnominee's legal experiences, record of impartiality, and commitment to \nthe Constitution and rule of law. We need to assess whether the nominee \nwill be able to exercise what we call judicial restraint. We have to \ndetermine if the nominee can resist the siren call to overstep his or \nher bounds and encroach upon the duties of the legislative and \nexecutive branches. Fundamental to the U.S. Constitution are the \nconcepts of these checks and balances and the principle of separation \nof powers. The preservation of our individual freedoms actually depends \non restricting the role of policymaking to legislatures rather than \nallowing unelected judges with lifetime appointments to craft law and \nsocial policy from the judicial bench. The Constitution constrains the \njudiciary as much as it constrains the legislative branch and the \nexecutive branch under the President.\n  When President Obama spoke about the criteria by which he would \nselect his judicial nominees, he placed a very high premium on a \njudge's ability to have, in his words, ``empathy when deciding the hard \ncases.'' This empathy standard glorifies the use of a judge's heart and \nbroader vision of what America should be in the judicial process. He \nsaid that individuals he would nominate to the Federal judiciary would \nhave ``a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of \nAmerican people.'' So when President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to the \nSupreme Court, we have to assume he believed she met his ``empathy'' \nstandard.\n\n  This empathy standard is a radical departure from our American \ntradition of blind, impartial justice. That is because empathy \nnecessarily connotes a standard of partiality. A judge's impartiality \nis absolutely critical to his or her duty as an officer of an \nindependent judiciary, so much so that it is actually mentioned three \ntimes in the oath of office that judges take.\n  Empathetic judges who choose to embrace their personal biases cannot \nuphold their sworn oath under our Constitution. Rather, judges must \nreject that standard and decide cases before them as the Constitution \nand the law requires, even if it compels a result that is at odds with \ntheir own political or ideological beliefs.\n  Justice is not an automatic or a mechanical process. Yet it should \nnot be a process that permits inconsistent outcomes determined by a \njudge's personal predilections rather than from the Constitution and \nthe law. An empathy standard set by the President that encourages a \njudge to pick winners and losers based on that judge's personal or \npolitical beliefs is contrary to the American tradition of justice.\n  That is why we should be very cautious in deferring to President \nObama's choices for the judicial branch. He set that standard; we did \nnot. We should carefully evaluate these nominees' ability to be \nfaithful to the Constitution. Nominees should not pledge allegiance to \nthe goals of a particular political party or outside interest groups \nthat hope to implement their political and social agendas from the \nbench rather than getting it done through the legislative branch.\n  When she was nominated to the Supreme Court, meaning Ms. Elena Kagan, \nVice President Biden's Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, assured the leftwing \ngroups that they had nothing to worry about in Elena Kagan because she \nis, in his words, ``clearly a legal progressive.'' So it is pretty safe \nto say that President Obama was true to his promise to pick an \nindividual who likely would rule in accordance with these groups' \nwishes. A Justice should not be a member of someone's team working to \nachieve a preferred policy result on the Supreme Court. The only team a \nJustice of the Supreme Court should be on is the team of the \nConstitution and the law.\n  I have said on prior occasions that I do not believe judicial \nexperience is an absolute prerequisite for serving as a judge. There \nhave been dozens of people, maybe close to 40, who have been appointed \nto the Supreme Court who have not had that experience. Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan, however, has no judicial experience and has very limited \nexperience as a practicing attorney.\n  Unlike with a judge or even a practicing lawyer, we do not have any \nconcrete examples of her judicial method in action. Thus, the Senate's \njob of advice and consent is much more difficult. We do not have any \nclear substantive evidence to demonstrate Solicitor General Kagan's \nability to transition from a legal academic and political operative to \na fair and impartial jurist.\n  Solicitor General Kagan's record and her Judiciary Committee \ntestimony failed to persuade me that she would be capable of making \nthis crucial transformation. Her experience has primarily been in \npolitics and academia. As has been pointed out, working in politics \ndoes not disqualify an individual from being a Justice. However, what \ndoes disqualify an individual is an inability to put politics aside in \norder to rule based upon the Constitution and the law. In my opinion, \nGeneral Kagan did not demonstrate that she could do that during her \ncommittee testimony. Moreover, throughout her hearings, she refused to \nprovide us with details on her views on constitutional issues.\n  It was very unfortunate we were unable to elicit forthcoming answers \nto many of our questions in an attempt to assess her ability to wear \nthe judicial robe. She was not forthright in discussing her views on \nbasic principles of constitutional law, her opinions of important \nSupreme Court cases or personal beliefs on a number of legal issues. \nThis was extremely disappointing.\n  Candid answers to our questions were essential for us as Senators to \nbe able to ascertain whether she possesses the proper judicial \nphilosophy for the Supreme Court. In fact, her unwillingness to \ndirectly answer questions about her judicial philosophy indicated a \npolitical approach throughout the hearing. I was left with no evidence \nthat General Kagan would not advance her own political ideas if she is \nconfirmed to the Federal bench.\n  General Kagan's refusal to engage in meaningful discussion with us \nwas particularly disappointing because of her position in a 1995 Law \nReview Article entitled ``Confirmation Messes, Old and New.'' In that \narticle she wrote--and she was then Chicago Law Professor Kagan--that \nit was imperative that the Senate ask about, and the Supreme Court \nnominees discuss, their judicial philosophy and substantive views on \nissues of constitutional law. Specifically, then-Professor Kagan wrote:\n\n       When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful \n     discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on \n     an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable \n     of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately \n     educating the public.\n\n  That is in Professor Kagan's own words.\n  Bottom line, General Kagan did not live up to her own standard. She \nwas nonresponsive to many of our questions. She backed away from prior \npositions and statements. She refused to discuss the judicial \nphilosophy of sitting judges.\n  When asked about her opinions on constitutional issues or Supreme \nCourt\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\ndecisions, she either declined to answer or engaged in an overview of \nthe status of the law rather than a discussion of her own personal \nviews. Because of her shallow record on the issues, this approach to \nthe hearing was extremely troubling.\n  At her confirmation hearing, General Kagan told us to ``look to [her] \nwhole life for indications of what kind of judge or Justice [she] would \nbe.'' Well, General Kagan's record has not been a model of \nimpartiality, as we looked at her record and her life just as she asked \nus to. There is no question that throughout her career she has shown a \nstrong commitment to far-left ideological beliefs. Solicitor General \nKagan's upbringing steeped her in deeply held liberal principles that \nat one point she stated she had ``retained . . . fairly intact to this \ndate.'' Her jobs have generally never required her to put aside her \npolitical beliefs, and she has never seen fit to do so. Her first \ninstinct and the instincts she has relied upon throughout her career \nare her liberal, progressive political instincts put to work for \nliberal, progressive political goals. I have no evidence that if \nSolicitor General Kagan were confirmed to the Supreme Court she would \nchange her political ways or check her political instincts or goals at \nthe courthouse door.\n  In fact, General Kagan gained her legal expertise by working in \npolitics. She started out by working on Congresswoman Liz Holtzman's \nSenate campaign, hoping for, in her words, a ``more leftist left.'' She \nalso worked as a volunteer in Michael Dukakis's Presidential run. The \nDukakis campaign wisely put her to work at a task that is political to \nthe core--opposition research. There she found a place where she was \nencouraged to use her political savvy and make decisions based upon her \nliberal, progressive ideology.\n  Moreover, while clerking for Justice Marshall, General Kagan's \nliberal personal convictions--rather than the Constitution and the \nlaw--seemed to be her ultimate guide when analyzing cases. General \nKagan consistently relied on her political instincts when advising \nJustice Marshall, channeling and ultimately completely embracing his \nphilosophy of ``do[ing] what you think is right and let[ting] the law \ncatch up.'' Her Marshall memos clearly indicate a liberal and outcome-\nbased approach to her legal analysis.\n  In several of her memos, it is apparent she had a difficult time \nseparating her deeply held liberal views and political beliefs from the \nlaw. For example, in one case she advised Justice Marshall to deny \ncertiorari because the Court might make ``some very bad law on \nabortion.'' In another case, she was ``not sympathetic'' that an \nindividual's constitutional right to keep and bear arms had been \nviolated. In essence, her judicial philosophy was a very political one.\n  During her tenure at the White House, Solicitor General Kagan worked \non a number of highly controversial issues, such as abortion, gun \nrights, campaign finance reform, and the Whitewater and Paula Jones \nscandals. She herself described her work for President Clinton as being \nprimarily political in nature.\n  In a 2007 speech, she said:\n\n       During most of the time I spent at the White House, I did \n     not serve as an attorney, I was instead a policy adviser. . . \n     . It was part of my job not to give legal advice, but to \n     choose when and how to ask for it.\n\n  Her documents from the Clinton Library prove just that. She \nforcefully promoted far-left positions and offered analyses and \nrecommendations that were far more political than legal in nature. For \nexample, during the Clinton administration, General Kagan was \ninstrumental in leading the fight to keep partial-birth abortion on the \nbooks. Documents show that she boldly inserted her own political \nbeliefs in the place of science. Specifically, she redrafted language \nfor a nonpartisan medical group to override scientific findings against \npartial-birth abortion in favor of her own extreme views. Despite the \nlack of scientific studies showing that partial-birth abortion was \nnever necessary and her own knowledge that ``there aren't many [cases] \nwhere use of the partial-birth abortion is the least risky, let alone \nthe `necessary,' approach,'' Solicitor General Kagan had no problem \nintervening with the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists to change their own policy statement.\n  After her intervention, this doctor group's statement no longer \naccurately reflected the medically supported position of the \nobstetricians and gynecologists. Rather, the group's statement now said \nthat partial-birth abortions should be available if the procedure might \naffect the mother's physical, emotional or psychological well-being. \nThe reality is that General Kagan's change was not a mere \nclarification. It was, in fact, a complete reversal of the medical \ncommunity's original statement.\n  Other documents show that Solicitor General Kagan also lobbied the \nAmerican Medical Association to change a statement it had issued on \npartial-birth abortion. These documents demonstrated her ``willingness \nto manipulate medical science to fit the Democratic Party's political \nagenda on a hot button issue of abortion.''\n  During her hearing, General Kagan refused to admit she participated \nin the decisionmaking process of what language the gynecologists would \nuse in their statement on partial-birth abortion. The documents present \na very different picture. Although she stated that there was ``no way \nshe could have intervened with the ACOG,'' she did exactly that. \nInstead of responding to a legitimate inquiry in an open and honest \nmanner, she deflected the question and gave, at best, nonresponsive \nanswers.\n  In addition, Solicitor General Kagan worked on a number of \ninitiatives to undermine second amendment rights. She was front and \ncenter of the Clinton administration's anti-second amendment agenda. \nShe collaborated closely with Jose Cerda on the administration's plan \nto ban guns by ``taking the law and bending it as far as we can to \ncapture a whole new class of guns.'' After the Supreme Court in Printz \nv. U.S. found parts of the Brady antigun law to be unconstitutional, \nshe endeavored to find legislative and executive branch responses to \ndeny citizens' second amendment rights.\n  Even in academia, Solicitor General Kagan took steps and positions \nthat were based on her strongly held personal beliefs rather than an \nevenhanded reading of the law. As dean of Harvard Law School, she \nactively defied Federal law by banning military recruiters from campus \nwhile the Nation was at war. Prior to her appointment as dean, the \nDepartment of Defense had made clear to Harvard that the school's \nprevious recruitment policy was not in compliance with the Solomon \nAmendment, so Harvard did what Harvard should have done: changed its \npolicy to abide by the Federal law. But when the Third Circuit, which \ndoes not include Massachusetts, ruled on the issue, then-Dean Kagan \nimmediately reinstituted the policy barring the military from the \nHarvard campus. She took this position because she personally believed \nthe military's longstanding policy of don't ask, don't tell, in her \nwords, was ``a profound wrong--a moral injustice of the first order.'' \nShe claimed her policy was equal treatment. However, the Air Force \nbelieved the policy was playing games with its ability to recruit. The \nArmy believed the policy resulted in it being stonewalled. Then-Dean \nKagan was entitled to her opinion, but--no different than anybody else \nin this country--she was not free to ignore the law. The Solomon \nAmendment required that military recruiters be allowed equal access to \nthe university as any other recruiter.\n  The bottom line is that then-Dean Kagan refused to follow the law and \ninstead interpreted that law in accordance with her personal beliefs. \nThe Supreme Court unanimously rejected her legal position on the \nSolomon Amendment and upheld our military.\n  I am concerned that Solicitor General Kagan will continue to use her \npersonal politics and ideology to drive her legal philosophy if she is \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court, particularly since her record shows she \nhas worked to bend the law to fit her political wishes.\n  Further, I am concerned with the praise Solicitor General Kagan has \nlavished on liberal jurors who promote activist philosophies such as \nthose of Israeli Judge Aharon Barak. Judge Barak is a major proponent \nof judicial activism who believes judges should ``bridge the gap \nbetween law and society.'' He also went on to say that we\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nought to use international law to advance a social and political agenda \non the bench.\n  At a Harvard law event attended by then-Dean Kagan, Judge Barak noted \nwith approval cases in which ``a judge carries out his role properly by \nignoring the prevalent social consensus and becoming a flag bearer of \nnew social consensus.'' When I asked General Kagan if she endorsed such \nan activist judicial philosophy, she replied that Judge Barak's \nphilosophy was something ``so different from any that we would use or \nwant to use in the United States.'' But that contradicts her previous \nstatement about Judge Barak that he is a ``great, great judge'' who \n``presided over the development of one of the most principled legal \nsystems in the world.'' I am not able to ascertain if Solicitor General \nKagan agrees with Judge Barak or if she rebukes his positions, so I am \nleft to believe she endorses the judicial method of what she calls her \n``judicial hero'' and his views on judicial restraint or lack thereof. \nI cannot support a Supreme Court nominee whose judicial philosophy \nendorses judicial activism as opposed to judicial restraint.\n  With respect to the second amendment, General Kagan testified that \nthe Heller and McDonald cases were binding precedent for the lower \ncourts and due all the respect of precedent. However, I worry that, if \nconfirmed, her deeply engrained personal belief will cause her to \noverturn this precedent because she does not personally agree with \nthose decisions or the constitutional right to bear arms. At the \nhearing, Solicitor General Kagan was unwilling to discuss her personal \nviews on the second amendment or whether she believes the right to bear \narms is what it is today--a fundamental right. When I asked her about \nher thoughts on the issue, she simply replied that she ``had never \nthought about it before.'' I also asked her whether she believed self-\ndefense was at the core of the second amendment. She could only \nrespond: ``I have never had the occasion to look into the history of \nthe matter.'' As a former constitutional law professor both at Chicago \nand Harvard, Solicitor General Kagan's response ought to be troubling \nto anybody who heard it.\n  A key theme in the U.S. Constitution reflects the important mandate \nof the Declaration of Independence. It is the recognition that the \nultimate authority of a legitimate government depends on the consent of \na free people, the ``consent of the governed.'' As Thomas Jefferson \nwrote:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, Governments are instituted among Men deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  As former Attorney General Edwin Meese explains:\n\n       That all men are created equal means that they are equally \n     endowed with unalienable rights. . . . Fundamental rights \n     exist by nature, prior to government and conventional laws. \n     It is because these individual rights are left unsecured that \n     governments are instituted among men.\n\n  So I am concerned that Elena Kagan refused to agree with my comments \nabout the Declaration of Independence--that there are such things as \ninalienable rights and if government does not give, government cannot \ntake away.\n  Similarly, Senator Coburn asked General Kagan if she agreed with \nWilliam Blackstone's assessment about the right to bear arms and use \nthose arms in self-defense. She replied:\n\n       I don't have a view on what are natural rights, independent \n     of the Constitution.\n\n  If you don't have a view about rights that existed before the \nConstitution was ever written, do you have the knowledge to be a \nSupreme Court Justice?\n  So this is concerning to me because, as one commentator stated:\n\n       A legal scholar with no take on such a fundamental \n     constitutional topic [of which individual rights qualify as \n     natural or inalien in character] seems at best disingenuous \n     and at worst, frightening. How can one effectively analyze \n     and apply the Constitution without a firm grip on what basic \n     freedoms underlie our founding documents and national social \n     compact? How can one effectively understand the original \n     intent of the Framers without any opinion on the essential \n     place of certain liberties within the American legal \n     framework?\n\n  Bottom line: The fact that General Kagan refused to answer our \nquestions about her personal opinions on the right to bear arms leads \nme to conclude that she does not believe people have a natural right of \nself-preservation, unrelated to the Constitution.\n  I am concerned about Solicitor General Kagan's views on our \nconstitutional right to bear arms not only because of her anti-second \namendment work during the Clinton administration but also in light of \nher memo in the Sandidge case when she clerked for Justice Marshall. In \nher memo, she summarily dismissed the petitioner's contention that the \nDistrict of Columbia's firearm statute violated his second amendment \nright to keep and bear arms. Instead of providing a serious basis for \nher recommendation to deny the certiorari, her entire legal analysis of \nthis fundamental right consisted of one sentence: ``I am not \nsympathetic.''\n  A further basis for my concerns about whether she will protect or \nundermine the second amendment if she is confirmed is the decision of \nthe Office of Solicitor General under her leadership not to even submit \na brief in the second amendment McDonald case. Solicitor General \nKagan's record clearly shows she is a supporter of restrictive gun laws \nand has worked on numerous initiatives to undercut second amendment \nfundamental rights. So, not surprisingly, as Solicitor General, she \ncould not find a compelling Federal interest for the United States to \nsubmit a brief in a case that dealt with fundamental rights and the \nsecond amendment of the Constitution. This was a case that everyone \nknew would have far-reaching effects. It is apparent that political \ncalculations and personal beliefs played a role in Solicitor General \nKagan's decision not to file a brief in this landmark case to ensure \nthat constitutional rights of American citizens were protected before \nthe Supreme Court.\n  With respect to the Constitution's commerce clause, Solicitor General \nKagan was asked whether she believed there are any limits to the power \nof the Federal Government over the individual rights of American \ncitizens.\n  Unfortunately, her response didn't assure me that, if confirmed, she \nwould ensure that any law Congress creates does not infringe on the \nconstitutional rights of our citizens. Specifically, Senator Coburn \nasked her whether she believed a law requiring individuals to eat three \nvegetables and three fruits a day violated the commerce clause. Though \npressed on this and other lines of questioning on the commerce clause, \nshe was unwilling to comment on what would represent appropriate limits \non Federal power under the Constitution--and probably the commerce \nclause has been used more than any specific power of Congress for \ngreater control of the Federal Government over State and local \ngovernments or over the economy and probably depriving individual \nrights in the process.\n  I am not sure Solicitor General Kagan understands that ours--meaning \nour government--is a limited government and that the restraints on the \nFederal Government's power are provided by the Constitution and the \nconcept of federalism upon which our Nation is founded. The powers of \nthe Federal Government are explicitly enumerated in article I, section \n8 of the Constitution. Further, the 10th amendment provides that the \npowers not expressly given to the Federal Government in the \nConstitution are reserved to the States.\n  The Founding Fathers envisioned that our government would be \nconstitutionally limited in protecting the fundamental rights of life, \nliberty, and property and that the laws and policies created by the \ngovernment would be subject to the limits established by the \nConstitution. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 45, ``The powers \ndelegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are \nfew and defined. Those which are to remain in the State government are \nnumerous and indefinite.''\n  I am not convinced the Solicitor General appreciates that there are \nexpress limits the Constitution places on the ability of Congress to \npass laws. I am not persuaded by her nonanswers to our commerce clause \nquestions that she won't be a rubberstamp for unconstitutional laws \nthat threaten an individual's personal freedoms.\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n  With respect to the institution of marriage, I am concerned with \nSolicitor General Kagan's ability to disregard her own personal beliefs \nin order to defend the Defense of Marriage Act. Under her supervision, \nthe United States filed a brief stating that ``the Administration does \nnot support DOMA as a matter of policy, believes that it is \ndiscriminatory, and supports its repeal.'' At the hearing, she refused \nto say whether this was an appropriate statement to make considering \nthat it is the duty of the Solicitor General to vigorously defend the \nlaws of the United States. How are we to believe she will uphold a law \nas a Supreme Court Justice when she disagrees with that law? When she \nwas tasked as the government's lawyer to vigorously defend the law, \nclearly she put her personal politics and beliefs first. It is obvious \nthat supporting the repeal of a law is not vigorously defending that \nlaw.\n  There are other occasions where General Kagan's personal beliefs \nrather than the law appear to have guided her decisions as Solicitor \nGeneral. For example, with respect to her handling of the lawsuits \nattempting to overturn the don't ask, don't tell policy, she didn't \nfile an appeal in the Witt v. Department of the Air Force case to \nuphold the constitutionality of the law, even though there was a split \nin the circuit courts on this issue. I have already discussed Solicitor \nGeneral Kagan's actions at Harvard Law and how she thwarted our \nmilitary's recruitment efforts because of her deeply held views against \nthe don't ask, don't tell policy. I cannot imagine that her personal \nopinions on this matter did not play a role in decisionmaking at the \nSolicitor General's Office with respect to the Witt case.\n  I am also concerned about Solicitor General Kagan's views on property \nrights. The fifth amendment states that the government ``shall not take \nprivate property rights for public use without just compensation.'' In \n2004, the Supreme Court took an expansive view of the words ``public \nuse'' in Kelo v. City of New London, allowing the government to take \nprivate property so that it could be transferred to another person \npromoting economic development. At the hearing, Solicitor General Kagan \nrefused to comment on whether she believed the Court had correctly \ninterpreted the text of the Constitution in the Kelo case. She also did \nnot elaborate on any limits to the government's ability to take private \nproperty. I am concerned that she does not agree that the ruling in \nKelo undermines citizens' property rights contained in the \nConstitution.\n  Solicitor General Kagan's view of the role of international law is \ndisturbing. At the hearing, she stated that a Justice could look to \ninternational law to find ``good ideas'' when interpreting the U.S. \nConstitution and our laws. However, when I pressed her on which \ncountries a Justice should look to in order to find those ``good \nideas,'' she refused to answer.\n  I am unaware of how international law can help us better understand \nour great Constitution. That is because international law should not be \nused to interpret our Constitution. When we begin to look to \ninternational law to interpret our own Constitution, we are at a point \nthen where the meaning of the U.S. Constitution is no longer determined \nby the consent of the governed.\n  The importance Solicitor General Kagan places on international law is \nmade abundantly clear by her actions as dean of Harvard, when she \nimplemented a curriculum mandating that all first-year law students \ntake international law. She said that the first year of law school is \nthe ``foundation of legal education,'' forming lawyers' ``sense of what \nthe law is, its scopes, its limits, and its possibilities.'' Yet, U.S. \nconstitutional law, the class that teaches the founding document of our \nlegal system--a class that almost every other law school in the country \nbelieves first-year students should have--is not a mandatory first-year \ncourse at Harvard Law.\n  I don't disagree that it is helpful for students to understand \ninternational law, but I question why it should be a first-year \nrequirement and thus mandatory to graduate--especially when U.S. \nconstitutional law is not required to graduate from Harvard Law School \nat all--yes, hard to believe; a student can graduate from Harvard Law \nwithout having to take a single constitutional law class.\n  When General Kagan was asked about this, she answered:\n\n       Constitutional law should primarily be kept in the upper \n     years, where students can deal with it in a much more \n     sophisticated and in-depth way.\n\n  This may seem reasonable, but it does not address why a student is \nnever required to take a constitutional law class to graduate. Because, \nas dean, she never saw the need to make constitutional law a \nrequirement to graduate, then I am led to believe Solicitor General \nKagan believes international law is more important than U.S. \nconstitutional law. This is remarkable--or maybe I should say it is \nshocking--considering that the Constitution of the United States is our \nmost fundamental law.\n  I am deeply concerned then that if confirmed to the Supreme Court, \nGeneral Kagan will put her own strongly held personal views above that \nof the Constitution and the law.\n  Throughout her life, Solicitor General Kagan's background has allowed \nher to work without having to check her political and ideological \nviews. Her experiences throughout her life have allowed her to indulge, \nreinforce, and ultimately submit her deeply ingrained liberal beliefs. \nIn my opinion, her record strongly suggests she will not be able to act \nin an unbiased manner as a Justice.\n  Her answers and evasions to our questions at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing also raise serious concern about her ability to set aside her \npersonal political goals when interpreting the Constitution. I am \nconvinced that once confirmed to the Court, her ``finely tuned \npolitical antenna'' and her ``political heart'' will drive her judicial \nmethod, rather than judicial restraint.\n  At the hearing, General Kagan tried to distance herself from her \nOxford thesis, where she embraced judicial activism. In that thesis, \nshe wrote that ``it is not necessarily wrong or invalid'' for judges to \ntry to ``mold and steer the law in order to promote certain ethical \nvalues and achieve certain social ends.'' Our great American tradition \nand the U.S. Constitution soundly reject the notion of judges \noverstepping their constitutional role by implementing their personal, \npolitical, and social goals from the bench. I am not convinced that, if \nconfirmed, General Kagan will actually be able to resist the temptation \nto do that. That is because I believe her judicial philosophy is really \nnothing more than a political philosophy. This being the case, I am not \nat all convinced she will be able to apply the law impartially and not \nbe a rubberstamp for the President or the leftwing interest groups' \npolitical and social agenda.\n\n  Solicitor General Kagan acknowledged that it is ``difficult to take \noff the advocate's hat and put on the judge's hat.'' Yet she could not \nshow us that she had the ability to make the transition from an \nacademic and political operative to what we believe ought to be a fair \nand impartial jurist. Her testimony did not disprove her far-left \nrecord or demonstrate she would not let her political views dominate \nher approach to the law. I am not persuaded Solicitor General Kagan \nwill be able to overcome that difficulty and transition into an \nunbiased judge, so I will vote no on her confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Objection is heard. The bill will receive its \nsecond reading on the next legislative day.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the President's \nnomination\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nof Elena Kagan to serve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  First, I congratulate my colleague from Iowa for his tremendous \nremarks this evening, as he went through the reasons he will not be \nsupporting Elena Kagan. I congratulate him on such a reasoned and \npersuasive oration this evening.\n  Ms. Kagan has been nominated to fill the seat of Justice Stevens. I \nhad the opportunity, in 2004, to appear before the Court in the \nposition as deputy attorney general of Florida. During that time, \nbecause Chief Justice Rehnquist was ill, Justice Stevens presided.\n  I think before I go into an evaluation of Solicitor General Kagan, it \nis important to note what a historic figure Justice Stevens is to the \nAmerican bench and the bar.\n  Even before he began his 35 years of service on the Supreme Court, he \nbuilt a stellar reputation as a member of the bar as a lawyer and a \ncareful jurist. He graduated from Northwestern School of Law. He served \nas a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge. Then he spent \nnearly 20 years, from 1949 to 1969, as a practitioner of law and one of \nthe country's foremost experts on antitrust law. He taught courses at \nthe University of Chicago, he served on a Department of Justice \ncommission, and he authored various papers on antitrust issues.\n  It was in 1970 that President Nixon appointed Justice Stevens to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. After 5 years of service \nthere, he was elevated to the Supreme Court.\n  His service to this country should be remembered, and he gets our \nthanks. On behalf of a grateful nation, I send my gratitude to him for \nhis unique and important service to this country.\n  In evaluating a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, we in the Senate \nexercise a solemn obligation. It is a rare time in our constitutional \ndemocracy when the three branches come together in one proceeding. One \nof those is the unfortunate proceeding of impeachment. Thankfully, that \nis not why we are here. But the other is this proceeding--a proceeding \nwhen the President submits for consideration a judicial nominee who is \nthen evaluated by this body under the advice and consent clause of \narticle II, section 2, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution.\n  That clause reads, in part:\n\n       [The President] shall have Power, by and with Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  While we do have that advice-and-consent role on a normal occasion \nfor those other officers, for judges of the lower courts, for ministers \nand the like, it is a rare occurrence when this body has the honor and \nopportunity to evaluate a Supreme Court nominee. Because it is a rare \noccurrence and because this is a lifetime appointment to the head of \none of the branches of our coequal government, we have a solemn \nresponsibility to do our job and understand what our job is.\n  In preparing for this responsibility of providing advice and consent \nand in being a lawyer who wanted to do a good job and be lawyerly about \nthis work, I took the opportunity to try to study up on what our \nopportunity and responsibility is in this confirmation of a Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  What do these terms ``advice and consent'' mean and what is our \nresponsibility and how do we undergo that responsibility to fulfill our \nconstitutional obligation? Certainly, in order to fulfill it, we must \nunderstand it.\n  What does advice and consent mean? Advice certainly means to provide \ninformation, counseling, and to give some feedback to the President of \nthe United States as to a nominee. It seems to be more of the role of a \ncounselor than anything else. But of the two words, it is not the most \nweighty.\n  The most weighty of the two is consent. In fact, the advice-and-\nconsent function is not found within the enumerated legislative powers. \nArticle I of the Constitution holds those responsibilities. Advice and \nconsent is found in article II, which enumerates the powers of the \nexecutive branch, of the President. Advice and consent is shown as a \nlimitation on the President's power. The President cannot just put \nwhomever he or she wishes on a court. He can only do so with the advice \nand consent of this body. In fact, our Founders did not place this \nresponsibility in both the House and the Senate. They solely put that \nresponsibility among the Members of this body. ``Consent'' being the \noperative and, in my mind, meaningful term because without our consent, \nthe nominee is not confirmed.\n  Our responsibility is not trivial, and we are certainly not here to \nbe a mere rubberstamp on the President's nomination. It is our \nobligation to thoroughly evaluate and provide that consent because, but \nfor our consent, the nominee will not be seated.\n  How do we execute that responsibility? What does it mean to provide \nconsent and how should we do it?\n  Certainly, we have to look at the nominee and the applicant. We have \nto see that the person will be a person of integrity, that they are \nthoughtful, that they have experience, and that they will uphold the \nobligations of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Last May, when I started my work of trying to evaluate how I would \nfulfill my constitutional obligation and started to do some reading of \nprior confirmation proceedings, the writings of Senators who have come \nbefore me, I came upon what I believe is a four-part criteria to \nevaluate a nominee to the Nation's highest Court.\n  It should be stressed how important a position this is. There are \nonly nine Justices who sit atop the judicial branch, and they are \nappointed for life. There is no other portion of government where this \nis true, to be head of a coequal branch for life--Justice Stevens \nserving 35 years on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  What criteria should we use? I propose the following: One, a nominee \nshould present a robust body of work. Why? Because there needs to be \nsomething for us to evaluate. We need to have the ability, in providing \nour consent function, to look at a body of work so we can properly \nexecute our responsibility.\n  This does not mean, nor do I believe, that it is required for a \nnominee to the U.S. Supreme Court that they have been a judge. In fact, \nour Constitution provides no requirements for a judge to serve on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. This is unlike what we see in the Congress. There \nare specific requirements of how old you have to be to be in the House, \nto be in the Senate, how many years you must be a resident of this \ncountry. The same requirements apply to the President. There are no \nrequirements for a judge as it is stated in the Constitution, for a \nJustice of the Supreme Court.\n  In evaluating that there are no requirements, we certainly need to \nknow what the Justice stands for and how the Justice will fulfill his \nor her obligations on the Court. Without a body of work, that is very \ndifficult to evaluate. While there is no requirement that one be even, \nin fact, a lawyer, although every person who has been confirmed has \nbeen a lawyer, and there is no requirement that you be a judge, if you \nare not a judge, you do not have a robust body of work for us to \nevaluate. That makes it more difficult on our part to make a decision \nof whether we should give our consent and, I suggest, it provides an \nadditional burden to the nominee to be forthcoming when answering \nquestions. Since we do not have a body of work to evaluate, since we \ncannot look at prior decisions that a judge has handed down, to know \nhow a judge ruled in the past and, therefore, glean how the judge will \nrule in the future, that nominee must be forthcoming so we can hear how \nhe or she will do his or her job as a Justice.\n  Second, the nominee must demonstrate an unfailing fidelity to the \ntext of the Constitution and proper restraint against the temptation to \nexpand judicial power. Why do we find this important? I will talk about \nthis more in a minute. It is because we have a separation of powers and \nchecks and balances that were imbued in our Constitution by our \nFounders. They intended for our government to be counterbalanced by \neach branch--the legislative, the judicial, and the executive.\n  It is the beauty of the Constitution that no branch will exert too \nmuch authority because it will be checked by the other, each branch \nhaving checks on the other. Furthermore, sometimes forgotten, is that \nthe Federal Government is part of a federalist society. We\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\nare a Republic, and the Federal Government is only one piece of the \ngovernmental structure. The rest are the governments of the States and \nthe powers and rights which are left to the people under our \nConstitution. Our Founders sought checks and balances between the \nFederal Government and the State governments and the people as well.\n  A nominee must understand that the judiciary cannot expand its role \nbeyond the confines our Founders intended. In fact, we know our \nFounders intended for the judiciary not to serve as a legislative \nbranch because in article II, the legislative power is vested solely in \nthe Congress.\n  For a judge or Justice to take on a legislative role, to not have a \nfirm adherence to the law as written, violates the separation of \npowers, violates the rights and responsibilities of the Congress.\n  Third, the nominee must make determinations about the meaning of \nFederal law and the Constitution and apply the law as written, again, \nbecause of that separation of powers.\n  Fourth, the nominee must understand the Court's role in stopping \nunconstitutional intrusions by the elected branches. Our Founders knew \neach branch of government would seek to expand the scope of its power. \nThat is the beauty of the checks and balances system--to keep each body \nin check. They did not want a strong executive. They worried about the \ntyranny of the executive. But they also worried about the tyranny of \nthe legislative. Nor did they hope the judiciary would become too \nstrong.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 78 that ``it is the courts \nthat will serve as the bulwarks of limiting Constitution against \nlegislative encroachment.''\n  Our Founders designed this intricate system of checks and balances to \nkeep all the governmental bodies and institutions in check, to not \nexpand to the detriment of another body, to not expand to the \ndetriments of our rights and the rights of the States.\n  In evaluating Solicitor General Kagan--and I note also in comparing \nher to Justice Stevens--I find she does not have the experience that \ngives us the opportunity to evaluate her work, to determine what kind \nof judge or Justice she would be.\n  In preparing for this decision, I went back and I read a book that \nwas written by one of our predecessors, Senator Paul Simon. It was a \nbook he published in 1992. The book is called ``Advice and Consent.'' \nThe book concerns the confirmation hearings of Justice Bork and Justice \nThomas.\n  Interestingly, in this book--and it is a very fine book and I commend \nanyone who is interested in this topic to read it--there is a foreward \nin the book by Laurence Tribe, the famous constitutional scholar, at \nthe time the Tyler Scholar of Constitutional Law at Harvard University, \nwith whom I believe Solicitor General Kagan served when she was the \ndean of Harvard Law School.\n  In this foreward, I think that Professor Tribe provides a very cogent \nand focused analysis of the problem we experience in the modern \nconfirmation setting where nominees fail to provide sufficient answers \nto questions.\n  Why this is so troubling with Solicitor General Kagan is because we \ndo not have the body of work to evaluate. It has been the course, in \nthe past 20 years, that it seems all the nominees to the Supreme Court \ngive these sort of vapid answers. That is not my phrase. That is, in \nfact, her phrase. We will talk about that in a moment--vapid answers \nthat come from questions from the Senators on the Judiciary Committee, \nfailing to articulate what your position is on a particular point of \nlaw, all the more concerned when we have no record to evaluate.\n  Here is what Professor Tribe said:\n\n       The Court and the Nation cannot afford any more ``stealth'' \n     nominees who steadfastly decline to answer substantive \n     questions the Senate might pose on the oft-invoked ground \n     that the matter might come before the Court during their \n     possible tenure. This easy refrain does not provide a valid \n     excuse for stonewalling, no matter how frequently it is \n     repeated . . .\n       On the contrary, the adversary system works best when all \n     concerned, and not just those who nominated the judge, know \n     what there is to be known about the judge's starting \n     predispositions on a pending issue. And let's stop pretending \n     that such predispositions do not exist. It hardly fosters \n     fairness to claim that a mind is completely neutral when in \n     fact a lifetime of experiences has unavoidably inclined it \n     one way or another and to other, and to equate an open mind \n     with a blank one insults the intelligence of all concerned.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       A nominee whose record is too pale to read with the naked \n     eye or whose views are shrouded in fog too dense for anything \n     but the klieg lights of national television to pierce is \n     probably ill-suited for a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court \n     in any event.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       A nominee whose record is too pale to read with the naked \n     eye or whose views are shrouded in fog too dense . . . is \n     probably ill-suited for a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, that describes Solicitor General Kagan. \nShe is an extremely bright and articulate woman. She has a tremendous \nacademic background. I commend her for her public service--of serving \nin a Presidential administration. I commend her for serving as dean of \na law school. That too is public service. But our job is to evaluate \nthese nominees, and we cannot evaluate them if they have no record of \nhow they would rule or how they have ruled, and they provide no \nsufficient information when they come before the Judiciary Committee of \nthis body. Without that information, how can we faithfully provide our \nconsent?\n  There is a notion in the law of consent needing to be informed. In \nfact, it can't really be consent in the law if it is not informed. Yet \nSolicitor General Kagan, without a judicial record and a failure to \ndirectly and clearly answer questions, as Professor Tribe writes, fails \nto give us the information to allow us to give consent in an informed \nway.\n  We need to look no further than her own words when she wrote, in a \nspring 1995 Law Review article. It was a comment on a book that was \ntalking about the confirmation mess, and then-Professor Kagan, also \nbemoaning the state of confirmation hearings, said:\n\n       When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful \n     discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on \n     an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable \n     of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately \n     educating the public.\n\n  She described the process before the Judiciary Committee as becoming \nvapid, and, unfortunately, even though she should know more than anyone \nelse--because those were her words, the charade that she condemned in \nher article in the 1990s--she engaged in the same charade when she \nappeared before the Judiciary Committee.\n  ``A nominee whose record is too pale to read with the naked eye or \nwhose views are too shrouded in fog . . . is probably ill-suited for a \nlifetime appointment,'' said Professor Tribe.\n  Ms. Kagan also has very little practical experience. Unlike Justice \nStevens, who practiced law for 20 years, Ms. Kagan practiced law for 2. \nNever having served before as a judge, we don't know her record. She \nsaid that the confirmation proceedings in the past had an ``air of \nvacuity and farce,'' a ``vapid and hollow charade.'' Instead of \nfollowing her own admonishment, she participated in that charade. She \nengaged in the same vapid exercise that she condemned.\n  The burden was on Ms. Kagan to demonstrate how she would rule as a \njudge. With no record for us to evaluate, she could not engage in the \nsame charade that she had previously condemned and leave us with \nnothing to know as to how she would act in a lifetime appointment--an \nappointment, if Justice Stevens' record is any sort of indication of \nhow long a ``Justice Kagan'' might serve, for 35 years.\n  I have an obligation, Mr. President, under article 2, section 2 to \nprovide advice and consent, and I cannot do so where the nominee cannot \nor does not provide a record that my colleagues and I can evaluate. We \nare left without a solid basis upon which to judge how she would judge.\n  During the Judiciary Committee proceedings, she said she would give \nbinding precedent all the respect of binding precedent. That is \nmeaningless. It gives us no indication of how she might make her \ndecisions, how she might rule.\n  So I am left with these serious concerns. I am left with the serious \nconcerns about her commitment to uphold the constitutional principle of \na limited government, the fundamental protections of the second \namendment, and\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\nplacing law ahead of her personal and political views.\n  I spoke before about one of these criteria being the fidelity to the \nConstitution and the principle of a limited Federal Government. \n``Thomas Jefferson warned us that our written constitution can help \nsecure liberty only if it is not made a blank paper by construction.''\n  Ms. Kagan testified that her whole life provided indications of what \nkind of judge or Justice she would be. And in that statement I agree.\n  As mentioned earlier, before law school, when she was writing a \nthesis at Oxford, she stated that ``new times and circumstances demand \na different interpretation of the Constitution,'' and that judges may \n``mold and steer the law in order to promote certain ethical values and \nachieve certain social ends.'' That is not what the Founders intended \nfor a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  In that same thesis, she wrote:\n\n       The judge's own experience and values become the most \n     important element in the decision. If that is too results \n     oriented, so be it.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a violation of the constitutional requirement \nthat all power legislative be vested in this Congress.\n  I was concerned about the colloquy that she had with Senator Coburn. \nIn fact, it was something I discussed with her in person prior to her \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee. This colloquy was about the \ncommerce clause and whether or not it was limited. Remember that our \nFounders intended for the Federal Government to be limited in its \npowers. That is why there are enumerated powers in article 1. They are \nnot plenary; they are limited by their number.\n  Senator Coburn asked her about sponsoring a bill, about requiring \nAmericans to eat their fruits and vegetables, and it got a response \nfrom Solicitor General Kagan that it ``sounds like a dumb law.'' But \nSenator Coburn asked whether or not it would be constitutional and she \nfailed to provide an answer.\n  Senator Coburn then put the meat on the bones and asked:\n\n       What if I said that eating three fruits and three \n     vegetables would cut health care costs by 20 percent? Now \n     we're into commerce. And since the government says that 65 \n     percent of all the health care costs [are because of health \n     care], why isn't that constitutional?\n\n  No real meaningful answer to give clarity of how Solicitor General \nKagan as Justice Kagan would rule.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has expanded its powers beyond \nwhat our Framers intended--far beyond what our Framers intended. James \nMadison, in Federalist 45, said:\n\n       The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the \n     federal government are few and defined. Those which are to \n     remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.\n\n  But that is not how our constitution is modernly interpreted. We are \naway from what our Founders intended. We are away from the clear \nmeaning of the words of the Constitution. And Solicitor General Kagan \ndoesn't tell us that the commerce clause has a limit, in her view. And \nit is through the commerce clause that this Congress and Congresses in \nthe past have sought to enter and to invade every portion of life in \nthis country--things in which our Founders never intended the Federal \nGovernment to be involved.\n  It appears Ms. Kagan has this same view of an expansive Federal \nGovernment--a Federal Government that makes States its dependents and \napparatuses thereto, a Federal Government that has no limits, a Federal \nGovernment that can invade every portion of our lives, a Federal \nGovernment that is too vast, too expensive and beyond what our Founders \nintended.\n  I am also concerned about Solicitor General Kagan's views on the \nright to bear arms enumerated in the second amendment. I think she has \ntoo little regard for some of our Constitution's most fundamental \nprotections. As a law clerk, she was dismissive of the second \namendment, saying she was not sympathetic to the amendment.\n  During the Clinton administration, she developed numerous anti-second \namendment initiatives. In her confirmation process for Solicitor \nGeneral, she declined to comment on second amendment rights.\n\n  There was a discussion earlier of my friend and colleague from Iowa \ntalking about natural rights. I think it is important for us to \nremember the setting upon which our Framers brought this constitution \nto bear. There were the Articles of Confederation--a loose arrangement \nbetween the States where there was no central government. The Founders \ntook it upon themselves to seek to enact a stronger Federal system but \na system that, as the 9th amendment, the 10th amendment and other \nprovisions of the Constitution show, leaves rights to the States and to \npeople; that enumerates specific powers of the Federal Government.\n  Remember, initially, there were not even the first 10 amendments. \nRemember, there was a confirmation battle as to whether the States \nindividually would ratify the Constitution. There were anti-Federalists \nwho thought the constitution had gone too far and given too much \nauthority to the Federal Government, and our Founders Hamilton, Madison \nand Jay, in writing the Federalist Papers, had to make the case of some \nform of central government. But they gave the assurances that most of \nthe obligations to govern would be left to the people and the States. \nMs. Kagan doesn't have that view, it appears.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the way that then-Dean Kagan treated \nthe military as the dean of Harvard Law School. I think it is \noutrageous that the U.S. military was not allowed to recruit on campus \nwhile she was the dean of the law school. And this idea that the \nmilitary could go through another part of the school--the Veterans \nAssociation but not the Career Services Office--is outrageous. The \nVeterans Association had no funding, no office. It was not set up to \nallow law students to interview with the military.\n  Some have called this the same as ``separate but equal.'' It was not \neven equal. It is outrageous. It is outrageous beyond the fact that \nHarvard received Federal dollars. It is outrageous that a premier \ninstitution such as Harvard University, one of our first institutions \nof higher learning, known throughout the world as being an exceptional \nschool, would not allow the military the benefit of its students to \nserve by being interviewed on campus, in a regular on-campus process in \nwhich every law firm or other agency of government is allowed to \nparticipate. And that is a decision that she presided over. That is an \nerror of judgment.\n  But I also believe that it was an error of law. In 1996, Congress \npassed the Solomon Amendment allowing the Secretary of Defense to deny \nFederal grants to institutions of higher education if they prohibited \nROTC or military recruitment on campus. Under the Harvard Law School \nantidiscrimination policy, the military was banned from utilizing its \nservices, and it was concluded that, therefore, those Federal funds \nwould be suspended.\n  Ms. Kagan refused to abide by that Solomon Amendment when she was the \ndean. In 2002, Harvard was informed by the Department of Defense its \npractice of letting military recruiters contact students through the \nHarvard Law School Veterans Association, but not the Office of Career \nServices, violated the Federal law. In response, Dean Kagan filed a \nbrief challenging the constitutionality of the Solomon Amendment, which \nis her right--not a good decision but her right.\n  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit enjoined the law. And Ms. \nKagan reinstated Harvard's, in my view, discriminatory policy.\n  Now, you might say: Well, the court ruled; therefore, it was \nappropriate for her, if she so chose, to go back to the previous policy \nbecause that had been enjoined. However, Massachusetts is not in the \nThird Circuit, it is in the First. An appellate decision in the Third \nCircuit is not binding on the First Circuit. If Dean Kagan wanted to go \nto court again and seek to have it applied, that would have been one \nthing. What she did instead is unilaterally follow a decision that had \nno effect upon her and, in my view, violates the law.\n\n  Again, I think Solicitor General Kagan is an extremely intelligent \nperson, an articulate person. I think that she has a commendable career \nof public service. But she has failed to meet the burden that is \nrequired of someone with no judicial record. She has failed to inform \nus of how she would judge as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nWith no record to read, there is heightened scrutiny on the nominee, \nand we did not have the opportunity to have full and forthcoming \nanswers from Ms. Kagan. Instead, what we had was the same vapid and \nvacuous answers that she condemned in her law review article in the \nmid-1990s, the same type of charade Lawrence Tribe said makes somebody \nill-suited for a lifetime appointment, with such a thin record.\n  If perhaps she would have been more forthcoming, I would have been \nable to come to a different conclusion. But when you take the lack of \nher record, her inability to provide clear responses to questions to \ngive us indication of how she would rule, and the concerns about the \nsecond amendment, about how she treated the military at Harvard, and \nher views about the activism of the Court--in light of all those \nreasons, I will be voting no on Ms. Kagan's confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "03", "month": "08", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/08/03/senate-section/article/S6676-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
