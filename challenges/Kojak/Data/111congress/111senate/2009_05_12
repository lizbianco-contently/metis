Mr. President, for the past several weeks, I have \nrepeatedly expressed my concerns about the administration's decision to \nfix an arbitrary deadline on closing Guantanamo before it has a plan \nfor the detainees. In my view, it was irresponsible for the \nadministration to announce the closure of this safe and secure facility \nbefore it could assure the\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nAmerican people that the alternative would be no less safe.\n  So far the administration's response to these concerns has been to \nsimply assure people that any future transfer will not endanger \nAmericans. Attorney General Holder says that detainees from Guantanamo \nwould only be sent to American prisons if he is convinced that doing so \nwon't impact the safety of the communities they are sent to. National \nSecurity Adviser Jim Jones has said the same thing. On Sunday, he said \nnothing would be done to make Americans, ``less safe.''\n  These assurances may be consoling to some. But Americans deserve more \nthan vague assurances. They want to know which communities are being \nconsidered, and they want to know how the people who live in these \ncommunities would be affected by the arrival of terrorists. In short, \nAmericans want the kind of assurances and specifics the Attorney \nGeneral has evidently shared with foreign governments like he did \nrecently on a trip to Europe, but not with the U.S. Congress.\n  News reports indicate that Alexandria, VA is a possible destination \nfor some detainees from Guantanamo. A few years ago, when one of the 9/\n11 conspirators, Zacharias Moussaoui, was held in Alexandria, the jail \nhad to set aside a unit of six cells and a common area just for him. \nEvery time Moussaoui was moved to a nearby courthouse, he was \ntransferred in a heavily armed convoy and the entire prison was locked \ndown. And whenever Moussaoui was transferred to the courthouse, traffic \nwas stopped due to security concerns, a major inconvenience to locals \nand local businesses.\n  These were the security requirements for just one terrorist. Now \nimagine duplicating these procedures many times over for multiple \ndetainees from Guantanamo.\n  Based on its own past experience with Moussaoui, local officials in \nAlexandria are extremely concerned. The mayor of Alexandria said \nrecently that he is ``absolutely opposed'' to detainees from Guantanamo \ngoing to Alexandria and that he would do everything in his power to \nstop it. Alexandria's sheriff is also unconvinced by the \nadministration's claims. He said that if multiple detainees were sent \nto Alexandria, they could ``overwhelm the system.''\n  Congressman Jim Moran, who represents Alexandria, is one of the few \npeople who is open to the idea of domestic transfers. But even he \nadmits the strain would be intense.\n  Yet what is even more worrisome to some officials at the local level \nis the prospect that any city which houses these detainees could become \nthe target of a terrorist attack. The residents of Alexandria are \nconcerned about it, and so are the residents of communities all across \nthe country. I can assure you that Kentuckians don't want detainees \nfrom Guantanamo living anywhere within our borders, and I know that \ncommunities all over the country share the same concerns.\n  Already, State and local officials in places like Louisiana, \nCalifornia, and Mississippi have been introducing resolutions to stop \nthese terrorists from being sent to their communities. In Virginia, the \nStafford County Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution opposing \nthe transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to the Marine base at Quantico. In \nMissouri, the legislature passed a resolution urging Congress to keep \ndetainees out of the State.\n  Similar measures have been introduced or approved in other States, \nincluding California where Camp Pendleton is considered a candidate to \nreceive detainees. Here in Washington, lawmakers on both sides of the \naisle are also raising concerns. When one Democratic Senator was asked \nabout the possibility of detainees being sent to his State, he was \nblunt: ``No way,'' he said, ``not on my watch.'' Other Democrats have \nvoiced serious concerns about the impact transferring detainees would \nhave on their communities. They know about the experience of Alexandria \nduring the Moussaoui trial, and they don't want it duplicated many \ntimes over in their own communities.\n  So there is strong bipartisan opposition to this proposal. I can't \nthink of a congressional district in America that would welcome \nterrorists. Local communities want the administration to explain how \ntransferring or releasing detainees won't make them, quote, ``less \nsafe''. And the American people want the administration to explain its \nplans to their elected representatives in Congress.\n  Senator Sessions, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has \nnow sent the Attorney General two letters asking what legal authority \nthe administration has to release trained terrorists into the United \nStates. He has yet to receive the courtesy of a response. Imagine that. \nThe ranking member of the Judiciary Committee sent the Attorney General \na letter pointing out that the law prohibits the transfer of terrorists \nto the U.S. soil, and he has not received a reply after two letters. \nVirginia Congressman Frank Wolf sent a letter to the Attorney General \nin March regarding concerns he had with transferring Guantanamo \ndetainees to Alexandria. He has since sent two more letters. The \nAttorney General has not responded to any of these requests.\n  Democrats are also demanding that the administration provide details \nfor how it plans to deal with the terrorists at Guantanamo. Senior \nDemocrats are now acknowledging that the administration simply doesn't \nhave a plan and are asking the administration to provide one. Members \nof Congress have a responsibility to ensure the administration is not \ntaking any actions that endanger the American people, and we have a \nresponsibility to protect our constituents.\n  It is unacceptable that the Attorney General is willing to discuss \ndetails about his plans for Guantanamo with foreign countries--foreign \ncountries--but not with the American people or their elected \nrepresentatives. Members of Congress deserve, and the American people \nexpect, the administration to provide us with answers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5342-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5342-S5343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRUSTEES ANNUAL REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, later today the trustees of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds will release their annual report \nwhich will give us an idea of the current and projected financial \nhealth of these programs. We do not know exactly what they will say, \nbut we know the news will not be good. Everyone knows these programs \nare unsustainable under current conditions, and the problem is only \ngetting worse.\n\n  Unfortunately, it is a problem the Democrats' budget does not \naddress. Despite repeated calls from our side of the aisle, entitlement \nspending has been overlooked for far too long, and now it is \ncompletely--completely--out of control.\n  This is a fiscal crisis of the first order, and it is a crisis that \ncannot wait any longer to be addressed. Nearly 7 out of $10 the Federal \nGovernment spends every year goes directly to mandatory spending on \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the interest \non the national debt. Soon enough, Social Security, Medicare, and other \nentitlements will consume about twice the percentage of the Federal \nbudget they did four decades ago. If we do not get control over this \nspending soon, we will only have a fraction left for vital priorities \nsuch as defense, health care, transportation, and other job creators.\n  We must address the issue of entitlement spending now before it is \ntoo late. As I have said many times before, the best way to address the \ncrisis is the Conrad-Gregg proposal, which would provide an expedited \npathway for fixing these profound long-term challenges. This plan would \nforce us to get debt and spending under control. It deserves support \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  The administration has expressed a desire to take up entitlement \nreform, and given the debt that its budget would run up, the need for \nreform has never been greater. So I urge the administration, once \nagain, to support the Conrad-Gregg proposal. This proposal is our best \nhope for addressing the out-of-control spending and debt levels that \nare threatening our Nation's fiscal future. More than 800,000 \nKentuckians receive Social Security benefits, and we need to make sure \nthe program remains solvent not only for them but for their children \nand their grandchildren.\n  Today's report will underscore the urgent need for action, and \nRepublicans stand ready to work with Democrats and the administration \nto meet that challenge.\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as a young man, I came to Washington, DC, to \ngo to school. I came back here to go to school, and I went to law \nschool during the daytime. I worked at night as a police officer here \nin this Capitol complex. I was a Capitol police officer. I had a badge. \nI still have that as my souvenir. It has a very low number. I was one \nof the early police officers, I guess. I worked the night shift. I \nworked from 3 to 11. Now, I did not do anything very dangerous, and \nthat is an understatement. I watched the doors, helped with the crowds \nsometimes. The most dangerous thing I did--and the thing I disliked the \nmost--was directing traffic. That was kind of dangerous because in \nthose days they had these streetcar tracks in the middle of \nConstitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, and trucks, vehicles, \nwould bounce around on those. But anyway, I did not do anything very \ndangerous.\n  Every year for decades now, police officers and their families have \ncome to Washington about this time of the year to honor those who have \nrisked their lives and to remember those who gave their lives. Having \nhad a little experience as a police officer, I recognize the sacrifice \nthese men and women who come here have made.\n  As I said, this is the time of year we honor those who have risked \ntheir lives and remember those who have given their lives during the \npast year. Three of those fearless officers we recognize this year \nserve in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. It is an \noutstanding organization. The work they do is intense, and I am very \nproud of the work they do. Three of these officers are here in the \nCapitol today.\n  Last June, police officer Blake Penny was chasing another vehicle, \nthinking perhaps the person was armed. But the suspect's car flipped \nover, end over end, and landed on its side. Officer Penny did what any \ngood police officer would do: He went to the car to see if everyone was \nOK. The passenger came out with gun blazing and shot Officer Penny. \nFortunately, he did not kill him. He shot him just above the knee. The \nother bullets did not hit Officer Penny at all.\n  It was then that Officer Penny's fellow patrolmen--Sergeant Steve \nCuster and Officer Christian Jackson--heard those frightening words \nover the radio that police officers hate to hear but hear them more \noften than they would like: ``Shots fired, officer down.'' They, of \ncourse, raced to the scene because one of theirs was down. In the \nmeantime, even though he was unable to walk, Officer Penny courageously \ncontinued to exchange fire with the suspect.\n  When Sergeant Custer and Officer Jackson got there, they threw \nthemselves into the line of fire to administer first aid to Officer \nPenny and pull him into their patrol car. Officer Jackson drove his \nwounded partner to the hospital, and Sergeant Custer--a police officer \nfor 36 years--stayed on the scene until backup arrived. Sadly, the \nsuspect was killed in the exchange of fire.\n  That is the work these brave police officers do every day.\n  This week, the National Association of Police Organizations is \nhonoring these brave officers with what is called the Top Cops Award. \nCuster, Jackson, and Penny are Top Cops. They have been designated so \nby their fellow police officers. This is a tribute given to just a \nselect few of the countless men and women who each year go above and \nbeyond the call of duty.\n  Today, it is we who are honored to have them here in the Capitol with \nus. To Officer Blake Penny and his wife Marcia, Sergeant Steve Custer \nand his wife Marcela, and Officer Christian Jackson and his wife \nBarbara--they are Nevadans and Americans--Nevadans and Americans \neverywhere thank you brave police officers for your service and your \nsacrifice. We are fortunate to have people just like you protecting us \nevery day, not only in the metropolitan area of Las Vegas but all over \nthe country.\n  We also remember the brave officers who tragically lost their lives \nthis past year.\n  In Nevada, last February, State trooper Kara Borgognone--a wife and \nmother of two--was investigating a bomb threat at a gas station in \nSpanish Springs, NV, when her car crashed. She died from her injuries. \nShe was only 33 years old. Trooper Borgognone will be honored here in \nWashington this week at the annual National Police Week candlelight \nvigil for officers killed in the line of duty.\n  Just last week, in Las Vegas, Las Vegas police officer James Manor--a \nhusband and a brandnew father--was responding to a call in the same \ncommunity where he grew up. With red lights blaring, he was going to a \nplace where a woman was allegedly being beaten. He was struck by a \ndrunk driver and killed. Officer Manor was 28 years old.\n  This week, we pause to think of the selfless police officers who have \nfallen in the line of duty this past year and in years past and their \nloved ones who have lost a father, a mother, a son or a daughter, a \nhusband or a wife, or even a friend. And we pause to thank those--just \nlike these three brave officers who are here this morning--who each day \ngo to work with a simple job--a simple job, Mr. President--to put their \nlives on the line to protect people they do not know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5343-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after 100 days, there have been a lot \nof report cards on the Obama administration. I would like, with \nrespect, to offer one on a subject both the President and I think is of \ncrucial importance: the education of the American people.\n  As a good teacher would--or as my late friend Alex Haley used to say: \nFind the good and praise it--I would like to start with the good grades \non this report card. So to begin with, I give President Obama an A-plus \nfor recruiting. His best appointee, in my opinion, is the new Education \nSecretary, Arne Duncan from Chicago. The Acting President pro tempore \nmight agree with that. The new Education Secretary grew up, as I did, \nin a family where the mom was a preschool teacher--my mother in the \nmountains of Tennessee, his on the South Side of Chicago. He has a \nbackground for leadership. He has an agenda for rewarding outstanding \nteaching, an agenda for encouraging the largest number of charter \nschools possible, an agenda for encouraging States to set higher \nstandards. He has a close relationship with the President. He is truly \na blue-chip recruit. On the subject of rewarding outstanding teaching \nand charter schools, if he succeeds with that in 4 years or 8 years, it \ncould be a Nixon to China exercise in education. So an A-plus for \nrecruiting.\n  Then, here is another A-plus: for rewarding outstanding teaching. \nThis is the greatest need we have in kindergarten through the 12th \ngrade in America. Every problem we are faced with--after you deal with \nthe question of having a good parent--has to do with a good teacher. \nWhether we are talking about a gifted child or the needs of a child \nwith a disability or of a child who has come from a home where a book \nhas never been read to them or whether they are in the mountains of \nTennessee or on the South Side of Chicago, put a child with the best \npossible teacher, and the child almost always succeeds.\n  In 1983, when Tennessee became the first State to pay teachers more \nfor\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\nteaching well, not one teacher was being paid more for being a good \nteacher. Many good people have worked hard on that: Governor Jim Hunt, \nGovernor Bob Graham, Senator Bennet of Colorado, Senator Corker of \nTennessee when he was mayor of Chattanooga. But it is hard to do, to \nfind ways to reward outstanding school leadership and outstanding \nteaching, to pay some teachers more than others. But if we do not, we \nwill not be able to attract and keep the best men and women in our \nclassrooms and in our schools.\n  The President's new budget increases from about $100 million to $500 \nmillion the Teacher Incentive Fund, which has been a big success across \nthis country. Thirty-four grantees--cities, school districts--across \nthe country are experimenting with different ways of rewarding \noutstanding teaching. There is not necessarily one way to do it. It \nalmost always has to be worked out locally. Most of these cities are \nworking with their unions to make this happen. Memphis city schools are \nusing their funds to train principles. Philadelphia's grant application \nwas co-written by the local teachers union. The Northern New Mexico \nNetwork for Rural Education is working with four school districts.\n  As I said earlier, if Secretary Duncan and the President can leave a \nlegacy of dozens or hundreds of school districts, or even States, where \noutstanding teachers are paid more for their skills--not just for being \nthere a long time or for going back to school--that would be the single \nmost important legacy they could leave.\n  Then, here is one more good grade: an A-minus for charter schools. \nCharter schools also have a little history behind them. They began in \nMinnesota. The last act I took as Education Secretary, in 1992, was to \nwrite every school superintendent in the country and encourage them to \nstart charter schools. Albert Shanker, the head of the American \nFederation of Teachers, asked ``If we can have a Saturn plant, why not \na Saturn school?''\n  What he meant was, why not start from scratch and take the union \nrules and the Government regulations off teachers and let them use \ntheir own good judgment to deal with the children who are assigned to \nthem. The charter school is a pro-teacher idea. It has greatly expanded \nover the years, but it still runs into substantial opposition, usually \nfrom the National Education Association or other educators who do not \nlike it. But these are public schools. These are designed to free \nteachers so they can use their judgment to help children. Secretary \nDuncan and the President are committed to them.\n  The Secretary and I cowrote an op-ed for a Tennessee newspaper 2 \nweeks ago, which apparently helped to influence the vote of the \nlegislature to begin to move along raising the cap on charter schools \nin Tennessee. I hope it did. I thank the Secretary for his bipartisan \nsupport and commitment. Again, if he is able to succeed, working with \nthe President, and leaves a large number of public charter schools in \nour country when he leaves office, it will again be a ``Nixon to \nChina'' experience and the country will be deeply grateful. The only \nreason why it is an A-minus is there is not much support in the budget \nfor the major obstacle in creating more charter schools, which is \nsupport for financing for new facilities.\n\n  Now for the bad news. Every parent has had this experience with the \nchild's report card. Here is a D. That is for spending $80 billion over \nthe next 2 years for more of the same in the Department of Education \nwithout even asking the question: Is what we are doing working? That is \nhard for me to imagine.\n  The budget for the Department of Education would be at about $70 \nbillion, so we are adding $40 billion to it this year and $40 billion \nnext year for more of the same. Is everybody delighted with the way our \nK-12 grade system is working in America? I don't think so. We are \nchallenged by it. We need to change it. So then why in the world would \nwe put more money in for more of the same?\n  The only thing that saves the grade from being an F is that there is \n$5 billion for the Secretary's Race to the Top, which is a good idea \nbased on the agenda I described.\n  What would we have done with the money? Well, I would have suggested \nwe give a Pell Grant for Kids to every middle- and low-income child in \nthe country and $500 for a state-approved afterschool program. Let the \nparents choose: for music, for art, for catchup, for academic \nimprovement. It would have poured billions into the school districts. \nIt would have created some competition and middle- and lower income \nchildren would be given more options. That would be what we could have \ndone.\n  Here is another unfortunate grade: D-minus. That is for the DC \nvoucher program. I see the Senator from Illinois. I had this all \nprepared. I had no idea he would be here. He has been a major \nparticipant in this. What keeps this from being an F is that the \nPresident and the Secretary have said they will continue funds for the \n1,700 children in the District of Columbia who are now in high school \nand who are continuing, but after that, it is gone. This is a death \nsentence for the program. This is a death sentence for the model of \ngiving low-income parents choices of better schools--schools such as \nmiddle- and higher income parents have. It is the model that made our \nhigher education system the best in the world.\n  Senator Lieberman has said he will have a hearing on this DC voucher \nprogram. I hope he does.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will after I am finished. Well, of course, I will. I \nwill be glad to do that as a courtesy to my friend.\n  I would say, first, the Senator from Illinois missed my first two \ngrades, which were A-pluses to the President for recruiting--for blue \nchip recruiting of Arne Duncan and for the teacher incentive program, \nso he may have come in as I was giving the bad news.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say the Senator from Tennessee, as \nalways, has been fair and balanced. I wish to ask him a question. Is he \naware of the Department of Education's analysis of the DC voucher \nprogram and the results in terms of student achievement?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am aware there are--the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask a further question: Is the Senator from \nTennessee aware that when they surveyed the 1,700 students after 3 \nyears in that DC voucher program, they found there was no measurable \nimprovement among male students?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, I am not going to get into a detailed analysis \nwith the Senator. I would say this: My view of American education is \nthat we should give parents and students the opportunity to choose \namong the schools they go to. If there are four times as many children \nand parents who apply for this program than can be accepted, that would \nindicate to me that these parents and these families and these children \nthink this is an opportunity they would like to have to improve their \nlives and improve their future.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask the Senator from Tennessee if he feels we \nshould hold those voucher schools accountable in terms of whether they \nare improving the education of the students who are sent to them with \nFederal support?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Oh, of course we should.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator from Tennessee if he is aware of \nthe fact that there was no improvement of math scores of the students \nin the DC voucher schools over a 3-year period of time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator for his questions. I know he is \nthe most ardent supporter of the idea of not using Federal dollars to \ngive poor children the same choices that middle- and higher income \nchildren have. I respect that difference of opinion. I am going to go \non with my remarks. But I believe it is a wise--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has spoken for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much. I am going to continue with the \ntime on the Republican side, if I may. I look forward to a longer \ndiscussion with the Senator from Illinois on this subject. I would hope \nthat when Senator Lieberman holds his hearing, we will have a full \ndiscussion of why it is a good idea to say to poor kids and poor \nfamilies: You can't have a choice of a better school, but people with \nmoney can. That is not the way we operate our college system.\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\n  This is our Nation's Capital. We are 3 years into a program. I have \nmet with many of the children. Their lives are not going to be \ninstantly changed in 3 years. There was much in the analysis that was \ncompleted by the Department of Education that showed the choices they \nmade were helping the students academically and otherwise, and I will \nbe glad to come back to the floor and discuss that when I have more \ntime.\n  But let me go on to my concern beyond the DC voucher program to the \nbad news. I regret to say this, but the bad news has to do with Pell \nGrants and student loans. Pell Grants, of course, are the 5 million \ngrants or scholarships that were made to low-income students this year \nto help them pay for college, with $19 billion that we have \nappropriated for that purpose this last year. Almost on the day it was \nannounced that we had a $1.8 trillion deficit for this 1 year--four \ntimes bigger than it was last year--the President's budget wants to add \n$293 billion over 10 years to entitlement spending. That is automatic \nspending. That is the reason the country's debt is so high. Sixty \npercent of our spending is entitlement spending. I think the punishment \nfor the administration should be that they should all be made to stay \nafter school and write on the blackboard, each, 100 times: I will \nnever, ever again add to entitlement spending, even for a worthy \npurpose. It is no gift to students to give them a scholarship to live \nin a country they can't afford to live in because it has an interest \npayment of $800 billion a year, which it would in the 10th year of the \nPresident's budget.\n  It is not as if the Congress has been stingy with Pell grants. They \nhave gone from $7.7 billion 10 years ago to $19 billion today, and 5 \nmillion students are getting them. All we say today is if we don't have \nthe money we have appropriated, we can't spend it on scholarships.\n  The President's proposal would say we are going to spend it whether \nwe have it or not. Spend it whether we have it, despite the fact that \nour debt has grown to such levels that we couldn't even qualify to be \nadmitted to the European Union, which is a huge embarrassment. That \ndeserves an F and a stay after school and detention, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Here is another F, and it is for student loans. There are 15 million \nof those student loans--about $75 billion--and what the President's \nbudget proposes to do is turn this great recruit--this blue chip \nrecruit, who I think has a good chance of being ``Educator of the \nYear,'' into ``Banker of the Year.'' He wants another Washington \ntakeover, this time of student loans. Instead of letting 12 million \nstudents decide they would prefer to borrow from 2,000 institutions on \n4,400 campuses all across America, they are saying: No--everybody just \nline up at the U.S. Department of Education to get your student loan.\n  The only justification for that, that I can see, is the \nadministration says it might save the taxpayers money because the \nFederal Government can borrow cheaper than the banks can. Well, if that \nis true, then we ought to not have any private financial institutions \nin America; we ought to turn every financial institution into a \nnational bank and let the President run them. Andrew Jackson, the \nfounder of the Democratic Party, would turn over in his grave because \nhe ran against the national bank during his whole political career.\n\n  It makes no sense to turn the U.S. Department of Education into a \nnational bank for student loans. It should not be done. The savings are \nillusory. In the President's budget they say $94 billion is what will \nbe saved, but they leave out the administrative costs which could go as \nhigh as $32 billion, and they leave out the fact that what they are \ndoing is borrowing money at one-quarter of 1 percent and loaning it to \nthe students at 6.8 percent.\n  So they are taking money from the students and using it to pay \nsomebody else a scholarship, with the Congressman taking the credit. \nThere needs to be some truth in lending here so that when students line \nup to get their student loans, somebody says: Did you know that the \ninterest you are paying by working an extra job or by going at night is \nbeing used to pay somebody else's scholarship? If we take that part out \nof it, we could leave the program just like it is.\n  Twelve million out of fifteen million students prefer to have a \nprivate choice. They have had 15 years to choose either the public \noption or the private choice, and they have consistently decided they \nwould rather deal with the community bank than a Federal agency.\n  Well, I am about through with the report card. The rest I would put \nunder ``incomplete.'' There is still a lot of good-faith effort: \nDeregulating higher education is a goal of mine and Senator Mikulski's \nas well, and the new Secretary of Education has said he will work on \nthat. More flexibility in No Child Left Behind is a goal of mine; it \nmay be of the Secretary's as well. We can work on that.\n  My respectful suggestion to the President would be, instead of trying \nto make a tackle out of this wide receiver you recruited, instead of \nmaking Banker of the Year out of your Education Secretary, why don't \nyou let him work on the education agenda? Why don't you let him focus \non paying teachers more for teaching well and charter schools? If he \nruns out of things to do, to help parents, he could work on a tax \nsystem that is more favorable to parents with children; we used to have \nthat in this country.\n  He could work on encouraging perinatal care so every child has a \nmedical home or helping nurses to help parents in their homes so \nchildren can grow up healthy or to make sure we do nothing to \ndiscourage home schooling for dedicated parents or helping adults learn \nEnglish. There are lines in Nashville and in Boston and in other cities \nof adults who wish to learn English.\n  He could encourage worksite daycare for parents who work and might \ntake their child to work with them so they would be closer together. \nAll that would be to help better parenting or to help create better \nteachers or better school leaders.\n  The Pell Grant for Kids I mentioned for afterschool programs or \nhigher standards in data collection, I know the Secretary is interested \nin that. Teach for America, that is an important part of new energy in \nour schools. The Secretary, instead of trying to be ``Banker of the \nYear,'' could take on the teachers colleges which have had a hard time \nspending their time on such things as how to give parents more choices, \nhow to reward outstanding teaching, how to make charter schools \nsuccessful, or how to help newly arrived children learn English. He \ncould expand the UTeach Program started at the University of Texas and \nwhich our America COMPETES legislation put into national law. That \nneeds to be implemented.\n  Then, the summer academies, to help outstanding teachers and \noutstanding students of U.S. history so our children can grow up \nlearning what it means to be an American. That would be a good thing to \ndo.\n  I look forward to working with this new Secretary of Education. I \ngive the President credit. I give him an A-plus for his recruiting. I \ngive him an A-plus for his agenda for rewarding outstanding teaching \nand a high grade for his focus on charter schools. I am grateful for \nthat. I stand ready to work with him.\n  I give him horrible grades for stopping the DC voucher program and \nanother Government takeover, this one of student loans, and of taking \nmoney away from students who are getting loans to pay for scholarships \nfor other students. That is not right. I think, in this day and age, \nwhen we are adding $1.8 trillion to the debt in 1 year, it is certainly \nno time to add $293 billion in entitlement spending to the budget over \n10 years. The whole administration ought to write on the blackboard: I \nwill never, ever again add to entitlement spending.\n  I look forward to working with the President and his outstanding new \nSecretary on that incomplete agenda. Many of the items I mentioned are \nthings in which they are interested in as well and things which all of \nus in the Senate would want to do to help improve our system of \nelementary and secondary education, as well as our excellent colleges \nand universities.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business on the Democratic time and that the Republican time be \nreserved.\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5346-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5346-S5349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CARD ACT\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage all to join me \nin recognizing the nurses of America and their commitment to addressing \nthe needs of patients and their families.\n  Today, on the birthday of Florence Nightingale, we celebrate National \nNurses Day. This is appropriate since Florence Nightingale is known as \nthe pioneer of modern nursing. National Nurses Week, which expands May \n6 through May 12, focuses on recognizing the integral role nurses play \nin promoting public health and also highlights the work nurses are \ndoing to improve health care for all Americans.\n  I know firsthand the critical role that nurses play in providing \nsafe, high quality, and preventive health care. My wife Mary is a \nbedside nurse, and I am delighted that she has been able to join me \ntoday to help put a spotlight on the critical role nurses play in \nhealth care.\n  Whether they work in a hospital, community health center, physician \npractice, school, home health care, a skilled nursing facility, or \nother health care setting, nurses create better outcomes for patients.\n  Nurses are the cornerstone of our country's health care system. \nNearly 3 million registered nurses work today in the United States. But \neven so, our country is facing an 11-year nursing shortage, and that \nshortage is projected to extend for at least a decade longer. Nurse \nfaculty shortages and a huge and growing burden of tuition debt for \nnurse training are contributing to the shortage, even as new vacancies \nfor nurse positions open every single day.\n  The nationwide nursing shortage has caused dedicated nurses to have \nto work longer hours and care for more patients at the same time. That \ndoes not contribute to quality nursing, and we need to address that \nshortage.\n  Quality nursing education is critical to ensuring that we have a \nsufficient number of qualified professionals joining the field. We need \nto ensure we are training not only the best and brightest to help out \nour patients but also bringing those nurses to join the ranks of nurse \neducators.\n  Providing adequate Federal funding for nursing workforce development \nprograms authorized under title 8 of the Public Health Service Act is \ncritical to ensure a sufficient nurse workforce to meet the growing \ndemand. I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of colleagues in \nsupporting an increased investment in title 8 which has been an \neffective solution with past nurse shortages. These programs support \nthe education of registered nurses, advanced practice registered \nnurses, nurse faculty, and nurse researchers.\n  Additionally, title 8 programs focus on recruitment and retention, \ntwo other distinct areas impacting this shortage.\n  Over the last 3 years, flat title 8 funding, combined with rising \neducational and administrative costs, as well as inflation, has \nsignificantly decreased the programs' purchasing power. Subsequently, \nthe number of grantees supported by the programs has decreased 43 \npercent over the past 4 years.\n  As Congress works to improve our health care system and ensure that \nevery American has access to quality, affordable health care, we must \nensure that we have a stable and well-trained nursing force.\n  We have an obligation to create a health care system that not only \nworks for patients but also works for people at the heart of our \npatient care--our nurses.\n  In closing, I want to note that I am soliciting my fellow Senators to \njoin me to form a Senate nursing caucus. The caucus will provide a \nforum to address issues affecting the nursing community and recognize \nand advance the important role of nurses in delivering high quality \nhealth care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, mounting debt is taking a big toll on \nfamilies throughout this Nation. That is why over the past few weeks we \nhave passed bills to stop mortgage scams and to prosecute corporate \nfraud and to lower fees for homeowners and help them into stable \nmortgages. Today we have an opportunity to continue to put Main Street \nfirst.\n  Over the last several months, I have heard credit card horror stories \nfrom my families all over the State of Washington. I have heard from \npeople who paid their cards on time but saw their supposedly fixed \nrates skyrocket unexpectedly or who had their minimum required payment \ndoubled with no notice.\n  I have heard from families who are 1 day late on their minimum \npayment, so the card company hiked up their rate and charged them a \nlate fee, which put their card over their credit limit and that \nincurred another fee.\n  I have heard from people who say their credit card company raised \ntheir minimum payment, and when they called to complain, they were \noffered their lower minimum payment back but only if they accepted a \ndramatic increase in the rate.\n  With so many of our families struggling to make ends meet today, it \nis especially important that we stand up to protect families from \nexcessive credit card fees from unexpected hikes in interest rates and \nminimum required payments and constantly changing credit card \nagreements that are designed to make a profit by keeping families in \ndebt. That is why we need to implement the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility and Disclosure Act, or CARD Act, to help protect \nconsumers from predatory and misleading lending practices.\n  The CARD Act we are going to be considering in the Senate today \nrequires credit card issuers to give 45 days' notice of rate increases \nand to provide clear disclosure of term changes when accounts are \nrenewed. It prohibits the so-called double-cycle billing where interest \nis assessed on the whole debt even when one portion was paid on time. \nIt prevents card companies from using a contract clause to raise \nconsumers' rates at any time for any reason that they choose. And it \nprohibits companies from issuing credit cards to anyone under the age \nof 21 unless the application is cosigned by a parent or guardian or the \nunderage consumer completes a certified financial literacy course.\n  We are going to bring fairness back to the system by stopping \nfinancial institutions from taking advantage of consumers with hidden \ncharges and misleading terms. No one should have to be surprised by \nchanges to interest rates or their minimum payments. These steps are \ngoing to help us level the playing field and are going to save families \nthousands of dollars a year.\n  This bill addresses a number of things that are keeping credit card \nusers in debt, and it is a good start. But at the same time we \nstrengthen protections for credit card users, we have to make sure that \npeople are empowered to make responsible decisions about their own \nfinancial future. Put another way, it is not enough to prevent credit \ncard companies from changing the rules when too many Americans don't \neven know the rules in the first place.\n  The reality is that over the last several years, too many Americans \nhave made poor or very often uninformed decisions about their finances. \nToo many overestimated their resources, didn't read the fine print, and \ndidn't grasp the terms of their financial responsibilities before they \nsigned on that dotted line. In fact, we have to recognize that too many \nAmericans, from college students all the way to senior citizens, are \nfinancially illiterate.\n  I recently heard from a constituent of mine in Spokane County whose \ndaughter had applied for credit cards shortly after she turned 18 years \nold. She, of course, didn't have much income and had difficulty making \nsome of those payments on time. Her mom said one of those cards had a \n$500 limit. But instead of the bank declining purchases that would \nexceed that limit, each purchase she made went through and the bank \ncharged a $37 fee for each and every one of them. Another bank charged \nher $7 every day because she had a $20 overdraft. Of course, she didn't \nhave any hope of paying down those debts on her own.\n  Those are problems that could have been avoided if she had simply \nunderstood her financial responsibilities and the terms of her \nfinancial agreements. That is exactly why I have introduced\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nbipartisan legislation to make sure we help people develop the skills \nthey need to make sound, informed financial decisions, from signing up \nfor credit cards to taking out a mortgage to planning for your \nretirement.\n  The Financial and Economic Literacy Improvement Act of 2009 will \nrequire the Federal Government to step to the plate and become a real \npartner in helping Americans manage their finances and make good, \ninformed financial decisions. It is a bipartisan bill. Senator Cochran \nhas cosponsored it with me.\n  The purpose of the bill is to give young people the tools to make \ninformed decisions about credit cards or student loans, to help them \nunderstand the importance of saving, and to have the knowledge to plan \na comfortable and dignified retirement down the road.\n  We used to say the three Rs of school were ``reading, writing, and \narithmetic.'' I think we need to add a fourth R: resource management.\n  Under our financial literacy bill, the Federal Government will become \na strong supporter of making financial literacy education a core part \nof our K-12 education. The bill would authorize $125 million annually \nfor our State and our local education agencies and their partnerships \nwith organizations experienced in providing high quality financial \nliteracy and economic instruction. That funding will help make \nfinancial literacy a part of our core academic classes. It will help to \ndevelop financial literacy standards and testing benchmarks and, \nimportantly, provide teacher training. It will also help schools weave \nfinancial concepts into some of their basic classes, such as math or \nsocial studies.\n  The training will not end in high school. This bill makes the same \ninvestment in teaching financial literacy in our 2- and 4-year schools. \nWhether it is skyrocketing interest rates on credit cards or an \nadjustable rate mortgage you can no longer afford or a retirement plan \nthey do not understand, I often hear the same thing from people: I wish \nthey had taught me this in school.\n  Our financial literacy bill will ensure that we are teaching it in \nschool and will help people learn those basic skills that are so \nnecessary that will give them a leg up when they deal with their banks \nor credit card companies.\n  Let me be clear, credit is not a bad thing. When used correctly, \ncredit can be a lifeline to the American dream. It can provide our \nentrepreneurs with the startup funds to become small business owners. \nIt can help small business owners with the capital to grow into bigger \nbusinesses. And it provides families with the financial security to \nplan for their future.\n  But at this important time in our history, as we reflect on financial \npractices, it is very important that we work to restore our credit card \nresponsibility for lenders and for consumers. That is why I am working \nto support this bill and my financial literacy legislation.\n  Just as families and consumers cannot afford unforeseen rate hikes \nand exorbitant card fees, we cannot afford for our young people today \nto not understand their own finances.\n  I congratulate Chairman Dodd on crafting the CARD Act, and I hope the \nSenate passes it quickly this week. I look forward to continuing to put \npriorities of Main Street first and following through with that next \nstep that is so important: passing the Financial and Economic Literacy \nImprovement Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in our home State of Illinois, we are \nlosing about 2,000 jobs a day. It is an indication of the economy going \nthrough a recession and the hardships that are being created across \nthis country. There is some good news, in the sense that perhaps we are \nturning a corner. I hope that is true. But let's not forget the victims \nand those who are casualties in this economic recession.\n  I recently received a letter, which I would like to read into the \nRecord, from one of my constituents in Illinois--from Hodgkins. This is \nwhat she wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin: I am a 61 year old female. I have \n     raised 6 children without the benefit of welfare, except for \n     6 months. The State of Illinois was unable to collect court \n     ordered child support. At one time I was working three jobs \n     to support us. I am not bragging but stating a fact that I am \n     not afraid to work. My children are now adults and I was, up \n     to August able to support just myself and finally live on my \n     own. For the last 23 years I have worked full time at a dry \n     cleaners. I now find myself downsized to part-time, hourly \n     instead of salary and in a position of real fear. I do not \n     have a pension. I no longer can afford health insurance. My \n     question to you is, ``What is going to happen to me and those \n     like me?'' Thank you for letting me vent and for listening.\n\n  I read this letter and saw my response. The staff prepared a good \nresponse about the issues of health insurance and the President's \nstimulus package and what we are trying to do. And I thought it just \nisn't enough. I handwrote a response to her and let her know I had not \nonly read her letter, but I was moved by this letter.\n  Many of the issues we debate on the floor of the Senate relate \ndirectly to this woman who has struggled through her entire life to \nprovide for her children and take care of herself without leaning on \nthe Government, and now she finds herself, at 61 years of age, in a \nvery vulnerable position. She has to wait 4 more years before she \nqualifies for Medicare. She has no health insurance. She is totally \nvulnerable to an accident or a diagnosis that can literally wipe out \nany meager savings she has put together and put her in a terrible \nposition.\n  People who face this do desperate things trying to keep things going. \nMany of them turn to credit cards, if they are lucky to have one. Too \noften they get too deeply into debt to those credit cards, and the \noutcome is not good. That is why the debate we are starting today on \nthe floor of the Senate about credit card reform is one that is very \ntimely. People across America are using these credit cards in an effort \nto try to stay afloat when they face a recession.\n  I receive countless letters, in addition to the one I just read into \nthe Record from Illinois, with stories about credit card companies \nspecifically. One woman wrote that she opened her statement recently to \nfind her credit card rate had jumped from 3.9 percent interest to 26.9 \npercent interest. She phoned her credit card company, and she was told \nher last payment had been posted 2 days late because of a technical \nproblem at her bank, which automatically pays her credit card bill each \nmonth. She did nothing wrong. Yet she was treated on the phone like a \ncriminal, in her words, and faced this dramatic increase in the \ninterest rate she had to pay on her credit card.\n  Another gentleman wrote that he paid $7 less than his minimum payment \n1 month and was immediately fined an $85 fee. Another wrote that his \ncredit card interest rate was increased from 8\\1/2\\ percent to 22\\1/2\\ \npercent. Yet he had never made a late payment or done anything else to \njustify the rate increase.\n  These people who wrote to me are totally at the mercy of the banks \nand these credit card companies. President Obama was right to call on \nthe credit card companies to stop this sort of outrageous behavior. \nChairman Dodd reported a very good credit card bill out of the Banking \nCommittee, and I am pleased the Senate is going to take up a version of \nthat bill this week.\n  The bill would bar many of the most abusive credit card practices \nthat banks have dreamed up over the years, including harmless sounding \npolicies such as universal default and double-cycle billing, which in \nfact are terrible for credit card borrowers.\n  The bill includes a provision that I have been promoting for nearly \n10 years. The bill would require that each credit card statement \ninclude, in clear terms, the cost of paying only the minimum amount due \neach month. Credit card statements would have to include two things: \nhow many months it would take to pay off the full balance if no more \npurchases were made on the card and if you just made the monthly \npayment, and how much interest the borrower would need to pay during \nthat\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\nperiod. If people better understood just how expensive it is to pay \nonly the minimum amount due each month, many people would save huge \namounts of money over the long term by paying a bit more on their \nbalances.\n  There are many good provisions in the bill such as the one I just \nmentioned, and I might add this is not a new idea. This is an idea I \nbrought to the Senate 8 or 9 years ago during the debate on bankruptcy \nreform. I said we are talking about people getting in debt and ending \nup in bankruptcy court and that they should at least be given fair \nnotice on their monthly credit card statements about what a minimum \nmonthly payment means. Tell them how much interest they would pay and \nhow long it would take to pay them off.\n  The banks and the credit card companies came back and said: Durbin, \nit is impossible to calculate; too difficult to calculate; we just \ncan't do it. They fought me and defeated my amendment. That was about 9 \nyears ago. Thank goodness we hung in there, and thank goodness Chairman \nChris Dodd on the Banking Committee took this provision which I had \noffered so many years ago, put it back in the bill, and this time the \nbanks have had to accept it.\n  I also wish to make this bill a little better, if I can, by setting \nlimits on the credit card industry going forward. I plan to file three \namendments this week. One would establish a new regulator, whose sole \npurpose would be to look out for the best interest of the consumers of \nfinancial products.\n  Understand what happens: If you go to the store today and buy a toy \nfor your child, you fully expect that somewhere, someone is taking a \nlook at it to make sure it is safe. You don't expect it to have lead \npaint that an infant or toddler might chew on, swallow, and have a \nnegative health outcome. You wouldn't expect the toaster you bought to \nbe faulty and catch fire in your kitchen. You wouldn't expect the \ntelevision set to blow up when you take it home. These are things you \nassume somewhere along the way someone has done some basic inspection \nof the product.\n  Well, we found a few years ago that our inspection services were not \ngood enough. The Consumer Product Safety Commission was not doing its \njob effectively. Those lead-based painted toys were coming in, and \nother dangerous toys, and so now we have completely reformed the law \ngoverning that commission, given them more authority and more power and \nmore staff to protect American consumers. It is a minimum that we \nexpect as consumers in America, that somebody is keeping an eye on \nthese products before they hit the shelves so that we can go ahead and \nshop with some confidence.\n  But what about financial instruments? How many Federal agencies keep \nan eye on credit cards to see if they are doing something with their \nnew practices which are abusive and shouldn't be allowed in this \ncountry? How many of them are taking a look at mortgage instruments to \nsee if there is a provision in the mortgage instrument that is being \noffered in America that is dangerous for consumers?\n  Let me give an example of one: prepayment penalty. Know what that \nmeans? You enter into a mortgage agreement, and if you are not careful, \nand you don't have somebody helping you, you might miss in one \nparagraph in that stack of papers you get at closing which says, if you \ndecide to prepay the mortgage, there is a penalty. It turns out that \nstarted in 2004. And because of a prepayment penalty, which many \nconsumers weren't even aware of, they were hooked into mortgages where \nthe interest rates exploded. So instead of being able to say, oops, I \nam going to push this old mortgage aside and get a new one at a lower \ninterest rate, you can't do it without paying a significant penalty--a \nprepayment penalty. So people were trapped into expensive high-interest \nmortgages.\n\n  You would think that somewhere along the way someone would have waved \nthe red flag and said to consumers across America, watch for this; \nprepayment penalties can become a hardship on you if you have one of \nthese adjustable mortgages. But that wasn't done. Despite the fact \nthere were Federal agencies that had the responsibility to keep an eye \nout for it, they didn't blow the whistle, and of course didn't have the \nauthority to stop it from happening.\n  What we are creating here is the Financial Product Safety \nCommission--a commission which would play the same role when it comes \nto financial instruments that the Consumer Product Safety Commission \ndoes when it comes to the toys and appliances and cars and other things \nwe buy, so we would have an agency not only with the authority to look \nat what is happening out there but to do something about it.\n  Trust me, as good as this credit card reform bill is--and I am hoping \nwe can pass it, and I am hoping the banks won't stop it when it gets to \nconference committee, and I am hoping the President will be able to \nsign it--the next day the people in this industry will sit down and \nsay, how do we get around it? What is the next thing we can do that \nthey didn't cover? Trust me, that is what is going to happen. You know \nit. So wouldn't it be good to have a watchdog agency that keeps an eye \non the financial industry and credit card industries on behalf of \nconsumers?\n  There are 10 different Federal agencies which are supposed to have \nthat responsibility, but few, if any, actually exercise it. Few, if \nany, say there are certain practices that are unacceptable, illegal, \nand we are going to stop them.\n  The second amendment I will file will be a Federal usury cap at a \nvery high level. What is a usury law? It is a limit on interest rates. \nThere was a time in America when that was considered normal; States \nwould have usury caps. The Federal government had a usury cap. But then \nthey went away in the interest of competition and free markets. We \ndecided we were not going to put a cap on interest rates, and so it has \nreached the point where there are very few usury caps left. What I have \nestablished, as the maximum, is 36 percent.\n  Nobody in their right mind would pay 36 percent on a mortgage, or 36 \npercent on a credit card. I mean, you would have to be out of your head \nto get into that kind of a predicament--a 36-percent annual interest \nrate. But the fact is Americans right and left are paying much higher \ninterest rates today and don't know it--payday loans, title loans, \ninstallment loans. Sit down and do the math and figure out to borrow a \nhundred dollars and what you end up paying, whether you are going to \none of those places and putting up the title of your car or letting \nthem have access to your checking account, which is a deadly thing to \ndo from a credit point of view. You end up paying interest rates that \ngo through the roof. I have actually had people sit in my office and \nsay, Senator, this 36-percent cap on interest rates will put us out of \nbusiness. I said: Well, how much do you charge? Well, somewhere between \n58 percent and 400 percent a year. I said: I hope you do go out of \nbusiness, because, quite frankly, they used to call that a juice loan \nwhen the syndicate and gangs were involved in it, but now it is \nlegitimate. It is legal.\n  So this 36-percent cap on interest is something which I know will be \nresisted by banks and title loans and payday loans and all the rest of \nthese folks, but it is about time we got real here. If we are not going \nto protect the American consumers when it comes to some of these \ninterest rates, they are going to be very vulnerable to some bad \npractices.\n  The third amendment would allow retailers--the department stores, \nconvenience stores, restaurants--to offer consumers discounts if they \nuse less expensive methods of payment. For example, they would say: If \nyou give us a credit card, here is your bill; but if you pay in cash, \nif you pay by check, or if you pay by a debit card, we will give you a \ndiscount. I don't think that is unreasonable. Because when it gets down \nto it, the extra charges the establishment has to pay for the use of a \ncredit card are kind of hidden inflaters in the cost of the product you \nbuy. If you can get a discount, I think it would be very helpful.\n  Ultimately, I believe these three amendments would move us toward a \nbetter bill. We are going to work with the sponsors of the legislation \nto see the best time and place to consider these amendments, and I am \ncertainly open to any good-faith effort to give us our day in court, as \nwe say here in the Senate, to debate these issues.\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n  I might say that when it comes to the Financial Product Safety \nCommission, it has the support of the Consumer Federation of America, \nthe Center for Responsible Lending, Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, and a wide array of groups that try to look out for the average \nperson in America who can't afford high-paid lobbyists to try to \nprotect them against some abuses and exploitations.\n  I think this is a move in the right direction. I commend this bill to \nmy colleagues. I hope we can add some significant amendments to it and \nI hope at the end of the day we will do something for the lady who \nwrote me, who now has seen her hours at the dry cleaners reduced, faces \nsome of the hardships of this economy, and is hoping that somewhere, \nsomeone on Capitol Hill will be keeping her interests in mind when we \nconsider this significant and historic legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I have a cloture motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Dodd-Shelby \nsubstitute amendment.\n  Nearly every adult American has at least one credit card. They \nprovide convenience, access, and service. They have become an essential \ntool for conducting financial transactions in this country and all over \nthe world.\n  The existing rules governing credit cards, however, no longer strike \nthe right balance between the interests of credit card companies and \nthe consumer.\n  Credit card contracts are unclear at best, and thoroughly confusing \nat worst. Card issuers raise rates for unclear reasons, use billing \nmethods that consumers do not understand, and assign fees and charges \nwithout warning. The bill seeks to remedy this by providing consumers \nwith greater transparency, fairer terms, and more certainty in their \ndealings with the card issuers.\n  During the committee markup before the Banking Committee, I made it \nclear that I shared many of Chairman Dodd's goals with respect to this \nissue. For example, I supported prohibiting double-cycle billing, \nbanning the practice of universal default, limiting certain fees, and \nplacing some restrictions on credit cards issued to young adults in \nthis country.\n  I also thought consumers deserved more and clearer disclosure \nregarding the terms of their agreements. Finally, I expressed to \nSenator Dodd the view that we should codify the Federal Reserve rules \nin a statute to ensure that they become permanent and not subject to \nthe whims of future regulators.\n  At the markup before the Banking Committee, however, I indicated \nthere were some areas where Chairman Dodd and I disagreed at that \npoint. Most notably, the original draft would have prohibited card \nissuers from using risk-based pricing for existing cardholders, both \nretrospectively and prospectively. I did not think it was wise to \nabandon the concept of risk-based pricing.\n  Without the means to price for risk, the credit card companies would \nbe forced to impose significant costs to all--all--users of credit \nbecause they would be unable to account for the particular risk of an \nindividual borrower. It would also be much more difficult for card \nissuers to innovate and create new products and services.\n  I believe credit should be priced according to the risk profile of \neach individual. Consumers who prudently manage their use of credit \ndeserve to be rewarded with lower prices and better terms. Moreover, \nthey should not be forced to subsidize the bad habits of others. I also \nbelieve markets must have the freedom to adapt to new circumstances and \nconsumer demands.\n  In the weeks that followed the Banking Committee markup, I worked \nwith Senator Dodd to craft a compromise that allowed for the use of \nrisk-based pricing. The Dodd-Shelby amendment before us allows card \nissuers to price risk but requires that they consider both positive and \nnegative changes in the consumer's risk profile when setting rates and \nterms. This means that consumers will pay more when their credit risk \ngoes up and can have their rates reduced when it comes down.\n  In total, the Dodd-Shelby substitute amendment reflects a broad, \nbipartisan compromise on many of the issues I raised in the committee. \nIt prohibits double-cycle billing, the practice of universal default, \nand places restrictions on credit cards issued to young adults. It \nlimits certain fees, provides more robust disclosure, and provides \nconsumers with statutory certainty. It also preserves the fundamental \nconcept of risk-based pricing, which is vital to the ongoing function \nof the credit card market.\n  I am hopeful this legislation has struck a better balance between the \nneeds of consumers and the credit card companies. I am also hopeful \nthis balance in design ultimately results in a balance in fact. To \nensure this, I asked that we include a provision in this substitute we \nhave offered that requires the Federal Reserve to track the impact this \nlegislation has on the cost and the availability of credit and to \nreport its findings to the Congress. Over time, if the Federal Reserve \nfinds we have not achieved that balance, in fact, we will be made aware \nand we should not then hesitate to make the necessary changes.\n  This legislation addresses some practices that are simply \nunnecessary. It gives consumers the chance to have a more equitable \nrelationship with the credit card companies. It also preserves the \nbasic framework necessary to maintain the function of a very important \nmarketplace.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Dodd, the chairman of the \ncommittee, on the floor of the Senate on this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the substitute \namendment offered by Senator Dodd and myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to thank my good \nfriend and colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, the former chairman \nof the committee and a very good partner to work with. I wish to thank \nBill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle, and Jim Johnson, as well as Amy Friend and \nCharles Yi and Lindsey Graham of my office who did a terrific job of \nworking together over long hours, including up and through a good part \nof this weekend, to reach an agreement on the substitute.\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked closely together over a number of \nyears, but during the last 2\\1/2\\ years of my chairmanship of the \ncommittee, I could not have asked for a better partner on this issue of \ntrying to develop whatever we can in terms of bipartisan solutions to \nproblems. This is an example. I suspect many people thought it would \nnot be possible. This is an issue that has divided people in the past--\ndealing with credit card reform and the needs of consumers--but because \nof the\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nhard work and because of the determination to try and reach that \nagreement, we are proud to announce today that we have a substitute to \noffer to our colleagues.\n  It is not everything everyone would like. There are certainly people \nwho will oppose this legislation because they think we have gone too \nfar. There are others who think we should be going much further. They \nwill make cases for that, I presume, in an amendment process. But this \nis a body of 100 Members. We deal with the other side of this building \nas well, not to mention the White House and other interests, in trying \nto meld those together. Major steps forward are not an easy task, but \nit is made easier when you have people you can work with who understand \nthe legislative process and who are willing to sit down and try and \ncompromise where we can on behalf of the people we represent.\n  This is a bill we are going to try to pass, not because the President \nwants it, not because Senator Shelby wants it, and not because I want \nit but because the American people need it. They are paying outrageous \nfees. They are watching exorbitant interest rates go up. Seventy \nmillion accounts over an 11-month period and one out of four families \nwatched credit card interest rates go up, in many cases at any time and \nfor any reason; not because they were late on payments, not because \nthey failed to pay but because the industry has the right, under their \ncontracts, to change those terms for any reason, at any time. That is \nunfair.\n  There is no other contractual relationship that I know of--when you \nbuy an automobile, when you buy a home, when you buy appliances, there \nis a contract. You don't change the terms of the contract after awhile \nbecause you don't like them or because you want to raise the rates. \nThere is an understanding there is a responsibility. Consumers have it \nbut lenders have it, too, in this case the issuers. But with 70 million \naccounts going up, interest rates going up, affecting 1 out of 4 \nfamilies at a very difficult time: when 10,000 families are losing \ntheir homes every day and 20,000 losing their jobs, the idea that the \ncard companies will raise those rates and add on fees is outrageous, \nand it affects every demographic group. It doesn't affect just one \nincome group; it is across the country. All of us hear, on a daily \nbasis, stories from our constituents about these egregious behaviors. \nSo our bill is designed to deal with this.\n  We like credit cards. They are a wonderful vehicle. They are a \nvaluable vehicle for many people. This is not to be punitive. It is \ncertainly not an expression of our opposition to the use of these \nvehicles. It is when these vehicles are being abused by the issuers at \nthe expense of consumers when we must step in and change the rules, and \nthat is what we are doing with this legislation.\n  I am pleased to be able to stand here, once again, with my friend \nfrom Alabama and thank him on the floor of the Senate for his \ncooperation in pulling this together. We urge our colleagues to take a \nlook at the bill, come on over, ask us and our staffs about it. We will \nbe glad to have a conversation with you. We are grateful as well that \ngroups such as the Consumer Federation of America and others are \nstrongly supporting this legislation.\n  This is a unique moment and opportunity. We spent the last 6 or 7 or \n8 months talking about financial institutions and getting them \nstabilized. We talked about TARP money, automobile bailouts, and all of \nthose sides of the equation. How about taking a week out to do \nsomething on behalf of the consumer, the average citizen who is \nsuffering terribly in this economic time and paying outrageous fees, \noutrageous interest rates; taking 1 week out to do something on their \nbehalf, while we have tried to do some of these other things. It is \nlong overdue. My hope is we can do it this week and send a bill to the \nPresident of the United States that accomplishes the goals we have \noutlined with this legislation.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Florida and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      American Journalist Released\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the morning's newspapers \nchronicle the happy fact that the American journalist Roxana Saberi was \nreleased from prison in Iran. This is a happy occasion, certainly for \nher and for her family, as she has been in Iran since 2003. She has \nbeen a journalist for National Public Radio and the BBC. She ostensibly \nwas arrested by virtue of having bought a bottle of wine and the \ncharges were later elevated to working without press credentials and \nespionage.\n  The fact is the U.S. Government weighed in on this. Secretary \nClinton, in a meeting with one of the high Iranian officials that had \nbeen called to a conference on Afghanistan in the Hague, the United \nStates handed the Iranian diplomats a letter calling for the release of \nMs. Saberi and, along with that, in that letter, calling for the \nrelease of Bob Levinson and Esha Momeni. Bob Levinson is from Florida. \nHe has a wife and seven children. He disappeared from the island of \nKish over 2 years ago. We have reason to believe he is being held in a \nprison, perhaps the very same prison where Ms. Saberi was held. Each \ntime his name is brought up to any Iranian officials, be it by me, be \nit by any other representative of the United States, the standard line \nis: We don't know anything about him, but usually that Iranian official \nwill then change the subject to the three Iranians being held by the \nAmericans in Irbil, Iran.\n  If they are suggesting some kind of exchange by consistently doing \nthis--whether it is with American officials or whether it is with the \nSwiss officials who represent us in Tehran; whatever it is--the release \nof Ms. Saberi is certainly a good first step. If the Iranians want a \nbetter relationship with the United States, clearly the new \nadministration has offered that. Now it is up to the Iranian officials. \nThey did the right thing by releasing Ms. Saberi yesterday. If they \nwant to additionally show a humanitarian gesture of returning a father \nand a husband to his wife and seven children, what better chance than \nto release Bob Levinson.\n  This Senator has met with the Iranian Ambassador to the United \nNations and, of course, received no information, even though the \nIranian Ambassador was very gracious in his hospitality. Perhaps he did \nnot even know, because in some of the information I expressed to him, \nhe expressed surprise. Whoever knows about it, whatever compartmented \npart of the Iranian Government knows about it, it is now time. If Iran \nwants to have a better relationship with the United States, this would \nbe the next humanitarian gesture: release Bob Levinson.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5351-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of Illinois, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes on an amendment I intend to offer but I will not offer at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I intend to offer \nat the proper time. I understand there is a bit of a parliamentary \nissue right now relative to amendments.\n  I intend to offer an amendment dealing with the issue of debt. \nObviously, this is a credit card bill, and debt is the topic of the \nday. But I am talking about the debt of the United States. One may say: \nHow does this affect the credit card bill? The interest on credit cards \nis driven in large part by what it costs to get money, and what it \ncosts\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nto get money is driven in large part by how much debt the United States \nhas to finance every year.\n  We are, unfortunately, in a situation where we are financing a \nmassive amount of debt. Regrettably, a lot of that debt is the result \nof the fact that the Government has had to move in and basically be the \nforce for liquidity in our economy, and thus the deficit has been \ndriven up dramatically.\n  The President estimated the deficit this year to be $1.8 trillion. \nThis is a massive number, almost incomprehensible for most people to \nunderstand. It represents four times more than the highest deficit I \nhave ever seen. More importantly, it reflects the fact that for every \ndollar we are spending in the Government today, 50 cents of it is \nborrowed, essentially. So we are borrowing half the money we are \nspending. That is a lot of debt. That adds to what is known as the \nnational debt. Right now, the national debt is about 40 percent of the \ngross national product. That is a survivable event, but after this \ndeficit this year, it is going to move up significantly.\n  Unfortunately, under the budget the President brought forward, it is \nprojected that there will be $1 trillion of new deficit every year for \nthe next 10 years. The practical implication of that is the national \ndebt grows astronomically. In fact, it doubles in 5 years, triples in \n10 years, and at the end of 10 years, we will have a national debt \nwhich is 80 percent of the gross national product.\n  To try to put that in context, because those are all just numbers, if \nwe as a nation wanted to get into the European Union, they have certain \nstandards where they say you have to be a responsible country in your \nspending, how much you are spending and how much you are borrowing. Two \nof the standards are that you cannot run a deficit that is more than 3 \npercent of your gross national product, and the second is, you cannot \nhave a national debt that exceeds 60 percent of your gross national \nproduct. This year, we will run a deficit that is 12.5 percent of our \ngross national product and we will have a national debt that is 40 \npercent and going up. It will become 80 percent in a brief period of \ntime. So under the rules of engagement for joining the European Union, \nwe would not be allowed in. Can you imagine, the United States could \nnot get into the European Union, but Latvia or Lithuania could? \nObviously, we do not want to be in the European Union, but when the \nindustrialized part of the world sets a standard for responsibly \ngoverning and we don't meet it, then something is fundamentally wrong.\n  What is wrong is we are passing on to our children a deficit and a \ndebt which is unsustainable, which means essentially they will not have \nthe type of prosperity we have had. It means they will have to pay so \nmuch in the way of maintaining the cost of the debt that they will be \nunable to afford buying a home, sending their kids to college, or \nliving the quality of lifestyle our generation has had. It is not fair \nfor one generation to do that to another generation, and it is \nespecially not fair to do it in the dark of the night where the \nAmerican people do not know what is happening, where they do not have \nthe information needed to make intelligent, thoughtful decisions on how \nfast they want this debt on their children to go up.\n  This amendment is an attempt to basically have full and fair \ndisclosure of what is happening with our national debt, how big it is \ngetting, how much it is going to cost, and who is going to have to pay \nit--the American people. It has three basic elements.\n  The first one is that there is a point of order created in this bill \nagainst any spending, any revenues or any appropriations legislation \nwhich doesn't have as part of its statement what effect that has on the \nnational debt--in other words, how much it is going to add to the \nnational debt--and what effect it has on every American in \nresponsibility for that debt. For example, the budget that was passed--\nthe President's budget, which I didn't vote for but which was passed \nanyway, the President's budget will increase the debt on every American \nhousehold by $133,000--$133,000--and it will increase the interest \nwhich each American has to pay on that debt by $6,000.\n  People should know that, in my opinion. That should be fully \ndisclosed. If we are going to have full and fair disclosure, and we \nshould, of what a person's credit card obligations are and what a bank \nrequires in the area of interest payments and what a bank requires in \nthe area of payment standards and how they can change interest \npayments, we should have full and fair disclosure to the American \npeople of how much their debt is because they are American citizens and \nhow much interest they have to pay on that debt because they are \nAmerican citizens. Because in many instances, $6,000 of annual interest \ncost to pay off the Federal debt will exceed a lot of people's payments \non their credit cards, and $130,000 of debt per household exceeds, in \nmany instances, the mortgage on a lot of people's homes. People should \nknow the type of debt and deficit that is being loaded onto them by \nthis Government, which is massively expanding the spending of the \nFederal Government.\n  The first item says there will be a point of order, and unless a bill \ncomes to this floor and is open and transparent on the issue of how \nmuch debt it creates per household and how much gross debt it creates \non the American people, it will take 60 votes to pass that bill. It \nwill be subject to a point of order.\n  The second amendment will be to formally disclose this information by \nusing the IRS, by putting in place a system where in the IRS \ninstructions for your 1040 form you will be informed of how much debt \nis owed and what the debt is per person in this country. You will be \nkept posted as a citizenry to suggest what is happening to you and your \ncountry relative to debt and deficits for which you have to pay.\n  The third item, in order to keep people informed and have \ntransparency, will require that every home page of every Federal agency \nmust have what is known as the debt clock, which shows how much the \ndebt is going up on a daily basis. So that if you are trying to find \nsome program at HUD or trying to find some program at the SBA or trying \nto find some program at transportation, when you go on that site, you \nwill be informed immediately as to what the debt of the United States \nis and how much it is going up. This is fair and transparent and it is \nappropriate.\n  Remember what is driving all this debt, and I think that is important \nfor people to understand. This debt is being driven primarily by a \nmassive expansion in spending. The President said--and I admire him for \nhis forthrightness--that he believes you can create prosperity by \ndramatically growing the size of the Federal Government, by increasing \nthe spending of the Federal Government. In his proposal, under his \nbudget, it will take the spending of the Federal Government from 20 \npercent of gross national product up to 23, 24, 25 percent of gross \nnational product. Those are huge numbers in the way of increase. We \nhave never had that type of spending level in this country, except \nduring World War II. Historically, the spending of the Federal \nGovernment has been about 20 percent of GDP, not 21, not 22, not 23, \nand not 24.\n  But that is the proposal of this administration because they \ngenerally believe in and they have stated it and they put out a budget \nwhich has called for this massive expansion in spending. I don't happen \nto agree that is the way you create prosperity. I believe the way you \ncreate prosperity is having a government you can afford, having a \ngovernment which you pass on to our children which is affordable to \nthem, and giving individuals the opportunity to take risk and go out \nand create jobs.\n  It is very hard, for example, for a small businessperson to invest in \ntheir small business--whether it be a restaurant or a small software \ncompany or a repair shop--if their taxes are going to have to go up at \nsuch a rate in order to pay this debt that the money they would have \nused to invest for the purpose of creating jobs is skimmed off by the \nGovernment for the purposes of funding this massive expansion. That is \nnot the best way to create prosperity. It makes much more sense to have \na manageable government.\n  We are not talking about cutting the size of Government. Nobody is \nsuggesting that. It doesn't happen around here. We are talking about \nhaving it be a reasonable size, something that is affordable, something \nour children can\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\npay for, not something that creates a debt and a deficit that is so \nhigh it is unaffordable.\n  Here is another number that is important or interesting. At the end \nof President Obama's budget cycle here, the interest on the debt will \nbe over $800 billion a year. That is interest. Interest on the Federal \ndebt will almost be $1 trillion a year. That will be more than we spend \non national defense. It will be, by a factor of five or six times, more \nthan we spend on education, more than we spend on roads. That is not \nright. We shouldn't be spending all this money on interest. We should \nbe spending it on real programs that do real things to benefit real \npeople. But you can't do that if you run up the debt so much.\n  It seems reasonable that we should have full and fair disclosure to \nthe American people not only about their credit cards and how they are \nbeing treated by their banks or the issuer of the credit cards, but we \nshould also have full and fair disclosure to the American people about \nwhat the Government is doing to them, about what this Congress is doing \nto them, about the amount of deficit and debt that is being put on \ntheir back on a daily basis as we spend money around here as if there \nis no tomorrow.\n  That is all this amendment does. It shouldn't be all that \ncontroversial because these are fairly reasonable things. We should \ninform people, when we have a bill as to how much that bill is going to \ncost in the way of added debt, not only to the national debt but to \neach citizen who is going to have to pay for that bill. We should send \nout with your IRS forms a summary of how much debt is owed and how it \nwill affect you as an individual. When you go on a Federal site, you \nshould be able to find out fairly easily--and it should be set right \nout there so it is transparent and clear--what the national debt is and \nhow quickly it is going up.\n  Believe me, credit cards are an important issue in people's lives. \nThe way they are handled is important. But equally important, \nespecially for our children, is going to be how much deficit and how \nmuch debt we run up as a government.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the majority side in allowing me to \nspeak at this time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n5:45 p.m. be for debate with respect to Coburn amendment No. 1067, with \nthe time equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees; that no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to a \nvote; that adoption of the amendment require an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold; further, that if the amendment achieves that threshold, then \nthe amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that if the amendment does not achieve that threshold, then \nit be withdrawn; provided that amendment No. 1068 be withdrawn upon \ndisposition of amendment No. 1067; that no further amendments on the \nsubject of these amendments be in order to H.R. 627; and that at 5:45 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. \n1067, and that of the time of the Republicans, Senator Coburn be given \n20 minutes, and of the Democratic time, Senator Feinstein be given 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, would you advise me when I have 10 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I will.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me say to the majority leader before he leaves, I \nwant to thank him for his good-faith effort in working with us on this \namendment. I appreciate the manner in which he has done that.\n  I want everybody to know what my motivation is. This is not about a \npolitical vote. I know it seems that way, but that is further from the \ntruth than anything that I know. This is about the U.S. Constitution.\n  We have two agencies within the Federal Government that, through \nbureaucratic means, not a vote of Congress, have limited severely the \nsecond amendment rights of individuals in this country, both on \nNational Park and Fish and Wildlife Service land. That is 190 million \nacres--190 million acres.\n  So the motivation is for the Congress to decide when we are going to \ntake away rights guaranteed under the Constitution. We have had a \nrecent Supreme Court ruling that has upheld the second amendment in a \nstrong fashion for what it really is, and this is reserved to citizens \nof this country.\n  This is not about hunting. This is not about having a gun to go \nhunting. A lot of people are going to make statements about, this is \ngoing to increase poaching. It does not have anything to do with that. \nIt will not affect that at all.\n  In fact, on U.S. Forest Service land, the second amendment reigns as \na right guaranteed under the Constitution. Under Bureau of Land \nManagement land, the second amendment reigns. They do not have any \nsignificant increase in poaching versus the areas where we do not have \nguns. So the point is that people who are going to break the law are \ngoing to break the law. So we see no difference.\n  The second point I would make is that this is about States rights. \nSenator Feinstein is going to come down and talk about this. But if \nCalifornia decides they do not want guns in their State parks, they do \nnot have to have them. If they decide that, then this amendment would \nsay they do not have to have them in the Federal parks.\n  What it says is that we are going to allow the States the right to \ndetermine, under their gun laws, who can have a gun and where, as long \nas it passes the muster of the U.S. Constitution.\n  So this amendment has two key points. One is to protect the second \namendment; and if we are to choose to eliminate somebody's second \namendment rights, the Congress ought to be onboard as affirmatively \nlimiting those rights rather than bureaucrats.\n  The second point is to say that States should reign supreme in terms \nof their parks and the national parks in their jurisdiction so that \nthey have coverage over what their State gun laws would have in terms \nof application.\n  Let me reveal data, talking about national parks, that I don't \nbelieve many people are aware of. The latest year for which we have \nstatistics is 2006. There were 16 homicides, 41 rapes, and multiple \nattempted rapes, 92 robberies, 16 kidnappings, 333 aggravated assaults, \nand 5,094 other felony violations. We have 1 park ranger for every \n100,000 visitors, and we have 1 park ranger for every 180,000 acres. \nWhat we know is that if in your State you have the right to carry on to \npublic lands or if you have conceal carry laws, that ought to have \napplication to your State, not to the Federal Government's predominance \nover your State.\n  The numbers I cited only reflect what the Park Service has \ninvestigated. They do not reflect all the other offenses of the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, which are thousands. It doesn't reflect the Federal \nBureau of Investigations or local law enforcement investigations in \nthese areas. So even though parks are relatively safe, the fact is that \noftentimes the best deterrent is for the criminal to know that if they \nhave a gun, somebody else might also have a gun.\n  As a physician, I hate what guns do. I don't want guns to be used. \nBut the fact is, the second amendment to the Constitution is real. What \nwe have is a situation before us where bureaucrats have said: We will \ntake your rights away. It may be that the Congress says we should do \nthat. But if we do it, it ought to be us doing it, not unelected \nbureaucrats through redtape fiat to truly limit your ability and your \nrights guaranteed under the Constitution.\n  What does this amendment do? This amendment restores the second \namendment rights as outlined in each individual State back to the \nnational parks and Fish and Wildlife Service. It says if States want to \nchange their laws with regard to those, they can. But it leaves it to \nthe government at the closest level to the people rather than the one \nfarthest away from the people.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  We will have a lot of claims that this will have an impact on \npoaching. It won't have any impact. But even if it does, tell me how \npoaching, the unauthorized killing of animals, is a higher value order \nthan a right guaranteed under the Constitution. You can't find it. If \nwe are that upside down in our country about guaranteed rights and the \nBill of Rights and the underlying Constitution, then we are in a lot \nmore severe trouble than most of us would recognize.\n  What we also know is that on Forest Service lands, we see a certain \namount of poaching, but we have a certain amount of poaching now on \nparklands. So we are not going to see a corresponding increase. And if \nwe do, it is still illegal.\n  This amendment doesn't apply to national monuments. It preserves \nStates rights. That means no national monument does this amendment \napply to. It preserves a State's right to do what it should do. In \nfact, it makes Congress responsible for the limiting of our rights \nunder the Constitution rather than bureaucrats.\n  The consequences of the rules that we have today are bizarre. Not \nlong ago on the Blue Ridge Parkway, a gentleman was convicted who had a \nVirginia right to carry. But because he drove through the national park \nwith his gun not broken down and not in his trunk, he was convicted of \na violation of national park policy. He was traveling from one place in \nVirginia to another and went through a park, as he did that on the \nroadway. So he was found liable under a Federal law which was never \nintended by us and never intended under the Constitution. Yet he was \ncompliant with his own State's gun laws.\n  The whole purpose of this amendment is not a gotcha amendment. It is \nto say: Does the second amendment mean something? If we are going to \nlimit it, it ought to be us who do it. Do States rights mean anything \nand should we have bureaucrats limiting individual rights versus the \nCongress? If it is going to happen, the Congress has to be the body \nthat does it.\n  For decades, regulations enacted by unelected bureaucrats at the \nNational Park Service, NPS, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nFWS, have prohibited law-abiding citizens from possessing firearms on \nsome Federal lands. The enactment of these rules pre-empted State laws, \nbypassed the authority of Congress, and trampled on the constitutional \nrights of law-abiding Americans guaranteed by the second amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  This legislation enables Congress to belatedly weigh in on this \nimportant matter.\n  The Protecting Americans from Violent Crime Act of 2009 would ensure \nState gun laws and citizens' constitutional rights are honored on \nFederal lands by prohibiting the Department of Interior from creating \nor enforcing any regulations prohibiting an individual, not otherwise \nprohibited by law, from possessing a firearm in national parks and \nwildlife refuges in compliance with and as permitted by State law.\n  This legislation would prohibit Federal bureaucrats, activist judges, \nand special interest groups from infringing on the right for law-\nabiding Americans to defend themselves and their families in national \nparks and refuges. This legislation does not affect current hunting and \npoaching rules in national parks and refuges.\n   This legislation is still needed.\n  While the Department of the Interior, DOI, finalized regulations \npermitting the possession of firearms in national parks and refuges in \naccordance with State law over a 2-year time period, several anti-gun \ngroups have successfully sued the Department of the Interior to prevent \nthis rule from being implemented for the time being.\n  An activist judge blocked the final gun-in-parks rule because the \nBush administration did not conduct an environmental impact analysis of \nthe rule change. Such an analysis was not conducted because the rule \nchange neither authorized the discharging of conceal carry weapons, nor \nthe poaching of animals.\n  DOI decided not to appeal this ruling, and is, instead, conducting a \nlengthy environmental review before it makes a final determination on \nthe rule change.\n  Even if this rule, allowing visitors to carry concealed firearms in \naccordance with State law, is reinstated, future administrations or \nactivist judges could repeal these regulations without congressional \napproval. Unelected bureaucrats and judges should not continue to have \nthe ability to revoke a constitutional right of law-abiding Americans. \nPassing this legislation will help ensure that such a comprehensive gun \nban may never again be enacted by unelected officials.\n  Congressional leadership inappropriately blocked consideration of \nthis measure repeatedly.\n  Members of Congress have repeatedly attempted to bring up this \nmeasure for a clean, fair vote. Unfortunately, congressional leadership \nhas gone to extreme lengths to avoid having a straight up-and-down vote \non this measure.\n  On December 19, 2007, Majority Leader Reid entered into the record \nthe following unanimous consent agreement:\n\n       Mr. REID. `Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \n     Senate proceed to Calendar No. 546, S. 2483, the energy lands \n     bills, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \n     following consultation with the Republican leader, and that \n     when considered, it be considered under the following \n     limitations: that the only amendments in order be five \n     related amendments to be offered by Senator Coburn; that upon \n     disposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time, \n     and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n       The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is \n     so ordered.\n\n  This agreement permitted five related amendments to an omnibus bill \nthat included dozens of bills that modified National Park Service \nlands. The Parliamentarian ruled legislation allowing for firearm \npossession in national parks in accordance with State and Federal law \nwas related and in compliance with Senator Reid's requirement. Instead \nof honoring this agreement, however, they majority leader pulled the \nentire bill from the floor and reintroduced a nearly identical measure \nto technically ``honor'' the unanimous consent agreement without \nallowing for a vote on related firearm legislation.\n  Repeated attempts to bring this bill to the new bill were thwarted. \nConsequently, a version of this bill was included at a Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee markup along with a package of lands \nbill. This amendment was adopted as a stand-alone measure by an 18-5 \nvote with the understanding that this bill would be included with the \npackage of lands bill approved during the same markup. Despite a letter \nsigned by five Senators on the committee asking the chairman of the \ncommittee, ``to honor this agreement and the bipartisan will of the \nCommittee by including S. 3499 in the Omnibus Public Land Management \nAct of 2008,'' this measure was excluded yet again.\n  When Members of the House of Representatives were close to forcing \nconsideration of the Protecting Americans from Violent Crime Act as an \namendment to this year's Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, \nalmost identical to the 2008 bill, Democratic leadership in the House \nand Senate coordinated to pull the bill from the floor in the House and \nadd the entire bill in the Senate as a replacement to a previously \npassed House bill on designating a battlefield as a historic site. \nWhile Democratic leadership in the Senate had already managed to block \na vote on the Protecting Americans from Violent Crime Act, by enacting \nthis maneuver, the House leadership was also able to block any \namendments from being considered in the House.\n  Last attempts to add firearm legislation to the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act of 2009 proved unsuccessful.\n   Gun bans on Federal property were enacted by unelected bureaucrats \nwithout the authority of Congress.\n  In 1936 the National Park Service established regulations banning \nfirearms in national parks. These regulations were updated in 1983 to \nallow for guns to be transported through national parks if they were \nunloaded and stored in the trunk of cars.\n  In 1976 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service established similar \nregulations for Federal refuges. These regulations were last updated in \n1981.\n  Congress has never endorsed or debated these gun bans.\n  Unfortunately, however, State laws permitting concealed carry of \nfirearms were not recognized on Federal land managed by NPS and FWS. \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\non these lands could not possess a loaded firearm in or on a motor \nvehicle, a boat or vessel except in specific circumstances. Firearms \ncould only be transported in or on a motor vehicle, boat or horse if \nthey were rendered temporarily inoperable, or packed, stored or cased \nin a manner that prevented their ready use. The penalties for violating \nthe gun prohibition included a fine of $5,000 and 6 months in prison.\n  In addition to criminalizing law-abiding citizens for exercising \ntheir constitutional rights, these regulations exposed the great threat \nof bureaucrats overstepping their authority--a threat that still \nexists.\n  These regulations and the corresponding penalties were established \nwithout any congressional mandate or legislative approval.\n  It is troubling that Government bureaucrats, single-interest groups, \nand activist judges could take away the rights of law-abiding citizens \nguaranteed by the Federal Constitution on Federal property and without \nthe consideration of the Federal representatives of the people. The \nSupreme Court recently ruled that a complete ban on firearms is \nunconstitutional, yet Federal bureaucrats have managed to completely \nban firearms for over 70 years on all 83.6 million acres of national \npark lands and for over 30 years on all 90.79 million acres of FWS \nlands, except for hunting purposes.\n  Recently, a judge also repealed the new regulations governing firearm \npossession in national parks and refuges on the grounds that no \nenvironmental review was completed prior to the promulgation of the \nrule.\n  It is unclear how allowing conceal carry has a significant impact on \nthe environment, or how the National Environmental Protection Act \nsupersedes the second amendment rights of law-abiding Americans on more \nthan 170 million acres of Federal lands.\n  While the activist judge ruled administration officials ``abdicated \ntheir congressionally mandated obligation'' to evaluate environmental \nimpacts and ``ignored, without sufficient explanation, substantial \ninformation in the administrative record concerning environmental \nimpacts'' of the rule, she failed to consider the constitutional \nobligation to protect the right to bear arms.\n  A handful of unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats and judges \nshould not possess the ability to overstep the authority of the U.S. \nCongress, the Supreme Court, or the U.S. Constitution. ``There was no \nlegislative process--[NPS and FWS] bureaucrats arbitrarily terminated \nthis Constitutional right.''\n  Given the fact that a recent investigator general report of the FWS \nOffice of Law Enforcement found that this agency has been unable to \neven account for firearms under their own management, it also seems \ninappropriate for these agencies to concern themselves with regulating \nthe second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.\n  It is clear that Congress should address this issue, and many in \nCongress have already expressed their opposition to these regulations, \nincluding 18 of the 23 members of the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources in the 110th Congress who voted for this amendment--\nincluding the current Secretary of the Interior. Fifty Senators, \nincluding 9 Democrats and 41 Republicans, also signed two letters to \nformer Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne asking him to remove \nthese regulations. Several additional Senators have indicated their \nsupport for allowing State laws to govern firearm possession on public \nlands and 25 Senators sponsored similar legislation last Congress.\n  Even the Department of the Interior--the agency that oversaw the \ncreation of these regulations--commented in 2008 that ``It's \nappropriate to look at updating these regulations, to bring them into \nconformity with state laws [on guns use]. Following the release of the \nfinal regulations, a spokesman for the Department of the Interior \npointed out, ``This is the same basic approach adopted by the Bureau of \nLand Management and the United States Forest Service, both of which \nallow visitors to carry weapons consistent with applicable federal and \nstate laws. . . . Federal agencies have a responsibility to recognize \nthe expertise of the states in this area, and Federal regulations \nshould be developed and implemented in a manner that respects state \nprerogatives and authority.''\n\n  No other federal land agency has enacted anti-gun rules similar to \nthe National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  As a spokesman for the Department of the Interior pointed out in a \npress release, both the Bureau of Land and Management and the U.S. \nForest Service allow for the law of the State in which the Federal \nproperty is located to govern firearm possession.\n  FS and the BLM have not experienced any difficulties as a result of \nallowing firearm possession.\n  According to the BLM, ``Laws and reg[ulation]s pertaining to \nconcealing and carrying firearms are within [states'] jurisdiction and \nwe only enforce them on public land if we have state authority by way \nof a local agreement. The BLM has some regulations on the use of \nfirearms that pertain to specific areas, such as recreation sites and \nother areas that may be closed to shooting (but that does not make it \nillegal to possess a firearm in those areas).''\n  If other land preservation agencies never had to enact regulations \ninfringing on the second amendment--including one agency within the \nDepartment of the Interior--why did NPS and FWS, which are both within \nthe Department of the Interior?\n  This legislation will protect law-abiding citizens without \nthreatening natural resources or wildlife.\n  These anti-gun regulations were intended to ``ensure public safety \nand maximum protection of natural resources,'' according to Scot \nMcElveen, the president of the Association of National Park Rangers.\n  According to NPS and FWS, prohibiting citizens to carry legally owned \nand registered firearms was necessary to prevent the poaching of \nanimals living on NPS and FWS lands. Anti-gun groups sued the \nDepartment of the Interior to repeal the implementation of the \nfinalized rule change, claiming in part that overturning the gun ban \nwill compromise the safety of humans and animals.\n  The Department of Justice argued against the lawsuit, pointing out \nthat the new rule ``does not alter the environmental status quo, and \nwill not have any significant impacts on public health and safety.''\n  This legislation will likewise not enable or permit illegal hunting \nof animals on these lands. Other NPS and FWS regulations specifically \ngoverning illegal hunting will remain in place, ensuring that poaching \nwill still be illegal.\n  It will also not authorize the discharging of firearms or target \npractice in these natural reserves.\n  Proponents of these extreme gun restrictions have also claimed that \nthe unconstitutional regulations are a necessary law enforcement tool \nagainst poaching and other crimes. They reason that if guns are \noutlawed in parks and refuges, law enforcement can use the possession \nof a firearm to prosecute would-be poachers.\n  In addition to the fact that the second amendment was not recognized \nby our founders to give law enforcement officers in national parks and \nrefuges an additional tool to eliminate poaching, the fact that both \nBLM and FS have not ``required'' these additional regulations further \nproves these anti-gun regulations are unnecessary.\n  As the former Department of the Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne \npoints out, ``Since the [proposed federal regulations similarly] \nmaintain existing prohibitions on poaching and target shooting, and \ncarrying weapons in federal buildings, [it] would not cause a \ndetrimental impact on visitor safety and resources.''\n  Crime rates on Federal lands are rising.\n  National parks, while still generally safe for visitors, have seen an \nincrease in crime.\n  According to the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife \nService, in 2006 there were 16 homicides, including one manslaughter \ncharge, 41 rape cases, including two attempted rapes, 92 robberies, 16 \nkidnappings, and 333 aggravated assaults out of 5094 part I offenses. \nIn national parks there were a total of 116,588 offenses. These \noffenses only include homicides and other\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\ncrimes handled by national park and refuge law enforcement, but don't \naccount for the homicides and crimes other law enforcement agencies \nprocessed--e.g. the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Drug Enforcement \nAgency, local law enforcement.\n  Overriding State laws that give its residents the ability to defend \nthemselves may increasingly place NPS and FWS visitors in unnecessary \ndanger.\n  NPS and FWS anti-gun regulations disarm individuals and leave them \nand their families vulnerable to crime on public lands.\n  In a Seattle Times article titled ``Crime Slowly Creeps Into Parks, \nForests,'' Captain John Klaasen of the U.S. Forest Service states, ``If \nyou see [a crime] happening in the city, it happens in the forest.'' \nWhether it is meth labs hidden amid lush forests or car prowls at \ntrailheads, park rangers and forest officers are seeing an increasing \namount of criminal behavior.\n  Following the grisly murders of four women at Yosemite National Park \nin 1999, Elaine Sevy with the National Park Service stated, ``You're \nnot escaping society when you come to the parks. Understand that parks \nare a microcosm of society.''\n  For many criminals, parks and forests offer a safe haven. \nConsequently, visitors enjoying some of our Nation's natural treasures \nare increasingly vulnerable to harm and personal injury.\n  According to a San Francisco Chronicle article, ``National Parks' Pot \nFarms Blamed on Cartels; Mexican Drug Lords Find it Easier to Grow in \nState Than Import;''\n\n       Hikers in national parks such as Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings \n     Canyon are encountering a danger more hazardous than bears: \n     illegal marijuana farms run by Mexican drug cartels and \n     protected by booby traps and guards carrying AK-47s. . . . \n     Park service officials said the drug cartels took extreme \n     measures to protect their plants, which can be worth $4,000 \n     each. Growers have been known to set up booby traps with \n     shotguns. Guards armed with knives and military-style weapons \n     have chased away hikers at gunpoint. In 2002, a visitor to \n     Sequoia was briefly detained by a drug grower, who threatened \n     to harm him if he told authorities the pot farm's secret \n     location.''\n\n  A more recent news story also highlighted this dilemma. Special agent \neradication teams heavily armed are needed to clear thousands of pot \nplants in State and national parks and other public lands. Many of the \nmarijuana fields are located next to popular trails. However, ``The \nfolks who are growing the marijuana are not your peace hippies from the \n60s . . . These are armed members of the Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations, who utilize assault style weapons, assault rifles to \nprotect their cash crops.''\n  A February 2005 report, ``Marijuana and Methamphetamine Trafficking \non Federal Lands Threat Assessment,'' concluded that already high \nlevels of cultivation of cannabis and methamphetamine production by \nMexican drug-trafficking organizations are likely to increase.\n  ``Cannabis cultivators and methamphetamine producers on federal lands \noften are armed, and cannabis grow sites and methamphetamine \nlaboratories frequently are booby-trapped. Law enforcement officers \nhave seized shotguns, handguns, automatic weapons, pipe bombs, \ngrenades, and night vision equipment from drug producers and smugglers \non federal lands.''\n  With one law enforcement officer for about every 110,000 visitors and \n118,000 acres of national park land, park police may not always be \nclose by and individuals may be left to defend themselves. While park \nrangers now use bullet-proof vests and automatic weapons to enforce the \nlaw, regular Americans in States where carry laws exist, are denied the \nopportunity for self-defense because of these NPS and FWS regulations.\n  Drug and human smuggling across the U.S. Mexico border has made it \nimpossible and dangerous for scientists to continue their research and \nfor visitors to frequent ``well-marked but unofficial trails'' in a \nnational park.\n  ``Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument stopped granting most new \nresearch permits because of increasing smuggling activity. Scientists \nmust sign a statement acknowledging that the National Park Service \ncannot guarantee their safety from ``potentially dangerous persons \nentering the park from Mexico.''\n  Lands managed by the Department of the Interior lands make up more \nthan 39 percent of our border with Mexico. Mexican drug trafficking \norganizations smuggling operations rely on back routes and private \nroads through these lands to transport marijuana and methamphetamine. \nThese drugs are primarily smuggled through NPS and FWS lands.\n  A report by the National Parks Conservation Association in 2007 \ntitled ``Perilous Parkland: Homeland Security and the National Parks'' \ndetailed how over the past 2 years at Organ Pipe Cactus National \nMonument, ``park rangers have arrested and indicted 385 felony \nsmugglers, seized 40,000 lbs. of marijuana, and intercepted 3,800 \nillegal aliens. The Border Patrol estimated that 500 people per day \n(180,000 per year) and 700,000 pounds of drugs entered the U.S. \nillegally through the monument in the year 2000.'' It is no wonder the \nlaw enforcement staff of 11 park rangers is encountering difficulties \nin managing a 330,000-acre park with numerous activities initiated by \nMexican drug cartels.\n  This park was ranked by the Fraternal Order of Police as the most \ndangerous national park in 2003. While two other parks on the Mexico-\nU.S. border were listed in top 10 most dangerous national parks in \n2003, other parks included on this list were in States such as New \nJersey, Florida, Virginia and Wyoming--Yellowstone National Park.\n  The Government Accountability Office, in a report entitled a \n``Actions Needed to Better Protect National Icons and Federal Office \nBuildings from Terrorism,'' additionally expressed concern with the \nability of the Interior Department to maintain adequate security in the \npost-9/11 world of heightened alerts due to potential terrorist \nattacks. According to a survey by the National Park Service, safety \nconcerns have played a significant role in the decreasing number of \nNational Park visitors.\n  Another result of this surge is that, ``National Park Service \nofficers are 12 times more likely to be killed or injured as a result \nof an assault than FBI agents.''\n  According to the group Public Employees for Environmental \nResponsibility, ``National Park Service commissioned law-enforcement \nofficers were victims of assaults 111 times in 2004, nearly a third of \nwhich resulted in injury. This figure tops the 2003 total of 106 \nassaults and the 2002 total of 98.''\n  Because of this threat, rangers in higher crime areas often carry \nautomatic weapons and wear bullet-proof vests.\n  In a CBS News article titled ``Crime Rates Up in National Parks--More \nRangers Find Themselves Battling Lawlessness,'' former executive \ndirector of the U.S. Park Rangers Lodge of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice and 30-year park ranger, Randall Kendrick noted that ``The \nNational Park Service has an astoundingly poor safety record for its \nofficers . . . If anything, these assaults against park rangers are \nundercounted. If there is not a death or injury, pressures within \na national park can cause the incident to be reported as being much \nmore minor than it is in reality, and it is not unheard of for an \nassault to go unreported altogether.\n\n  FWS refuges have also experienced significant crime and law \nenforcement concerns. The Cooperative Alliance for Refugee Enhancement \nreleased a report this past May that pointed out that refuges are also \nbecoming increasingly dangerous to visitors. According to the report \n``Restoring America's Wildlife Refuges,'' there is one law enforcement \nofficer for every 555,000 acres of refuges.\n  President of the National Wildlife Refuge Association and chairman of \nC.A.R.E., Evan Hirsche, said the following:\n\n       A decrease in law enforcement has left the refuges \n     vulnerable to criminal activity, including prostitution, \n     torched cars and illegal immigrant camps along the Potomac \n     River in suburban Washington, methamphetamine labs in Nevada \n     and pot growing operations in Washington state. . . In some \n     cases, we find that drug operations have set up shop in \n     refuges.\n\n  The C.A.R.E. report finds that, ``On many wildlife refuges, drugs are \na serious problem. These aren't small-time marijuana gardens; drug \noperators on refuges frequently defend their plots with armed guards . \n. . A 2005 report by the International Association of Chiefs of Police \n(IACP) detailed the urgent need for additional law enforcement to\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\nrespond to commercial-scale drug production and trafficking, wildlife \npoaching, vandalism, assaults, and a host of other crimes.\n  For example, according to C.A.R.E., because of staffing cuts, \nTishomingo National Wildlife Refuge located in Oklahoma, will now share \none law enforcement officer with a refuge in Texas--one law enforcement \nofficer for 200,000 annual visitors.\n  While better prioritization of Federal funds may be needed to \nincrease law enforcement efforts in our public parks, refuges, and \nforests, allowing visitors to national parks and refuges to possess \nguns provides responsible gun owners the ability to defend themselves \nin the event that other protection is not available.\n  Gun regulations were confusing, burdensome and ineffective.\n  The contradictory patchwork of Federal regulations within different \nagencies created the scenario where a law-abiding gun owner traveling \nfrom public land managed by BLM to an adjacent NPS or FWS unit was \nsubject to a $5,000 fine and a 6 month prison sentence for violating \nFederal regulations.\n  In many States, people have to pass through designated Federal lands \nevery day. They should be able to do so without having to worry about \nwhich laws apply on what type of public land, if they are authorized to \ncarry firearms under State law.\n  A man driving along the Blue Ridge parkway in Virginia was stopped \nfor failing to obey a stop sign by a national park ranger. Upon further \ninspection, the ranger found two loaded firearms in the car. The \ndefendant was licensed to conceal carry under Virginia State law and \ndid not know he was in violation of National Park Service regulations \nand had not observed any signs prohibiting the possession or \ntransportation of loaded and operational firearms. The road he was on \nalso serves as highway between routes 460 and 220 in the Roanoke area. \nThe defendant was found guilty, even though he was in his car and \npermitted under State law to possess firearms because of an \nadministrative rule.\n  The bureaucrats seemingly well intended goal of ``protecting'' the \npublic and natural resources holds the same flaws of other anti-gun \nefforts: It ensures that only criminals possess firearms and makes law \nabiding citizens subject to criminal penalties for exercising their \nconstitutional rights.\n  An editorial in the Colorado Spring Gazette pointed out that ``Armed \nlaw-abiding citizens aren't the source of violence, criminals are.''\n  Likewise, John Stossel commented that:\n\n       [L]aws that make it difficult or impossible to carry a \n     concealed handgun do deter one group of people: law-abiding \n     citizens who might have used a gun to stop crime. Gun laws \n     are laws against self-defense.\n       Criminals have the initiative. They choose the time, place \n     and manner of their crimes, and they tend to make choices \n     that maximize their own, not their victims', success. So \n     criminals don't attack people they know are armed, and anyone \n     thinking of committing mass murder is likely to be attracted \n     to a gun-free zone, such as schools and malls [or national \n     parks].\n       If you are the target of a crime, only one other person \n     besides the criminal is sure to be on the scene: you. There \n     is no good substitute for self-responsibility.\n\n  Individuals who are already willing to break the law to illegally \nhunt on public lands, after all, are no more likely to obey Federal \nregulations that disallow the use firearms on public lands.\n  Federal law enforcement in parks and refuges is ineffective and \nincompetent.\n  According to the inspector general of the Department of the Interior, \nNPS law enforcement agents and rangers are ineffectively managed by \n``non-law enforcement managers.''\n  In a statement before the Senate Committee on Finance, inspector \ngeneral Earl E. Devaney remarked that various superintendents of a \nnumber of dangerous parks opposed increasing law enforcement staff to \ncombat rising crime levels for a variety of reasons.\n  Some superintendents ordered rangers not to carry firearms because \nthey thought it would ``offend park visitors.''\n  Other superintendents assigned law enforcement staff non-law \nenforcement work to prevent them from becoming ``too much like cops'' \nor because ``the public does not want park rangers with the same edge \nas FBI agents but instead what the public wants is the park ranger to \nbe cut from the same cloth as a boy scout.'' One assistant Park Police \nchief sought to address safety concerns with the statement that \nterrorists ``are not incredibly sophisticated.''\n  According to the Washington Post, a February 2008 assessment of the \nU.S. Park Police by Mr. Devaney concluded that:\n\n       The U.S. Park Police have failed to adequately protect [ ] \n     national landmarks [ ] and are plagued by low morale, poor \n     leadership and bad organization . . . The force is \n     understaffed, insufficiently trained and woefully equipped . \n     . .\n\n  The International Association of Chiefs of Police also described law \nenforcement staffing at the Park Service as ``patently illogical and \nerratic.''\n  This legislation will enable law-abiding citizens to defend \nthemselves in national parks and refuges.\n  This legislation would not void State and local laws that prohibit \nthe possession of fire arms and do not provide State residents with \nconceal and carry permits. National monuments would still be governed \nby U.S. law that prohibits the possession of firearms at Federal \nfacilities, and visitors to national parks in States with no conceal \nand carry laws would be required to follow State law.\n  This legislation, similarly to the recently implemented rule change, \ndoes, however, require the National Park Service and any other agency \nunder the Department of the Interior to promulgate regulations \nregarding firearm possession that do not conflict with state and local \nlaws--including conceal and carry laws.\n  An aggressive black bear was shot and killed in the Denali National \nPark in Alaska. Luckily one of the three park employees threatened by \nthis bear was authorized to carry a gun. ``An attempt to divert the \nbear with pepper spray was ineffective,'' and the bear was shot and \nkilled. Typical Americans would not have been permitted to defend \nthemselves with anything besides ``ineffective'' bear spray.\n  A boy celebrating his tenth birthday in Tonto National Forest in \nArizona was attacked by a rabid mountain lion. The lion made two \nattempts to attack the boy, but was shot both times by the boy's uncle \nwith a pistol. The second shot killed the mountain lion. If this event \nhad occurred in a national park or refuge, the uncle would not have \nbeen allowed to even have brought an unloaded pistol along with him.\n  Additionally, a 38-year-old man hiking in British Colombia was \nattacked and mauled by a grizzly bear in June and would have been \nkilled had he not managed to shoot the bear twice. Even though he was \nable to shoot the bear, he still needed 40 stitches and suffered a \nbroken hand and multiple puncture wounds. In national parks and \nrefuges, this story would have most likely ended tragically.\n  The Washington Post also featured a two-part story recounting a \ndouble murder in 1981 and an attempted double murder earlier this year \non the Appalachian Trail. Many of the 2,175 miles that make up this \ntrail are under the jurisdiction of NPS. Adopting this amendment would \nensure all law-abiding citizens would be able to protect themselves \nfrom rare, but dangerous, four- and two-legged predators on this trail \nand other NPS and FWS lands.\n  By passing this bill, the Senate will be voting to increase the \nsafety of families and discourage criminals from taking advantage of \nvulnerable families on Federal lands managed by the Department of the \nInterior. Congress will also finally ensure that elected \nrepresentatives, instead of federal bureaucrats, determine second \namendment policies in this instance.\n  It is claimed that gun restrictions enacted by the National Park \nService, NPS, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, FWS, are \ndifferent than those of Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and U.S. Forest \nService lands, FS, because the roles of the agencies are different.\n  The fact is all four agencies have generally similar responsibilities \nto manage and protect Federal properties and national resources.\n  The NPS mandate is to ``[preserve] unimpaired the natural and \ncultural resources and values of the national park system for the \nenjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.''\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  The FWS mandate is to ``[work] with others to conserve, protect, and \nenhance fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats for the \ncontinuing benefit of the American people.''\n  BLM's mission is to ``[sustain] the health, diversity, and \nproductivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present \nand future generations.'' According to the FS Web site, ``the mission \nof the USDA Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and \nproductivity of the Nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs \nof present and future generations.''\n  Besides the fact that the missions of all four agencies are similar, \nbecause additional regulations prohibit the inappropriate use of \nfirearms in nondesignated areas, allowing for State conceal and carry \nlaws will not compromise these agency missions. Instead, by allowing \nfor State firearm laws to be recognized, visitors will feel safer and \nmore protected in areas where there is limited or no law enforcement.\n  It is claimed that animals will be poached and not adequately \nprotected if visitors are permitted to carry guns in Federal parks.\n  The fact is that separate regulations already outlaw such behavior. \nThis legislation will not void those regulations.\n  This legislation is necessary to enable law-abiding Americans to \ndefend themselves and their families--not to permit more hunting.\n  Additionally, officials from FS also have poaching regulations and, \njust like FWS, also have the option of enforcing Federal Wildlife \ncrimes under a criminal code called the Lacey Act.\n  It is claimed that it would be impractical to enforce State-by-State \nconceal and carry laws on NPS lands.\n  The fact is that both the BLM and the Forest Service have not \nexpressed any difficulties or frustration in recognizing State laws.\n  As it currently stands, the NPS does not enforce NPS regulations that \nvoid State concealed carry laws, except if violations are found \ninadvertently according to NPS congressional liaison. Even then, \nrangers will normally only give a warning to visitors that NPS \nregulations do not recognize State conceal and carry permits.\n  This bill would actually simplify rules for national park and refuge \nvisitors by requiring them to abide by State and local laws regardless \nof what type of Federal land they are visiting. Currently, visitors in \nsome States may carry operational firearms in State parks, BLM and FS \nlands but not in national parks and refuges.\n  It is claimed that recognizing concealed carry State permits would \ncompromise the effectiveness of NPS law enforcement.\n  The fact is that concealed carry permits exist for the protection of \nindividuals--not law enforcement by regular citizens.\n  Current police forces are spread far too thin as it is and are not \nsufficient. According to GAO, for every one law enforcement officer \nthere are about 10,000 visitors and 118,000 acres of land. According to \na report, FWS only employs one law enforcement officer for every \n550,000 acres of national refuge land.\n  Both FS and BLM do not believe their effectiveness has been \ncompromised because State laws governing firearms are followed on their \nlands. Additionally, thousands of Americans with concealed carry \npermits in 48 States have not compromised the effectiveness of our law \nenforcement in States. Why should allowing concealed carry in national \nparks produce a different outcome?\n  It is claimed that poaching has decreased as a result of these \nregulations.\n  The fact is that according to CRS, there is no way of determining \nsuch a conclusion because poaching data is not maintained on a national \nbasis throughout national parks and refuges for a variety of reasons. \nAttempts by both NPS and FWS to keep poaching statistics have not \nsucceeded for a variety of reasons. Additionally, NPS, up until \nrecently, did not even differentiate between different types of \npoaching when reporting any instances of poaching--including poaching \narchaeological relics, trees and plants, and animals.\n  According to DOI's limited recordkeeping of poaching incidents, there \nhas actually been a 10 percent increase in these incidents between 2003 \nand 2006--a jump from 365 incidents in 2003 to 405 in 2006. In contrast \nthere were 16 homicides; including one manslaughter charge, 41 rape \ncases, including two attempted rapes, 92 robberies, 16 kidnappings, and \n33 aggravated assaults out of 5094 part I offenses.\n  It is claimed that hunting is already allowed in a number of \nspecially designated areas.\n  The fact is that this bill is not about hunting but concerns the \nright for Americans to protect themselves and their families from \ncriminals and rabid and dangerous animals. This legislation will not \noverturn hunting regulations.\n  It is claimed that 7 former NPS directors have spoken out against \nchanging the current regulations along with organizations such as the \nAssociation of National Park Rangers, the Coalition of National Park \nService Retirees, and the U.S. Park Rangers Lodge. This legislation \ndirectly contradicts the opinions of those most knowledgeable of law \nenforcement in national parks and refuges and thus should not be \nendorsed.\n  The fact is that many of the concerns listed by these organizations \nhave to do with poaching, not self-defense. The current situation in \nour national parks and refuges does not afford many visitors the \nbenefits of adequate law enforcement protection--a fact that is \nemphasized by the increasing level of crime and violence experienced by \nlaw enforcement officers of these public lands.\n  The Association of National Park Rangers has requested that Congress \nweigh in on these Federal regulations concerning the possession of \nfirearms in these public lands. This amendment gives Congress, \nrepresenting all Americans, instead of unelected bureaucrats the \nopportunity to do so.\n  It is claimed that the regulatory process improperly did not include \na full environmental impact study.\n  The fact is that both the current and previous administrations agreed \nthat this rule change does not significantly impact the ``environmental \nstatus quo, and . . . public health and safety.'' This bill does not \nauthorize poaching or illegal gun use.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time, suggest the absence of \na quorum, and ask unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to reserve for me 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the Coburn \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Oklahoma yield time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, there is, rightfully so, a great deal of varied \nopinions among our body about the issue of gun control, gun rights, the \nsecond amendment, who, where, what. We have seen it debated many times \nin the now 2\\1/2\\ years since I have been here in the Senate. I think \nit reflects the diversity of our country. I think it affects the \ndifferent challenges that different regions, different urban and \nnonurban environments have when it comes to the use of weapons, and I \nrespect that.\n  I respect the fact that many on our side of the aisle have a great \ndeal of concern about amendments such as this amendment. It just \ndepends on what you are reading into it, in many cases.\n  The other part of that is that I believe this particular amendment \naddresses those differences, and it does so in a way that attempts to \nbring some fairness to people who live in States that have a different \nview of the right to bear arms than in other areas. So I think we need \nto calm down a little bit in terms of what the intent of this amendment \nis and what its application would actually bring about.\n  This amendment is very clear. It basically says that if you are \nauthorized to possess a firearm in your State and if the possession of \nthat firearm is in\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\ncompliance with the laws of your State and if there is a national park \nor a national wildlife refuge system in that State, then you would be \nauthorized to possess a firearm in your State in those areas.\n  If you look at Virginia, there are a lot of national parks and \nwildlife areas that intermingle, even along our roadways. So we have a \nState that permits individuals to not only possess firearms but also to \ncarry them, and potentially they could be at legal risk if they are \ndriving down the same highway and they get pulled over because they \nhave crossed into areas that are now national park areas. If you go \nalong the mountain areas in the western part of our State, that is \ntrue. It is actually true right across the river. If you are driving \ndown the George Washington Memorial Parkway from Arlington to \nAlexandria, you can suddenly enter an area that is a national park \narea. So that places a burden on a lot of people who are obeying the \nlaw and who are carrying out the standards that have been placed on \npeople in Virginia, and this amendment helps to clarify that. That is \nall it does.\n  If you live in a State where you can legally possess a firearm and if \nyou meet the standards to legally possess a firearm, then in a national \npark inside that State, or a national wildlife refuge, you can continue \nto possess a firearm. It doesn't mean you can go hunting. It does not \nmean a 12-year-old can have a weapon inside a national park. It simply \nmeans that there is a consistency inside that State. If you live in a \ndifferent State that doesn't want to allow people to possess firearms \nto the extent that the second amendment would allow that sort of State \nlegislation, then you can't bring a weapon or a firearm inside one of \nthose jurisdictions.\n  So, to me, as someone who believes in all of the amendments in our \nBill of Rights, as one who believes very passionately in the first \namendment and the fourth amendment and the fifth amendment as well as, \nin this case, the second amendment, I believe this amendment is proper, \nand I intend to support it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, following up on what the Senator from \nVirginia said, there actually was an event in his State on the Blue \nRidge Parkway where a gentleman who was licensed to carry failed to \nstop completely at a stop sign and was stopped. Under his law, the laws \nof the State of Virginia, he was licensed to legally carry, but the \npark ranger found that he had guns in his car--all within the laws of \nthe State of Virginia. Yet he was convicted because he drove through an \nedge of a national park, carrying a gun in a national park.\n  Senator Webb has described it well. This is about establishing \nclarity. You still can't go out and target shoot. You can't hunt. But \nwhat you can do is be within the law. So by protecting the second \namendment and by protecting States rights, we will have common sense.\n  I would make the other point--the Senator from Connecticut is here--\nif your State says: We don't want to do these things, you can under \nthis amendment. So if you have a national park and you don't allow guns \nin the State park, you can say you don't allow guns in the national \npark. So it follows completely. When the Senator from Connecticut asked \nme about this today, I went back to my staff, and, in fact, that is the \ncase, that State law will reign supreme as long as there is consistency \nwithin the State and the park that is part of that State.\n  So I also agree with what Senator Webb said, which is the natural \nreaction is, this is nuts. It is not nuts. It is about commonsense \napplication of the second amendment. It is about States rights, and it \nis about not putting people in jeopardy who are in jeopardy today \nbecause they are lawfully carrying out the laws of their own State.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I did not intend to comment on all of this, \nbut as the manager of the underlying bill dealing with the credit card \nlegislation, let me first of all thank my colleague from Oklahoma for \nthat clarification I raised because it is an important point, and it is \none raised by others as well about whether a State statute that would \nhave prohibited someone from carrying a licensed weapon in a State park \nwould apply as well to the national park located in that State, and I \nappreciate very much his answer to that question. And the point raised \nby Senator Webb is worthy as well.\n  I come from a State that I believe is still the largest manufacturer \nof weapons in the United States, Connecticut. Not many people are aware \nof that fact. But we have lost a lot of that employment over the last \nnumber of years. A lot of it has gone offshore, regrettably, but for a \nnumber of years Connecticut led the Nation in the production of rifles, \nshotguns, and handguns. So I have more than a familiarity with the \nissue.\n  My concern here is about the amendment, on one hand, but I respect \nwhat my friend from Oklahoma said. My concern is about the underlying \nbill and what happens to it, having watched the fate of other \nlegislation where it has been the case that it moves to the other body \nand what happens to the underlying bill. I suspect, based on what I \nhave heard, that it may carry, and if that is the case, my hope is that \nwe will be able to still move forward with the other body, resolve \nthese matters favorably one way or the other, and still deal with the \nunderlying issue of credit cards. I hate to see us lose this \nopportunity to make a difference with credit card reform. I am not \nanticipating that to be the case, but there is always that risk we run, \nand I would be remiss if I didn't raise that concern I have as the \nmanager of the bill.\n  Senator Shelby and I have worked very hard to put together a credit \ncard reform bill that we hope enjoys broad bipartisan support. It is a \nbalanced bill that will allow an industry to continue to profit, to \nmove forward, but not at the expense of consumers with unnecessary rate \nincreases or exorbitant fees and the like that we have watched too many \nAmericans face over the last number of years. We make major changes in \nhow credit cards are handled under this bill. I know millions of \nAmericans will benefit from this if we are able to pass it into law.\n  I believe the interest of my friend and colleague from Oklahoma is \nnot in undermining that effort, but he has a strong interest in the \namendment he has raised, and I believe he has raised it on any number \nof bills over the past weeks or months.\n  I see my colleague standing, and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as I told the Senator from Connecticut, \nthe underlying bill has many things I am in favor of. I don't want to \nsee it fail on this, but nor should we want to see the second amendment \ntrampled, nor should we want common sense to go out the window as we \napply laws in this country.\n  The fact is, we have had very many good commonsense amendments come \nout of the Senate that don't come out of conference committee. I am not \nsure I would expect a different result on this one.\n  The fact still remains that we have an incoherent policy that takes \naway a right that has been done by bureaucrats. If we decide we don't \nwant to do that, then that is the Congress speaking that we are not \ngoing to do that, and that is fine. But to have bureaucrats eliminate \nsome of these second amendment rights and do so in a way that causes \npeople confusion and puts people at risk is wrong.\n  So I thank the Senator for his comments. I hope he can support the \namendment because it is a commonsense amendment. He has supported many \nother of my amendments. What you do in conference will determine \nwhether it comes back out with that on it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield back all time at this point and ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 67, nays 29, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 188 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--67\n\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sanders\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--29\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Udall (NM)\n     Whitehouse\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Kennedy\n     Mikulski\n     Rockefeller\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, amendment No. 1068 \nis withdrawn.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for Members of the Senate, we have spent \nall day on the Coburn amendment. We tried to work something out. We \ncould not. We took the vote. The Senate has spoken.\n  I hope that Senators who have amendments to offer would do so. We \nhave to complete this legislation. It is no one's fault they have not \nbeen able to offer amendments because the floor was blocked and they \ncould not do that. But I hope tonight we can have some amendments laid \ndown. I hope people will do that. We are not going to have a lot of \namendments pending, but if somebody wants to lay down some amendments, \na reasonable number of amendments, that is fine. There is going to come \na time when we are going to have to move on. This is a bill literally \nsupported by 90 percent of the American public. This bill received \nalmost 380 votes in the House. We are going to have to move on.\n  I am not going to file cloture tonight. It is only Tuesday. But we \nwill see what happens tomorrow. We have a lot of other business we need \nto complete before we leave here. This has been a long work period. We \nhave accomplished a lot of things. We have a lot more to do. We would \nlike to be able to complete our work by next Thursday. I don't know \nthat we can do that, but we certainly need to try. We have things we \nare going to have to do before the work period ends. Monday is a \nnonvote day.\n\n  I am not criticizing anyone, but I repeat, let's not be tied up in \nthe mornings and say: I can't offer my amendment in the morning; I am \ntoo busy; I have appointments. The most important thing a Senator can \ndo is to legislate. We need to start legislating. This bill is very \nimportant. The managers have worked very hard. Senators Dodd and Shelby \nworked the weekend to come up with the agreement they got to get a \nbipartisan bill we can work on. I applaud each of them for their work \ntogether. This sends a good message to the American public that we can \ndo something very important.\n  I repeat, there will be no more votes tonight, but we need to have \nsome amendments laid down so we can start voting tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for those \nwords, and let me just say, on behalf of Senator Shelby and myself, if \nMembers have amendments, please bring them over. In many cases, we \nmight be able to accept them; others to modify. In some cases we may \nhave to reject them, but we can't make those decisions unless we know \nwhat they are. We can move this along pretty quickly if Members will \nlet us know what they want to offer, and we will see if we can work \nthose out.\n  So I appreciate the majority leader making that point. We will stay \nas late as possible to have Members come by with their amendments, to \nmeet with staff and others to see if we can't move forward with the \nbill. We have an opportunity this week to do something for millions and \nmillions of our fellow constituents and citizens around this country. \nThere is nothing that plagues our constituents more than these \noutrageous fees and rates that are being increased on their accounts, \nand we can make a difference this week in that matter. But we need to \nknow the amendments.\n  Senator Shelby and I put together a good bill, but we always know our \ncolleagues can offer ideas as well to improve it. So we would like that \nopportunity, and I appreciate the majority leader making that point.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the manager of this bill, we both want \namendments to be offered, if in fact people want to offer amendments. \nBut we hope they would be related to the bill. If we have a few more \nnongermane amendments, it is going to wind up that the banks win again \nbecause we will not be able to proceed on this legislation if we have \nmore amendments dealing with unrelated matters, such as guns or \nwhatever else somebody else dreams up.\n  In the morning, we have a cloture vote on one of Secretary Salazar's \nassistants. It is very important we have that vote. We will have it an \nhour after we come in, unless we work out another time with our \ncolleagues. We have to complete that. I hope that we can get that done. \nBased on what we have been through in years passed, I can't imagine \nthat we would have to invoke cloture on a Cabinet nomination, someone \nwho is going to work for one of our Cabinet officers. That is what I \nthought we debated with the nuclear option. But it appears there are a \nlot of people not willing to even allow a vote on David Hayes.\n  It seems a little unusual for me that people who were wanting to \ninvoke the nuclear option are now saying: Well, we are not sure we were \nright about that, and we are not even going to allow you to have a vote \non someone whom Secretary Salazar has worked very hard on, getting him \nto help him work on the many issues he has to work on in the Department \nof the Interior. So I hope we can get that over with in the morning and \nthat we would not have to have a cloture vote. But it appears we might \nhave to do that. I wish I didn't have to file cloture on any nominees, \nbut we have had to do it many times already this Congress.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the majority leader, and I would say that we are \nopen for business, Senator Shelby and I are. So if there are \namendments, let us hear them. Bring them over and we will try to move \nthings along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is a very straightforward but \nimportant amendment. It would grant rulemaking authority to the Federal \nReserve to set forth minimum standards for credit card issuers to \nestablish a consumer's identity in order to prevent illegal \nimmigrants--folks in the country illegally, breaking Federal law, \nincluding terrorists, in some cases, and including many others here \nillegally--from obtaining credit cards.\n  Madam President, we have all read numerous accounts of how this is \nactually a growth industry for some very large financial institutions. \nNot so long ago, in February 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       In the latest sign of the U.S. banking industry's \n     aggressive pursuit of the Hispanic market, Bank of America \n     Corp. has quietly begun offering credit cards to customers \n     without Social Security numbers--typically illegal \n     immigrants.\n\n  The same Wall Street Journal article detailed how Bank of America \nabused loopholes in customer identification rules to provide illegal \nimmigrants with credit cards.\n\n       The new Bank of America program is open to people who lack \n     both a Social Security number and a credit history, as long \n     as they have held a checking account with the bank for 3 \n     months without an overdraft. Most adults in the U.S. who \n     don't have a Social Security number are undocumented \n     immigrants.\n\n  Now, as we have a major credit crisis in this country, and \nparticularly when we are throwing billions upon billions of taxpayer \ndollars at these same large financial institutions, I don't think it is \ntoo much to ask that they help us enforce our law, not to be a willing \ncoconspirator with lawbreakers, and to actually go after the illegal \nalien market as a new niche market or a new profit center. I think that \nis offensive because we do have a serious illegal immigration problem \nthat we are trying to get our hands around in this country.\n  So again, my amendment is very simple. It doesn't say exactly what \nall of the detailed rules have to be. It simply gives the experts in \nthe Federal system--in this case the Federal Reserve--rulemaking \nauthority to set forth minimum standards for credit card issuers to \nestablish a consumer's identity, and specifically to prevent illegal \nimmigrants and terrorists from obtaining credit cards. It shouldn't be \ntoo much to ask, curtailing a little bit of the big banks and big \ncredit card companies' business to do that, to at least be that \ncareful. It isn't asking very much, and I believe this would be an \nimportant step forward in the proper enforcement of our immigration \nlaws.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention. I urge all of my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support this commonsense, \nsimple, but important amendment, and I look forward to a vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise on behalf of consumers \nin Colorado and across this country who work hard every day, pay their \nbills on time, and struggle to stay ahead in the midst of an economic \nrecession. In the face of these challenges, the last thing Colorado \nfamilies need is credit card companies that arbitrarily change terms \nand charge fees, offering only legalese and print so small you need a \nmagnifying glass to read it.\n  Some credit card companies have been taking advantage of consumers \nfor years. This bipartisan bill would give cardholders some much needed \nrelief, and I am very glad we are taking it up this week. Why, Madam \nPresident? Because after the near financial collapse last year, \nCongress has worked to meet the needs of banks and financial \ninstitutions. I think it is time working families also had someone in \ntheir corner. This bill is about them. It is about making sure that \nfamilies who pay their bills on time and stay within their means can't \nget charged excessive fees or see their interest rates jacked up \nwithout clear notice.\n  I have come to the floor, as many of my colleagues have today, to \nurge our other colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  We know how important short-term credit is to families, and we have \nall heard stories of people who have been victimized by the kind of \nunfair dealing that I am talking about tonight. As a longtime supporter \nof credit card reform, I have met with countless victims of the abusive \npractices of credit card companies. One of them was a wonderful woman \nby the name of Susan Wones, and I want to take a minute to share her \nexperience with you tonight.\n  I met Susan in person last year when she flew from Denver to \nWashington to testify before Congress about the unfair treatment she \nreceived from a credit card company. She has a classic story. She has \nalways maintained a high FICO score, never exceeded her card's limit, \nand always paid the amount required on time. In short, she is a good \ncustomer who plays by the rules and lives within her means. But despite \nSusan's good standing, one of her credit card issuers doubled her \ninterest rate to 25 percent without notice.\n  When she later asked why, she was told the rate had been increased, \nnot because she had missed a payment but because this particular credit \ncard company decided her balance on another card was too high. This \npractice, known as universal default, will no longer be allowed if this \nlegislation passes and is signed into law.\n  Unfortunately for Susan, this kind of treatment did not stop there. \nJust before she was prepared to testify in the House of \nRepresentatives, the powerful lobbying interests of the banks and \ncredit card issuers insisted she sign a waiver relinquishing her \nprivacy rights to her personal financial information. Then, a month \nlater, after deals were worked out to have Susan return to Washington \nand finally tell her story without fearing her personal information \nwould be released to the press, that information was released anyway.\n  While Susan had nothing to hide, the treatment she received is \nindicative of the abusive treatment American consumers have been \nsubject to at the hands of credit card companies. This kind of \ntreatment has to stop, and that is why we need this bill.\n  The bill will put in place some commonsense rules that will protect \nhonest, hard-working Americans from unfair and downright abusive \npractices by credit card issuers. I first introduced similar \nlegislation to protect individual consumers from this kind of unfair \ntreatment by credit card companies back in 2006, as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. I reintroduced this bill in the House in \n2007, and last year I worked with Representative Carolyn Maloney, from \nNew York, to incorporate the principles of my bill in the Credit \nCardholders' Bill of Rights.\n  I thank and acknowledge Congresswoman Maloney for her hard work and \ndedication in working on that legislation, which passed the House last \nyear and then again just a few weeks ago.\n  This year, one of my first steps as a freshman Senator was to join \nwith Senator Schumer in introducing the Credit Cardholders' Bill of \nRights in the Senate. The legislation we are considering today overlaps \nin every critical category with a bill Senator Schumer and I \nintroduced. I did wish to acknowledge Chairman Dodd for his leadership \non this important issue.\n  Here is what the bill does, in short. It protects against arbitrary \ninterest rate increases, No. 1. No. 2, it prevents cardholders who pay \non time from being unfairly penalized. No. 3, it bars excessive fees \nand will require more fairness in the way payments are handled. \nFinally, it will prohibit the use of universal default clauses, as I \nmentioned earlier in my remarks.\n  With all due respect, we know how important the credit card industry \nis to modern America. For many Americans, consumer credit is more than \na convenience, it is a necessity. You have the parent who uses short-\nterm credit to buy groceries, the small business owner who uses credit \nto cover expenses. In that regard, a well-functioning credit card \nindustry is absolutely essential to our economy. But this influence \nshould not give the credit card industry the right to abuse customers \nwith an ``anything goes in the name of profit'' approach.\n  For far too long, the Federal Government has placed the blame of \nindividual's overbearing debts solely at the feet of the American \nconsumer. Most notably, in 2005, the laws governing bankruptcy were \nfundamentally changed to prevent abuse. But while we passed laws to \nhold the consumer accountable, too much emphasis was placed on \nborrowers alone. Just as Congress has cracked down on the predatory \nlending that spurred the subprime mortgage crisis, Congress must also \ndo more to promote responsibility by the credit card companies that \nprovide this important consumer credit.\n  In the last several months, the Federal Government has taken \nextraordinary steps to respond to a financial crisis that has paralyzed \nthe credit markets. This crisis was brought on, as we know all too \nwell, by excessive leverage and risk-taking on the part of the very \nbanks that have treated credit card customers such as Susan Wones so \nunfairly.\n  I supported many of those steps to rescue the financial industry, as \nmany in the Senate have done as well--despite my distaste for doing \nso--because I believed they were necessary to stabilize our economy and \nget credit flowing again. It is now time we start working to level the \nplaying field for American families who are being asked to pick up the \ntab.\n  As I close, I wish to underline that this is a commonsense bill whose \ntime has come. It is time to stand for working families again. This \nlegislation is a big step in that direction, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1062 to Amendment No. 1058\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I move to set aside the pending \namendment so I can call up amendment No. 1062, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Whitehouse, proposes an amendment \n     No. 1062 to an amendment numbered 1058.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To establish a national consumer credit usury rate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT USURY RATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 107 of the Truth in Lending Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 1606) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(f) National Consumer Credit Usury Rate.--\n       ``(1) Limitation established.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a) or any other provision of law, but except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), the annual percentage rate applicable to an \n     extension of credit obtained by use of a credit card may not \n     exceed 15 percent on unpaid balances, inclusive of all \n     finance charges. Any fees that are not considered finance \n     charges under section 106(a) may not be used to evade the \n     limitations of this paragraph, and the total sum of such\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\n     fees may not exceed the total amount of finance charges \n     assessed.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--\n       ``(A) Board authority.--The Board may establish, after \n     consultation with the appropriate committees of Congress, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, and any other interested Federal \n     financial institution regulatory agency, an annual percentage \n     rate of interest ceiling exceeding the 15 percent annual rate \n     under paragraph (1) for periods of not to exceed 18 months, \n     upon a determination that--\n       ``(i) money market interest rates have risen over the \n     preceding 6-month period; or\n       ``(ii) prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety \n     and soundness of individual lenders, as evidenced by adverse \n     trends in liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth.\n       ``(B) Treatment of credit unions.--The limitation in \n     paragraph (1) does not apply with respect to any extension of \n     credit by an insured credit union, as that term is defined in \n     section 101 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752).\n       ``(3) Penalties for charging higher rates.--\n       ``(A) Violation.--The taking, receiving, reserving, or \n     charging of an annual percentage rate or fee greater than \n     that permitted by paragraph (1), when knowingly done, shall \n     be deemed a violation of this title, and a forfeiture of the \n     entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of \n     the obligation carries with it, or which has been agreed to \n     be paid thereon.\n       ``(B) Refund of interest amounts.--If an annual percentage \n     rate or fee greater than that permitted under paragraph (1) \n     has been paid, the person by whom it has been paid, or the \n     legal representative thereof, may, by bringing an action not \n     later than 2 years after the date on which the usurious \n     collection was last made, recover back from the lender in an \n     action in the nature of an action of debt, the entire amount \n     of interest, finance charges, or fees paid.\n       ``(4) Civil liability.--Any creditor who violates this \n     subsection shall be subject to the provisions of section \n     130.''.\n       (b) Civil Liability Conforming Amendment.--Section 130(a) \n     of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1640(a)) is amended by \n     inserting ``section 107(f)'' before ``this chapter''.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam, this amendment, No. 1062, is being cosponsored by \nSenator Harkin, Senator Durbin, Senator Levin, Senator Leahy, and \nSenator Whitehouse. Before I speak on this amendment, let me begin by \ncommending the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, and \nRanking Member Shelby, for introducing the underlying bill we are \ndebating today that, for the first time, would seriously begun to crack \ndown on big banks and credit card issuers that are ripping off millions \nof American consumers by charging outrageously high interest rates and \nsky-high fees. The American people are saying loudly and clearly: \nEnough is enough. This legislation begins--begins--to move us in the \nright direction.\n  I also commend President Obama for his leadership on this issue. \nWithout his tenacious support for this bill, it is doubtful we would \nhave the necessary votes to pass this important piece of legislation--\nand we will have the necessary votes to do that.\n  Under the Dodd-Shelby bill, credit card companies will no longer be \npayable to raise interest rates at any time for any reason. Credit card \ncompanies will be banned from retroactively raising interest rates on \nconsumers who are less than 60 days late in paying their credit card \nbills.\n  This bill also prohibits credit card issuers from increasing interest \nrates on consumers during the first year after a credit card account is \nopened, and it requires teaser rates to last at least 6 months, among \nmany other things.\n  When I was the ranking member of the Financial Institutions and \nConsumer Credit Subcommittee in the House, I fought to end the ``bait \nand switch'' practices of the credit card companies for years. It is \nsomething we worked on for a long time in the House. I applaud Chairman \nDodd for putting a stop to some of the most egregious practices being \nperpetrated by the credit card companies today.\n  But while Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby deserve strong \ncredit for standing up to the big banks and credit card issuers that \noppose this legislation, in my view, this bill, as good as it is, does \nnot go far enough. That is why I am introducing this amendment today. \nAt a time when banks are receiving the largest taxpayer bailout in the \nhistory of the world, at a time when the Federal Reserve is providing \nbanks with zero interest loans, those same banks are now charging \nconsumers outrageous fees and sky-high interest rates on credit cards \nand other loans.\n  In other words, after taking $700 billion from the taxpayers, after \ngetting zero interest loans from the Fed, what these banks are now \nsaying is: Thank you very much, chump, we are going to take your money, \nand then we are going to charge you 25 or 30 percent interest rates.\n  All over this country, people are saying: Sorry, that cannot be \nallowed to continue.\n  That is why we are here tonight. Today one-third of all credit \ncardholders in this country are paying interest rates above 20 percent \nand as high as 41 percent--more than double what they paid in interest \nin 1990. Nineteen years later, people are now paying double what they \npaid in 1990. According to a recent Business Week article:\n\n       Bank of America sent letters notifying some responsible \n     cardholders that it would more than double their rates to as \n     high as 28 percent, without giving an explanation for the \n     increase. What's striking is how arbitrary the Bank of \n     America rate increases appear.\n\n  In other words, they are doing it, and I know many people in Vermont \ncall and they say: I paid my bills every month on time. Why are you \ndoubling my interest rates? Essentially, what the bank is saying is: We \nare doing it because we can do it.\n  That is not acceptable.\n  Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and other banks should not \nbe permitted to charge consumers 25 to 30 percent interest on their \ncredit cards while they are getting bailed out by the middle-class \ntaxpayers of this country. The amendment I am proposing with Senators \nHarkin, Durbin, Levin, Leahy, and Whitehouse would cap credit card \ninterest rates at 15 percent, the same interest rate cap that Congress \nimposed on credit unions almost 30 years ago. Under our amendment, the \nFederal Reserve would have the authority to allow credit card lenders \nto charge higher rates if the Fed determines this cap would threaten \nthe safety and soundness of financial institutions.\n  In other words, the time is now--not tomorrow, not next year, but \nnow--to have a national usury rate. As a nation, what we must say is \nbanks cannot charge people 25 percent or 30 percent. As I mentioned, \nthis is not a new idea I pulled out of my ear. This, in fact, is what \ncredit unions have been living under for the last 30 years. Do you know \nwhat. Credit unions are doing fine. I don't see them crawling in here \nasking for hundreds of billions of dollars of bailout money. They are \ndoing fine with that regulation, and we should impose that same \nregulation on the private banks as well.\n  Establishing a national usury law is not a radical concept. Up until \n1978, about half the States in our country had usury laws on the books \ncapping credit card interest rates. While the State usury laws remain \non the books in several States, they were effectively eradicated by a \n1978 Supreme Court decision Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha \nService Corporation, which concluded that national banks could charge \nwhatever interest rate they wanted if they moved to a State without a \nusury law, which is, of course, what they did. South Dakota, Delaware, \nother States do not have usury laws, and that is where these companies \nmoved.\n  Our amendment simply applies the same statutory interest rate cap on \ncredit cards that Congress imposed on credit unions in 1980, capping \ninterest rates at 15 percent.\n  The National Credit Union Administration has the authority to raise \ninterest rates if it determines the 15-percent cap threatens the safety \nand soundness of credit unions.\n  It is also important to know that the concept I am bringing forth \ntonight is one that former Senator Al D'Amato, Republican of New York--\nwho was then chairman of the Banking Committee, by the way--advocated \nfor in 1991, when he offered an amendment to cap credit card interest \nrates. The D'Amato amendment would have capped all credit card interest \nrates at 14 percent. Do you know what. That amendment won on the floor \nof the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 74 to 19. That was back in \n1991. If that amendment received 74 votes in 1991, the truth is our \namendment should receive even more because the situation\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\ntoday is more egregious than it was in 1991.\n  Here is what the Republican Senator, then chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Al D'Amato said in 1991:\n\n       Fourteen percent is certainly a reasonable rate of interest \n     for banks to charge customers for credit card debt. It allows \n     a comfortable profit margin but keeps banks in line so that \n     interest rates rise and fall with the health of the economy.\n\n  He was right then. We are right now.\n  The Bible has a term for what we are seeing today. I see a lot of my \nfriends coming to the floor and quoting the Bible. I don't often do it, \nbut let me do it at this moment.\n  In the Bible quite often we see the term ``usury.'' Usury. It appears \nvery often in the Bible. Because not only in Christianity, but in \nJudaism, in the Muslim world, there is a reprehension against people \nwho lend money out at outrageously high rates. There is a strong sense \nthat that type of activity is not moral.\n  In Dante's ``Divine Comedy'' there was a special place reserved in \nthe seventh circle of hell for sinners who charged people usurious \ninterest rates. So that is a warning for our friends in the credit card \ncompanies. Beware.\n  Today we do not need the hellfire and pitchforks, we do not need the \nrivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law capping \ncredit card interest rates. That is why I am proposing this amendment \ntoday.\n  I am not under any illusion that this amendment will easily pass. \nAfter all, the financial services industry has spent over $5 billion on \ncampaign contributions and lobbying activities over the past 10 years \nin support of deregulation, and they are spending even more money today \ntrying to prevent Congress from seriously regulating their industry. \nThey are a very powerful force here in Washington. In many ways all of \nthat money has got us to where we are today with the collapse of major \nbanking institutions.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: On April 24, a few weeks ago, I sent \nan e-mail to my Senate mailing list, and I simply said: Tell me how \ncredit card companies are treating you. We did not know what kind of \nresponse we would get. But 3 days later, I had almost 1,000 responses, \nmany from obviously the State of Vermont, but from people all over this \ncountry.\n  I took some of these responses and I put them into a booklet. Let me \nconclude by reading a few of those e-mails that I received.\n  Donna from Neptune, NJ, writes:\n\n       I want to know why consumers are not protected in any way \n     from these predatory lenders who were bailed out with my \n     taxpayer dollars and then turn around and raise my interest \n     rates from 7 percent to 27 percent because of ``difficult \n     economic times'' for the credit industry. This is outrageous. \n     I have not missed a payment and my credit rating is in the \n     high 800s. How can they keep getting away with this?\n\n  And Steven from St. Johnsbury, VT, wrote:\n\n       A couple of weeks ago, Bank of America sent us a letter \n     saying they were going to raise our interest rate from 7.3 \n     percent to 24 percent. The letter stated we could get our \n     credit report to find out why. We received our credit report \n     and I still have no reason why they wanted to raise our rate. \n     We did opt out, kept the 7.3 percent and we destroyed our \n     card, but we do know what was wrong with our credit report.\n\n  On and on it goes, arbitrary acts on the part of credit card \ncompanies, raising rates to outrageous levels. There is a lot of \nfrustration on the part of the American people as to what has gone on \nin Wall Street, and the fact of what has gone on here in Congress.\n  The American people want to know that we are fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibilities and representing the needs of ordinary \npeople and not just major financial institutions that may make lots of \ncampaign contributions and have their lobbyists out lining the Halls of \nCongress.\n  The time is now to say there must be a limit on credit card rates. \nThe time is now to pass a national usury law. I hope very much we will \nhave the support of our colleagues in going forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1084 to Amendment No. 1058\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so I may call up amendment No. 1084.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Gillibrand] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1084 to amendment No. 1058.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting \n   agencies to provide free credit reports in the native language of \n                certain non-English speaking consumers)\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 503. CREDIT REPORTS IN CONSUMER'S NATIVE LANGUAGE.\n\n       Section 612(a)(1) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 1681j(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(D) Native language requirement for non-english \n     speakers.--The disclosures required under this paragraph \n     shall be provided, upon request, to the extent possible, in \n     the native language of any consumer having limited ability to \n     read, write, speak, and understand English, subject to such \n     limitations and in accordance with such guidelines as shall \n     be established by the Commission, in consultation with the \n     Federal Interagency Working Group on Limited English \n     Proficiency.''.\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, my amendment is very simple. It \nbasically says that the Fair Credit Reporting Act will require rating \nagencies to make available credit reports in languages other than \nEnglish. This is very important, because we have 22 million Americans \nwho have limited English proficiency, and so this basic requirement \nwill make sure that these translations are made available so folks have \nthe opportunity to understand what their credit report is.\n  When we have a serious economic downturn, as we have today, where we \nhave 3.5 million jobs lost, more than half in the last few months \nalone, we need to do everything we can to get our families back in the \nfight to make sure that we have good jobs to make sure they can provide \nfor their families.\n  Being able to understand your credit rating is very much part of that \nprocess. So this very simple amendment will make sure those 22 million \nAmericans have access to their credit report in a form they can fully \nunderstand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in the last Congress there was a Wyden-\nObama amendment to better protect the rights of those who have credit \ncards in our country. My original cosponsor has obviously moved on and \nis doing important work for our country at 1600 Pennsylvania where he \ncontinues to advocate for the rights of consumers.\n  But I am very hopeful, and discussions are now taking place with \nChairman Dodd and Ranking Minority Member Shelby, that it will be \npossible to get a bipartisan agreement here in the next day or so to \nadvance the legislation that I and then Senator Obama originally \nproposed the last Congress.\n  I am very pleased that my original cosponsor this session is my new \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley, who has a long record of \nadvocating for the rights of consumers as well.\n  What Senator Obama and I originally proposed in the last Congress \nwould direct the Federal Reserve to establish a safety rating system \nfor credit cards. What then-Senator Obama and I sought to do was to \nmake sure that cards with terms that are consumer friendly would be \nrated up, and cards with the tricky terms, the terms that are larded \nwith qualifiers and exceptions and waivers, the legal mumbo jumbo that \nis so deceptive in the marketplace, those cards would be rated down. \nUnder our legislation, credit cards with five stars would be deemed the \nsafest; those with one star would be considered the least safe.\n  For example, credit card agreements that state that terms can be \nchanged at any time for any reason would automatically get a one-star \nrating, because clearly that is the kind of consumer practice that has \ncaused great difficulty for American consumers and is plain wrong.\n  I see our proposal operating much like the five-star crash rating \nsystem works for new cars. That system has worked. Americans have \nbecome better educated about how their car will protect them in a \ncrash, and the rating system has helped incentivize the car industry as \nfar as basic safety measures. When that rating system first\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\ncame out, a lot of the cars only received one or two stars. But then \nthe basic principles of competition and free enterprise kicked in, and \nnow you have got many of those cars receiving four or five stars.\n  I am very confident that what then-Senator Obama and I sought to do 2 \nyears ago will accomplish exactly the same thing with credit cards. \nSimilarly, the safety star rating will increase competition between \ncredit card companies over the fairness of the terms in their \ncontracts, which will create an incentive for them to use fairer terms \nfor more credit cards.\n  Credit card companies would have to display the rating on all of \ntheir marketing materials, billing statements, agreement materials, and \non the back of the card itself. Consumers would be able to see the \nratings for their card and how their card got that rating on a stand-\nalone Web site that was created and operated by the Federal Reserve. \nThe Federal Reserve would be responsible for updating the star system \nand making sure that if new terms or practices come to market, those \nterms or practices would be assigned an appropriate rating.\n  Card issuers currently compete on their ability to advertise, mostly \nadvertising their interest rates and annual fees, but not on the \nfairness of their credit card contract. Card issuers advertise their \ngreat interest rates and their great rewards, and then try to tell the \nconsumers that their cards will cost less to use. But too often the \nimportant information is buried, the information about early deadlines \nand arbitrary rules, and what happens is that these cards end up \ncosting millions of consumers more.\n  I believe--and Senator Merkley and I continue to advocate this cause, \na cause that began in the last Congress--we believe that consumers \ndeserve to have the tools that are needed to make informed choices \nabout what they buy. That, of course, is what the marketplace is all \nabout, getting information to consumers so they can make the choices \nthat make sense for them. We believe our legislation empowers consumers \nto better make the marketplace work in this critical area of our \neconomy.\n  I want to close by saying I have always felt that in a free society, \nAmericans have a right to make decisions that, by perhaps someone \nelse's assessment, would be wasteful or ill advised. In effect, we have \nin our country a constitutional right to be pretty foolish with our \nmoney. The problem with credit cards is that too often the marketplace \nfails the millions and millions of Americans who want to manage their \nmoney responsibly. Too often the major provisions of these credit card \nagreements require that you have an advanced legal degree--not just a \nbasic law degree but an advanced legal degree--in order to sort out the \nterms. I do not think it is right to say that you ought to, in effect, \nbe someone who spends their free time reading the Uniform Commercial \nCode in order to make sense out of these credit card agreements.\n  I am very hopeful that now with millions of our people walking on an \neconomic tightrope, it will be possible to use classic free market \nprinciples to encourage better behavior. This is not heavy-handed \nregulation. This is not run-from-Washington micromanagement that is \ngoing to jack up somebody's credit card rates. This is about \ndisclosure. This is about making sure that people in the marketplace \nunderstand what is in front of them, and that they are in a better \nposition with objective information, in this case supplied by the \nFederal Reserve, overseen in a system operated by the Federal Reserve.\n  Consumers would be able to make better choices while forcing the \ncredit card companies to compete not on who can best craft these \ntechnical legalistic terms of legal mumbo jumbo, but instead who best \ninforms the public about their credit card choices and who addresses \nthe rights of consumers with responsible practices.\n  I will continue to talk with Chairman Dodd and the ranking minority \nmember Senator Shelby. They are familiar with what Senator Obama and I \nsought to do in the last Congress. I am glad this bill is on the floor. \nIt is high time the rights of credit card consumers were addressed, \nthat credit card consumers got a fair shake.\n  I think I have got the best possible partner, somebody who has been a \nlong-standing advocate of consumers' rights, in Senator Merkley. We are \nhopeful in the next day or so that we will be able to forge an \nagreement with the chairman and the ranking minority member.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Mitchell Scholarship has allowed America to deepen its \nstrategic, political, and cultural ties with Ireland and helps prepare \nfuture American leaders for an increasingly globalized world. I can \nthink of no better way to honor Senator George Mitchell and his pivotal \nrole in bringing peace to Northern Ireland than through this valuable \nprogram dedicated to deepening our ties to Ireland.\n  I fondly remember meeting the inaugural class of scholars in late \n2000 when I visited Ireland with President Clinton, and I have proudly \nwatched the Mitchell Scholarship program grow to become one of \nAmerica's most respected overseas scholarships. I look forward to \nwatching the Mitchell Scholarship program continue to prosper and \nfurther enrich U.S.-Irish relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5365-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5365-S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST 100 DAYS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in recent days, the White House, the news \nmedia, and many in this Chamber have taken the opportunity to reflect \non the first 100 days of President Barack Obama's administration. I \nrise today to offer my comments and evaluation in light of this \nmilestone.\n  Admittedly, it is somewhat arbitrary to use the 100-day point in a \nPresidency as a time for evaluation.\n  Indeed, success in the first 100 days doesn't guarantee success in \nthe next 100 days or for the rest of a Presidential term. Likewise, \nstruggles and failures in the first 100 days do not necessarily \npredicate similar troubles in the future. It is certainly the case \nthat, as with most administrations, the defining moments of this \ncurrent President are yet to be written.\n  That said, President Obama's first 100 days have provided us with \nsome unique insight into this President and how he intends to govern. \nIt is this insight that informs my comments here today.\n  The President came into office facing unprecedented expectations. \nWhile some of these expectations may have been unfairly placed upon him \nby some starry-eyed supporters who believed him to be a politician, a \nmovie star, and a religious figure all in one, he brought much of the \npressure upon himself. President Obama campaigned on a platform of big \npromises, not the least of which was a promise to change the tone here \nin Washington and move the country past the bitter partisan divides \nthat has kept us polarized in recent years.\n  But as any reasonable person observing U.S. politics will concede, we \nare not on that path yet.\n  The supporters of the President will argue that he cannot accomplish \nsuch\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\na daunting task alone and I tend to agree with them. However, so far, \nthe President has done very little on his end to make good on that \npromise and that has been his biggest failing during the first 100 \ndays.\n  The problems began right out of the gate when the Congress debated \nthe SCHIP reauthorization language. I was an original author of the \nSCHIP program and had been one of its strongest supporters. In fact, \nover the years, a number of Republicans in this Chamber--including \nmyself and Senator Grassley--had endured a lot of criticism among our \nmore conservative constituents over our support for the SCHIP program.\n  During the 110th Congress, we worked with the Democratic majority to \nforge a bipartisan compromise in order to ensure widespread support for \nreauthorizing this program. This included some common-sense proposals \nto ensure the program was an efficient use of taxpayer funds. Yet, when \nthe 111th Congress convened, the President and his supporters in \nCongress left that compromise on the side of the road and instead chose \nto push through a more expansive and liberal version of the bill. In \nthe end, the bill passed on a vote divided on partisan lines.\n\n  So, in the earliest days of his administration, the President was \npresented an easy opportunity to place unity and bipartisanship ahead \nof a far-left Democratic agenda and, unfortunately for the SCHIP \nprogram, he balked and, in doing so, he set the tone for the early \nmonths of his Presidency.\n  Shortly thereafter, the President came to Congress with a proposed \n``stimulus package'' at a pricetag of nearly a $1 trillion. Although it \nwas eventually reduced to $790 billion, the ``stimulus package'' \nbasically read like a wish-list of long-time Democratic policy \npriorities and had very little to do with actually stimulating the \neconomy. For example, small businesses, which create 70 percent of the \nnew jobs in this country, went virtually unnoticed in the President's \n``stimulus'' bill, which focused more on expanding the Federal \nGovernment and providing ``tax credits'' for millions of Americans who \ndon't pay any taxes.\n  The President had an opportunity to work with Republicans on the \n``stimulus'' and include ideas that are proven to have immediate \neconomic impacts--like reducing the highest corporate tax rates in the \nindustrialized world to keep businesses in the U.S. or tax credits to \naddress the housing crisis.\n  Instead, he chose to cut Republicans almost entirely out of the \nnegotiations and was content to have the support of only three members \nof the minority voting in favor, one of whom officially joined the \nmajority earlier this week.\n  Almost as disappointing as the substance of the bill was the \nPresident's tactics in debating the ``stimulus.'' Rather than \nacknowledging sincere policy differences between Democrats and \nRepublicans, he accused the Republicans of wanting to do nothing, which \nwas anything but the truth. This too has become an unfortunate, yet \ncommonly used, tactic used by the Obama administration.\n  The partisan recklessness continued into the debate over the \nPresident's budget. I have been in the Senate now for 33 years and I \ncan say without reservation that President Obama's first budget is the \nmost poorly crafted budget I have ever seen. In 1 year, the President's \nbudget will quadruple the Federal deficit--That is the case even if you \nuse the President's own estimates. Following the President's budget \nwill create more debt than was created under every President from \nGeorge Washington through George W. Bush combined. It also contains the \nlargest tax increase in history of our union. And, under the Obama \nbudget, government spending could end up as high as 40 percent of the \nGDP within the space of only a few years.\n\n  In order to assuage such concerns--or at least in order to pretend to \ndo so--the President has claimed that his budget will cut the deficit \nin half over 5 years. So, he will quadruple the deficit in 1 year--but \nwe don't have worry because, 5 years from now, he will cut that deficit \nin half? Does anyone really think the President was considering his \npromises of bipartisanship when drafting this budget?\n  It is not only the size of the budget, but its priorities. Like the \nstimulus bill, the President's budget reads like a policy manifesto for \nfar-left Democrats. Worse still, the President and congressional \nmajority have declared their intentions to use the budget \nreconciliation process in order to enact major pillars of their \ndomestic policy platform, including an expansive government-run health \ncare program and an energy tax euphemistically referred to as ``cap and \ntrade.'' These are bills the President couldn't get passed through \nregular order, even with the large Democratic majorities. So, instead, \nhe seems willing and able to force them through with little substantive \ndebate, leaving the minority completely out of the equation.\n  Once again, it appears that the President's promise of increased \nbipartisanship came with an expiration date.\n  I wish this was all, but unfortunately it is not. The President's \nfailure to live up to his promises of bipartisanship extends into the \nnational security sphere. One of his very first actions as President \nwas to order the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison facility. Of \ncourse, he didn't have an alternative plan in place, only the stated \ndesire to close the prison and to cast aspersions on his predecessor's \nefforts to protect our country's national security. Such inane \ndetails--like what we will do with these dangerous captives once the \nfacility closes--could wait until later, the President had a political \nstatement to make.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, President Obama opted to selectively declassify \nmemos drafted by the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush \nadministration relating to CIA interrogation tactics. Instead of \nproviding the American people real context about these tactics--their \nsuccesses and failures--the President opted to placate those on the far \nleft who want nothing less than an indictment and trial of our former \nPresident. He did this for the stated purpose of clearing the air and \nmoving forward, yet he left open the possibility of prosecuting former \nBush officials whose only alleged crimes were to offer legal opinions. \nOne would think that a President who is truly interested in \nbipartisanship and moving forward would avoid further politicizing such \ncontentious issues. Yet, as a result of the President's lack of \nleadership, we may be looking at months and years of show trials in \norder to pacify those on the far left who would criminalize policy \ndifferences in order to exact political vengeance on the Bush \nadministration. I hope that this will not be the case and that the \nPresident will change course on these issues.\n  Now, to be fair, the President has made some good decisions during \nhis first 100 days and I am not unwilling to give him credit where it \nis due. For example, he ended the ban on Federal funding for embryonic \nstem cell research. I have supported taking such measures for many \nyears as I believe that this research has the potential to \nrevolutionize medicine in this country. This was, in my view, a wise \ndecision on the part of the President and I have commended him for it.\n  Likewise, the President exercised true leadership in helping Congress \nto pass the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, a new law that will \nrevolutionize volunteer service in this country. This bill was a long-\ntime coming and had the support of a bipartisan coalition here in the \nSenate. Beginning with his address before Congress in February, \nPresident Obama got involved in helping this legislation move forward \nand, as a result, many people throughout the country will be given more \nopportunity to serve in their neighborhoods and to do much of the heavy \nlifting in fixing our Nation's problems. I have both publicly and \nprivately thanked the President for his support of the Serve America \nAct.\n  Sadly, such instances of true bipartisanship have been few and far \nbetween.\n  Some may believe I am being too hard on the President or that my \nconcerns are just sour grapes over my own partisan disagreements with \nthe President's agenda. But, from the day he was inaugurated, I have \ncontinually expressed my willingness to work with President Obama. \nAfter all, this is my country too and I want him to succeed. My record \nin being willing and able to work with Members of both parties speaks \nfor itself. But, in my opinion, success in addressing the major issues \nfacing our country--including health care, energy, and our crippling \nentitlement programs--will require the work\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nand ideas of both parties. So far, with very few exceptions, the \nPresident seems all too willing to keep his own counsel and that of his \nfellow Democrats on how to address these issues. This is not the type \nof government he promised on the campaign trail and, quite frankly, I \nthink it has led to policy results that, at best, have to be considered \nquestionable.\n  Going forward, I hope that, instead of cursory gestures and empty \nstatements encouraging bipartisanship, President Obama makes a real \neffort to listen to and accept ideas from both sides of the aisle. That \nwill take real courage and leadership and, thus far, I don't know that \nhe has demonstrated much of either.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FREE MEDIA IN THE OSCE REGION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier this month we marked World Press \nFreedom Day, a timely opportunity to draw attention to the plight of \njournalists and others involved in the press and media in the OSCE--\nOrganization for Security and Co-operation in Europe--region. While all \n56 OSCE countries have accepted specific commitments on media and \nworking conditions for journalists, the difficulty remains translating \nwords on paper into deeds in practice. Today, many courageous \njournalists are working under tremendously difficult conditions, often \nat great personal risk, with some paying the ultimate price for their \njournalistic pursuits.\n  According to the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, \nnearly a dozen journalists and their colleagues have been killed in the \nOSCE region since last year's observance. Among those slain in Russia \nwere Anastasiya Baburova, of Novaya Gazeta; Shafig Amrakhov, of RIA 51; \nTelman Alishaya, of TV-Chirkei; and Magomed Yevloyev, owner of the \npopular Web site Ingushetiya, who was killed while in police custody. \nScores of journalists have been murdered in Russia alone since the \nearly 1990s.\n  Others slain over the past 12 months included Ivo Pukanic and Niko \nFranjic, both of Nacional, in Croatia; and freelance journalists \nAlexander Klimchuk and Grigol Chikhladze, with Caucasus Images, as well \nas Dutch RLT TV veteran cameraman Stan Storimans, killed in the \nconflict zone during the war in Georgia last August. Besides war \ncorrespondents, victims often include investigative journalists \ncovering politics, corruption, and human rights.\n  We are approaching the fifth anniversary of the slaying of American \njournalist Paul Klebnikov in Moscow. I call upon the Russian \nauthorities to bring to justice all of those responsible in any way for \nhis murder.\n  As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I note the vital work \nundertaken by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Miklos \nHaraszti, a tireless advocate for freedom of expression and the \ncourageous journalists who pursue their profession, sometimes at great \npersonal risk. The reports of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the \nMedia are available at: http://www.osce.org/fom/.

Mr. President, I would like to speak on the nomination of \nDavid Hayes to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior. The Department of \nInterior has made some key decisions in the past few months that I \nthink warrant special attention and discussion before we vote on this \nnominee. I also want to note that several issues surrounding this \nnominee fall under the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, on which I serve as ranking member. As Deputy Secretary at \nthe Department of Interior, Mr. Hayes would oversee the implementation \nof the Endangered Species Act, a law that the EPW Committee oversees.\n  As chairman of the EPW Committee for 4 years, and now in my third \nyear as ranking member, I have worked a considerable amount with the \nDepartment of Interior, specifically the Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nits implementation of the Endangered Species Act. As ranking member, \none of my roles is to exercise rigid oversight of executive branch \nactions under EPW jurisdiction. In the past, I have seen many good \nthings come from the Department of Interior, such as the Partners for \nFish and Wildlife Program, which conserves habitat by leveraging \nFederal funds through voluntary private landowner participation, as \nwell as the delisting of the Bald Eagle, showing what good the ESA can \naccomplish. However, recent actions to reverse rules related to ESA \nhave bothered me.\n  Through my role as ranking member on the EPW Committee, I have become \nconcerned with the possibility of the ESA being used as a backdoor for \ngreenhouse gas regulation following the listing of the polar bear as a \nthreatened species. In April, I joined other Senators in a letter to \nCommerce Secretary Locke urging him not to reverse regulations \npreventing the Endangered Species Act from regulating carbon dioxide. \nNow as we move to debate the David Hayes nomination this week, we must \nagain carefully consider the motives of this administration in using \nthe Endangered Species Act. ESA should be used as a tool for protecting \ntruly threatened and endangered species, not for controlling the \nemissions of greenhouse gases from potentially every source, big or \nsmall, in America.\n  Two weeks ago, I voted for Tom Strickland to become the new Assistant \nSecretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks, after he was reported out of \nour committee. As with David Hayes, I took issue with the nomination of \nAssistant Secretary Strickland, raising questions concerning the \nadministration's decision to reverse rules on the listing of the polar \nbear and modifications to the section 7 consultation process. \nThankfully, just last week, Assistant Secretary Strickland and \nSecretary Salazar upheld the polar bear rule. While the decision by \nInterior to retain this rule shows good judgment by this \nadministration, potential lawsuits by radical environmental groups \nstill threaten to undermine the original intent of the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  What is most troublesome, however, is the decision by Interior to \noverturn the section 7 consultation rule in complete disregard of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. That is in direct contrast to President \nObama's commitment to transparency and public process. Moreover, \nrevoking this rule forces Federal agencies to consult with the Fish and \nWildlife Service for each new Federal action that may result in the \nemission of greenhouse gases. Under the ESA, a Federal action agency is \nrequired to initiate consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service or \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service if it determines that the effects \nof its action are anticipated to result in the ``take''--including \npotential harm--of any listed species, or the destruction or adverse \nmodification of designated critical habitat. This includes actions the \nagency takes itself, actions that are federally funded, as well as the \nissuance of a Federal permit or license for a private party.\n  The final rule as published last December exempted from consultation \nactions which are ``manifested through global processes and (i) cannot \nbe reliably predicted or measured at the scale of a listed species' \ncurrent range, or (ii) would result at most in an extremely small, \ninsignificant impact on a listed species or critical habitat, or (iii) \nare such that the potential risk of harm to a listed species or \ncritical habitat is remote.'' Unfortunately, after Interior's recent \ndecision to reverse this rule, Federal agencies are again subjected to \nconsulting Fish and Wildlife Services in these areas. This is a very \ncostly process, which would cover any number of highway and \nconstruction projects, including, among others, those under the \njurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Senator Murkowski, the ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee, \nhas made her position very clear on Mr. Hayes by placing a hold on his \nnomination until her questions to Secretary Salazar are fully answered. \nThe Department, and environmental groups, could manipulate the \nEndangered Species Act and the polar bear listing for purposes never \nintended by Congress. Moreover, repealing regulations without public \nhearings or public comment is a bad way to start an administration, as \nit signals to the public\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\nthat its views on important regulatory matters are irrelevant. It is my \nhope that Mr. Hayes will fully explain his position on these important \nissues, and that the Department of Interior will practice openness and \ntransparency, as President Obama has promised, by including the views \nof stakeholders and the public when it makes decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5368-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5368-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KENT WELLS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a special tribute \nto Kent Wells, a Kansan and longtime friend, who has turned his own \nbattle with multiple myeloma into a fight for continued research to \nbenefit the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, MMRF.\n  Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of the plasma cell. It is the \nsecond most common blood cancer. There are approximately 50,000 people \nin the United States living with multiple myeloma and an estimated \n15,000 new cases of the disease are diagnosed each year.\n  The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, which was established in \n1998 as a nonprofit organization, has a unique mission to urgently and \naggressively invest in research that will result in the development of \neffective treatments and, ultimately, a cure.\n  Today, MMRF has raised over $100 million to support the world's most \ncutting-edge myeloma research. The foundation is widely recognized as \nthe driving force behind progress made against the disease and one of \nthe Nation's most groundbreaking cancer research organizations.\n  When Kent received his diagnosis in 2007, he began working with the \nfoundation, personally benefiting from the research and the clinical \ndrugs that have been established. But he understands all too well that \nmuch more must be done, and Kent has chosen to fight for his own health \nand for the health of others by further supporting the work of MMFR.\n  This week, on Kent's behalf, dozens of his friends and colleagues are \nsponsoring an event that will raise money for the Multiple Myeloma \nResearch Foundation so that it can continue the efforts to develop the \nnecessary research to conquer this disease.\n  It should come as no surprise to Kent that his friends and colleagues \nfrom all walks of life have come together to share this fight with him \nand his wife Debbie and their sons, Trevor and Bryan.\n  I first met Kent in 1975. Kent was a young man from Garden City, KS, \ninterning in Washington for my predecessor, Congressman Keith Sebelius. \nI was the Congressman's chief of staff at that time.\n  I would like to take a little credit for giving Kent his start in \npublic service, hiring him for that internship. ``Potomac Fever'' must \nhave bit Kent because after he finished law school at George Washington \nUniversity, he became a legislative assistant for Senator Nancy \nKassebaum. And our friendship continued.\n  Yes, I admit to omitting one small part of his biography here. Kent \ndid receive his undergraduate degree from the University of Kansas in \nLawrence. He is a proud Jayhawk, something that he never lets this \nWildcat forget.\n  Truth be told, I think that Kent would have chosen Jayhawk basketball \nover Washington internships, but he didn't make the team. Kent, I never \ntold you that we would have welcomed you with open arms to the K-State \nteam. Instead, Kent had to settle for pickup games in Washington when \nhe came to work for Senator Kassebaum.\n  One of the genuinely nice things about working in Washington is that \nstaff for the Kansas delegation get to know one another and actually \nbecome family--not on every occasion or in every instance--but often in \nsharing a common experience.\n  I could get into quite a laundry list of mutual experiences I have \nenjoyed with Kent, his brother Kim, and the Wells family, great \nsupporters and friends. Not to embarrass Kent, but with his smile and \npersonality he could brighten up any room regardless of the occasion. \nKent Wells is just one of those people you like to be around, and that \ngenuine personality plus a lot of talent has served him, and those he \nhas worked for, well.\n  That is, of course, with the exception of the pickup basketball games \nI mentioned before. It was at a local gym that the Dole, Kassebaum, \nRoberts staffers and other hangers-on would play Saturday mornings.\n  My role, given my athletic career had sunset years previous, was to \npass the ball to the players like Kent and set blind-side picks. Kent \nis a slasher but really prefers an outside set shot. Somehow, we ended \nup on opposing teams.\n  My team would be composed of big Bill Taggart, who simply walked \naround the gym for exercise and would occasionally kick the out of \nbounds ball back; Rich, ``The Mule'' Armitage--enough said; a couple of \npickup players who simply ran with the ball as fast as they could.\n  Kent and Randy Miller, another staffer and good basketball player, \nhad their own handpicked team that, for the most part, scored at will \nwith absolutely no respect for an elder Member of Congress except to \ncall fouls.\n  The trash talk would go something like:\n  ``All he does is foul people, stay at one end of the court and try \nthat old flat hook shot.''\n  ``I know, but we have to have five people, just stay out of his way \nor if we get him, tell him to pass you the ball.''\n  You would think one would expect a little more respect, especially \nsince I would bring my young son David to shoot baskets on another \ncourt. But not these guys. The Jayhawk crimson and blue was running in \ntheir veins and they pretty much ran me off the court. But I did set \nsome hellish blind side picks, hit 1 out of every 10 flat hook shots, \nand had great times that are wonderful memories.\n  Kent's career goes well beyond Capitol Hill. Today he is a successful \ntelecommunications executive, but one of his joys is that he has passed \nthe love of KU basketball to Trevor and Bryan, both of whom proudly \nsport KU attire on campus at USC and Wisconsin.\n  Now we have come full circle with the Wells family. Thanks to his \nDad's passion for public service, Bryan Wells begins an internship with \nmy office this summer. He is clearly a chip off the old block.\n  I stand today with all of the Wells family and friends in support of \nKent's efforts to promote increased awareness and research for the \nMultiple Myeloma Foundation. He and others facing this disease are not \nalone.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nand discuss a former resident of my home State of Kansas and a disease \nthat is affecting millions of Americans and honor him today on a \nspecial occasion that is occurring to benefit the Multiple Myeloma \nResearch Foundation.\n  Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of the plasma cell. It is the \nsecond most common blood cancer. There are approximately 50,000 people \nin the United States living with multiple myeloma and an estimated \n15,000 new cases of the disease diagnosed each year. The 5-year \nsurvival rate for multiple myeloma remains only 32 percent.\n  Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, MMRF, was established in 1998 \nas a nonprofit organization with a unique mission to urgently and \naggressively invest in research that would result in the development of \neffective treatments and, ultimately, a cure. Today, MMRF has raised \nover $100 million to support the world's most cutting-edge myeloma \nresearch. The MMRF is widely recognized as the driving force behind \nprogress made against the disease and one of the Nation's most \ngroundbreaking cancer research organizations.\n  Guided by an innovative scientific plan, the MMRF supports one of the \nworld's most strategic and aggressive research drug and development \nportfolios. This diverse portfolio is comprised of cutting-edge \nprograms in three paths--basic science, validation, and clinical \ntrials--that represent the MMRF's research strategy. Taken together, \nthese research programs will accelerate the pace of scientific \ndiscovery, rapidly transform scientific progress into lifesaving \ntreatments, and ultimately lead to a faster cure for multiple myeloma.\n  I ask Congress to continue to look at ways that we can assist the \nresearch and health communities to fight this disease and help treat \nmyeloma patients.\n  I would like to take a few minutes and tell you about a special \nKansan\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\nwhom I know quite well and who is currently battling multiple myeloma.\n  Kent Wells was born and raised in Garden City, KS. Kent's first job \nwas working at the radio station in Garden City. His family moved to \nWashington, DC, in 1970 while Kent was in high school because his dad \nwas appointed as an FCC Commissioner. Kent attended Jeb Stuart High \nSchool for 1\\1/2\\ years before returning to Garden City to complete his \nsenior year and graduate with his class.\n  Kent attended college at the University of Kansas from 1972 to 1976, \ninterning for Representative Keith Sebelius in 1975, who at the time \nwas the chief of staff of my current Senate colleague from Kansas, Pat \nRoberts. Kent attended law school at George Washington University from \n1976 to 1979. Kent's first job after law school was as a legislative \nassistant to former Senator Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas from 1979 to \n1982.\n  Kent then went to work for Southwestern Bell in 1985, shortly after \ndivestiture and the opening of the Washington offices for the Baby \nBells. He moved to the Cingular office in February 2001 and back to \nAT in January 2007.\n  Kent has kept close ties to Kansas through his love of sports. He \nfollows the Kansas City Chiefs and the Royals closely, but as anyone \nwho knows him will tell you, he is crazy about Kansas basketball and \nrarely misses a Jayhawks' game. One of his joys is that he has passed \nthe love of KU basketball to his two boys, Trevor and Bryan, both of \nwhom proudly sport KU attire on campus at USC and Wisconsin. Kent's \nparents moved from Garden City to Lawrence several years ago, which \ngives him lots of chances to visit Lawrence and Allen Field House just \nto get another look at that championship trophy. He also is always for \na trip to Hutchinson, KS, to play golf at Prairie Dunes Golf Club.\n  Kent was diagnosed in 2007 with multiple myeloma and has been \nbenefited from the work of MMRF in the research and the clinical drugs \nthat have been established. But as Kent and thousands of other \nAmericans face this disease, there is more work to do.\n  Colleagues of Kent's and his wonderful wife Debbie are sponsoring an \nupcoming event on May 13, 2009, that will raise money for Multiple \nMyeloma Research Foundation and continue the efforts to develop the \nnecessary research to fight this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              COMMUNITY BANK OF RAYMORE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Missourians, I \nextend my warmest congratulations to the Community Bank of Raymore for \ntheir 30 years of service to the community.\n  Community Bank of Raymore opened its doors on May 15, 1979. As the \nfirst chartered bank in Cass County, MO, in 45 years, Community Bank of \nRaymore takes pride in being an independent community owned bank and is \ncommitted to serving its customers financial needs.\n  Starting out in a temporary facility at the current location, \nRaymore's population was only 3,138 consisting of mostly farm ground.\n  The first bank building was completed in March 1980. The entire \ncommunity celebrated the open house and accounts began to grow. It was \nestimated by an FDIC investigator that total deposits would reach 2 \nmillion in 1\\1/2\\ years. This milestone was passed in the first 6 \nmonths. Slogans were used such as ``Drive a Mile--Get a Smile'' in 1980 \nand later as area housing developed the slogan became ``The U in \nCommUnity is You.''\n  William R. McDaniel purchased Community Bank of Raymore on October \n26, 1992, and immediately became part of the community by hosting \nCustomer Appreciation Days, Open House Celebrations and Chamber \nCoffees.\n  By 1994 it was time to expand. A new facility was built adding 2,800 \nsquare feet to the existing building. In 1998 expansion accompanied the \naddition of Trust Services in January and the opening of the Peculiar \nBranch in June.\n  Community Bank of Raymore doubled in size in 2003 going through a 14-\nmonth remodel while continuing to serve the needs of their customers. \nThe bank also acquired a mortgage lending officer allowing them to \nserve area residents with their long-term home financing needs.\n  Many of their employees, directors and customers have been with the \nCommunity Bank of Raymore from the very start. The Community Bank of \nRaymore should be commended for the dedication and loyalty they have \nearned from the community in which they serve.\n  I am pleased to honor the Community Bank of Raymore on its 30th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        2009 ACADEMIC DECATHLON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the great work \nand remarkable accomplishments of Moorpark High School's Academic \nDecathlon team for winning the 2009 Academic Decathlon and becoming \nback-to-back national champions. Members of the National Championship \nteam include: Scott Buchanan, Michael Fantauzzo, Danielle Hagglund, \nZyed Ismailijee, Sol Moon, Neil Paik, Marlena Sampson, Kris Sankaran, \nSarah Thiele, and team coach Larry Jones.\n  With this win, Moorpark High School has earned the distinction of \nbecoming a four-time Academic Decathlon National Champion, previously \nwinning in 1999, 2003, and 2008. The fourth and most recent \nchampionship was won by earning an overall score of 51,289.5, 309.6-\npoints higher than their closest competitor.\n  Competing in an academic decathlon is a daunting task. Students spend \nmany hours studying, practicing, and competing, often away from their \nfamily and friends. However, I know that families across Moorpark are \nnow celebrating the accomplishments of their home team. I invite all of \nmy colleagues to join me in congratulating California's Moorpark High \nSchool Academic Decathlon team for becoming 2009 National Academic \nDecathlon Champions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5369-S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM McCOMB\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to the \noutstanding accomplishments of Jim McComb, executive director of the \nMaryland Association of Resources for Families and Youth--MARFY--since \n1989. I have known Jim for many years and I have the utmost respect for \nhim and what he has been able to accomplish for children in Maryland \nand across the Nation.\n  Jim McComb is known as one of our Nation's leading child advocates. \nHe was among the first in the country to call for the elimination of \nrestraints and seclusion in the treatment of children. He led the \neffort that made Maryland one of the first States in the country to \nensure that college tuition would be available for young students in \nfoster care.\n  During his tenure as executive director, MARFY greatly expanded its \nrole in advocating for disadvantaged children and youth, those with \ndisabilities, and their families. Under his leadership, the association \nplayed a prominent role in forming several advocacy coalitions \nincluding the Maryland Juvenile Justice Coalition and the Coalition to \nProtect Maryland's Children.\n  Jim McComb began his career in the early 1960s as a part-time \nchildcare worker at Edgemeade, a residential treatment center and \nschool for adolescents with mental illness and severe emotional \ndisturbances in Prince George's County, MD. By the end of the 1960s, he \nhad become the director of residential services for Edgemeade of \nVirginia.\n  In 1970, Jim went to Ironton, OH, to become the administrator of the \nOhio Center for Youth and Family Development, a residential treatment \ncenter for adolescents. From 1975 through 1979 he was administrator for \ncontracts and services with Youth Resources Centers, Inc., Roanoke VA. \nIn 1979, he returned to Maryland as the chief executive officer for \nEdgemeade and in 1989 he became the executive director of MARFY.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Jim on the Foster Care \nIndependence Act that was enacted into law in 1999. The bill increased \neducation and support services for foster care children between ages 18 \nand 21, an age group that had previously been tremendously underserved.\n  In the next phase of his life, Jim will serve on the board of \ndirectors of the\n\n[[Page S5370]]\n\nMaryland Foster Youth Resource Center, which provides a variety of \nsupportive resources for both youth in foster care and alumni of the \nfoster care system.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding the many accomplishments \nof Jim McComb and in wishing him success in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5370-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING THE MINNESOTA NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

BARQUIN\n\n Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nhonor an individual who lived in pursuit of a free Cuba and a better \nAmerica--Colonel Ramon M. Barquin, who died at the age of 93 on March \n3, 2008. Colonel Barquin was an accomplished military leader, an \neducator, a diplomat, and an entrepreneur. Although Cuba was his native \nhome, he made our Nation a better place during the years he lived in \nexile.\n  Ramon was born in Cienfuegos, Cuba, on May 12, 1914. At the age of \n19, he joined the Cuban Army, served his country, and graduated from \nthe Cuban Military Academy in 1941. During his years of military \nservice, Colonel Barquin attended the U.S. Strategic Intelligence \nSchool here in the U.S. Following a distinguished career in the \nmilitary, Colonel Barquin found his passion in teaching. In the \nclassroom, he worked to instill a culture of civic awareness within the \nmilitary's ranks and eventually was promoted as director of Cuba's \nmilitary schools.\n  Following his career in Cuban military education, Barquin was \nselected to serve as Chief of Intelligence of the Cuban Army. As an \nattache to the United States, Colonel Barquin was honored in 1955 with \nthe Legion of Merit for his military acumen. While serving as an \nattache, he learned of the shifting political winds in Cuba and \nconspired to prevent freedom from losing its foothold in his native \nhome. I can remember as a young boy living through tumultuous times, my \nfather often remarking that in Colonel Barquin, Cuba had the best hope \nfor democracy. His concerns led him to participate in a failed military \nrevolt against the Batista dictatorship and actively work against \nCastro's totalitarian regime. When Castro came to power, he asked \nBarquin to serve in the regime's army. Knowing the regime's repressive \nnature, Colonel Barquin instead chose to serve in an ambassadorial post \nin Europe, where he was able to flee to the United States to live in \nexile.\n  After briefly living in Miami, Barquin rekindled his passion for \neducation by establishing a consortium of schools in Puerto Rico. The \nconsortium consists of several educational institutions, including a K-\n12 military school, summer camps and an institute for civic education \nnow known as Instituto de Formacion Democratica. He was recognized for \nhis hard work and entrepreneurism by the Puerto Rican government as the \n1995 Educator of the Year.\n  Graduates of the K-12 academy he founded had kind words of \nappreciation for the Colonel's work and character. According to one \nstudent, ``with the Colonel, I learned to love my country and he taught \nme the values that lead my life today.''\n  As a Cuban-American, a Floridian, and a U.S. Senator, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to pay tribute to an individual with a legacy as awe-\ninspiring as that of Colonel Ramon M. Barquin. His unwavering \ncommitment to freedom and democracy, his generosity, and his zeal for \nserving others is sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5370-4", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5370-S5371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SOUTH DAKOTA HONOR FLIGHT\n\n Mr. THUNE.

This trip was made \npossible by the Honor Flight Network, a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to bringing World War II veterans to Washington, DC, to visit \nthe World War II Memorial at no cost to the veterans.\n  South Dakota's veterans have played an important role in making our \nNation great. Through their sacrifices, America has triumphed, remained \na free and vibrant nation, and helped others obtain their own freedom. \nI was honored to welcome these American heroes to our Nation's Capital \nto see the symbols of the freedoms they have protected around the \nworld.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Energy to carry out a \nprogram to demonstrate the commercial application of integrated systems \nfor long-term geological storage of carbon dioxide, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have been able to \nintroduce the Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Sequestration \nProgram Amendments Act of 2009, S. 1013, along with Sens. Barasso, \nDorgan, Tester, Udall, Bayh, Landrieu, Casey, and Voinovich. It is \ncritical that we work towards reducing our greenhouse gas footprint \nwhile producing safe and secure, clean energy here in America. I \nbelieve this bill will go far to incentivize early project developers \nto start reducing their carbon dioxide emissions through carbon capture \nand geologic sequestration.\n  This bipartisan bill establishes a national indemnity program through \nthe Department of Energy for up to 10 commercial-scale carbon capture \nand sequestration projects. There is a clear need for liability \ntreatments and adequate project financing for early mover projects. An \nindemnity program is a strong step to building confidence for project \ndevelopers and demonstrates that the projects will be conducted safely \nwhile addressing the growing concerns of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions from industrial facilities, such as coal and natural gas \nfired utilities, cement plants, refineries and other carbon intensive \nindustrial processes.\n  In addition, the legislation maps out a clear framework for closing \ndown a geological storage site. It is essential to consider the issue \nof safe, long-term storage of carbon dioxide and take the steps needed \nfor site stewardship during the injection phase, directly following \nclosure and for long-term preventative maintenance of the geologic \nstorage site. Many stakeholders associate maintenance issues with \nliability concerns, however they should be viewed as two separate \nentities. Maintenance is essential for reducing risk and limiting \nliabilities at a storage site, and it is critical to have robust \nmonitoring and verification of an injected carbon dioxide plume at each \nof the storage sites that would continue well past site closure. With a \nproper site maintenance program developed for each project, risk will \nbe minimized and developers will have greater confidence that \nliabilities will not be incurred. This legislation will require \nscience-based monitoring and verification of the injected carbon \ndioxide plume throughout the life of the project to well beyond the \nclosure phase.\n  Also, as carbon capture and sequestration projects grow in both scale \nand number, there will be an increasing need to train qualified \nregulators to oversee the permitting, operation, and closure of \ngeologic storage sites. This bill creates a grant program whose goal\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\nis to train State agencies and personnel who oversee the regulatory \naspects of geologic storage of carbon dioxide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit termination of employment of volunteer \nfirefighters and emergency medical personnel responding to emergencies \nor major disasters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Carper in \nintroducing a bill that would provide reasonable job protections for \nour Nation's volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel who \nsave thousands of lives across this country every year.\n  This bill is a matter of simple fairness. It recognizes that \nvolunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel not only serve \ntheir own towns and offer mutual assistance to other communities on a \nday-to-day basis, but also that they are a key component in State and \nFederal plans for responding to catastrophic natural disasters and \nterrorist attacks.\n  Across the Nation, our emergency planning relies on the ready \navailability of these brave first responders. Indeed, volunteers are \nabsolutely critical to mounting a response to disasters, both large and \nsmall. My home State of Maine, for example, has slightly more than \n10,000 firefighters in 492 departments. Because Maine is a mostly rural \nState, fully 88 percent of those firefighters are volunteers.\n  Yet, even if they are called up in a major disaster or a \nPresidentially declared emergency under the Stafford Act, these \nvolunteers have no official protection for their jobs while they are \nanswering the call to duty.\n  We should protect volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel who put \ntheir lives on the line.\n  The current lack of job protection is troubling. If large numbers of \nvolunteer firefighters and EMS personnel were terminated or demoted \nafter being called away to a disaster or a series of disasters, \nrecruitment and retention of volunteers could be devastated.\n  The Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection Act would \ncorrect the injustice and mitigate the danger in a measured and \nresponsible way. It would protect the volunteer first responders \nagainst termination or demotion by employers if they are called upon to \nrespond to a Presidentially declared emergency or a major disaster for \nup to 14 work days.\n  Most employers are strong supporters of our volunteer firefighters \nand EMS personnel, and this bill imposes no unreasonable burdens on \nemployers. They are not obligated to pay the volunteers during their \nabsence, and they are entitled to receive official documentation that \nan absent employee was in fact summoned to and served in a disaster \nresponse.\n  Finally, I would note that the bill would facilitate the work of \nemergency managers. Having this job protection in force would allow \nthem to make operational and contingency plans with greater confidence, \nknowing that volunteer responders would not be forced to withdraw in \nshort order for fear of losing their jobs.\n  By extending some peace of mind to these brave men and women, we can \nstrengthen the protection and lifesaving response that they provide to \nmany millions of Americans. I believe this bill merits the support of \nevery Senator, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 1026. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act to improve procedures for the collection and delivery of \nmarked absentee ballots of absent overseas uniformed service voters, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Military \nVoting Protection Act--a bipartisan bill to support our troops and \nprotect their right to vote. In every Federal election in recent \nmemory, American Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have \nencountered substantial roadblocks in the voting process, especially \nthose who are deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. This is a national \ndisgrace.\n  Our military service members put their lives on the line to protect \nthe rights and freedoms of all Americans. In return, it is our \nresponsibility to do everything we can to support them. The nature of \nthe Global War on Terror and the high tempo of U.S. military \noperations--including our surge into Afghanistan--will necessitate \noverseas service by our troops for the foreseeable future. It is \nimperative that we put in place a system to ensure that American \nservice members serving abroad can participate in the democratic \nprocess even as they simultaneously fight to defend our democracy, its \ninstitutions, and the American way of life. Surely, these brave men and \nwomen have earned at least that much through their blood, sweat, and \ntears.\n  Yet the country they defend has repeatedly denied our troops one of \nour most sacred rights--the right to vote. The U.S. Election Assistance \nCommission, in studying the 2006 election, found that only 47.6 percent \nof the military voters who requested absentee ballots were actually \nsuccessful in casting those ballots. That means that less than half of \nthose troops who wanted to vote were able to do so,\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\nwhich is appalling. Overall participation rates among military and \noverseas voters in the November 2006 election were also extremely low. \nLooking at the big picture, there were roughly 6 million eligible \nmilitary and overseas U.S. voters at that time, but only 16.5 percent \nof them were able to request an absentee ballot for the election. \nAccording to a 2006 DoD Inspector General report, only 59 percent of \nsurveyed service members even knew where to obtain voting information \non their installation, and only 40 percent had actually received \nassistance from their designated Voting Assistance Officer. Though the \nofficial data from the 2008 election is not yet available, the \npreliminary evidence indicates that our military voters faced the same \narray of problems in trying to cast their ballots as in previous \nelections.\n  Our troops report many procedural hurdles when trying to participate \nin federal, state, and local elections. States have inadequate \nprocesses and unreasonable timelines in place for transmitting blank \nabsentee ballots to our troops, and the methods available to these \nservice members for returning completed ballots to local election \nofficials are both slow and antiquated. Moreover, there are a myriad of \nabsentee voting rules and regulations that are extremely confusing and \nvary widely with each state. The process is clearly broken, and there \nis no excuse for not stepping up to challenge the status quo and \nstreamline the process. We ask so much of our troops, and in return we \nhave given them a voting system that is perplexing, frustrating, slow, \nand often dysfunctional. They deserve better.\n  The bill I introduce today can help address some of these procedural \nhurdles. The Military Voting Protection, MVP, Act will give our troops \na louder and clearer voice at the polls by ensuring their absentee \nballots are delivered back home in time to be counted and do not get \nlost on the way. It will reduce delays in the absentee voting process \nby requiring the Department of Defense to take a more active role in \nthe process. The MVP Act will require the DoD to be responsible for \ncollecting completed absentee ballots from overseas troops and then \nexpress-shipping them back to the U.S. in time to be counted, allowing \ntroops to track their ballots while they are in transit and confirm \ntheir delivery after they arrive at local election offices.\n  I am pleased that Senators Wyden and Inhofe have joined me in this \neffort; it is a testament to their unwavering support for the members \nof our Armed Forces.\n  We should pass this bipartisan bill quickly so that elections \nofficials have time to prepare for the 2010 election cycle. Meaningful \nreform will not come overnight, but now is the time to take up the \ncause of military voters. There are 18 months until the next election, \nwhich is enough time to implement significant improvements. If we fail, \nfurther disenfranchisement of military voters will likely result. We \nmust avoid a repeat of 2004, 2006, and 2008.\n  This bill does not solve all the problems with our current military \nvoting system, but it is an important first step. The Americans who \nanswer the call to serve are a national treasure, and I remain in awe \nof their selfless sacrifice and commitment to the defense of freedom. \nIn what is now the 8th year of the Global War on Terror, they continue \nto voluntarily step forward to defend our Nation and our freedom--often \nrequiring immeasurable personal sacrifice by them and their loved ones. \nThe members of this next ``greatest generation'' deserve nothing less \nthan the same constitutional rights and individual liberties that they \nsafeguard for their fellow citizens back home. It is the responsibility \nof Congress to ensure that they get them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1026\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Voting Protection \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the defense of freedom, members of the United States \n     Armed Forces are routinely deployed to overseas theaters of \n     combat, assigned to overseas locations, and assigned to \n     ocean-going vessels far from home.\n       (2) As the United States continues to fight the Global War \n     on Terror, the substantial need for overseas service by \n     members of the Armed Forces will continue, as we live in what \n     senior Army leaders have referred to as an ``era of \n     persistent conflict''.\n       (3) The right to vote is one of the most basic and \n     fundamental rights enjoyed by Americans, and one which the \n     members of the Armed Forces bravely defend both at home in \n     the United States and overseas.\n       (4) The decisions of elected officials of the United States \n     Government directly impact the members of the Armed Forces \n     who are often called to deploy or otherwise serve overseas as \n     a result of decisions made by such elected officials.\n       (5) The ability of the members of the Armed Forces to vote \n     while serving overseas has been hampered by numerous factors, \n     including inadequate processes for ensuring their timely \n     receipt of absentee ballots, delivery methods that are \n     typically slow and antiquated, and a myriad of absentee \n     voting procedures that are often confusing and vary among the \n     several States.\n       (6) The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting \n     Act, which requires the States to allow absentee voting for \n     members of the Armed Forces and other specified groups of \n     United States citizens, was intended to protect the voting \n     rights of members of the Armed Forces.\n       (7) The current system of absentee voting for overseas \n     members of the Armed Forces could be greatly improved by \n     decreasing delays in the process, and certain steps by the \n     Department of Defense, including utilization of express mail \n     services for the delivery of completed absentee ballots, \n     would address the major sources of delay.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF MARKED \n                   ABSENTEE BALLOTS OF ABSENT OVERSEAS UNIFORMED \n                   SERVICES VOTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \n     Absentee Voting Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ff et seq.) is amended by \n     inserting after section 103 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 103A.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a resolution today \nto designate Saturday, July 25, 2009 as ``National Day of the American \nCowboy.'' My late colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, began the tradition \nof honoring the men and women known as ``Cowboys'' five years ago when \nhe introduced the first resolution to designate the fourth Saturday of \nJuly as National Day of the American Cowboy. I'm proud to carry on \nSenator Thomas's tradition.\n  The national day celebrates the history of Cowboys in America and \nrecognizes the important work today's Cowboys are doing in the United \nStates. The Cowboy Spirit is about honesty, integrity, courage, and \npatriotism, and Cowboys are models of strong character, sound family \nvalues, and good common sense.\n  Cowboys were some of the first men and women to settle in the \nAmerican West and they continue to make important contributions to our \neconomy, Western culture and my home state of Wyoming today. This \nyear's resolution designates July 25, 2009 as the National Day of the \nAmerican Cowboy.

Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 627, to amend \nthe Truth in Lending Act to establish fair and transparent practices \nrelating to the extension of credit under an open end consumer credit \nplan, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n               TITLE VI--CREDIT CARD SAFETY STAR PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Credit Card Safety Star \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) competition in the credit card market is severely \n     hindered by a lack of transparency, which results in \n     inefficient consumer choices;\n       (2) such lack of transparency is largely due to confusing \n     terms and overwhelming information for consumers;\n       (3) the marketplace has not increased competition based on \n     the merits of credit cards;\n       (4) a Government rating system that would use market forces \n     by encouraging better transparency would increase such \n     competition and assist consumers in making better credit card \n     choices; and\n       (5) such a rating system would not preclude additional \n     regulation or legislation that may eliminate certain \n     practices considered unfair or abusive.\n\n     SEC. 603.

USURIOUS CREDIT RATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest \n     rates in America since colonial times;\n       (2) at the State level, 15 States and the District of \n     Columbia have enacted broadly applicable usury laws that \n     protect borrowers from payday loans and many other forms of \n     high-cost credit, while 34 States and the District of \n     Columbia have limited annual interest rates to 36 percent or \n     less for 1 or more types of consumer credit;\n       (3) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a \n     Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members \n     and their families for covered credit products, as defined by \n     the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, \n     and tax refund lending around military bases;\n       (4) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory \n     lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to \n     loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms \n     of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates \n     permitted by preemption;\n       (5) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, \n     consumers annually pay approximately $17,500,000,000 for \n     high-cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,600,000,000 for \n     storefront and online payday loans, and nearly $900,000,000 \n     for tax refund anticipation loans;\n\n[[Page S5389]]\n\n       (6) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent \n     annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest \n     for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft \n     loans, 50 to 500 percent annual interest for loans secured by \n     expected tax refunds, and higher than 50 percent annual \n     percentage interest for credit cards that charge junk fees;\n       (7) a national maximum interest rate that includes all \n     forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to \n     eliminate such predatory lending; and\n       (8) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small \n     dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment \n     schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be \n     encouraged.\n       (b) National Maximum Interest Rate.--Chapter 2 of the Truth \n     in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 140A.

Res. 121\n\n       Whereas, in the United States and around the world, more \n     than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of \n     extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of \n     extinction;\n       Whereas the actual and potential benefits that may be \n     derived from many species have not yet been fully discovered \n     and would be permanently lost if not for conservation \n     efforts;\n       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping \n     crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray \n     wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have \n     resulted in great improvements in the viability of such \n     species;\n       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound \n     research, careful coordination, and intensive management of \n     conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness \n     and education;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of endangered or threatened species reside on \n     private lands;\n       Whereas voluntary cooperative conservation programs have \n     proven to be critical to habitat restoration and species \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the \n     first steps in effectively informing the public about \n     endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2009, as ``Endangered Species Day'';\n       (2) encourages schools to spend at least 30 minutes on \n     Endangered Species Day teaching and informing students \n     about--\n       (A) threats to endangered species around the world; and\n       (B) efforts to restore endangered species, including the \n     essential role of private landowners and private stewardship \n     in the protection and recovery of species;\n       (3) encourages organizations, businesses, private \n     landowners, and agencies with a shared interest in conserving \n     endangered species to collaborate in developing educational \n     information for use in schools; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to become educated about, and aware of, threats to \n     species, success stories in species recovery, and \n     opportunities to promote species conservation worldwide; and\n       (B) to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5394-5", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5394-S5395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DESIGNATING MAY 15, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL MPS AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 143\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') is a genetically determined lysosomal \n     storage disease that renders the human body incapable of \n     producing certain enzymes needed to break down complex \n     carbohydrates;\n       Whereas complex carbohydrates are then stored in almost \n     every cell in the body and progressively cause damage to such \n     cells;\n       Whereas such cell damage adversely affects the human body \n     by damaging the heart, respiratory system, bones, internal \n     organs, and central nervous system;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS often results in \n     mental retardation, short stature, corneal damage, joint \n     stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, \n     heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, \n     and, most importantly, a drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas the nature of the disease is usually not apparent \n     at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas recent research developments have resulted in the \n     creation of limited treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of newly developed remedies, \n     the blood-brain barrier continues to be a significant \n     impediment to effectively treating the brain, thereby \n     preventing the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life for individuals afflicted with \n     MPS, and the treatments available to them, will be enhanced \n     through the development of early detection techniques and \n     early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     those within the medical community;\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n       Whereas the damage that is caused by MPS makes it a model \n     for the study of many other degenerative genetic diseases;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution;\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution than can raise public \n     awareness about MPS; and\n       Whereas the Senate is also an institution that can assist \n     in encouraging and facilitating increased public and private \n     sector research for early diagnosis and treatments of MPS \n     diseases: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2009, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason we say ``MPS'' is the word is \nhard to pronounce. It is spelled M-U-C-O-P-O-L-Y-S-A-C-C-H-A-R-I-D-O-S-\nI-S. I commend the Senators for moving this forward. It is a very \ncomplex problem many people have. More awareness should be made of this \ncondition. As a result, we are confident and hopeful that because this \nresolution passes, there will be more medical research about this \ncondition, MPS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/12/senate-section/article/S5395-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL WOMEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.
