Con. Res. 13).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the Senator from Nevada is going to be \nrecognized to offer an amendment at this time. I note that after the \nSenator from Nevada, the plan is to go to Senator Coburn, Senator \nSessions, Senator Cornyn, Senator Grassley, Senator Brownback, Senator \nVitter and Senator DeMint, and then maybe Senator Coburn again and then \nmaybe Senator Ensign again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3593\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3593.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3593.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve access to pro bono care for medically underserved \n    or indigent individuals by providing limited medical liability \n                              protections)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2__. HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET ENHANCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Liability.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, a health care professional shall not be \n     liable in any medical malpractice lawsuit for a cause of \n     action arising out of the provision of, or the failure to \n     provide, any medical service to a medically underserved or \n     indigent individual while engaging in the provision of pro \n     bono medical services.\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\n       (b) Requirements.--Subsection (a) shall not apply--\n       (1) to any act or omission by a health care professional \n     that is outside the scope of the services for which such \n     professional is deemed to be licensed or certified to \n     provide, unless such act or omission can reasonably be \n     determined to be necessary to prevent serious bodily harm or \n     preserve the life of the individual being treated;\n       (2) if the services on which the medical malpractice claim \n     is based did not arise out of the rendering of pro bono care \n     for a medically underserved or indigent individual; or\n       (3) to an act or omission by a health care professional \n     that constitutes willful or criminal misconduct, gross \n     negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant \n     indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed \n     by such professional.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``medically underserved individual'' means an \n     individual who does not have health care coverage under a \n     group health plan, health insurance coverage, or any other \n     health care coverage program; and\n       (2) the term ``indigent individual'' means and individual \n     who is unable to pay for the health care services that are \n     provided to the individual.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, very briefly, this is an amendment to \nimprove the health care system in America. We talk about making health \ncare more affordable. One of the ways to do that is to encourage people \nto give away health care.\n  In my veterinary practice, I used to give away about 10 to 20 percent \nof my business. I did not have to be worried about being sued. Every \ndoctor, every health care provider I have talked with, if they give \naway, if they do it pro bono, if they do it out of compassion, that is \none of the first times they are going to get sued.\n  What this amendment says is, unless there is gross negligence, if a \nhealth care provider is giving their services away out of the \ncompassion of their heart, they cannot be sued. It is a very simple \namendment.\n  We have had this debate on the Senate floor before. This would \ngreatly improve our medical system by encouraging people to be \ncompassionate for those who cannot afford medical care, but they should \nnot have to be worried about being sued if they happen to be \ncompassionate enough to give their services away.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. I encourage all our colleagues to \nvote for this amendment. This will improve our health care system in \nthe United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we just now saw this amendment. We have \nto look at it. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, as I said, we were just handed this \namendment. We have now examined it. This is an amendment that is \nrelated to medical malpractice and tort reform. There are a lot of \nprovisions already in the bill which cover this subject. However, the \nmain point of this amendment is not the jurisdiction of the relevant \ncommittees.\n  I raise a point of order that the Ensign amendment would violate \nsection 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of my amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from Washington \n(Ms. Cantwell), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

I ask unanimous consent that all additional votes on this \nbill be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3700.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To help protect Second Amendment rights of law-abiding \n                               Americans)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                 TITLE III--SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. 3001. VETERANS SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act''.\n       (b) Conditions for Treatment of Certain Persons as \n     Adjudicated Mentally Incompetent for Certain Purposes.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 55 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 5511. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as \n       adjudicated mentally incompetent for certain purposes\n\n       ``In any case arising out of the administration by the \n     Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, a person who \n     is mentally incapacitated, deemed mentally incompetent, or \n     experiencing an extended loss of consciousness shall not be \n     considered adjudicated as a mental defective under subsection \n     (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of title 18 without the order \n     or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial \n     authority of competent jurisdiction that such person is a \n     danger to himself or herself or others.''.\n       (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 55 of such title is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new item:\n\n``5511. Conditions for treatment of certain persons as adjudicated \n              mentally incompetent for certain purposes.''.\n\n       (c) Severability.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, if any provision\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n     of this section, or any amendment made by this section, or \n     the application of such provision or amendment to any person \n     or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, this section \n     and amendments made by this section and the application of \n     such provision or amendment to other persons or circumstances \n     shall not be affected thereby.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, 140,000 of our troops have lost their \nsecond amendment rights as they go through the VA hospital system. They \nare not a danger to themselves or anyone else. This amendment is \nsomething that has passed this body unanimously, has come out of the \ncommittee unanimously, but still we have 140,000 of our long-serving \nveterans who have lost their rights to own a gun, hunt with their \ngrandchildren, or to hunt birds in North Dakota.\n  We have taken it away, not because of anything we did, because the \nbureaucracy did it. This amendment restores that. As they have gone \nthrough the VA system and the health care system, a bureaucrat has \ntaken that right away.\n  This is supported by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, AMVETS, \nMilitary Order of Purple Heart, NRA, Gun Owners of America, Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and the American Legion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is a health care reform----\n  Mr. COBURN. They lost it under their health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a health care reform bill, and we should keep all \namendments to that subject. When we were sworn in as Senators, we took \nan oath of office to support the Constitution of the United States, \nwhich clearly includes the second amendment. All of us have a strong \nbelief in the second amendment to our Constitution. But whatever you \nthink about second amendment rights and the application of the second \namendment, whatever you think about veterans and the relationship to \nquestions of competency, I think we all should agree that neither what \nanybody thinks about second amendment rights or what veterans' \nrelations should be to that should be in this bill. This is a health \ncare bill.\n  I note this bill already explicitly protects the rights of gun \nowners. Therefore, because this amendment is nearly entirely composed \nof matter outside the jurisdiction of the reconciled committees, I \nraise a point of order that the Coburn amendment violates section \n313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-as-you-go Act of 2010, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of my amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

I would note that loopholes do remain in the health \ncare legislation. My amendment would simply ensure that the promise \nthat has been made to the American people would be kept. It sets up an \neffective eligibility verification system consistent with that for \nother Federal health-related programs.\n  The amendment maintains current law, which prohibits legal immigrants \nfrom becoming a public charge on the taxpayers. It also prohibits the \nSecretary from drafting any regulation that would amend or alter these \nprinciples, principles that the President, the Congress, and the \nAmerican people have said they support. The amendment would reduce \nfraud and the financial burden of the legislation on the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nSessions amendment. It does two things. First, it requires legal \npermanent residents in the United States to produce documentary proof \nof their legality. We tried this under Medicaid and found out that many \npeople in our country, the elderly and others, found it difficult to \nproduce documentation though they were clearly eligible and clearly \nlegal and entitled to basic assistance.\n  Instead, our bill that we passed, health care reform, verifies that a \nperson is legal by declaration of their Social Security number, which \nis verified. So we go through a good process here to make sure only \nthose eligible will receive, and, secondly, what Senator Sessions' \namendment does, is say to legal permanent residents paying taxes, they \ncannot use the Tax Code like other citizens for deductions and credits \nfor 5 years. They are paying taxes under the Tax Code. They should be \nallowed the same tax credits as other Americans, other people living in \nthis country.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat it for those two reasons, and the fact \nthat this is an attempt to derail this bill.\n  I move to table the Sessions amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

LIMITATION ON APPLICATION OF ACTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services shall not implement the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2011 until the Office of the \n     Actuary at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n     certifies to Congress that such Acts will reduce National \n     health expenditures relative to the level of such \n     expenditures under current law.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this amendment would ensure that health \ncare reform costs are lowered by this piece of legislation. If \nindependent actuaries for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices cannot certify that this health care reform legislation lowers \nnational health expenditures, this bill will not go into effect.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment is a thinly disguised \nattempt to kill health care reform. Let me explain why. I remind my \ncolleagues that the Congressional Budget Office has told us that in the \nfirst 10 years the bill actually will reduce the deficit by a \nsignificant amount. CBO also informs us that health care reform will \nlower premiums for 97 percent of Americans, improve benefits for many \nwho are underinsured, and health care reform will bend the growth curve \nof health care spending. The CMS Actuary also says that national health \ncare spending will be lower under the law than it will be without \nreform. In 2019, health spending will be 6.7 percent, compared to 7.2 \nwithout reform.\n  To prohibit implementation unless all these projections bear out is \njust another attempt to kill the bill. For that reason, I urge \ncolleagues to resist this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Montana has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, if you raise taxes enough and if you cut \nMedicare enough, you might be able to claim, through phony bookkeeping, \nthat somehow this cuts the deficit. The administration's own actuaries \nhave concluded this law will raise health care costs. That is why it is \nimportant we pass this amendment, so that the central purpose of this \nlegislation--to bend the cost curve down--is actually realized.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we need to move these amendments more \nquickly. We have an agreement. We want to make sure everyone continues \nworking in good faith. I ask unanimous consent that all future votes, \nstarting with this one, be 10 minutes, and we will only have 2 minutes \nfor the penalty period, so to speak. After 12 minutes, the votes are \ngoing to be cut off. Everyone should understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to table the Cornyn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is about geographical equity for \nall States. The Senate health reform bill just signed into law includes \na frontier sweetheart deal that improves Medicare payments for five \nrural States at the expense of the other 45. The special deal is for \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. The Washington \nPost calls these deals the ``Candy Land'' of the health care bill. \nRepealing this provision will not kill the bill because it has to go \nback to the House anyway.\n  My amendment also ensures that Health and Human Services cannot undo \nthe formula fix that my amendment established in the Senate health care \nbill that is now law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for my good \nfriend from Iowa. We work very closely together. We want to make sure \nour States are fully incorporated, involved in the national health care \ndelivery system; that is, rural States. We also want a balance between \nurban and rural. It is the only fair solution. This bill has that \nbalance.\n  I might say, there are some--I chuckle a little bit--I have talked to \nsome of my friends in the East who talk about rural America--rural New \nYork or rural Illinois or rural Indiana--and I appreciate that very \nmuch. But we are talking here, with frontier States, with what is \nreally rural: only about six people per square mile.\n  So I say to my friend from Iowa, we have the balance in the bill. We \nshould maintain that current balance. I think this amendment is \ninadvisable, and I urge us to not support it.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3697\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I call up, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Murkowski, amendment No. 3697 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for himself and \n     Ms. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 3697.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To index tax thresholds imposed under the legislation to \n prevent the government from using inflation to impose those taxes on \n  individuals currently making less than $200,000 and families making \n                          less than $250,000)\n\n       At the end of section 1402(a), insert the following:\n       (5) Inflation adjustment.--Section 1411 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, as added by paragraph (1), is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Adjustment for Inflation.--In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning after December 31, 2013, each of the dollar \n     amounts under paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (b), \n     subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 3101(b)(2), and clauses \n     (i) and (iii) of section 1401(b)(2)(A) shall be increased by \n     an amount equal to--\n       ``(1) such amount, multiplied by\n       ``(2) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which such taxable \n     year begins by substituting `calendar year 2012' for \n     `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) thereof.\n     If any increase determined under this subsection is not a \n     multiple of $1,000, such increase shall be rounded to the \n     next lowest multiple of $1,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this is a very simple but very \nimportant amendment in the sense that the new surtaxes on Medicare, on \nwages, and on unearned income are not indexed for inflation. All of my \ncolleagues are familiar with the problem we have had with the \nalternative minimum tax being not indexed for inflation, and with that \nbeing a problem, it is now built into this bill. This new surtax is not \nindexed for inflation.\n  If I can show my colleagues for a moment, on this chart, we can see \nhow quickly, with a 4-percent rate of inflation, the people who are \ngetting the subsidy today will be taxed as high income in a few years. \nThis is a problem we are very familiar with. We fight with it \nregularly. It is part of the funding base of this bill. It needs to be \ntaken out. The bill should not be paid for with inflation, and we are \nall too likely to have significant inflation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have a lot of sympathy with the \namendment. We don't want to get into an AMT situation. The AMT was not \nindexed when the AMT was enacted. We are now paying the price today. It \nis very possible that if this level is not indexed, we may be paying \nthe price later on, in several years' time, but this is not the time or \nplace.\n  I might also say there are other provisions in the bill that are not \nindexed, such as the affordability provisions. That is not indexed. I \ndon't think it is fair to index only for upper income and others whose \nincomes are below $20,000. But it is an issue, and we will address this \nat a subsequent date because it must be.\n  In the meantime, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the whole be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the new government entitlement program from \n              further increasing an unsustainable deficit)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SUSPENSION OF THE ACT.\n\n       If at the beginning of any fiscal year OMB determines that \n     the deficit targets set forth in the CBO report of March 20, \n     2010 will not be met, the provisions of this Act and the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shall be suspended \n     for that year.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I was very happy to hear the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee absolutely promise that \nthe ObamaCare bill will reduce the deficit, and the CBO projects that. \nThe problem is, I think the American people have a very different view \nbased on their gut common sense. There was a recent national scientific \npoll that showed significantly more Americans think there is life on \nMars than think that the bill will reduce the deficit.\n  My amendment is a simple, straightforward way to settle the question. \nIt says for any fiscal year when those CBO costs or deficit reduction \nprojections are busted, the entire ObamaCare bill is suspended. So, in \nfact, if this is ballooning spending and ballooning the deficit, we \nwill stop it in its tracks. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have had all sorts of amendments this \nmorning. We have had amendments on malpractice, we have had amendments \non guns, we have had amendments on immigration. Even last night we had \namendments on some very interesting subjects, but this is the return of \nthe killer amendment. We had a few killer amendments yesterday, and \nthis is the return of the killer amendment.\n  Why is it a killer amendment? Basically because this would suspend \nhealth care reform if certain arbitrary budget targets are not met. It \nis on again, off again, wondering about the other. It is clearly \ndesigned to kill the bill. Therefore, Madam President, I raise a point \nof order that the Vitter amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this motion will ensure that the new \ngovernment health regime that has just been made law will not prohibit \nAmericans from purchasing private health insurance plans across State \nlines without going through a government exchange.\n  Throughout this yearlong health care debate, we have talked about the \nimportance of competition between insurance companies, how it could \nbring accountability and lower costs. Yet the laws of the land have \nactually created State-by-State monopolies that have not been \nresponsive to the American people and have run up costs.\n  This motion could change that, creating hundred of choices, for \nAmericans all across our Nation, with insurance companies competing for \ntheir business. CBO says this would lower their costs at least 5 \npercent; other folks say much more, particularly if you are in a State \nwith a lot of mandates.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my motion.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a motion to commit to the Finance Committee \nobviously designed to kill the bill. Clearly, there is inadequate \ncompetition among insurance companies in most of our States. In fact, \nin most States I think there are maybe just two major companies. We \nwant to encourage much more competition.\n  Allowing them to sell across State lines is in concept a good idea, \nbut it must be done responsibly. The underlying bill--the bill that \npassed, actually--does allow for interstate compacts. States can \ncompact to sell across State lines. Once the exchange is open in 2014, \ninsurance companies will automatically be able to sell across State \nlines. But to allow sales now would be irresponsible because it would \nencourage a race to the bottom. By that, I mean that irresponsible \ncompanies will be inclined to go to States with the lowest standards \nand then sell health insurance to other parts of the country, so people \nin other States will have virtually no remedies.\n  It makes sense to have health care reform provisions in place, and \nthen we can sell across State lines with compacts through the \nexchanges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the DeMint motion, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself and Mr. \n     Brown of Massachusetts, proposes an amendment numbered 3710.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the penalty for failure to comply with the \n                          individual mandate)\n\n       Strike section 1002 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1002.

I call the attention of the Senate to this clever \ncartoon. This cartoon has captured a very important part of this health \ncare bill. It is a Trojan horse that says ``health care reform'' on it. \nYou see a bunch of IRS agents coming out.\n  My amendment goes to the heart of one of the problems with this bill. \nThere is an individual mandate that puts fines on people that can also \nattach civil penalties. And 16,500 new IRS agents are going to be \nrequired to be hired because of the health care reform bill.\n  Do we want IRS agents showing up at people's houses, not only to \naudit them because of their taxes but because now they are not paying \nan individual mandate fine? I do not think America wants expansion of \nthe IRS. We should be focusing on jobs, not new jobs for IRS agents.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment that would \neliminate the individual fines on the individual mandates and civil \npenalties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the whole premise, the theory of health \ncare reform is that it is a shared responsibility--employers, \nemployees, American citizens, companies, a shared solution here.\n  The bill already waives any criminal penalties. That is taken out of \nthe bill. No criminal penalties. A person cannot go to jail. That is \nprovided for in the bill that was signed a couple of days ago. The bill \nalso limits collection activities. It is very sensitive to the points \nmade by the Senator from Nevada. It has a good balance of \nresponsibility and accountability. But there must be some consequence \nof somebody not living up to his or her shared responsibility. It is \nvery sensitive to doing this in the right way. I think it is a good \nbalance. Their amendment goes way too far by eliminating any \nconsequences.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the amendment I offer is simple. What \nwe are doing is indexing for inflation the Medicare tax increase the \nmajority has levied on the American people through this health care \nbill. Under the bill that is now law, Medicare taxes are going to jump \n.9 percent for certain income groups. This is about an $86 billion tax \nhike. My amendment aim is to contain the damage by indexing for \ninflation the wage thresholds for those subject to the tax increase. \nThe amendment is very similar to what my friend from Kansas offered not \ntoo many amendments ago. It is a reminder that we have gone down this \npath before with the AMT. The AMT was not indexed for inflation. Today \nwe have nearly 30 million taxpayers hit by the AMT tax. We deal with it \nevery year through the AMT patch. I wish to make sure we are not \nrepeating history.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, as I said on the Brownback amendment, \nthere is much to be said for indexing this provision. It is true we \ndon't want to get back into the situation we now face with the AMT \nbecause the AMT was not originally indexed. Unfortunately, the current \namendment will be offset with unspent, unallocated mandatory spending \nof stimulus funds. Unemployment is still hovering close to 10 percent. \nThere is growing evidence the recovery package is working. I don't \nthink we want to stifle the stimulus now. Over the last 6 months of \n2009, the economy grew at an annual rate of 4 percent. The fourth \nquarter grew at a higher rate, but that was due to an inventory \nsituation. By and large, it is not proper to offset this with stimulus \ndollars. We will find some time at a later date to deal with this \nissue. I do think it is a serious issue.\n  I raise a point of order that the Murkowski amendment violates \nsection 313(b)(1)(c) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our small businesses are struggling. \nWe all know that. We are trying to encourage small businesses to hire \nand help our economy. Yet when this bill passes, our small businesses \nare going to have a tax credit if they offer health care to their \nemployees, but what we are not telling the American people is that tax \ncredit is limited to 2 years once the bill becomes fully effective. \nWhen the exchange opens, then the tax credit will last for 2 years.\n  My amendment assures this is not going to be a bait-and-switch to our \nsmall businesspeople; that they will be able to have the tax credit \npermanently if they offer health care to their employees and they are a \nbusiness of 25 employees and under.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment to help these small \nbusinesses. That is what will encourage them to offer health care to \ntheir employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in an effort to help small business, there \nare many provisions in this bill to accomplish that result. One is $37 \nbillion in tax credits that are in this bill already for small \nbusiness.\n  I do agree with the Senator from Texas, though, that it would be \nbetter if the credit, which is available for 2 years beginning in 2014 \nwhen the exchange is up and running, was extended. That would be my \npreference. But right now, in 2010, we are short on money, frankly, and \nwe can't find all the money that is necessary to make that permanent to \naccomplish the wishes of the Senator from Texas. But I do say I am \nsympathetic with extending that 2 years, and we will work to try to \nfind ways in the future to accomplish that.\n  In the meantime, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3712\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3712, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3712.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To give States incentives to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse \n                      in their Medicaid programs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1207. FMAP REDUCTION FOR HIGH PAYMENT ERROR RATE.\n\n       Section 1905 of the Social Security Act, as amended by \n     section 1202(b) of this Act, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(ee) Decreased FMAP for High Payment Error Rate \n     Measurement.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, beginning January 1, 2014, in the case of a State for \n     which the payment error rate measurement (commonly referred \n     to as `PERM') is at least 10 percent, the Federal medical \n     assistance percentage otherwise applicable to the State with \n     respect to payments for medical assistance for individuals \n     enrolled in the State plan under subclause (VIII) or (IX) of \n     section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) or subclause (XX) or (XXI) of \n     section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii) shall be reduced by 1 percentage \n     point until the date on which the Secretary determines that \n     the PERM for the State is below 10 percent.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this amendment will lower the deficit \nwhile attacking the scourge of fraud and waste in our Medicaid Program. \nThe $3.4 trillion Medicaid Program is riddled with waste, fraud, and \nabuse, and improper repayment rates that range roughly in the 10-\npercent range for the Nation. Some States and some cities are even \nworse.\n  In Washington, DC, 19.3 percent of Medicaid payments are classified \nby Health and Human Services as improper payments. In Oregon, one out \nof every five people on Medicaid is not even eligible to be on \nMedicaid. That is 20 percent.\n  This amendment takes the $434 billion that we are putting into the \nhealth care coverage, much of it in Medicaid, and it provides a \nfinancial incentive for the States to reduce their improper payment \nrates.\n  Since the Medicaid expansion does not go into effect until 2014, this \nprovides a more than adequate period of time for the States to comply \nwith bringing their improper payment rates down under Medicaid and thus \nto avoid any penalty under this amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues for their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all want to fight fraud, waste, and \nabuse. In fact, there are many provisions in this bill which so \nprovide. To add to that, when we negotiated the bill, the White House \ncame up with even stronger provisions. They have the screening, time to \ncheck for payments, and so forth.\n  I talked with the Senator from Florida, Mr. LeMieux, who also has \ngood ideas. I pledge to him to do what we can to get some of that \npassed this year. However, the amendment before us is much too \npunitive. It is arbitrary in its numbers. I think it would be \ncounterproductive, especially at a time when States are already \nstruggling with their Medicaid Programs. I think it would be \ninappropriate for us to lay this arbitrary punitive measure on them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to make a \nquick statement just for the edification of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is our last amendment, I believe and hope--genuinely\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nhope. After this amendment is completed, I understand there will be a \ncolloquy between the ranking member of the Finance Committee and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Then we will proceed to raising \npoints of order relative to the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And other measures.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then we will proceed to final passage at 2 o'clock. That \nis the general outline of where we are.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might reconfirm, this is the last amendment. There will \nbe points of order raised and other business will transpire before we \nget to the points of order, which I understand will begin about quarter \nof 2. We are going to finish at 2 o'clock. We are right there. It is \ngoing to work.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Cornyn amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I \nwish to repeat that statement: That was the last vote on amendments.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I was unable to cast a vote for \nrollcall No. 99 in the second session of the 111th Congress--the motion \nto waive the Budget Act point of order against Vitter amendment No. \n3665 to H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. \nHad I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on the motion.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I was unfortunately off the Senate floor \nwhen the Senate conducted rollcall votes Nos. 68 and 101 and, \ntherefore, missed those recorded votes. I wish to state for the record \nthat had I been prsent for rollcall vote No. 68, I would have voted \n``yea'' on the motion to table Senate amendment No. 3582, and if I had \nbeen present for rollcall vote No. 101, I would have voted ``yea'' on \nthe motion to table Senate amendment No. 3710.\n\n\n                      Lawfully Present Immigrants\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue affecting \nsome of the most vulnerable families living in our society. Under \nhealth reform, tax credits are provided to families between 100 percent \nand 400 percent of the Federal poverty line in order to purchase health \ninsurance. Families below 133 percent of the poverty line become \neligible for Medicaid. Certain lawfully present immigrants however are \nnot eligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status. Fortunately, \nhealth reform does not leave them in the cold. Mr. Chairman, am I \ncorrect in saying that lawfully present immigrants, who are otherwise \nineligible for Medicaid, are eligible for premium tax credits in the \nexchange?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right. Due to the Senator's leadership and hard \nwork, we were able to make sure those here legally had a place to find \naffordable health coverage.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I believe it is important to clarify that the Senate \nbill's treatment of certain lawfully present immigrants as having an \nincome at 100 percent of the Federal poverty level was intended to \npertain only to their eligibility for the affordability credit--not the \nsize of the actual tax credit. Plainly put, a legal immigrant whose \nincome is at 50 percent of the poverty line should not have to pay the \nsame premium amount as someone whose income is at 100 percent of the \npoverty line. Was this the intent of this provision in the health \nreform legislation?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is exactly right. The health reform \nlegislation that was signed into law allows immigrants who are here \nlawfully, who are otherwise ineligible for Medicaid to receive tax \ncredits in the exchange. However, the size of those tax credits should \nbe based on the families' actual income, not an artificial level of 100 \npercent of the poverty line. I expect this provision will be \nimplemented as such. I look forward to working with Senator Menendez to \nensure that these families receive access to affordable health \ninsurance coverage.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a specific \nsection of the health insurance reform bill.\n  There has been some concern that language in the bills could be \nmisinterpreted to create new causes of action or claims that would \ninterfere with existing State medical malpractice laws.\n  As Representative Henry Waxman clarified on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, it has never been the intent of the bill to create any \nnew causes of action or to preempt any State medical malpractice law.\n  Section 10201(j) of H.R. 3590, which added Section 3512 to subtitle F \nof title III of the act, calls for the Comptroller General to conduct a \nstudy of whether the development, recognition or implementation of any \nguideline or other standards under a list of enumerated sections of the \nSenate bill would result in a new cause of action or claim.\n  It is important that this language requesting such a study not be \ninterpreted in any way as creating any inference or implication that \nthe enumerated sections of the bill will create any new action or \nclaim.\n  Additionally, it is important to understand that Congress has no \nintent in this legislation to modify or supersede any State medical \nliability law that governs legal standards or procedures used in \nmedical malpractice cases.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in addition to important improvements to \nthe health reform bill President Obama signed into law this week, the \nreconciliation measure before the Senate also provides a significant \ninvestment in higher education.\n  I have always strongly believed in the importance of a college \neducation. Unfortunately, in recent years, average college tuition \nrates have increased faster than inflation, and have far outpaced \nstudent financial aid. Skyrocketing tuition is making it increasingly \ndifficult for families to afford higher education. Many students are \nforced to take on significant debt, and too often are not able to \ncomplete college because of soaring costs.\n  Especially during these difficult economic times we need to be doing \nmore to address the rising costs of higher education and the growing \nneed for student financial aid. I am glad to see that the measure in \nfront of us today streamlines our student lending system and no longer \nsubsidizes banks to lend to students risk free. By requiring that all \nfuture student loans be made directly to students through the Federal \nGovernment, this bill will save $61 billion over 10 years. Not only \nwill this provision save the government money,\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\nbut the Direct Loan Program is projected to save students millions of \ndollars in fees and interest payments.\n  A portion of the savings from this bill will be used to fund the Pell \nGrant Program, which is facing a significant shortfall this year. The \nmeasure provides $13.5 billion in mandatory appropriations for Pell \ngrants, and will provide additional mandatory funding to the program by \ntying increases to inflation. Combined with the investment in Pell \ngrants in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act last year, which I \nwas proud to support, the maximum Pell grant award will double as a \nresult of this bill. Unfortunately, Pell grants cover less than half as \nmuch tuition at a public college or university as they did just a few \ndecades ago, so a significant investment in the program's growth is \nnecessary to help the more than 8 million students who participate. I \nmet with students who attended school in Vermont this week and they \nshared their stories about how important this program was to them, and \nhow it was critical to their ability to attend college. No student \nshould be denied the opportunities of a college education because of \nfinancial burdens.\n  I am also pleased the changes to student lending in the \nreconciliation bill will help nonprofits to provide important loan \nservicing and counseling services to students and their families. \nSeveral States have established not-for-profit State agencies to \nadminister financial aid and to provide their residents and students \nattending their schools with quality counseling services and low-cost \nloans. Vermont pioneered this movement by creating the Vermont Student \nAssistance Corporation, VSAC, more than 40 years ago. Since then, VSAC \nhas worked hard to establish and maintain strong and longstanding \nworking relationships with Vermont's higher education institutions as \nwell as K-12 schools to provide outreach programs critical to the \neconomic vitality of Vermont.\n  The reconciliation bill will prohibit anyone other than the Federal \nGovernment from originating new Federal loans, but unlike the lending \nmeasure the House passed in July, the reconciliation package will help \nnonprofits continue to provide important college access and completion \nactivities. This measure will double the funding directed to Vermont, \nwhich will help VSAC continue to counsel students and their families \nabout entering and completing college. Additionally, the reconciliation \nlegislation will allow non-profits to contract with the Federal \nGovernment to continue to service loans at a competitive market rate.\n  I have heard from countless Vermonters about the invaluable services \nVSAC provides to help students attend and complete college. Just \nrecently, a father of twins attending college in Vermont contacted my \noffice to share with me the support that VSAC provided. If not for \nVSAC, he said, he did not think he could have made it through the \npaperwork or learned about the scholarships that were available.\n  I am glad that Congress has recognized the importance of these \nservices in States across the country and will allow for a continued \nrole to help more students access and complete college. I look forward \nto continuing to work with VSAC to ensure their place as an important \npart of students' college experience.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, included within this budget reconciliation \nbill are provisions that make significant changes to the federal \nstudent loan programs. Like others, I strongly support the provisions \nthat increase funding for Pell grants. These grants form the foundation \nof Federal student aid, and do much to increase college access.\n  Other provisions in the bill and the Higher Education Act also are \nimportant to students. As students increasingly look to Federal student \nloans to cover the costs of their college education, they are in need \nof federally supported services that help students to make well-\ninformed financial decisions. In this bill, section 2103 extends and \nroughly doubles the authorization, to $150 million annually, for the \ncollege access challenge grants, CACG. The CACG authorizes States who \nreceive funding under the CACG to provide subgrants to guaranty \nagencies to assist students and families with such services as early \nawareness and outreach, financial literacy, debt management, and loan \ncounseling to impact the ability of students to successfully manage \ntheir student loan obligations and start off their postcollege and \nprofessional lives on the right foot. Congress should encourage the \nStates to continue to work with their designated guarantors to use the \nopportunity of continued authorization and increased funding of the \nCACG to utilize the expertise of guaranty agencies in providing such \nservices. I agree with the comments of the chairman of the House \nCommittee on Education and Labor during House consideration of this \nbill--Congress intends that states receiving grants under the college \naccess challenge grant program should partner with entities, including \nguaranty agencies and their nonprofit subsidiaries, to provide \nfinancial literacy, delinquency and default aversion activities, and \nother loan counseling activities for borrowers.\n  I also share the House chairman's view that the Secretary of \nEducation has existing tools to ensure students have access to borrower \nand school services for financial literacy and default prevention. \nUnder the Direct Loan Program, the Secretary is authorized to contract \nwith guaranty agencies for services that ensure the successful \noperation of the program. As we move to require all institutions of \nhigher education to participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program, \nstudents should continue to have access to the borrower and school \nservices provided so well over the past 40 years by guaranty agencies. \nIn my State of Indiana, our guaranty agency has a distinguished history \nof providing comprehensive services to help borrowers repay their loans \nand avoid default. Along with the House chairman, I, too, expect the \nDepartment of Education to ensure the availability of these services by \nexercising the Secretary's authority to contract with guaranty agencies \nfor the provision of these services for students and schools.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have confused some statements made by the President and made by \nme regarding whether the new health law will cause premiums to go down.\n  The President has spoken forcefully about the impact of the new \nreform law on health insurance premiums. He has contrasted the effect \nof reform with the effect of doing nothing. He made it clear that if we \npassed a reform bill, premiums would go down compared to the status quo \nof not enacting a reform law.\n  A couple of weeks ago, I said on the Senate floor that no one claims \npremiums will go down tomorrow when we pass this legislation. I was \nspeaking in absolute terms. Premiums have been rising at a high and \nunsustainable rate. With these reforms, premiums will rise more slowly.\n  The President and I were saying the same thing, using different \nwords. The point is the same. With this new law, American families and \nbusinesses can have hope that their premiums will not rise as fast as \nthey have been in the past.\n  The days of 39 percent premium increases, as we have seen in \nCalifornia, will be over once this law is fully implemented.\n  The days of 60 percent premium increases, as we have seen in my home \nState of Illinois, will be over once this law has been carried out.\n  And if we repeal this new law, as the Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle advocate, premiums will continue to rise at an unsustainable \nrate with spikes like those we have seen this year.\n  Senators on the other side of the aisle are right to ask what will \nhappen to premiums.\n  Every American wants to know, ``What is going to happen to the cost \nof my healthcare?'' And they are right to ask that question.\n  But the obstructionists and naysayers on the other side of the aisle \nare wrong when they oppose this bill and the new law based on the false \nclaim that it will cause premiums to rise faster than the status quo. \nThat is simply not true.\n  And you don't have to take my word for it. Just ask the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office--the congressional ``umpire'' when it comes \nto questions of what legislation will cost or save.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n  Early in the health reform debate, throughout most of last year, we \nhad useful data from the Congressional Budget Office--but it was not \ndefinitive. It was easily distorted by the opponents of reform and the \ndefenders of the insurance companies, who want to stop all action and \nallow premiums to be increased by 10, 20, 39, 60 percent each year.\n  The initial CBO reports compared premiums in today's market with the \ncost of a more generous health plan that is likely to be offered in the \ninsurance exchanges of a reformed market.\n  That is not a fair comparison, but it is all we had.\n  It showed that people would pay more if they chose better coverage. \nBut it didn't clearly say that for coverage comparable to what is \navailable today, premiums would be lower.\n  And so there was confusion.\n  In January, when no one was paying attention and the debate on the \nSenate floor had shifted to jobs, we received some important additional \ninformation from CBO.\n  The new data, from the people who know the numbers best at CBO, backs \nour conclusion that the Senate health reform bill will reduce the \npremiums people will pay for health insurance, compared to current law.\n  That clear answer came in response to a request from the senior \nRepublican Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  At the request of Senator Snowe, CBO estimated the premiums for a \nBronze plan under the Senate reform bill.\n  Bronze plans will cover roughly the same proportion of an individual \nor family's total health care costs as the average plan sold in the \nindividual market today.\n  So using Bronze plans to compare the Senate reform bill to current \nlaw provides an ``apples to apples'' comparison. It tells you what \npremiums you can expect if the bill passes, compared to what premiums \nyou can expect for a similar policy if the bill is defeated. That is a \nfair comparison.\n  Here's what CBO tells us:\n  A Bronze plan in 2016 will cost an individual between $4,500 and \n$5,000 a year.\n  Earlier, CBO estimated that under current law, with no health reform \nin place, an average plan in 2016 will cost an individual $5,500.\n  So, under reform, the cost of a typical plan will be considerably \nless than the cost if we do nothing. In fact the savings will be \nroughly $500-$1,000 a year.\n  We see the same story for family coverage. According to CBO, under \nthe Senate reform bill, a family can expect to pay between $12,000 and \n$12,500 for family coverage. If we do nothing, a family can expect to \npay $13,100.\n  That is a savings of $600-$1,100 a year for American families.\n  So now we have the answer that many Senators, and many Americans, \nsought.\n  CBO's analysis provides a fair assessment of the effect of reform on \nthe individual and family pocketbook.\n  And the answer is savings of $500 to $1,100 a year, from 2016 on.\n  But only if we preserve the reforms the President signed into law.\n  And that is just the direct effect on premiums. Millions of Americans \nwill be eligible for subsidies that will dramatically reduce their \ncosts beyond these basic reductions available to everyone.\n  But even people who don't receive subsidies will have lower premiums. \nLower than if we don't implement the reform law.\n  Not because of assistance from the Federal Government, but because \nhealth reform legislation will give people buying power and will take \nthe necessary steps to rein in health care costs.\n  The changes included in the new law will make a difference in the \nhealth care system and those changes will reap benefits for all of us.\n  This is confirmation that the reform bill represents an important \nvictory for Americans struggling with the high cost of health \ninsurance.\n  And now we can put a value on the savings: $500 to $1,000 a year for \nindividuals and $600 to $1,100 a year for families.\n  The Senators on the other side of the aisle haven't been talking \nabout this report, which was provided by the CBO to a member of their \nown party, because they don't want the American people to know that \npremiums will go down relative to doing nothing.\n  So instead, they try to find alleged discrepancies between the \nPresident and me that simply do not exist on this issue.\n  The evidence is clear. The Congressional Budget Office has weighed \nin. The facts are plain.\n  The health reform bill will reduce premiums compared to the do-\nnothing outcome pursued by the obstructionists.\n  Similarly, there has been some confusion about the magnitude of the \ntax cuts in this bill.\n  The tax cuts in the reform bill passed by the Congress and signed \ninto law by the President are the largest middle-class tax cut for \nhealth care in the history of our Nation.\n  No Congress has provided greater tax assistance to American families \nand individuals and small businesses to help them afford the cost of \nhealth care.\n  There have been larger tax cuts unrelated to health care--not all of \nthem wise.\n  But American businesses and families need help to deal with the high \ncost of health care, and this Congress has responded.\n  The new law, combined with the improvements in the reconciliation \nbill, will provide refundable tax credits to people with incomes up to \n400 percent of the poverty level--around $88,000 for a family of four--\nso that they can afford their health insurance premiums.\n  Ordinarily, a tax credit is provided when you file your tax return \nafter the end of the year. The new law allows the credit to be paid to \nthe insurer month by month, so that you can afford your monthly \npremiums. That is a good thing if you live month to month and can't \nwait until the end of the year to receive the tax credit and still pay \nyour monthly premiums.\n  The new law also provides tax credits to small businesses--available \nstarting right now--to help them pay for health insurance.\n  These provisions will give nearly $500 billion of tax cuts and cost-\nsharing assistance to middle-class Americans. That is what makes this \nthe largest middle-class tax cut for health care in the history of our \nnation.\n  We received no help from the Members on the other side of the aisle \nin enacting these tax cuts. This Democratic Congress did it anyway. We \nprovided the largest middle-class tax cuts for health care ever, and we \nare proud to have done so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are concluding an historic week here in \nthe Nation's Capital and in the U.S. Senate. Health reform is no longer \na bill. It is the law of the land.\n  Just as the history books remember 1935 as the year FDR signed Social \nSecurity into law, and 1965 as the year Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare \ninto law, they will now remember 2010 as the year President Barack \nObama signed comprehensive health reform into law.\n  Of course, not only is health reform the law of the land, but, thanks \nto the reconciliation bill, we have also passed a landmark reform of \nthe student lending program, permitting a major increase in Pell \ngrants.\n  Appropriately, Members have cited the historic contributions of key \nleaders here in the Senate, including Majority Leader Reid, Senator \nConrad, Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, and, of course, for his \ncommitment to this cause spanning decades, the late Senator Ted \nKennedy.\n  It is also important to etch into history, in our Congressional \nRecord, the names of Senate staff members who have done so much to get \nus to this point. I have often cited the old saying that ``Senators are \na constitutional impediment to the smooth functioning of staff.'' We \nlaugh at that, but we also know that there is a lot of truth. Were it \nnot for skilled, talented, dedicated staff members, willing to spend so \nmany evenings and weekends away from their families, we would not have \narrived at the historic triumph of passing comprehensive health reform.\n  I am especially grateful to the extraordinary efforts of staff \nmembers on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \nwhich I chair. I would like to thank Dan Smith, Pam Smith, Michael \nMyers, Mark Childress, David Bowen, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy, Connie \nGarner, Portia Wu, John McDonough, Topher Spiro, Stacey\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nSachs, Tom Kraus, Terri Roney, Craig Martinez, Taryn Morrissey, Brian \nMassa, Andrea Harris, Caroline Fichtenberg, Bethany Little, Luke \nSwarthout, David Johns, Maria Worthen, Thomas Showalter, Paulette \nAcevedo, Abby Bartine, Ches Garrison, Sarah Whitton, Robin Juliano, \nLory Yudin, and Evan Griffis.\n  On the staff of Majority Leader Reid, I want to thank Gary Myrick, \nKate Leone, Jason Unger, Carolyn Gluck, Jacqueline Lampert, Bruce King, \nDavid Krone, Rodell Molineaux, and Randy DeValk.\n  On Senator Dodd's staff, I thank Jim Fenton, Tamar Magarik Haro, \nMonica Feit, Brian DeAngelis, Madeline Gitomer, and Averi Pakulis.\n  On Senator Baucus's staff: Liz Fowler, Bill Dauster, Russ Sullivan, \nJohn Sullivan, Scott Mulhauser, Kelly Whitener, Cathy Koch, Yvette \nFontenot, David Schwartz, Neleen Eisinger, Chris Dawe, and Hun Quach.\n  On Senator Conrad's staff: Mary Naylor, John Righter, Joe Gaeta, \nRobyn Hiestand, Matt Mohning, Purva Rawal, Sarah Kuehl, Joel Friedman, \nJim Esquea, and Jennifer Hanson-Kilbride.\n  On my personal staff, I want to thank Beth Stein, Lee Perselay, Kate \nCyrul, Bergen Kenny, Dan Goldberg, Lindsay Jones, and Jim Whitmire.\n  Mr. President, I also want to salute the great skill and \nprofessionalism of the Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin, as well as \nAssistant Parliamentarians Elizabeth MacDonough, Peter Robinson and \nLeigh Hildebrand.\n  In addition, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the staff of the \nCongressional Budget Office. They are an extremely knowledgeable and \ncapable team, willing to work late nights and through the weekends to \nmodel and estimate the budgetary effects of the complex provisions in \nthis bill.\n  Finally, I want to thank staff members in the Senate Legislative \nCounsel's office. They also worked many long hours to assist my HELP \nCommittee in drafting the language and working out the technical issues \nin the bill.\n  To all of these dedicated members of our Senate family, I say thank \nyou for your service to this body, and thank you for your selfless \nservice to our Nation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to spend a couple of minutes to \nexpress my gratitude to a lot of people. I begin by thanking my \ncolleagues here, both Democrats and Republicans. Obviously, all of us \nwould have liked to have had a health care bill that was more than a \npartisan vote. It didn't turn out that way. I am glad we ended up with \nthe result we did.\n  I thank the members of the HELP Committee on which I serve, both \nDemocrats and Republicans. Although we didn't end up with a bipartisan \nvote on that committee, there was a very vibrant, active, civilized \ndiscussion over many days last summer regarding the HELP Committee's \nportion of this health care product. Obviously, having been the acting \nor temporary chair of the committee in the absence of our friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts who was obviously ill and could not be \nthere, I begin by thanking Tom Harkin. You have heard people talk about \nhim already. He has taken over the reins of that committee and has done \nan excellent job. I thank Barbara Mikulski, my long-time friend and \ncolleague, who did a tremendous job in dealing with various aspects of \nthe health care debate, as Tom Harkin did, Jeff Bingaman, Patty \nMurray--again, seasoned members of the committee and Members of this \nbody who have contributed to many pieces of legislation over the years. \nJack Reed, my neighbor and great friend from Rhode Island, was \ntremendously helpful on the committee, as well as Bernie Sanders of \nVermont, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who played a critical role working with \npeople like Senator Hagan of North Carolina, working with Sheldon \nWhitehouse, who was on our committee at the time and played a critical \nrole in fashioning our public option. Jeff Merkley and Bob Casey were \nvery productive and serious members of the committee effort. Al Franken \nand Michael Bennet have since joined the committee, and Sheldon \nWhitehouse has moved on. But I want the record to reflect my deep \nappreciation for their work.\n  Let me also thank Mike Enzi and the people such as Tom Coburn and \nothers, Judd Gregg, from the committee. I can't go down the whole list, \nbut the Republicans on the committee, while they don't necessarily like \nto admit it, made a contribution to the bill. One hundred sixty-one \namendments--I know they are tired of hearing me talk about over the \nlast several months--were their additions to the HELP Committee final \nproduct.\n  I have talked about Max Baucus, my friend. We have served together, \nalong with Tom Harkin in this Chamber and the other, for 35 years \ntogether. The work of the Finance Committee, which bore a tremendous \nshare of this responsibility, dealing with very complicated issues that \nare within the jurisdiction of that committee, was tremendously \nimportant. I won't go down and list all the members of the Finance \nCommittee. In fact, we had several on our committee who served both on \nFinance and on the HELP Committee: Jeff Bingaman on the Democratic \nside; I know there were several Republicans as well who filled a dual \nrole by serving on both committees.\n  I thank my friend from Montana as well for his work. He has been \nrecognized and acknowledged by many and deservedly so over the last \nnumber of days.\n  I commend, if I may, the staff members of the Finance Committee, \nbeginning with Liz Fowler and the group I ask unanimous consent to \ninclude for the Record. They did a wonderful job. Senator Baucus has \nreferred to them already, but I also wish to thank them this afternoon \nfor their work.\n  On the Budget Committee, again you have heard Senator Kent Conrad \ntalk about the Budget Committee staff. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir names be printed as well at this juncture in the Record, if I \nmay.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           finance committee\n\n       Liz Fowler, David Schwartz, Yvette Fontenot, Neleen \n     Eisinger, Shawn Bishop, Chris Dawe, Andrew Hu, Bill Dauster, \n     Russ Sullivan, Cathy Koch, Jon Selib.\n\n\n                            budget committee\n\n       Sarah Kuehl, Purva Rawal, Jim Esquea, Mary Naylor.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I want to make particular reference to the members of my \nstaff, beginning with Jeremy Sharp and Tamar Magarik Haro who did a \nwonderful job. Jeremy Sharp's father is former Congressman Phil Sharp. \nHe was part of the class with Max Baucus and Tom Harkin and me, Henry \nWaxman and George Miller, who played a critical role in the debate in \nthe House. Both Tamar and Jeremy were tireless in this effort, going \nback many months. I am deeply grateful to them. Jim Fenton is my \nlegislative director and played a very important role as well in those \nefforts.\n  Then, of course, there are the other members of the HELP Committee, \nmany of whom, of course, were staff members of Ted Kennedy. I inherited \ntheir expertise, their knowledge, their great abilities when Ted was \nlaid up. They continued to work with us, beginning with Carey Parker \nwho is, of course, legendary in this institution, having served with \nSenator Kennedy since the day he arrived 47 years ago. While not \ndirectly on the HELP Committee staff, I can't tell you what a critical \nrole Carey Parker played time and time again during the rough spots. \nMichael Myers, Pam Smith, Connie Garner, Stacey Sachs, David Bowen--all \nwere tremendously influential in the process. Mark Childress, who \nworked with Tom Daschle before, was at the White House for a while, \ncame back up and stayed with us on that effort. Mark was invaluable in \nunderstanding the rhythms of the Senate, understanding the White House, \nand we are deeply grateful. Jenelle Krishnamoorhty, who worked with Tom \nHarkin, I have gotten to know her very well, and the members of Tom's \nstaff. I want Jenelle to know how much I appreciate her work. She did a \ntremendous job for us as well.\n  I want to thank the leader's staff as well, who were so valuable to \nus: Kate Leone, obviously; Carolyn Gluck; Bob Greenawalt; Bruce King; \nRandy Devalk; Jacqueline Lampert; and Gary Myrick, who we see here all \nthe time pacing this Chamber at all hours of the day and night, keeping \nan eye on the movements of the Senate and what is occurring, keeping \nthe leader well informed, about as knowledgeable as\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\nanyone you will meet in understanding exactly what is happening at all \nmoments. To Gary and the leader's staff, I apologize if I left anybody \nout, but I thank them for their work as well.\n  This bill also included the work on education issues. There were a \nnumber of people who played a very important role in that. In my \noffice: Maddy Gitomer, Averi Pakulis, Joe Caldwell, and Anna Staton \nwere all part of our efforts in that regard. I should have mentioned \nearlier Tom Kraus, Topher Spiro, and Andrea Harris who worked on HELP \nCommittee efforts as we moved forward on the bill.\n  Those were a lot of names I have just recited. I said them so quickly \nthat they may fly by. It hardly reflects the recognition they deserve \nfor the time and effort they have put in. They will never be standing \nbefore a bank of microphones or getting their picture taken, probably \nwon't have articles written about them and what they did or didn't do \nduring their tenure in the Senate. But this place only functions and \nruns, the floor staff who are here and the respective cloakrooms who do \nthe work every single day that make this institution work as well as it \ndoes, spending the hours, the weekends crafting ideas and compromises \nthat allow us to move forward.\n  While there are a lot of people deservedly, in a very public way, \ngetting credit for the work that has transpired over these many months, \nI didn't want this moment to pass without at least expressing my \ngratitude to them and others whose names I, unfortunately, have not \nmentioned, who have made this day possible.\n  To them, to my colleagues, to Senator Reid, Speaker Pelosi, House \nMembers who valiantly took up a Senate-passed bill that they had strong \nreservations about and yet understood the value of the moment.\n  And to President Obama, who understood the importance of this issue \nand insisted it come up. I remember Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Max Baucus \nand I served with Dan Moynihan, and Max had served with him on the \nFinance Committee when he chaired that committee, a very wise man who \nunderstood the movements of the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch. He once told me that American Presidents, whether they get one \nor two terms, only get somewhere between 18 and 24 months to do \nanything really meaningful. It is those first days from January 20, \nInauguration Day, to maybe as late as Election Day of the midterm \nelections in their first term. If they are going to do anything really \nimportant, that is the window in which they have to try. After that, it \ngets harder. You campaign for reelection. If you are reelected, you are \na lame duck. Your ability to affect huge issues narrows.\n  I thank our President. Whether you agree or disagree with his \npolitics or his policies, the fact that he took on a major issue that \nhad been crying out for decades for resolution is testimony to his \nwillingness to put a political administration, a political campaign on \nthe line. For those who work with him, from his chief of staff to his \nadvisers on these various matters, history will be and should be deeply \ngrateful to President Barack Obama for having the courage to take up a \nbig issue that deserved and needed resolution by the Congress for the \nAmerican people. Whatever else transpires in the remaining tenure of \nhis office, whether he serves one term or two, in large measure he will \nbe defined by his willingness, his courage to raise this issue, when \nmany others suggested this was a worthless task to take on, we couldn't \nsucceed, he would be wiser to follow a course where less significant \nissues might be at stake.\n  So to the President, I thank you immensely for having the courage to \ntake this on. I believe in the long call of history the American people \nwill thank you as well for having the courage to bring up this \nimportant issue.\n  With that, again, this is one of those very few rare days we get in \nthis institution historically, but it is one in which I am deeply proud \nto have been involved. I thank all who made it come to pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I had the great privilege of observing \nSenator Dodd as he stepped into the breach for Senator Kennedy and did \nan extraordinary job--hour after hour after hour--listening to the \ncomments, the suggestions of both sides of the aisle. I think about 400 \namendments were filed, and 161, or so, were accepted. In that process, \nhis leadership was extraordinarily effective and critical. So the \npraise he rightfully accords to others he must share in a major way. We \nwould not be here today if Senator Dodd had not stepped in while \nsimultaneously also doing financial reform and getting us to this \nmoment.\n  So I say to the Senator, thank you.\n  I concur, obviously, with his comments about Senator Baucus and \nexpress the respect I have for Senator Baucus. As chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Max had an extraordinarily important role to play, \nand he played it with great wisdom and great judgment throughout.\n  Again, we are here today because of these two gentlemen, and my \ncolleagues in the House.\n  I, too, commend the President. It would have been easy at any time in \nthis process to fold up the book and say: Well, I have joined the ranks \nof all my predecessors since Franklin Roosevelt. I have tried and have \nnot succeeded. I think at moments he might have come tantalizingly \nclose to that conclusion. But he pressed on. Ultimately, it was his \ndecision more than anyone else to try to do this that got it done.\n  As Thucydides said: The bravest of the brave are those who, seeing \nboth the glory and the danger, go forth to seize it. These gentlemen--\nparticularly the President--saw the danger and the glory and refused to \nretreat and went forward. We have a historic victory today. But our \nwork is not done.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the Health Care and Education \nReconciliation Act. America has 47 million people without health \ninsurance, including more than 240,000 West Virginians, and the number \ngrows every week. More than half of West Virginia's uninsured are \nbetween the ages of 19 and 49. Health care consumes more than 15 \npercent of our national gross domestic product. Health care reform \nshould matter to every West Virginian.\n  When the health care debate began last year, I urged the Senate to \nforgo using the budget reconciliation process to shield a comprehensive \nreform bill from debate and amendment. I am pleased that the Senate \nheeded that call, and opted to consider the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act under the cloture rule and the regular procedures.\n  When amendments to that measure were proposed by the President, to be \nenacted through the budget reconciliation process, I insisted that \nthose amendments be considered in a manner consistent with the \nCongressional Budget Act and section 313 of that act, the Byrd rule. \nThe reconciliation bill must not address extraneous matter, and it \nmust--absolutely must--reduce the deficit. This measure meets that \ntest. I applaud the Senate for bringing the health care debate to a \nclose in a manner that is balanced, fair, and equitable. The rights of \nthe minority have been protected, and the Senate has upheld its \nhistorical role as a forum for debate and amendment.\n  While this bill as passed may not satisfy the individual concerns of \neach and every constituent or member of Congress, it does begin to \nsatisfy the growing needs of millions of Americans who find themselves \nwithout access to the medical services and attention they need. Access \nto proper health care for every American citizen should not only be \nheld as a necessity, it should be considered the commensurate right of \nany and every citizen of the mightiest and most advanced Nation the \nworld has ever known.\n  Mr. President, in order to clarify for the record, I want to make it \nknown that section 1556 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct is intended to apply to all claims filed after January 1, 2005, \nthat are pending on or after the date of enactment of that act.\n  It is clear that the section will apply to all claims that will be \nfiled henceforth, including many claims filed by miners whose prior \nclaims were denied, or by widows who never filed for benefits following \nthe death of a husband. But section 1556 will also benefit all of the \nclaimants who have recently filed a claim, and are awaiting or \nappealing a decision or order, or who are in the\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nmidst of trying to determine whether to seek a modification of a recent \norder.\n  Section 1556 applies immediately to all pending claims, including \nclaims that were finally awarded or denied prior to the date of \nenactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, for which \nthe claimant seeks to modify a denial, or for which other actions are \ntaken in order to modify an award or denial, in accordance with 20 CFR \n725.309(c) or 725.310. Section 1556 applies even if a final order is \nmodified, or actions are taken to bring about the modification of an \norder, subsequent to the date of enactment of the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act, in accordance with the sections of Part 725 \nthat I mentioned. I look forward to working to ensure that claimants \nget a fair shake as they try to gain access to these benefits that have \nbeen so hard won.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \neducation provisions in H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education \nAffordability Reconciliation Act of 2010.\n  Over 40 years ago, Congress passed the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nwith the conviction that no qualified student should be denied the \nopportunity to attend college simply because of the cost. Who knew that \ntoday, in the year 2010, this concern would still ring true? The \npassage of this legislation will provide greater access to higher \neducation for thousands of American students.\n  The Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act \nrepresents the single largest investment in college affordability in \nhistory. From increasing the maximum Pell grant for low-income students \nto eliminating excessive subsidies for banks, this bill makes \nsignificant improvements to Federal student loan programs. Also, as \nstudents and their families look to Federal loans to pay for their \npost-secondary education, this legislation will allow non-profit \nstudent loan servicers in states like mine to continue servicing \nstudent loans.\n  This legislation provides funding for the college access challenge \ngrant program, a program created in the College Cost Reduction and \nAccess Act of 2007. This program was designed to assist states working \nin partnership with organizations with expertise in improving access to \ncollege. These guarantee agencies ensure that students have access to \nhigh-quality, affordable higher education. In my home State, the \nCollege Foundation of North Carolina serves as our State guarantee \nagency and plays a critical role in providing students and families \nwith financial literacy, debt management, and loan counseling \ninformation.\n  I fully support the intent of the access and completion challenge \ngrants included in this legislation. They will allow State guarantee \nagencies to continue the important work that they do. The College \nFoundation of North Carolina has done extraordinary work in this regard \nand, as a result, has had a default rate consistently below the \nnational average for the past several years. As a strong advocate for \nfinancial literacy education, I can think of nothing more important \nthan ensuring that students and families are armed with the tools they \nneed to understand the dynamics of their student loans.\n  In North Carolina, we have 58 community colleges and 10 historically \nBlack colleges and universities. The students at these institutions of \nhigher education stand to benefit greatly from the passage of this \nlegislation. A $2.55 billion investment over the next 10 years for \nMinority Serving Institutions, and more specifically Historically Black \nColleges and Universities, is unprecedented. While HBCUs only make up 3 \npercent of all colleges and universities across the country, they \ngraduate 40 percent of African-Americans with degrees in science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics, 50 percent of African-American \nteachers, and 40 percent of African-American health professionals. \nCommunity colleges play an instrumental role in our education and \nworkforce systems by providing postsecondary education and job \ntraining. We need to keep our community colleges open and thriving. I \ncan't think of a better investment as we encourage people to get the \ntraining and skills necessary to get back to work.\n  Making the commitment to create greater access to higher education, \nand ensuring that our students have the tools that they need to \ncomplete their postsecondary education is at the core of the education \nprovisions in the Health Care and Education Affordability \nReconciliation Act, and I am proud to support this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate has considered dozens of \namendments and motions to the reconciliation bill this week. The vast \nmajority of these proposals were flawed, either because they would have \nundermined the important consumer, business and taxpayer protections in \nthe health care reform bill signed into law Tuesday, or because they \nwere not offset and thus would have reduced the savings in the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Some of these proposals, however, did have merit. In particular, \namendment No. 3564 by Senator Grassley would have clarified that all \ncongressional employees, as well as certain other Federal employees, \nmust receive their health insurance through the new health insurance \nexchanges. The health care reform bill already requires ``Members of \nCongress and congressional staff'' to receive care through the \nexchanges, but I support efforts to remove any ambiguity about who is \ncovered. Another amendment by Senator Grassley, No. 3569, would have \nslightly increased reimbursements for rural physicians in Wisconsin, \nbuilding on important provisions in the new law. And I strongly support \nefforts to remove the unjustified ``sweeteners'' that remain in the \nhealth care reform law; unfortunately, the amendment offered by Senator \nMcCain, No. 3570, to remove those provisions also would have eliminated \nprovisions that were entirely legitimate.\n  Two other amendments addressed legitimate concerns that Congress is \nalready working to address. I am a cosponsor of legislation to clarify \nthat coverage provided by TRICARE will be treated as minimum essential \ncoverage under the health care reform bill. The amendment offered by \nSenator Burr, No. 3652, addressed this topic. Similarly, the chairman \nof the Veterans Committee is already seeking a legislative fix to \nprotect the Second Amendment rights of veterans, as Senator Coburn \nproposed to do, No. 3700.\n  However, all of these amendments and motions--even the more appealing \nsounding ones--had the same purpose: to delay and obstruct \nreconciliation legislation that will fill the Medicare Part D doughnut \nhole, make coverage more affordable and in other ways improve the new \nhealth care reform law. I opposed these efforts to undermine health \ncare reform, and I will continue fighting to ensure Wisconsinites get \nthe affordable and dependable coverage they deserve.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I now ask unanimous consent that Senators Grassley and \nConrad be permitted to engage in a colloquy and inquiries of the Chair \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator state his inquiry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have submitted a list of provisions \nfor review by the Chair. It is my understanding that these provisions \nof the bill have been reviewed and further, if points of order were \nraised against these provisions, the Chair would have ruled that the \nvarious points of order would not have been taken. Is this the opinion \nof the Chair?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. That the points of order would not have been well \ntaken, yes. That is the decision of the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the list of provisions just referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Section 1002--Insurance Mandate\n     Subject to (b)(1)(D)\n     Merely incidental to non-budgetary components of the \n         provision\n\n     Section 1203--DSH Methodology\n     Page 70 Line 4 through Page 71 Line 12\n     Subject to (b)(1)(A)\n     No budgetary effect\n\n     Section 2301--grandfathering\n     Subject to (b)(1)(D)\n     Merely incidental to non-budgetary components of the \n         provision\n\n     Section 1401--High cost plans tax\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\n     Subject to 310(g)\n\n     Section 1401--indexing\n     Pg 84 lines 3 through 17\n     Subject to (b)(1)(A)\n     No budgetary impact\n\n\n   List of Points of Order Submitted to the Chair by Senator Grassley\n\n       1. A point of order under Section 313(b)(1)(D) of the \n     Budget Act against Section 1002 of the bill.\n       2. A point of order under Section 313(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Budget Act against Section 1203, page 70 line 4 through page \n     71 line 12 of the bill.\n       3. A point of order under Section 313(b)(1)(D) of the \n     Budget Act against Section 2301 of the bill.\n       4. A point of order against the bill under Section 310(g) \n     of the Budget Act.\n       5. A point of order under Section 313(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Budget Act against Section 1401, page 84 line 1 through 15 of \n     the bill.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my staff, working with the staff of the \nFinance and HELP Committees, has spent an enormous amount of time \nensuring that this bill complies with the rules of the reconciliation \nprocess. The majority and minority staffers have spent long hours going \nover this bill in excruciating detail with the Parliamentarian. We just \nheard the Parliamentarian's determinations on some of those issues.\n  The Parliamentarian has further advised us that two provisions do \nviolate the Byrd rule. The first provision concerns the formula setting \nthe maximum Pell grant amount annually and is considered out of order. \nBasically, it provides an insurance policy on how that level is \ncalculated.\n  The second provision says this, in its entirety: ``(D) by striking \nsubparagraph (E); and(E) by redesignating subparagraph (F) as \nsubparagraph (E),'' and is also considered out of order.\n  CBO has concluded that the two provisions do not score for budgetary \npurposes. The Parliamentarian gave great weight to this in making his \ndetermination.\n  While I wish these provisions were not being stricken, removing them \nwould not affect the score of the program or prevent the bill from \nachieving the goals of the new Pell grant policy.\n  Mr. President, we think it is important for the historical record to \nhave these matters laid out on the record. I thank Senator Grassley and \nhis staff for the work to make certain that the historical record is \nclear, and I want to thank my staff as well, and the staff of the \nFinance Committee for an extraordinary effort. I hope the people of \nthis country recognize that these staffs have worked on both sides, \nminority and majority, weekend after weekend after weekend, night after \nnight after night, and they deserve our commendation and our thanks.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are a flood of emotions going \nthrough all of us today as we pass this reconciliation bill which \nimproves upon the bill the President signed 2 days ago. I would like to \nfocus only on one part--a very important part but only one part--and \nthat is to thank the people who have worked so hard, especially in this \nbody, to help accomplish this result.\n  I thank especially my friends Senator Dodd, the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, who many times acted in the capacity as chairman of \nthe HELP Committee, and Senator Harkin, chairman of the HELP Committee, \nworking so hard with their staffs. As well, I thank Senator Conrad, \nespecially for his acumen, his budgetary acumen. I don't know anybody \nwho knows this stuff better than Senator Conrad. We all rely on him \nvery much.\n  I thank Leader Reid for his strategic vision--he helped put the \nFinance Committee bill together; he saw a path forward--and his staff, \nwho are so competent--Kate Leone, Bob Greenawalt, Randy DeValk--his top \nthree staff.\n  I also thank my friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, for his \ncourtesy in managing this bill. He was very decent and a very good \nperson to work with.\n  We all want to thank so many people. Once we start mentioning a \ncouple or three names, we run the danger of offending people whose \nnames are not mentioned. We all know that. There will be an appropriate \ntime for us to make all the thanks, and I will make mine so sincerely \nbecause I am so grateful for all the hard work my staff has put into \nthis.\n  I wish to single out one person, and that one person is sitting next \nto me. Her name is Liz Fowler. Liz Fowler is my chief health counsel. \nLiz Fowler has put my health care team together. Liz Fowler worked for \nme many years ago, left for the private sector, and then came back when \nshe realized she could be there at the creation of health care reform \nbecause she wanted that to be, in a certain sense, her profession \nlifetime goal. She put together the White Paper last November--2008--\nthe 87-page document which became the basis, the foundation, the \nblueprint from which almost all health care measures in all bills on \nboth sides of the aisle came. She is an amazing person. She is a \nlawyer; she is a Ph.D. She is just so decent. She is always smiling, \nshe is always working, always available to help any Senator, any staff. \nI thank Liz from the bottom of my heart. In many ways, she typifies, \nshe represents all of the people who have worked so hard to make this \nbill such a great accomplishment.\n  I will have printed in the Record the names of all my professional \nstaff. There are more than I realized, so I can't name them all. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that list printed in the Record and just \nregret that I cannot thank everybody personally.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Committee on Finance Majority Professional Staff\n\n       Ryan Abraham, Joseph Adams, Sarah Allen, John Angell, Randy \n     Aussenberg, Mary Baker, Scott Berkowitz, Shawn Bishop, Mark \n     Blair, Pat Bousliman, Joe Carnucci, Tony Clapsis, Alan Cohen, \n     Blaise Cote, Amber Cottle, Tim Danowski, Bill Dauster, Chris \n     Dawe, Jennifer Donohue, Neleen Eisinger.\n       Danielle Edwards, Andrew Fishburn, Yvette Fontenot, Liz \n     Fowler, Jim Frisk, Christopher Goble, Michael Grant, Jewel \n     Harper, Diedra Henry-Spires, Laura Hoffmeister, Andrew Hu, \n     Matt Kazan, Ayesha Khanna, Tom Klouda, Cathy Koch, \n     Christopher Law, Josh Levasseur, Richard Litsey, Carla \n     Martin, Kerra Melvin.\n       Bob Merulla, Rory Murphy, Scott Mulhauser, Kelcy Poulson, \n     Holly Porter, Hun Quach, Russell Quiniola, Tom Reeder, Matt \n     Schmechel, Athena Schritz, David Schwartz, Erin Shields, \n     Michael Smart, Meaghan Smith, Tiffany Smith, Challee Stefani, \n     Greg Sullivan, Russ Sullivan, Chelsea Thomas, Kelly Whitener, \n     Erin Windauer.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I join the chairman of the Finance Committee in thanking \nso many people who participated in the process. I especially thank the \nstaff on the dais and staff in the cloakroom who were here so late last \nnight and do such an exceptionally professional job; otherwise, we \ncould not move this type of legislation in a coherent way.\n  Obviously, I thank the chairman and I thank his staff and I thank the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and his staff because really there has \nto be cooperation across the aisle to handle something this complicated \nand do it in a reasonably efficient way, by Senate standards, which we \ndid.\n  I especially, of course, thank the people on our side who played such \na large role, our leadership but especially my staff on the Budget \nCommittee--Cheri Reidy, who runs the committee, who does such an \nexceptional job; Jim Hearn, her partner; and Allison Parent. I will \nsubmit for the Record, as the Senator from Montana has, other members \nof our committee staff who have done such an exceptional job. But it \nseems you have to be named ``Liz'' around here to really understand \nhealth care because I have Liz Wroe on my staff, who really did such an \nextraordinary job for us here.\n  Again, I thank everyone who was so cooperative. There were an awful \nlot of amendments, and we could not have been successful without \ncooperation on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I just say I really owe it to several people on my \nstaff, especially my staff director, Mary Naylor. I don't know that \nthere has been a person more dedicated to public service than Mary \nNaylor. What an extraordinary effort she has made, along with Bill \nDauster of the Finance Committee and also my deputies, John Righter, \nJoel Friedman; my counsel, Joe Gaeta; and Sarah Kuehl, who led my \nhealth care team. We owe deep thanks to this staff. This has been a \nyear-and-a-half long effort by so many;\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nlost weekends with their families, lost evenings.\n  Thank you. Thank you.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a few more items of business that \nmust be taken care of, but I didn't want the time to go by without \nsaying something to the American people.\n  We all know the importance of this legislation. It is a Thursday \nafternoon, about 2 o'clock. We are all tired. But this has been a \nlegislative fight that will be in the record books. I am grateful for \neveryone who has worked on this to make this happen.\n  First of all, I have had a number of people on my staff who have \nworked very hard--Randy DeValk, who is kind of the resource of all the \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats. He is a utility man. He can do \nanything. He is a very accomplished, fine human being and a great \nperson to have working for you.\n  Kate Leone has been such a stalwart in helping me work through these \nissues. We started this a number of months ago. We got together every \nweek because I didn't know a lot about health care. She and I would sit \nand talk for an hour every week so I became more accomplished in \nknowing at least the framework of this legislation we looked forward to \ndealing with. I have so much appreciation for her. Like Randy, they \nleft their families at home. She left her baby at home. A lot of the \ntimes, it was very difficult for a young mother to do that. I have such \nrespect and admiration for her skill and her being such a nice person.\n  Bob Greenawalt, my tax guy, has done a remarkably good job--very \nquiet but someone whom everyone knows in the Senate. He is someone you \ncan go to and get a straight answer.\n  Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has had a \ntremendous burden. It has gone on for well more than a year. He has \nbeen criticized, he has been praised, but he has always been there \ntrying to move this ball forward, always having the idea that we could \nget this done when a lot of people around him said, ``It can't be \ndone.'' I personally appreciate Max Baucus and the good work he has \ndone for these many years for the State of Montana, but in recent \nmonths America has come to know the great work he has done on this bill \nwhich is now law.\n  Tom Harkin--what a wonderful human being. When I had a very difficult \nelection in 1998, no one called more often to find out how I was doing, \nboth before the election and after the election. He is my friend. I \ncare a great deal about him. He has some big shoes to fill, those of \nTed Kennedy. He has been so easy to work with.\n  Chris Dodd--even though he was no longer running the committee \nbecause Senator Kennedy died, Tom Harkin never got involved in it. He \nleft everything involved with health care that the committee had up to \nChris Dodd. It worked out well. We were able to do reconciliation, and \nhe moved into something for which he has such great passion, and that \nis education. So thank you very much.\n  Kent Conrad and I came to the Senate together. When the history books \nare written, there will certainly be a chapter or two or three talking \nabout a person who over the years has come to know more about the \nfinances of this country than any other human being--anyone. He and I \nare friends. He is the reason we are here now with so little \ncontroversy on these points of order. He has been someone whom you can \nreally, because he is such a perfectionist--frankly, he can really get \non your nerves. He is someone who always wants to make sure that the \n``i'' is dotted and the ``t'' is crossed. I am so grateful we are able \nto be where we are as a result of the good work of this honorable man \nfrom the State of North Dakota.\n  Finally, I have seen this man shed tears on so many occasions in the \nlast few months. Why? Because his pal is no longer in the Senate, his \nbuddy, his soulmate. There could not be two better friends than Ted \nKennedy and Chris Dodd. I don't know how you can be better friends than \nthey were to each other. He has done such a good job filling in for Ted \nKennedy. I know we want to get to this vote, but I love Chris Dodd. He \nis such a wonderful person, and his family is remarkably good. He got \nhome at quarter to 4 this morning, and Grace woke him up at 5 to tell \nher story.\n  Chris, thank you very much for what you did.\n\n\n                           Moment of Silence\n\n  I think it would be very appropriate, and I hope I do not offend \nanyone--if I do, I certainly do not mean to--I think it would be very \nappropriate right now to have a moment of silence for our departed \nfriend, one of the great Senators in the history of this country, Ted \nKennedy.\n  I ask the Chair to direct that moment of silence.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, the Chair will direct a moment \nof silence.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that when the vote is called, Senators \nvote from their desks.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me acknowledge the majority leader also \nbecause he has been under tremendous stress. We all know that, with \nwhat has happened relative to Landra and his daughter. We appreciate \nthe fact that he has been so professional and worked so hard while \nconfronted with this extraordinarily difficult situation. We obviously \nwish everyone in his family well.\n  Mr. President, at this time I will make two points of order. I submit \nfor the Record a statement of those points of order.\n  The following provision of the pending bill, H.R. 4872, the Health \nCare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, on page 118 at \nline 15 through 25 does not produce changes in outlay or revenues and \nthus is extraneous. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section \n313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The point of order is sustained.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the following provision of the pending \nbill, H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education Affordability \nReconciliation Act, on page 120, lines 3 through 5, does not produce \nchanges in outlays or revenues and is extraneous. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order under section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The point of order is sustained. Both provisions \nare stricken.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in keeping with my previous statement, we \non our side would not further contest either of those provisions.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is it appropriate to ask for the yeas and \nnays?\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is on passage \nof H.R. 4872, as amended by operation of section 313(e) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Isakson).\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 43, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--43\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Isakson\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 4872), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today's final passage of this Health Care \nand Education Reconciliation Act marks the culmination of a decades-\nlong struggle to make health insurance affordable to hard working \nAmericans. This has been an arduous process, but it has proven that \nchange truly is possible. America again has risen to meet one of its \nforemost challenges.\n  Still, there is more work to be done to introduce competition into \nthe health insurance industry. Today, health insurers do not play by \nthe same rules of competition as do other industries. Benefiting from a \n60-year-old special interest exemption, the business of insurance is \nnot subject to the Nation's antitrust laws. These laws promote \ncompetition, which ensures that consumers will pay lower prices and \nreceive more choices. We can surely agree that health insurers should \nnot be allowed to collude to set prices and allocate markets.\n  Last fall, I introduced legislation to repeal the health insurers' \nantitrust exemption. I held a hearing to examine the merits of this \nrepeal, and worked to build bipartisan support. A few weeks ago, repeal \nof the antitrust exemption for health insurers became the first stand-\nalone part of the health reform package to pass the House, in a strong \nbipartisan vote of 406-19. Today I want to renew my call for the Senate \nto take up and pass this legislation to repeal the antitrust exemption \nfor health insurance companies.\n  As they begin to implement the measures included in the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, other Federal agencies, and the States can all greatly \nbenefit from the competitive analysis provided by both the Department \nof Justice's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. \nThe Justice Department and the FTC have the knowledge and experience to \nprovide informed assessments of whether a marketplace is functioning \nproperly, and when there may be warning signs that competitive abuses \nare taking place. Their expertise will ensure that the basic rules of \nfair competition apply to those reforms included in the new health \ninsurance reform law.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to add to my comments from earlier \ntoday regarding the passage of H.R. 4872, the Health Care and Education \nReconciliation Act of 2010. I want to again acknowledge and thank my \nstaff for their extraordinary effort and professionalism. My staff has \nworked tirelessly over many months, working late nights and weekends on \nhealth care reform and reconciliation. I greatly appreciate the \nsacrifices that they--and their families--have made in these efforts.\n  On my Budget Committee staff, I want to again thank my extraordinary \nstaff director, Mary Naylor, as well as my deputy staff directors, John \nRighter and Joel Friedman, and my counsel, Joe Gaeta. In addition, I \nwant to thank my incredible Budget health team, which is led by Sarah \nKuehl, but also includes Purva Rawal, Jim Esquea, Jennifer Hanson-\nKilbride, and Steve Bailey. They did extraordinary work. I also want to \nthank my Budget education team, Robyn Hiestand and Matt Mohning. \nEducation was an important part of the reconciliation bill and college \nstudents will benefit greatly from the expansion of Pell grants and \nother assistance. I want to thank the remainder of my excellent Budget \nCommittee staff, all of whom contributed greatly to this effort. I \nparticularly want to thank Craig Kalkut, Ron Storhaug, and Jean Biniek \nfor their assistance in this effort.\n  Finally, I want to thank the staff in my personal office. They also \nplayed a key role in this effort and represented the State of North \nDakota very well. I want to thank Sara Garland, my chief of staff; Tom \nMahr, my legislative director; Kate Spaziani and Dana Halvorson, my \npersonal office health team; and Caitlin Coghlan, my education \nspecialist. In particular, I want to thank Tom and Kate for their \nextraordinary efforts. They worked hand-in-hand with my Budget team in \nhelping produce a bill that moves this nation in the right direction on \nhealth care and fiscal responsibility.\n  I believe it is important that the American people understand the \nwork and sacrifice made by the staff who work here in Congress on their \nbehalf. The last year has witnessed an incredible effort by staff on \nboth sides of the aisle. I thank them all, and again, thank my staff in \nparticular.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is clear to everyone watching the \ndebate on the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act that \namendments were offered for the sole purpose of derailing health care \nreform. Therefore I voted to table all amendments.\n  Under normal circumstances, I would have supported some of the \namendments offered by my colleagues. For example, last night, an \namendment was offered to clarify that the health care reform bill would \nnot adversely affect VA and military health care programs. I am a \ncosponsor of freestanding legislation that would make that very same \nclarification. However, last night, when Senator Webb asked unanimous \nconsent for that legislation to be adopted separate from this bill, an \nobjection was raised from my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I am pleased that the bill passed because it will make life better \nfor the people I represent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill on the floor today \nrealizes a dream of my friend and mentor, former Senator Paul Simon--\nconsolidation of the Federal student loan program entirely into direct \nloans.\n  The very first Federal student loans were direct loans provided under \nthe National Defense Education Act of 1958--directly from the Federal \nGovernment to students.\n  In 1965, the Federal Government began guaranteeing student loans \nprovided by banks and nonprofit lenders through the Federal Family \nEducation Loan, FFEL, Program. Through this program, the Federal \nGovernment would pay banks a certain rate of return on student loans \nand guarantee those loans against default.\n  By the early 1990s, it was clear to Paul Simon that incentivizing \nbanks through subsidies no longer made sense. The Federal Government \ncould make loans more cheaply and more simply directly to students.\n  As he said: ``Are we in the business of helping banks and guarantee \nagencies, or are we in the business of helping students?''\n  Paul Simon became the leading Senate champion of a new direct college \nloan program, enacted in 1992 as a small pilot program. He and others \nhoped that the Direct Loan Program would be quickly expanded to replace \nthe FFEL Program.\n  In 1993, during a budget reconciliation fight, lobbyists for the \nbanks and Sallie Mae joined forces to try to defeat the effort to move \nthe student loan system into direct loans. The result was our current \nsystem: the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL Program operating side-by-\nside.\n  This system hasn't worked. Private lenders like Sallie Mae have \nretained the majority of the student loan market through special deals \nwith financial aid offices and have continued to make billions off of \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies--$6 billion per year. Taxpayers are absorbing \nall the risk of student loan defaults, while private corporations bank \nall the profit.\n  Senator Kennedy, a longtime proponent of direct loans, once said: \n``We\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nwaste billions of dollars in corporate welfare every year on student \nloans, and we cannot afford it any longer.''\n  I agree with Paul Simon and Ted Kennedy. And so does Chairman Harkin, \nwho led this bill through the HELP Committee. I join him in supporting \nthis bill that would finally end corporate welfare in the Federal \nstudent loan program and put that money back in the hands of students.\n  The reconciliation bill will shift all loans into the Direct Loan \nProgram that Paul Simon envisioned and use the $68 billion in savings \nto invest in education priorities.\n  We will put $36 billion over the next 10 years into the Pell Grant \nProgram, a program that we know is essential for many poor families and \nstruggling students.\n  For the first time, we will index the Pell grant to inflation. We \nwill also avert a projected Pell grant budget shortfall caused by \nrecent increased demand for Pell grants.\n  Without this investment, 8 million students could see their Pell \ngrants cut by 60 percent next year, and 600,000 students could lose \ntheir scholarships completely.\n  The bill will cap monthly student loan payments at just 10 percent of \ndiscretionary income, so that college graduates can pursue careers in \nteaching or public service without the burden of student loan bills \nthey couldn't keep up with.\n  We will also invest in historically Black colleges and universities, \nminority serving institutions, community colleges, and state-based \ncollege access programs that help students succeed in college.\n  And we will reduce the deficit by $10 billion over 10 years.\n  Families and students will benefit enormously from this bill and the \nrealization of Paul Simon's vision. And who will suffer? Bank and \nlending executives who have grown rich off of unnecessary taxpayer \nsubsidies for decades.\n  Paul Simon was right 20 years ago, and he is still right today. It is \ntime to take the middleman out of the student loan industry and return \nour focus to students.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his hard work on the student \nloan reform provisions in this bill and for his tireless efforts on \nbehalf of college students across the country.\n  I strongly support the student loan reform provisions that are \nincluded in the reconciliation bill and I look forward to seeing Paul \nSimon's full Direct Loan Program finally signed into law.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have always wondered if this day \nwould come, when I could stand on the Senate floor before my colleagues \nand say those words:\n  We did it. We passed comprehensive health care reform.\n  Many have come before us and we have worked together for years. We \ntook on a monumental task and faced obstacles at every corner.\n  It wasn't easy--nothing that is worth doing is easy. But we put aside \nour own differences and came together to pass meaningful legislation \nthat will transform the way health care works in our country.\n  And it was worth every minute and every hurdle. It was worth every \nsetback and every step forward.\n  Because for all those challenges, for all our debates and \nnegotiations, I know that any trouble we faced was nothing in \ncomparison to the daily struggle millions of Americans face everyday \nwithout health insurance. Millions that are without coverage who live \neveryday in terror of becoming sick--parents powerless to provide care \nfor a sick child, workers unable to change jobs and pursue a new \nopportunity, families forced to choose between seeing a doctor and \npaying their mortgage.\n  When I think about the cause of reform, I think about those people \nand their stories.\n  And I want to tell you about some of them today.\n  I want to tell you about the Bord family of West Virginia.\n  The Bords are two dedicated school teachers--with health insurance, \nthrough their employer--whose son Samuel had Leukemia and needed \ntreatment well beyond the onerous annual insurance limits, they didn't \neven know they had. Samuel's parents were desperate and feared for the \nworst. When he hit his million dollar cap, my office helped his parents \nfind more resources.\n  But, the Bords were left with two heart-wrenching suggestions--\nconsider getting a divorce so that Samuel would qualify for Medicaid \nand stop taking their other children--Samuel's twin brothers--to the \ndoctor altogether, even if they got sick, in order to save every penny \nfor Samuel.\n  That's right. Get a divorce and choose one child's health care needs \nover another's.\n  Those are the choices our Nation offered to these caring, hard-\nworking parents with a sick child?\n  They did everything in their power but, this fall, Samuel passed \naway.\n  It breaks my heart to think of what his parents went through: not \nonly the pain of watching their son fight a terrible disease, but also \nthe uncertainty of paying for his treatment when the coverage they \ncounted--on and paid for--abandoned them.\n  And so now, we are creating a more secure and reliable health care \nsystem that works for every American: where those who are uninsured \nfinally have someplace to go for care; where those with health \ninsurance know that the coverage they count on--and pay for--will be \nthere when they need it; and where a profit driven insurance industry \ncannot play mercilessly with people's lives or steal their hope for a \nhealthy future.\n  This new law is for all those countless people we have lost to a \nbroken system. This is Samuel's law. We will never be able to bring him \nback--but we can make sure no one's health is ever left to the whims of \nannual and lifetime caps or pre-existing conditions or arbitrary rate \nhikes.\n  In the course of my Senate Commerce Committee investigations into the \nhealth insurance industry, I met a wonderful woman named Susan Pearl.\n  You see, we knew in the committee that health insurance companies \nwere not being straightforward about how much money they were spending \non actual medical care. Too many people were not getting the care they \nneeded, yet health insurance industry profits continued to soar.\n  So Susan came to us. Her husband owns his own business, and they had \ncoverage--good coverage. And they were glad to have it--their son Ian \nwas born with muscular dystrophy, but was doing well with medical \ntreatment.\n  Unfortunately, Susan's insurance then decided that her son's care--\nincluding the round-the-clock nursing necessary for advanced muscular \ndystrophy--was getting just too expensive for them to continue paying.\n  So with the full knowledge of the devastating and fatal effects of \ndropping coverage--Guardian Insurance abruptly rescinded, not just Ian \nPearl's coverage, but the entire family policy, replacing it with \nanother plan that was, quite simply, inadequate.\n  With Ian's life-saving care costing upwards of $1 million a year, \nSusan did everything she could to reinstate Ian on his original plan--\nthe one she had paid into faithfully for years.\n  Thankfully, Susan Pearl was able to recover Ian's old coverage--but \nonly after Guardian's deplorable practices drew worldwide media \nattention.\n  This new law means health insurance companies can no longer gamble \nwith people's lives and rescind coverage because it's hurting their \nbottom line.\n  You shouldn't need the full focus of a Senate investigation, just to \nbe treated fairly by your insurance company.\n  I think of small business owners like Kate from my home State of West \nVirginia who shared her story on the White House Office on Health \nReform's public website www.healthreform.gov. Her 2-year-old son is the \nonly person with health insurance coverage in her household.\n  Many of us know that it is often hard for small businesses to find \naffordable coverage for themselves and their employees.\n  She and her husband are small business owners and they simply could \nnot find an affordable policy. Today, small businesses pay up to 18 \npercent more than large firms for the same health insurance policy, so \nmany just don't even offer it. While small businesses make up 82 \npercent of businesses in West Virginia, only 37 percent of them offered \nhealth insurance coverage to their employees in 2008.\n  Kate wished she even had the security of catastrophic coverage. She\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nknows she is risking her home and economic security without health \ncoverage, but, basic health insurance is a luxury she and her husband \nsimply can't afford.\n  When it comes to health care, small business owners have been facing \nhigher administrative costs, lower bargaining power, greater price \nvolatility and fewer pooling options. These are not minor details. They \nare major problems and health care reform includes concrete solutions \nto begin solving them.\n  Now, with this new law, West Virginia businesses will have access to \nfar more affordable coverage options. In 6 months, as many as 20,000 \nsmall businesses in West Virginia like Kate's will have access to tax \ncredits for up to 35 percent of the cost of health coverage for their \nemployees.\n  And new State-based health insurance exchanges will be designed to \nhelp small businesses cover their employees in the small group market. \nBy expanding the pool and spreading risk across every individual in the \nState exchanges, we can significantly decrease premiums for small \nbusinesses and lower administrative costs for small business coverage \nby as much as 30 percent.\n  Many people have heard about Sarah Wildman, a woman who purchased \ninsurance on the individual market right here in Washington, DC.\n  Sarah was an informed consumer and specifically chose a policy she \nbelieved included good maternity coverage--one of the few policies on \nthe individual market that cover maternity care at all.\n  Of course, her so-called ``Maternity'' coverage didn't cover labor, \ndelivery, or even her stay in the hospital. And as a result, Sarah was \nleft with a $22,000 bill.\n  And, because she gave birth by cesarean section--she now has a \n``preexisting'' condition and can no longer get coverage elsewhere.\n  Sarah's situation would seem absurd, if it were not so deadly \nserious. And it begs the question: What is the value of health \ninsurance that offers no coverage when it's needed?\n  But soon she won't have to worry. This new law will mean the \nelimination of preexisting condition exclusions--right away for our \nchildren and as soon as the exchanges are up and running for adults.\n  Both the House and the Senate have spent more than a year working on \na meaningful plan to move our health system forward.\n  For many of us this journey started in earnest three years ago in our \neffort to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nProtecting that program--which will cover more than 14 million children \nby 2013--represents yet another of this new law's enormous \nachievements.\n  But today's achievement is built on more than 50 years of effort and \nincremental change--some quite meaningful, but none truly \ncomprehensive.\n  At last, our work has brought fundamental changes to a broken health \ncare system, and takes an enormous step to begin making people's lives \nbetter.\n  I was so proud to be there with the President when he signed the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law--after spending my \nentire career in public service committed to this cause, it was a \nchance to witness history in the making.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House and Senate who did the \nright thing for the American people. I know we are walking on the right \nside of history. I know many wanted to do even more, and go further. I \nknow this bill is not perfect, but it will be transformative and that \nis a good thing.\n  I particularly want to thank two courageous colleagues on the House \nside--Congressmen Allan Mollohan and Nick Rahall who took a stand for \nthe American people and voted to pass this legislation.\n  I want to thank Harry Reid for his leadership, and his unwavering \nvision which helped deliver a final bill to the President's desk.\n  And finally, I want to thank the President who came to the White \nHouse as a champion of change. And now, he has delivered.\n  We knew it would not be easy to change our health care system, but we \npersevered. All of us have stories like the ones I told.\n  I am enormously proud to have supported this legislation, which, more \nthan anything, means a better health care system. It means a better \nAmerica and a better life for families everywhere.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

Mr. President, at this time I wish to give a short \nstatement for the Record, and then I will ask for the Senate to \nconsider the nomination of Winslow Lorenzo Sargeant, of Wisconsin, to \nbe Chief Counsel for Advocacy, for the Small Business Administration.\n  This is very troubling to me, as the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee. Months ago now, we had Dr. Winslow Sargeant before our \ncommittee. The President nominated him to be the Chief Counsel of the \nOffice of Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. For my \ncolleagues who may not be aware of this office and how important it is \nto have a qualified individual leading it, let me say that the Office \nof Advocacy works to reduce the burdens of Federal policies and \nregulations on small business, which is an important effort that is \nundertaken when either Republicans or Democrats are in the majority.\n  We recognize that sometimes regulations, particularly overly \nburdensome regulations, can be difficult for small business, so this \nposition in the Small Business Administration was actually created to \nadvocate not on behalf of the regulations, not on behalf of the \ngovernment, but on behalf of the small businesses--the millions of them \nthat are out there struggling right now to create jobs. We want to be \nhelpful to them, not hurtful. So it is puzzling to me why this \nnomination is being held up, particularly because he passed out of our \ncommittee with bipartisan support.\n  He has three degrees, including a Ph.D. from the University of \nWisconsin-Madison in electrical engineering, and a background as a very \nsuccessful small business owner himself. He not only is well educated \nbut well aware of the many difficult challenges facing businesses \ntoday.\n  Dr. Sargeant cofounded Aanetcom, a technology company that was \nultimately acquired. He is currently the managing director of Venture \nInvestors, a Midwest venture capital company which focuses on funding \nstartup health care and technology companies. In this role, Dr. \nSargeant works closely with technology transfer organizations to \ndevelop policies which enable the formation of startups, giving him an \nunmatched insight into the needs of entrepreneurs in this challenging \neconomic environment.\n  This is exactly what we need to be doing here: nominating and \nconfirming people such as this to step into positions of power, to \nadvocate on behalf of small businesses. So it is very troubling to me \nthis nomination has been held up. I am going to ask for his nomination \nto be cleared in a moment.\n  I am also puzzled because he has the support of many business \norganizations: the National Small Business Association, the Small \nBusiness Association of California, the Small Business Technology \nCouncil, and the Small Business Association of New England--very well-\nrespected small business organizations from one side of the country to \nthe other that are familiar with him and his work.\n  With more than 80 percent of job losses coming from small businesses \nsince the current recession began, it is critical, I believe, as the \nchair of this committee, that we provide our Nation's 29 million small \nbusiness owners\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nwith a strong and effective advocate here in Washington.\n  This position is empty. There is no one sitting in the office, at a \ntime when small business needs a voice. There are regulatory matters \ncoming from all sides. There are new challenges in this environment. \nThere are trade opportunities for businesses all over the world. Our \nsmall businesses must break into those markets. Let's not even begin to \ntalk about the regulatory nightmares here at home--just think about \nthose regulatory nightmares as our small businesses seek markets across \nthe oceans and over our borders. Why--why--would anyone want to hold up \nthis position? But someone is, and we are going to find out who and \nwhy.\n  Dr. Sargeant also has spent a great deal of time sitting on different \nboards, helping to advise others on building strong businesses. He is a \nKauffman Fellow, a member of the New York Academy of Sciences, and \nSigma Xi. He serves as a director of the University of Wisconsin \nFoundation, a trustee for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, and \na member of the corporation board of Northeastern University. He is an \nadvisory board member for WiCell, the Waisman BioManufacturing \nFacility, the University of Wisconsin Astronomy Department, and Purdue \nUniversity Discovery Research Park.\n  And the list of his accomplishments goes on. He has served as a \ntechnical advisory board member for startup company Intersymbol \nCommunications, Madison-based venture firm Venture Investors, LLC, \nmanaging member of Xcelis Communications, LLC and as an advisory board \nmember for the Maryland Venture Fund. Dr. Sargeant received the \ninaugural 2002 Wisconsin distinguished Young Alumni Award and was the \n2003 Outstanding Engineering Alumni Awardee from Northeastern \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Sargeant's work also extends to the community. He has been a \nmember of the Board of Directors for the Boys and Girls Club of \nMadison, Wisconsin, since 2006; a member of the Accelerate Madison, \nInc., a Madison, WI, organization dedicated to using information \ntechnology to spur economic growth; and active alumni organizations, \nsuch as the University of Wisconsin Foundation.\n  I have no doubt that Dr. Sargeant will make an excellent Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy and I remain baffled as to why his nomination has \nyet to be confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 427, the nomination of \nWinslow Lorenzo Sargeant, to be Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small \nBusiness Administration; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to the \nnomination be printed in the Record, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her concerns \nabout this matter. I am not a member of the committee and am not \npersonally familiar with the nomination. But I know it is controversial \nwith some Members on our side. I think as to the question of why, it is \nbecause we agree with the Senator that the nomination is to an \nimportant position, and there is concern about whether this is the \nright person for it. Therefore, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Alabama. He \nand I have worked on many important issues together. He is not a member \nof the committee, and I appreciate that. But I wish to, through the \nChair, let the Senator from Alabama know that he might want to consult \nwith some of the members of the Small Business Committee because when \nwe come back I am going to be asking every day on the floor of the \nSenate for this nomination to proceed.\n  I think it is fair, in the spirit of openness that so many people \nhave called for, that we have these discussions now in a very open way \non the floor of the Senate. So I hope the Senator will understand the \nspirit of this. This gentleman is extremely well qualified. I have had \nnumerous calls to my office urging us to move forward.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for those comments. But if you would \nrelay that to not only the members of the Small Business Committee but \nto the Republican Caucus, that would be wonderful. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, how many more minutes do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you.\n  Let me, while I have the floor, call attention to this document that \nis on our desks. It is the Executive Calendar that is placed every day \non our desks. Since we have been at our desks now for many hours, I \nactually had the opportunity to read it, which I do not often do.\n  Although the pages are not numbered, I counted them and I believe \nthere are 12 pages. This is documentation of every person pending on \nthe Executive Calendar for confirmation. It might be interesting to the \npeople observing our session today to note that all of these \nnominations--from the Judiciary, to the Federal Elections Commission, \nto the Department of Energy, to military positions, Corps of Engineers \npositions, the Army, the Executive Office of the President, members \nappointed to the Amtrak Board of Directors, the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission, the Farm Credit Administration, the Department \nof Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban Development--these are \npeople--pages and pages of names--who the President has suggested would \nbe wonderful people to serve our government.\n  They have passed the committee process, most of them--or many of \nthem, I understand--with bipartisan votes. Why they are sitting on this \ncalendar I do not know. But we are going to find out. I realize there \nis sort of a place and a time and a process in the Senate, but it is \nimportant for us to know, and for these individuals who have put their \nlives and their careers on the line, who put their homes up for sale, \nwho have left their former jobs thinking they were going to come to \nwork for the Government of the United States--proud to work for our \ngovernment--many at much less than they were making before they were \nnominated by the President. I am going to ask my colleagues on the \nRepublican side, Why are they being held up?\n  There are actually two individuals I know personally--two judicial \ncandidates from the State of Louisiana: Beth Foote and Brian Jackson--\none outstanding lawyer from the Western District of Louisiana, and one \noutstanding lawyer from the Middle District of Louisiana. They are not \ntechnically being held up, but they are not moving forward. So we need \nto be moving them forward. The chairman of the committee, Chairman \nLeahy, has done a wonderful job moving them through. In fact, the \nSenator from Alabama was extremely complimentary--who is on the \nJudiciary Committee--of both of those nominees because I happened to be \npresent at their hearing. The Senator from Alabama was extremely \ncomplimentary in his views, and he is, of course, the ranking member on \nthat committee.\n\n  When we get back, on behalf of Beth Foote and Brian Jackson and \nWinslow Sargeant, I hope some of my other colleagues will be happy to \njoin me in very open and public discussions on the floor of the Senate \nabout what might be a problem that we should know about so that we can \nget these people in positions of power and authority and of service, \nmight I say, to the people of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2091-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2091-S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          CONTINUING EXTENSION ACT OF 2010--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout where we are as a nation and what the future is for our children.\n  We have at this point in time $12.6 trillion worth of debt. We now \nhave equivalent debt for every man, woman, and child in this country of \n$42,000. For our children who are under 25 years of age, in the year \n2030, each one of them will be responsible for $1,113,000 worth of debt \nand unfunded obligations. If we think about what that means, it means \nthat for our children who are under 25 years of age, the ability for \nthem to experience the opportunity that we as a nation have experienced \nin the past 230-plus years is going to be put at risk.\n  We have before us some things that need to get done. They have to get \ndone. We have two options: We can add another $9.2 billion to that \n$12.6 trillion we have today and bump up more than that $1,113,000, or \nwe can relook into the mirror and say: Should we as Americans start \nmaking some of the hard choices that are going to be necessary for us \nto get out of the mess we have created for our children?\n  When I travel around the country--and I travel in Oklahoma--Americans \nare concerned about our future right now. What are their concerns? What \ndoes it boil down to in their hearts? In their hearts, they have this \ngripping sensation that what they have experienced as an American may \nnot be available for their children. It is a painful realization. Their \nhope for us is that we might change that outcome for their children. We \nhave an opportunity to start that right now.\n  By way of background, most of us know there is a tremendous amount of \nwaste, fraud, abuse, and duplication in the Federal Government. \nOftentimes, it is hard to weed out because every program, whether it is \nefficient or effective or not, has people who tout it. Our nature as \npoliticians is to offend no one. That is our nature. How in the world \ndo we accomplish what is going to be necessary in the next 5 to 10 \nyears and solve this most difficult problem that we, the politicians, \nhave created? America didn't create this. The States didn't create \nthis. This problem was created in Washington.\n  As has often been said, the easiest thing in the world is to spend \nsomebody else's money. So the earnestness with which I come to the \nfloor is to say we ought not be doing that, especially when we know \nthere is waste and there is fraud and there is duplication and there is \nabuse in much of the Federal Government.\n  I was reminded of the trouble the State of New Jersey is in. What the \npeople of the State of New Jersey have said is: We recognize the \nproblem, and we need to change things. So they elected a new Governor \non the basis that he would make the tough decisions about priorities to \nchange the future path--that he might change the path of the future for \nthe citizens of New Jersey. He put forth a bold budget. As a matter of \nfact, one of the Senate Democratic leaders is helping him fix the \nproblem.\n  So we have a Republican Governor with a bold plan who has come \nforward to the people of the State of New Jersey. They elected him by a \nfairly large margin and said: For us to have this great future we all \nwant for our kids, we are going to have to do some things that aren't \nnecessarily pleasant, but they are necessary. It is kind of like when \nyou have a child and they have to take a medicine, or the first time \nyou take a child to the pediatrician's office for their first set of \nshots. That is an easy visit. The hard visit is the second visit \nbecause they have a memory of getting the injections the first time. So \nall of a sudden you have resistance, you have resistance, you have \nresistance to a medicine or a vaccine that actually fixes the problem, \nbut there is a small amount of pain with it.\n  So the Governor of New Jersey has started out on a bold, fresh course \nnot because he is a Republican--it doesn't matter the label. The fact \nis, the people in New Jersey, in a bipartisan manner, recognized they \nhad to make changes. So we have unemployment insurance. We have COBRA. \nWe have flood insurance. We have the doc fix for 30 days. We have all \nof these things in front of us that we all agree we want to get done.\n  Where lies our disagreement? It is very simple. One says we will \ndeclare it an emergency, not pay for it, and send the bill to our \ngrandkids. The other says: Maybe it is time we quit doing that.\n  What is the expectation of the American people in terms of how we \nshould respond to that? A recent poll said 72 percent of the American \npeople, not divided by party, pretty neutral between both parties, say \nthe No. 1 issue in front of us as a nation is our debt.\n  We had a warning from the rating agencies just 2 weeks ago that the \nUnited States of America is about to lose its AAA credit rating on its \nbonds. If you watched bond prices yesterday, what you saw was the yield \nshot up. The interest payment we are going to have to pay for when we \nborrow a huge amount of money is going to rise.\n  One of the most significant things we could do to help ourselves is \nsend a signal to the world that we are not going to wait until our bond \nrating crashes, that we are going to start taking the steps that are \nnecessary for us to get back on a road to fiscal health.\n  With all good faith, I think the majority leader and the minority \nleader tried to work out an agreement where we could perhaps accomplish \nthis. We did not get there. Therefore, we find ourselves where we are \ngoing to have to have a debate, and we are going to have to discuss in \nfront of the American people if we do these good things--and they are \ngood--should we get rid of things that are a whole lot less good or \nshould we take the immoral choice and not make any choice at all and \npass it on to our children and grandchildren.\n  That is the question of where the American people are today. The \nmajority and the President have had a great victory on health care, \nwith not partisan differences but policy differences with my side of \nthe aisle. That is now the law of the land. Whether you believe CBO and \nhow it is scored, the fact is, even if it saves that amount of money, \nthat does not come close to solving any of our problems.\n  We have had these multiple month-long extensions, of which none have \nbeen paid for, at about $9 billion to $10 billion a month. We find \nourselves, because we want to go home or we want to go on a codel or we \nwant to campaign or we want to fundraise, we want to make it easy and \njust pass it on down to the next generation.\n  I cannot agree to that anymore, ever again; that, in fact, if we are \ngoing to spend money on things we know we ought to do, then the \nobligation ought to be on us to get rid of funds that are spent on \nthings that are very much less important. That is the hardest thing a \npolitical body does, is that they end up isolating and irritating those \nwho are well connected who have an interest in those lower priority \nitems. It is hard for us because, as is our nature, we want to offend \nno one. But we are going to have to talk that out. I guess we are going \nto have to talk it out on the floor, and we are going to have to debate \nit. We are going to talk about what our true long-term future is if we \ndo not change.\n  I would rather us not be at this point, but when I wrestle with my \nown conscience and as I visualize my grandchildren and the \ngrandchildren of everybody in this body, I think it would be immoral \nfor us not to have this debate.\n  I don't know what the outcome of the debate is going to be and the \nultimate\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nresult. But I can tell you it is a legitimate debate we ought to be \nhaving. We ought to not just be having it on this extender package. We \nought to be having it on any new spending, in any form, that the \nCongress does.\n  One of the large segments of the Recovery Act that some of us \ndisagreed with was the amount of money that got transferred to the \nStates to help them through this fiscal crisis. When we look at that, \nwhen we did that, I believe--and this is my personal belief, and I am \nsure many of my colleagues would not agree with it--we transferred the \nworst habit of Washington to the States, saying there are not \nconsequences to your spending more money than you have. Although all \nthese States have balanced budget amendments--in my own State, even \nthough we had to make some tough decisions because of the tremendous \namount of money that came through the Recovery Act, we did not make the \ndecisions we should. So now we are going to make them this year, and we \nare going to make very difficult choices about priorities in the State \nof Oklahoma, with a Democratic Governor and a Republican House and \nSenate. They are going to get the job done. They are going to \naccomplish it because the people of Oklahoma do not allow their \ngovernment to run their government on the backs of their unborn \nchildren. We do not allow it. We forbid it. We see it as immoral.\n  If you think about it, it is because what we are doing is stealing \nfuture opportunity from our children. People can say that is not right, \nbut when you run the numbers--and everybody knows the numbers--it is \nright.\n  CBO put out 2 weeks ago that we are going to have a $9.8 trillion \ndeficit this decade, not counting last year. They also put out that \n$5.6 trillion of that $9.8 trillion is money that is going to be used \nto pay interest. We are now similar to the person who gets in trouble \non their credit card. The analogy does not stop there because what \nhappens to the person with the credit card debt? The interest rate \nrises because they are not paying, when they only pay the minimum.\n  We have now gotten to the point where the vast majority of our debt \naccumulation in the next 9 years is going to be associated with \ninterest payments rather than defending the country, rather than \nrefilling Social Security, the money we have stolen out of there, \nrather than picking up the deficit that is in Medicare. We are going to \nspend that money to pay for interest. It is a double whammy. It is \nmoney we are paying that is not helping anybody. It is not helping \nanybody.\n  I was nominated to be on the Commission President Obama issued by \nExecutive order that has six of our Democratic colleagues in the House \nand Senate and six of us on the Republican side and six appointed by \nthe President. I have had multiple conversations with many of those \npeople already. Quite frankly, they are worried and scared for our \ncountry based on the numbers we are seeing.\n  How is it we would now start down a road ignoring the reality of what \nis in front of us?\n  Let me describe what is in front of us. I wish to talk about it from \nan international standpoint first, and then I wish to talk about it \nfrom a domestic economy standpoint.\n  We had the Chinese Army say 6 weeks ago to the Chinese Government: \nDump a bunch of American bonds; hurt them. You have the Chinese \nGovernment that undervalues its currency, stealing our jobs, and we are \nborrowing money from them. They now have an impact on our foreign \npolicy. All we have to do is talk about Iran.\n  The sanctions we want to place on Iran that are necessary to be \nplaced on Iran to contain the threat of them developing nuclear weapons \nare not available to us. The reason they are not available to us is \nbecause China and Russia have leverage over our debt. We do not have a \nclear, clean, crisp foreign policy because we have this little IOU of \n$900 billion to China and $700 billion to Russia that we are worried \nmight influence their handling of that and the consequences of it.\n  When we look at history and we look at all the republics that have \never been, the one key thing in common that happens to them that causes \nthem to fail is what? Is that every one of them got in trouble on a \nfiscal basis before they withered on an international basis or on a \ndominance basis. Every one of them withered. They, in fact, fell \nbecause they could not support their armies, they could not support the \nnetworks they put out and developed as a governing body.\n  The question is, Will that happen to us? There is a potential for \nthat to happen to us. I will tell you, yes, we are in a position now \nwhere if we do not change gears and start making priorities on both \nprograms and benefits, drawn in the light of the priorities of our \npresent financial situation, and start making selections about what is \nmost important versus what is least important, we are going to be \nsimilar to the Athenian Empire.\n  The real thing that is going on outside Washington and throughtout \nAmerica is the fear of what is happening to us. They sense it. They \nworry about it. We have exaggerated that by at times not paying \nattention to that fear and that worry. But the consequence of not \nstarting at a point in time in which we are going to make a difference \nand start doing what we were elected to do, which is to select \npriorities and eliminate nonfunctioning, poorly functioning duplication \nand fraud from the Federal Government--I said I was going to talk about \nthe other side.\n  What does the domestic side look like for us as we go out, having \n$9.8 trillion worth of more borrowing in the next 9 years, with $5.6 \ntrillion of that in interest payments? What does that do to our \ndomestic economy? What is the impact? The impact is, we will see \nchanges in our standard of living because of it. They are not positive \nchanges.\n  If we were to stop right now and not borrow another penny and try to \nmanage the debt we have today, we would still see a marked increase in \ninflation in our country--not immediately, but all you have to do is \nwatch the bond market to see what is going to happen and you watch the \nyield curve. When you see 10 years go from last year this time 2.4 \npercent to 3.9 percent, which is a greater than 50 percent rise in \nyield as we continue to flood $300 billion this week in borrowing from \nthe Fed, what does that mean for the average American?\n  What that means for the average American is inflation. What that \nmeans to that $5.8 trillion in terms of interest payments is that it is \na larger proportion because as the interest costs rise, the proportion \nof interest payments versus total debt rises. We now spend in the \nUnited States--last year, per household--$38,980 in Federal programs \nper household. The median family income in America is $50,000, and the \nFederal Government is responsible for 80 percent of that as a ratio in \nterms of money we spend. We only collected--and this is not last year \nbut the year before data--$18,000 per household.\n\n  So what do the numbers say? The numbers said that last year, 43 cents \nout of every dollar that the government spent we borrowed. It is going \nto be about 48 cents or 47 cents, we don't know for sure, this year. \nBut I would note that we had the highest monthly deficit in our history \nin the month of February, and we need to send a signal to the \ninternational financial market that we are aware----\n  Mr. REID addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I would ask if my friend would yield for \na question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Senator give us an idea of how long he is going \nto talk?\n  Mr. COBURN. About another 30 or 45 minutes. I will be glad to signal \nthat ahead of time so the Senator would not have to wait on me. I will \nmake sure the Senator is notified before I finish.\n  I kind of lost my train of thought.\n  The fact is, about 47 cents out of every dollar that we spend this \nyear we are going to borrow. From whom are we borrowing it? Half we are \nborrowing from the American taxpayer, but the other half we are \nfloating to the same people who hold our debt today. So we are doing a \ncouple of things that are very dangerous for us. We are increasing our \ndependency on financing with those who don't have the best interest in \nmind for us, and we are raising the level of the amount of money we \nborrow that we have to pay back in interest to where it is not going to \nbe long\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nthat all the money we are borrowing is interest.\n  Why is that important to the individual family? If you have a savings \nthat has recovered somewhat from the lows of 2009--and I think the \naverage savings has recovered about 60 percent of its losses, or 75 \npercent of the losses in this country--when we start inflating the \nvalue of that retirement, the value of that asset is going to decline \nin terms of real dollars. We are perilously close to getting into the \nsame situation we got into in the late 1970s and the early 1980s where \nwe had double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment, and double-\ndigit interest rates.\n  You will hear everybody say: Oh, that isn't going to happen to us \nagain. Well, I certainly hope it doesn't, but some of the same \nsituations are playing out today that were playing out then. So if in \nfact you are on a fixed income, a retirement income, and we start \ninflating because of our debt, who does it hurt the most? It hurts \nthose individuals who are on a fixed income, who don't have the luxury \nof going back to work or don't have the capability of going back to \nwork. What happens to them? Their standard of living goes down, along \nwith their ability to cope.\n  As I talk to families across America, what they are doing, still to \nthis day, is they are sitting down at the table and they are visiting \nwith one another and they are saying: Here is the money in, and here is \nthe money out. How do we increase the money in, and how do we decrease \nthe money out? What they are doing is picking what is important. They \nare picking what is a priority and going without the things that are \nnot as important.\n  I agree that we have 9.7 percent unemployment and we ought to be \nhelping those people. I agree we ought to be helping with COBRA. I \nagree we ought to do the doc fix. We had an opportunity last night to \nfix it for 3 years and 9 months and pay for it, but this body rejected \nthat. I agree those are good things. What I don't agree with is doing \nthose good things on the backs of our grandchildren. When and if we do \nthose good things, and we haven't paid for them, what we will have done \nis been dishonest with the American people, not only in our action but \nin our oath.\n  You see, it is easy to spend other people's money if in fact you are \nsitting up here secure with a pension and a good salary and there are \nno consequences to us. We will all do fine. But the vast majority of \nAmericans will not do fine, and the future of America will not shine \nbright. The future will be a little dimmer because we have this \ntremendous yoke of heaviness and drudgery on our backs because we, in \nfact, would not have made the hard choices.\n  This isn't the first Congress. The Republicans didn't make hard \nchoices when they were in control. It is not partisan. It is a disease \nof elected officials, that they think they can get away without making \nthe hard choices because the cost for not making the hard choices comes \ndown the road. We have been doing that now for 30 years in this \ncountry. We have not made hard choices. We have made a lot of mistakes.\n  No question, Republicans have made more than their fair share of \nthose mistakes. But rather than point fingers, what we ought to say is: \nWhat is the problem? What are the symptoms of the problem, and how do \nyou fix them?\n  Many economists say it is impossible for us to grow our way out of \nthis situation. We had a nice bump in the fourth quarter, thanks to \nhundreds of billions of dollars that got pumped into the economy, and \nthere truly were a lot of jobs saved by the stimulus act. Maybe not as \nefficiently as I would have liked, but there were jobs saved. Nobody \ncan dispute that. The question is, are we going to continue the \npolicies that got us into trouble?\n  As I practice medicine, the one mistake doctors make and that gets \nthem into trouble is when they treat symptoms instead of the disease. \nHere is the best example I know. Somebody comes to you with a fever and \ncough, malaise, and not feeling good. Well, I as a doctor, I can give \nthem medicine for a cough. I can fix that. And I can give them \nsomething for the fever and the muscle aches. I can fix that. But if I \ndon't diagnose what is causing the fever, the muscle aches, and the \ncough, what I have done is covered up the disease. That is what we are \ndoing. The patient may get well because the body is a miraculous part \nof creation, and it has tremendous defenses. The mortality rate for \npneumonia at the turn of the last century was 60 percent. Today, in \nsomebody under 80, it is about 1 percent because we have the drugs to \ntreat the real disease not the symptoms.\n  What is going to describe our action? Are we going to treat the \nsymptoms or are we going to treat the disease? My hope would be that we \ncould lock hands and say: Here is a start. Here is $9.2 billion that \nwe, in fact, can find a way to come together and pay for and make sure \nthese people get these benefits that are needed in this time of \ndifficult economic situation. We can do that, and we can set a new \nstart--a new start of reaching across the aisle and saying this is an \nappropriate moral goal, just as it is an inappropriate moral goal to \nnot pay for it. It is immoral.\n  Let me say it again: To steal from your children and your \ngrandchildren with a wink and a nod and thinking there are no \nconsequences for your borrowing against their future is immoral. It \nwouldn't be immoral if everything we were doing was working great; that \nthere wasn't $350 billion worth of duplication, fraud, abuse, and waste \nin the Federal Government every year--$350 billion every year, fully \ndocumented. It wouldn't be. But that is where we find ourselves.\n  So on the one hand over here we have this waste, fraud, abuse, and \nduplication. Yet because we want to get out of town we don't want to do \nthe hard work of ferreting something out of that, something that is \nsuspected of not being effective, to pay for the $9.2 billion. And I \ntold my leadership that I didn't have any desire to keep anybody here \nthis weekend through Wednesday. That is not my desire. But, in fact, if \nwe are not going to do it, if we are going to take the immoral choice \nand spend money that we don't have and not eliminate programs that are \nnot effective--programs that would not deliver to the American people, \nprograms that would not accomplish their intended purpose--and just \ncharge that to our grandkids, I feel obliged to stand in the way of \nthat. And it will not be easy.\n  We didn't have much sleep last night. It will require a lot of effort \non my part. But I think the future of our country is worth that. The \nfuture of our country is worth taking the consternation of those who \nwill be upset with me because I am taking this stand. And I want to say \nat the outset, if somebody had plans, I apologize that those plans \nmight be disrupted. I had plans, and they are going to get disrupted. \nBut I don't apologize for having a legitimate debate on whether we \nought to grow a spine and start making the same kind of decisions that \nevery family in America is making.\n  It doesn't matter if you are a liberal or a conservative, you are \nstill making those decisions. It is not about social issues. The \ngreatest moral question in front of us today is not this range of \nsocial issues that so often divide us. The greatest moral issue in \nfront of us today is whether we will preserve this wonderful experiment \nand create an opportunity, through hard work and sacrifice, so that the \ngenerations that are to come will have the same benefit from it that we \nhave had. So it may turn into a partisan debate, but that is not my \ngoal. It needs to be a legitimate, intellectual debate about the value \nof being efficient, the value of doing the hard work of making choices \nthat are of the highest priority, and eliminating those things that, \nalthough they might be good, are less good in favor of things that are \nabsolutely necessary.\n  Unfortunately, in my almost 5\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, my side \nrarely does that, and neither does the other side.\n  How do we get out of the problem we have? How do we get out of the \ngridlock? How do we get out of the anger? How do we then focus on what \nthe real problem, the real danger to the undermining of America is? The \nreal danger to the undermining of America is the fact that we have a \ngovernment that is entirely too big; the only thing it is effective and \nefficient at is wasting money; that we can't afford the Government we \nhave today; that we continue to borrow money we don't have\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\nto pay for things we don't absolutely need. How do we get out of that?\n  I recognize the debate. Unfortunately, I had a drafting error in what \nI intended to offer so we are offering pay-fors from what I think is \nnot necessarily the best source, but it is better than not paying for \nit. There is $100 billion in unobligated balances sitting at the \nagencies in this country. It has already been used to pay for certain \nthings we have already voted on. Nobody would feel the pinch if we did \nit that way.\n  I would be inclined to ask for a unanimous consent, but I will not do \nthat until I am sure the other side will not object to it, to have a \nchange in the paperwork in mine from what I originally intended but, \nbecause of a drafting error, I cannot use. But nevertheless, the \nlegitimate debate is whether we borrow and steal from our kids or we \nget out of town and send the bill to our kids for something we are \ngoing to consume today.\n  There is a disease that is called consumption--it is syphilis. It is \nconsumption because it consumes you. We have a disease similar to that. \nOur disease actions in Congress are consuming away the opportunity of \nAmerica, much of it because we lack perspective but most of it because \nwe lack the will to make the difficult choices that are in front of us. \nI wonder--actually, I am sometimes astonished--why people do not go \nhome from here at night tremendously concerned about our future, enough \nso that it causes us to come together to do the best, right thing for \nAmerica. Is the best, right thing for America to borrow this $9.2 \nbillion? Is that the best, right thing for America? Or would it be that \nwe eliminate programs that are not nearly as effective or lessen \nprograms that are not nearly as effective as these are going to be for \nthose people who are depending on us today? Not just the best, right \nthing in the short term, because another disease that plagues us is we \nfail to consider the long term oftentimes--not all the time. But we \nbecome short-term thinkers, thinking about, where is the political \nadvantage? How do I look good? How do I accomplish what I want to \naccomplish for me or my State? I think it is important that we \nunderstand there is no State in this country that can be healthy if our \ncountry is not healthy--if the country isn't economically healthy, if \nit is not socially healthy. If it is not, then we have not done our \njob.\n  My apologies to the leader for putting him in this position. It is \nwith a very intended sense of commitment that I want us to try to pay \nfor this. I understand there is disagreement in that regard, but I look \nforward to trying to solve this problem, and if we can, I look forward \nto having the debate as it goes forward.\n  I yield to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, he has not put me in an \nawkward position at all. We would have been happy just to vote on this.\n  That being the case, what I will do--and I alert everybody we are not \ngoing to rush this, so people will have time to get here--I move to \ntable the motion to proceed.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Madam President, even though we have made an extraordinary \nadvance in health care reform, we still have millions of Americans who \nare without jobs and in need of unemployment insurance. We are in a \nsituation that requires action.\n  Early this month, we were able to pass a 30-day extension by a vote \nof 78 to 19. It was overwhelmingly adopted, but it was not quickly \nadopted because of the delay and the procedures imposed upon the \nprocess. We might in this Chamber understand the nuances of rules and \nprocedures, but for the people who have been without work for up to a \nyear or more, the nuances escape them. They need help. The reality is, \non April 5 this extension will expire. We will not be in session, so we \nare here today to continue the work that we must do as Members of this \nSenate.\n  We have already passed in this body a year-long extension along with \nsome other tax provisions--again, under the leadership of Chairman \nBaucus. That provision is over in the House, and it is unlikely to move \ntoday or tomorrow. The House sent us a provision for another 1-month \nextension. That is bottled up. But, again, all of these legislative \ninitiatives do not put the check in the mail for those who are without \nwork.\n  That is what we have to do. We have to pass another extension, at \nleast to get us from April into next month and beyond. Of course, I \nthink the year-long extension until the end of this calendar year is \nthe right approach. It has already been adopted, and I hope we can \nreturn and embrace that proposal.\n  If we do not move, at a minimum, for a temporary extension, \napproximately 1,200 Rhode Islanders will start losing their benefits \neach week starting April 5. By the end of April, three-quarters of 1 \nmillion unemployed workers across the Nation will lose their benefits.\n  This is at a moment when we are beginning to see some economic \ntraction, some reports of progress in labor markets. Just today it was \nreported that initial unemployment claims fell by 14,000--a number much \nlarger than the experts expected. Now we are in a very difficult moment \nwhen we look at the good news being that ``the claims fell.'' But that \nis a prelude to the point we have to achieve: when not only the claims \nfall but the jobs start growing and growing and growing.\n  We have come a long ways since President Obama took office: 700,000 \npeople a month who were losing their job--with huge, catastrophic, \nramifications throughout the economy. That is beginning to turn around. \nBut until we are back to a robust employment situation, we cannot \nignore people who need help through the unemployment compensation \nsystem.\n  I believe the major point at this juncture between the two sides is \nthe issue of how do we pay for this, its cost. We have adopted, as \nDemocrats, what was ignored and then dismissed by Republicans, which is \nthe concept of pay-go, of paying for government activities either by \nrevenue increases or by offsetting reductions. But we have always \nunderstood that in emergencies these pay-go rules properly can be \nsuspended;\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\nthat we can go ahead and deal with an emergency.\n  Frankly, this situation we are in today, that is triggering all this \nconcern--and rightfully so--of the deficit is not something that was \ncreated by President Obama. He walked in with a $1.3 trillion deficit--\nin sharp contrast to President George W. Bush, who walked into office \nwith a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years. That was not the result of \njust the economy humming along, that was the result of very difficult \nchoices that were made in this body and in the House of Representatives \nunder the leadership of President Clinton and, once again, under the \nleadership of my colleagues such as Max Baucus.\n  But that surplus, that opportunity of a robust employment picture \nwhere unemployment was around 5 percent, that was the legacy of \nPresident Clinton. Frankly, the legacy of President Bush is significant \ndeficits and significant unemployment and financial crisis. More debt \nwas added in that administration--$3 trillion--than all previous \nadministrations combined, from George Washington all the way up to \nGeorge W. Bush.\n  So this deficit is a real problem. But a lot of it was the result of \ndecisions that were made by that administration to finance activities \nnot through pay-go but through just piling it on the deficit. Tax cuts \nwere not paid for, and the tax cuts were skewed in the nature of a \nprogressive tax to the wealthiest. Iraq, Afghanistan--none of those \nwars were paid for through offsets or anything else. The prescription \ndrug program, Part D, was not paid for. It was, again, added to the tab \nof future generations. It is interesting, today we have actually tried \nto fix that with the passage of the health care bill by closing the \ndoughnut hole.\n  So at this moment, when we face a true employment emergency, when \npeople say: Well, we are now going to insist upon complete offsets, it \nmisses what was done casually and repeatedly during the Bush \nadministration for areas that you could argue were not true \nemergencies. Now we face a critical emergency. In my State of Rhode \nIsland, we have a 12.7 percent unemployment rate. If we do not start \nsupporting and turning that around, it will get worse rather than \nbetter. We have never in recent history--going over several decades--\never suspended emergency unemployment benefits when the unemployment \nrate was at least 7.4 percent or higher. We are at nearly 10 percent \nunemployment nationally, and in some States--again, in Rhode Island, it \nis close to 13 percent. Until we lower joblessness significantly, we \nare still in an employment emergency.\n  The other aspect of this, too, is unemployment compensation is one of \nthe major activities for stimulating the economy. The bang for the buck \nis significant. There is $1.90 of economic activity for every $1 \ninvested in unemployment insurance. It makes sense. People need the \nmoney to go to the store to buy food for their children. They need to \npay for the gas to look for a job. That money will come in and be \nmultiplied in the economy.\n  The irony, too, of trying to use, in some respects, the stimulus \nmoney to pay for the unemployment is it is basically taking away money \nwe have designed to get the economy moving and spending it for a \nprogram that will also help the economy move. But you are going to get \na lot less bang for the buck in terms of decreasing our overall \ncommitment to that economic activity in the country.\n  So we have to move. I would urge an immediate extension of the \nunemployment compensation legislation to give us a chance to return and \nwork with our colleagues in the House for the legislation that will at \nleast guarantee an unemployment extension until the end of this \ncalendar year. But we have to move. We have to act. We should do so \nnow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to follow up a little bit \nand address the same subject addressed by my good friend from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Reed.\n  Just a little reminder first. On March 10, the Senate passed \nlegislation to extend both tax provisions and safety net programs \nthrough to the end of 2010. That legislation included $34 billion worth \nof tax cuts, an extension of unemployment benefits, an extension of \nCOBRA health benefits for laid-off workers, and several other items. \nThat legislation was also partially paid for. The Senate bill differs \nfrom similar legislation passed by the House, and we have not yet had a \nchance to reconcile these differences--one bill in each body.\n  In the next couple weeks, however, several of these programs will \nexpire. Beginning April 5, some laid-off workers will begin losing \ntheir unemployment benefits. That is not long from now. Workers laid \noff after March 31 will lose the 65-percent tax credit currently \navailable to purchase temporary health insurance. After March 31, \ndoctors will see 20 percent reductions in their reimbursements under \nMedicare.\n  We should not let these programs expire. Today, we should extend them \nfor a month, at least, while we try to meld the Senate and the House \nversions into one bill that the President can sign.\n  I think all of us can recall 2 days at the beginning of this month \nwhen Congress did let these programs temporarily expire. It was not our \nfinest hour. I hope we will not do the same this month.\n  So I ask, what is holding us up from keeping these programs in place? \nThere is no controversy about whether to extend the programs for 1 \nmonth. Both Republicans and Democrats have proposed doing that. Both \npropose extending the programs for at least 1 month until we get the \nyearlong bill resolved. There is only an honest disagreement over \nwhether to provide offsets for this bill.\n  Most Republicans believe the package should be fully offset. My good \nfriend from Iowa offered an amendment to do just that. Most Democrats \nbelieve unemployment benefits during a recession when we have seen \nunemployment rates rise to double digits signify an emergency and need \nnot be offset.\n  We are still in a very dire situation. In a moment, I will propound a \nunanimous consent request that seeks to resolve these differences. We \nshould do that. Clearly, we should for the benefit of thousands of \nAmericans who are struggling as a result of the downsizing that has \noccurred across our Nation in this recession.\n  They are the ones bearing the brunt of our failure. They are the ones \nbearing the brunt of our inaction and of our--to be honest--partisan \ndifferences. It is astounding to me we just cannot get together for the \nsake of people who otherwise will lose their unemployment checks, who \nwill not have the benefit of COBRA health insurance, and seniors who \nare in jeopardy because their doctors are not going to get paid for \nMedicare. There is no one to blame but us.\n\n  The COBRA tax credit has helped millions of unemployed workers and \ntheir families afford health care while looking for a job. Without this \nassistance, the average family would need to pay $1,100 per month to \nkeep their health insurance, which is simply unaffordable for most \nunemployed workers. This provision would extend the COBRA tax credit \nthrough April 30 to ensure newly unemployed workers can also receive \nassistance in affording their health insurance.\n  Unemployment insurance benefits have helped millions of Americans \nstay afloat after they have lost their job. We want them to keep those \nbenefits, at least for awhile. Folks who lose a job then face an \neconomy that has few and sometimes no options for returning to work in \ntheir community and in their chosen field. In fact, I read recently \nthat there are five people looking for every single job opening--five, \nat least five--in America.\n  Approximately 1 million workers--that is about 200,000 per week--will \nlose their benefits in April alone. Not only will this cause them and \ntheir families untold hardship--just think of it, no job, no \nunemployment insurance--it will also cause important money to stop \nflowing through their communities, and that could very well lead to an \nimmediate application for food stamps.\n  Unlike last month, when the program lapsed for just 2 days because of \nthe upcoming recess, the programs will lapse this time for at least a \nweek. The State\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nagencies will have absolutely no ability to keep their programs up and \nrunning. They will have to terminate benefits.\n  Over 6 million workers are depending on extended benefits and they \nare distraught. Yet again, this debate is going down to the wire, \ncausing them unnecessary stress, unnecessary anxiety. They have already \nbeen through enough. They deserve better. They deserve our support.\n  Unemployment benefits are used for basic necessities--food and \nshelter--while the laid-off worker seeks a new job. These benefits are \ncritical to a worker and his or her family and to the economies of the \ncommunity. I hope we do what is right and find a solution to help the \npeople whom we work for.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 323, H.R. 4851, to provide \na temporary extension of certain programs; that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, I wish to ask the chairman \nof the committee a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is this bill you have just called up and asked unanimous \nconsent to move forward on paid for?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is a bill which requires urgent attention. It is not \npaid for.\n  Mr. COBURN. Given that fact, as I stated in my earlier speech, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB.

Madam President, last night we had an issue involving the \nwell-being of our veterans who I think got caught up in the give-and-\ntake of the debate on the health care bill, particularly the procedural \naspects of it. An amendment was offered to the bill by Senator Burr, \nand a counteroffer was made to solve these two disparities, one \nregarding TRICARE and another regarding a certain section of title 38 \nwith respect to veterans health care through unanimous consent, since \none of the bills had already been voted on unanimously in the House and \nthe other one certainly there is no real objection to. The request to \npass these bills immediately, which would have made them law today, was \nobjected to. Senator Burr's amendment also went down.\n  I wish to say first, I don't think there is any debate in this body \nabout the dedication that Senator Burr has to our veterans. I think \nthat goes for all Members of this body. There is no one in this body \nwho isn't fully dedicated to the well-being of our veterans and our \nActive-Duty military people as well. I think it is a shame that the \nprocedural aspects of what we were debating overcame something that \nshould have been a simple process.\n  In that spirit, I have been discussing this matter with Senator Burr, \nand we are going to take two amendments that were offered last night \nfor unanimous consent to see if we can't clear them on both sides and \nto have these protections, these express protections for the medical \ncare of those who are serving and those who have served take their \nrightful place as protected in the larger aspect of this health care \nreform. We are going to work to clear them on both sides, hopefully, to \nget this matter resolved. We can have our political debates and we will \nhave our political debates, but all of us need to come together to make \nsure that those who serve fully understand the dedication of this body.\n  So I hope the other side will help us move these two amendments \nforward. I appreciate Senator Burr's support in that effort. Also, as I \nsaid, I very much appreciate the dedication he has always shown to our \nveterans. He is the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Committee, and \nno one is in any way questioning that aspect of his service in the \nSenate.\n  So I just wished to again point out that we are going to attempt to \nclear these today. We can resolve this matter within a day or two. It \nwill become law. Our veterans and those serving will know they are \nfully protected.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I wish to salute my colleague \nfrom Virginia. There has been no one in this body who has stood more \nfirmly and more intelligently and more successfully for veterans than \nthe junior Senator from Virginia, and I thank him. I hope the other \nside will heed what he has asked, which is not anything to do with \npolitics but simply in the benefit of our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2096-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A JOB WELL DONE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, second--and I am going to speak on a \nlocal matter in a minute--I wish to compliment Senators Reid and Baucus \nand Harkin and Dodd for the great job they have done. What a momentous \nday it is. Today is a moment to ignore the politics--how it will affect \nthis party or this election or this President. For the next decade and \nhenceforth, there are going to be 1 million people each week whose \nlives are made better by what we have done today. There is going to be \na young person, God forbid, who is in an automobile accident and \nbecause she has good health insurance, she will get cured and live a \nbetter life; whereas, until now, she wouldn't. There is going to be \nsomebody who has cancer, and in the past their insurance company would \nhave said: Forget it. Now they are going to get that treatment. There \nis going to be a poor person who walks into a community health center \nand gets diagnosed early and cured and able to live a productive life. \nThere are going to be countless young people who are worried. My \ndaughter called me right after the House passed health insurance at 1 \nin the morning and she said: Dad--she is getting out of law school. She \nis going to have no health insurance until she starts her job 4 or 5 \nmonths from now, and she was worried about whether she could afford to \nbuy it. She said: Dad, I got health insurance. I can be on yours.\n  So it is little instances and big instances. Every day, every week, \nevery month people's lives are going to be made so much better by what \nwe have done. That is what we ought to think about today, regardless of \nour differences. I am proud to win a small part of that, but again, I \nsalute some of the giants who led us here: the President, whose faith \nin getting this done never waivered; Speaker Pelosi and her crew over \nin the House; and, of course, our leader, Harry Reid, who, in his low-\nkey but relentless way, makes sure we do what we have to do and unites \nour cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2096-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2096-S2097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NASA SPACE SHUTTLE RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I wish to spend the rest of this time \ntalking about a local matter of some concern. One of the nice things \nabout being a Senator, you work on big matters and small matters and \nthey are all enjoyable and all are important. This isn't small but more \nlocal, shall I say.\n  With NASA searching for a new home for three soon-to-be-retired space \nshuttles, it is time to convince NASA that the Big Apple has the right \nstuff to showcase one of these iconic spacecraft.\n  The perfect location for a retired space shuttle is the Intrepid Sea, \nAir & Space Museum on Manhattan's West Side in my hometown of New York \nCity.\n  Yes, it will be a huge boon to New York's economy and a magnet for \ntourists.\n  But showcasing a genuine space shuttle will not only bring visitors \nby the millions, it will inspire multitudes to learn, explore and \ndream, of adventure.\n  It is perfect for NASA, too: The agency's explicit goal is to have \nthese magnificent vehicles seen--and their history understood--by the \ngreatest number of people possible.\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  No other location in the nation can offer the millions and millions \nof visitors who will stream into the Intrepid to view and experience \nthe shuttle.\n  Housing an iconic spacecraft in New York City--the media center of \nthe world--guarantees it will appear in countless news and \nentertainment programs broadcast throughout the nation and world, \nproviding incalculable public-relations value to NASA.\n  Just yesterday I spoke to NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and he \nhas informed me that the Intrepid is in good shape to be the permanent \nhangar for one of the shuttles.\n  The Intrepid is competing with museums in 25 other cities to win one \nof the shuttles, including Washington's Smithsonian National Air and \nSpace Museum.\n  NASA has been clear that they intend to award the shuttles to the \nsites where the most people could view them.\n  With the Intrepid already drawing one million visitors a year it is \nclear that the Intrepid is the best possible spot for a shuttle.\n  NASA also requires any potential host location to raise significant \nfunds.\n  I have no doubt that the Intrepid's drawing power and New York City's \ndeep and diverse philanthropic community are more than able to compile \nall the resources needed.\n  Yet skeptics may ask why a space shuttle should be brought to New \nYork City.\n  Perhaps they don't know that the Intrepid led the recovery of \nastronauts during the Mercury and Gemini programs in the 1960s.\n  The exhibit will be sure to attract heavy foot traffic too: The \nIntrepid will house the shuttle in a glass enclosure on Pier 86--close \nto Times Square and many other tourist attractions, accessible from \nmajor airports, passenger-ship terminals and highways.\n  Countless boys and girls, as well as adults, with boundless \nimaginations, will be able to stroll over to the West Side and take in \nthe truly magnificent icon of science, exploration and innovation.\n  With 20 institutions across the country competing to receive one of \nthe retired shuttles, Discovery, Endeavour and Atlantis, we should all \njoin the fight to bring a space shuttle to the greatest city in the \nworld. a no-brainer.\n  It is a non-brainer.\n  I, along with some of my New York colleagues, are working hard to \nland the shuttle here, and I hope we are able to convince NASA that we \nare ready, willing--and very able--to be the home for a shuttle.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to spend a short period of time, \nand hopefully it will not even be 5 minutes.\n  What we have seen on the floor this afternoon is a motion to \naccomplish what the chairman of the Finance Committee wanted us to \naccomplish, without adding to the debt. We did not reach agreement on \nthat motion. It was tabled. Then what we saw was a motion to proceed to \ntake care of these issues by adding $9.2 billion to the debt. That is \nthe real debate: are we going to pay for what we do? There is not an \nagreement to move forward and pay for it, and there is not an agreement \nto move forward and not pay for it.\n  There is a process here called cloture, which means that by \nWednesday, if all time is consumed, this problem would be solved and it \nwould be dealt with. It is unfortunate that the potential is that we \nmay go home and not deal with this issue, having us vote against \ntabling a motion to supply these needed priorities but also making sure \nwe do not add to the debt as we do it.\n  I look forward to the rest of the afternoon. I will not consume any \nadditional time but will note that I do not care how we pay for it as \nlong as it is legitimate, as long as we do not add to our kids' debt. I \nam hoping and willing to negotiate on any area of waste in the Federal \nGovernment that we can eliminate to pay for it. We cannot pay for part \nof it; we need to pay for all of it because we violate the principle of \nstealing from our kids.\n  I advise the Senator from Alabama that we have unanimous consent and \nI cannot break off, and the Senator from North Dakota will be \nrecognized after I yield the floor, so I cannot in good conscience \nyield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand. I am proud of the commitment the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has made and totally recognize it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a pretty disappointing thing to \nsee on the floor of the Senate--a discussion about the potential of \nhaving unemployment insurance at this point in time lapse, let it lapse \nduring one of the steepest recessions since the Great Depression.\n  Unemployment insurance is not some abstraction when we have 15 \nmillion, 16 million, 17 million people who got up this morning in this \ncountry and looked for work, people who lost their jobs and then \nsearched valiantly to find a new job and could not find a new job, and \nso they pay their rent, they buy food, they provide for their children, \nthey buy school clothes with unemployment insurance.\n  We are told: We cannot reach an agreement, so we will just let it \nexpire. We will not extend it. It will be OK.\n  It will be OK for everybody here who gets up and showers in the \nmorning and puts on a nice blue suit and comes to work. There is nobody \nhere who is unemployed, but there are a whole lot of people in this \ncountry who are unemployed.\n  If ever there were a need to extend unemployment insurance, it is \nnow. We cannot do that to the most vulnerable people in this country.\n  It is very interesting. It was not too many months ago that there was \na proposal on the floor of the Senate: Let's give $700 billion to the \nbiggest financial firms in America to bail them out. They ran this \ncountry into the ditch with unbelievable greed and speculation and \nrecklessness. Then after running this country into the economic ditch, \nthere is a bill brought to the Congress that says: We need to bail them \nout, $700 billion--a three-page bill. They said: We need to have it \npassed in 3 days--$700 billion. I did not vote for it, but there are \nplenty of people who did who now say it is too much\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\nto extend unemployment benefits to people who are out of work.\n  It is the same old story, and it has been going on for decades in \nthis country--big shots get in trouble, and you give them an aspirin, \nfluff up the pillow, put them to bed, and ask if there is anything else \nyou can do for them. Ordinary folks get in trouble, lose their job \nthrough no fault of their own, and then when push comes to shove, they \nare told: You know what, we just cannot agree. Your unemployment \ninsurance has run out. Get along. Tough luck. I find that unbelievable.\n  Let me go back. The fact is, we have budget deficits. They are \nserious, and they are unsustainable. We have to deal with them, there \nis no question about that. But it is important for us to understand how \nall of this happened.\n  Now we come to this moment, and we choose to say that unemployment \ninsurance is where we are going to make the stand. Help for people who \nhave lost their jobs--that is where we are going to make the stand.\n  It was 10 years ago on the floor of this Senate when we were told: We \nhave the first budget surplus in 30 years, and they expect budget \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see.\n  President Bush came to town and said: We are going to give large tax \ncuts, and we are going to give the biggest tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans. If you earn $1 million, guess what, we are going to give you \nsomething very special. You get an $80,000 tax cut a year.\n  I said: I will not support that. Let's be a little conservative. What \nif we do not have these budget surpluses in the outyears? What if they \ndo not exist?\n  They said: Don't worry about that, it will be fine.\n  They drove through a tax cut that benefited the wealthiest Americans. \nThen we were in a recession. Then 9/11, a war in Afghanistan, a war in \nIraq, and then supplemental after supplemental request to increase \ndefense spending, none of it paid--none of it--all of it emergency.\n  Then at the end of that period, when the biggest financial firms ran \nthis country into the ditch, the question was, What is going to happen \nto this economy? We were told: Now you have to have a $700 billion \nbailout for the biggest institutions in the country. That was done. \nNobody paid for that. That was all ladled right on top of the debt. But \ntoday, in this ``let them eat cake'' moment, we are told: No, no, let's \njust let unemployment insurance expire. Just let it expire. It will be \nfine.\n  It will be fine for everybody in this Chamber who wears a suit and \nclaims it will be fine because they are not unemployed. But what about \nthose people who are unemployed and are right at the cusp of losing \ntheir home? They have lost their job. They have lost hope. The only \nthing that keeps them going to pay the rent and to pay for food and to \ntry to help their kids is the unemployment insurance while they are \nlooking for a job. And this Congress has people who stand up to say: We \nwill not allow them to extend unemployment insurance, even after they \nvoted to give $700 billion to the biggest financial firms in America \nthat ran the country into this big economic wreck we have had. I do not \nunderstand that at all. How do you go home and tell people that is what \nyour priority is? How do you do that?\n  If there is anything that ought to represent a priority for us, it is \nto say to those who are the most vulnerable in our society, those who \nhave lost their jobs with a recession they did not create, those who \nare looking for work in the morning and cannot find it, those who now \nhave no income because they have lost their jobs, probably lost their \nhomes, and many of them lost hope--we say to them: It will be fine; you \ndo not need this money to get along.\n  Unemployment insurance is just that--it is insurance. That is why it \nis called insurance. Every one of their paychecks while they were \nworking paid for a portion of this. I just cannot believe that this \nafternoon we would decide it is not a priority for us to help the most \nvulnerable in this country, especially during this period in which we \nhave just ladled money out the door in terms of tens and tens of \nbillions of dollars in emergency funding for almost everything.\n  I held 20 hearings on the issue of waste, fraud, and abuse in \ncontracting in the war in Iraq. They threw money away. In fact, not \njust threw it away, they actually loaded $100 bills on pallets and sent \nthem over in C-130s and shoveled them out the back of pickup trucks, \nfor God's sake, wasting taxpayers' money. I did not hear anybody stand \nup on the floor and say: Here is where we draw the line. No, you draw \nthe line with the most vulnerable people. You won't notice you don't \nhave the funds to buy your food, pay your rent, or for your kids.\n  We have more responsibility than this, in my judgment.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader following consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 323, H.R. 4851, \nand that when the bill is considered, it be under the following \nlimitations: that general debate on the bill be limited to 2 hours, \nwith all time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees; that the only amendments in order be the following, \nwith no motions to commit in order, and that the amendments be subject \nto an affirmative 60-vote threshold; that if the amendments achieve \nthat threshold, then they be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that if they do not achieve that threshold, then \nthey be withdrawn: Baucus amendment, partial offset; McConnell or \ndesignee, full offset; that debate on each amendment be limited to 60 \nminutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that upon disposition of the listed amendments, the bill, as \namended, if amended, be read a third time and the Senate then proceed \nto vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, under this scenario, we will pass this \nbill and add to the debt. Because of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I regret that my Republican colleagues \nhave once again objected to giving out-of-work Americans the \nunemployment and health benefits they need.\n  Since they have evidently forgotten, I remind them that unemployment \nis high in every one of our States--it is over 13 percent in Nevada--\nand 10 percent nationwide.\n  I understand that Republicans are upset they didn't get their way. I \nknow they are disappointed that Democrats have listened to the American \npeople, and that we succeeded in finally delivering the change our \ncitizens have demanded and deserved for decades.\n  But Republicans should not take out their anger on the least \nfortunate, which is exactly what they are doing by objecting to these \nextensions. They should not kick the unemployed while they are down.\n  Several Republicans said this week that after health reform became \nlaw, they would retaliate by not cooperating with Democrats for the \nrest of this year. I will trust the American people to judge whether \nthat threat was made in their best interests or in the interests of a \npolitical party.\n  So far, Republicans have made good on that promise by refusing to let \ncommittees meet--including, inexplicably and inexcusably, a committee \nhearing yesterday on police training in Afghanistan.\n  Republicans then offered amendments to the final health bill on such \nirrelevant topics as gay marriage and foreign embassies.\n  And now they are using the unemployed as political pawns. They even \nobjected to holding a vote on their own proposal for this extension.\n  That is such an unfortunate posture, and such an irresponsible \nresponse.\n  Let us put the other side's newfound principles in perspective:\n  They refuse to pay the bill for two ongoing wars.\n  They refuse to pay the bill for entitlement expansions, like their \nprescription drug program.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n  They refuse to pay for the bill for the tax giveaways they gave to \nmultimillionaires who don't need them and didn't ask for them.\n  But while one out of 10 Americans struggles to pay his or her own \nbills while trying to find a full-time job, Republicans have suddenly \nfound religion.\n  These objections are not only disingenuous. They are dangerous.\n  I hope they can muster the compassion to help families in every one \nof our States make ends meet for just a few weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2099-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              QUORUM CALL\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have spoken with Senator Coburn, and he \nand I reached an agreement about which I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. \nbe evenly divided between his side and our side in 15-minute segments; \nthe first 15-minute segment will be for our side, the Democratic side, \nfor those Members wishing to speak in favor of the 30-day extension; \nthe next 30 minutes to Senator Coburn on the Republican side for those \nsharing his position; and the last 15 minutes back to our side until we \nreach the end of this debate at 9:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then at 9:30 p.m., there may be some procedural issues \nunrelated to the substantive issue which we will be discussing between \n8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., but that has to be worked out between both \nsides.\n  To initiate the debate on this side, I yield to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Mr. Reed, for such time as he may consume within the 15-\nminute segment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on April 5, the extension that was recently \nvoted for extended unemployment compensation benefits will expire. We \nneed to at least provide for a temporary extension while we await the \nresolution of a much broader piece of legislation that is in the House \ntoday which would provide for an extension of unemployment benefits \nfrom today until the end of the calendar year, as well as FMAP payments \nto the States and other provisions.\n  This is absolutely critical. In my home State of Rhode Island, we \nhave basically a 13-percent unemployment rate--12.7 percent. We have a \nrecord number of long-term unemployed people. This is not a situation, \nas in the past, where there was a temporary labor crisis. This has been \ngoing on in Rhode Island for almost 2 years or more, and people have \nreached the end of their resources and the end of their patience. For \nmany, the only thing that is sustaining them--and not particularly \nwell--is the fact they are still getting some unemployment benefits.\n  So we have to move very aggressively to provide a solution. We have \nnever, in the last several decades--reaching back at least as far as \nthe 1980s--denied extended unemployment benefits as long as the \nunemployment rate nationally was at least 7.4 percent. It is 10 \npercent, and in many States it is higher than that--Rhode Island being \none of those States. So this would break tradition in terms of \ndisrupting, interrupting, preventing extended benefits at a time when \nwe have 10 percent unemployment.\n  We have persistently seen this, accurately and realistically, as an \nemergency--an emergency that allows us to provide funding without \noffsets. That is something that I think still is compelling. This is an \nemergency. Perhaps one of the ironies that will take place on this \nfloor in the next several weeks is that we will call up a supplemental \nbudget from the Department of Defense which, as I understand, will not \nbe offset totally. One of the ironies is that we will be providing \nbenefits--because part of our strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq is civic \nengagement--we will be providing employment opportunities and \ninvestment in infrastructure for Afghans and Iraqis without offset, \nwhich is my understanding at the moment. The irony, of course, is that \nfor our own citizens we are claiming: No, we can't do that.\n  The other side has accumulated, under the Bush administration, a huge \ndebt. In fact, in the term of the Bush administration, the national \ndebt grew astronomically. Part of it was because repeatedly the \nRepublican side refused to provide offsets to the funding for the war \nin Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, and Medicare Part D, which was an \nentitlement payment for seniors in terms of their drug prescriptions. \nThey thought that paying for things was an undue constraint on their \nplans. But now that we are in a crisis that affects Americans, there is \nthe insistence during this emergency of paying for it, which \ncontradicts practice and contradicts the real needs out there.\n  One final point. We are now beginning to see some very limited \nprogress on the employment front. This week's report about jobs caused \na very positive reaction in the marketplace because the number of \nfirst-time claimants for unemployment compensation dropped much further \nthan they thought. That suggests we are beginning to bottom out. There \nare other reports that suggest we will see some job growth beginning. \nThat is because of the stimulus efforts we have undertaken today and in \nthe past.\n  Part of that stimulus effort has been unemployment compensation \ninsurance. For every dollar we invest in unemployment compensation, \nthere is $1.90 growth in economic activity. That is the result of \nstudies over many years. So when we don't invest in these types of \nprograms, we are not only denying sustenance to many families, we are \nalso not providing the kind of economic stimulus that the country needs \nto move forward.\n  So for all those reasons and more, I hope we can move, in the course \nof this evening or tomorrow, to adopt a measure that will allow us to \ncontinue the funding for unemployment compensation.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Illinois, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership on this issue, as well as my friend from \nRhode Island who has been such a staunch fighter, and other colleagues \non the floor.\n  I can't help but think: Here they go again. One more time we are in a \nsituation where we need to extend unemployment benefits for people who \nare out of work, through no fault of their own--breadwinners not \nbringing home the bread, through no fault of their own--and we are \nright back where we were before with the Senator from Kentucky, who \nheld up the ability for us to move forward to help families, to help \npeople who have lost their jobs or are out of work and looking for \nwork, who are caught up in an economic tsunami, an economic disaster, \nthrough no fault of their own. Here we are again.\n  We just left a debate where we went most of last night with the same \nkind of effort to block, to stall, to say no, and to try to stop us \nfrom moving ahead and doing something very important for families, \nsmall businesses, tackling the national debt in this country, and with \nhealth insurance reform. We just went through hours and hours and hours \nwith our colleagues on the other side becoming just a party of no and \nplaying games, holding up things politically, finding tricks to make \npeople vote on things they support, knowing if they do, that will stop \nus from moving forward on health insurance reform.\n\n  We finished that. We made it through. We cast the votes and achieved \nthe goal for the American people of saving money for middle-class \nfamilies, saving money for small businesses, saving money for seniors \non their medicines, and putting in place something that will make a \ndifference in bringing down cost and making sure every family can \nfinally have a family doctor. The same day we finally get through all \nthat, here we are again.\n  I come from the State with the highest unemployment in this country, \nand it is not because people in Michigan don't want to work. People in \nMichigan know how to work. They work very hard. They are out looking \nfor work. People are trying to hold it together, some with part-time \njobs right now, trying to just get through until they can get back a \njob that is going to allow them to be able to take care of their \nfamilies and have some sense of security; to stop holding their breath \nwhile they are waiting for things to turn around. But we are in a \nsituation right now where we have six people looking for every job. Six \npeople are vying for every job.\n  People are caught in an economic disaster that they didn't create, \nand our job has been to help them get through that so they can keep a \nroof over their head, food on the table, take care of their kids as we \nwork to create an economic situation, partnering with business, to turn \nthis around. Things are beginning to turn around but not fast enough \nfor any of us. We are working very hard to turn that around, but the \nreality is we still have more than 700,000 people in Michigan who have \nlost a job and who want to work. They are out of work, through no fault \nof their own, and find themselves in a situation where they are looking \nto their government to understand the situation for their family and \nplace some value on that.\n  We seem to be able to pay for things when people think it is \nimportant. I have been here long enough to live through a situation \nwhere tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans somehow were passed even \nthough they weren't paid for--and more than once. My guess is there \nwill be proposals to do it again. But when you are talking about \nsomebody who has worked all their lives and finds themselves in a \nsituation where they do not have a job because of what is happening in \nthe economy, then we say, but for you--for you--we are going to have a \ndifferent set of rules. We are going to have a different set of rules. \nWe are not going to treat this as a disaster--an economic disaster--as \nwe have at every other time in our country where we move forward with \nemergency spending. For you, because you are not as important as those \nfolks on Wall Street or the folks who got the big tax cuts, we are \ngoing to have a different set of rules.\n  Well, that is why we are here, because we don't think that is fair. \nWe don't think that is right. It is not right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as I yield the floor, I wish to say we \nare going to be here, and we are going to keep fighting over and over \nagain, as things move forward this year and beyond, on behalf of the \npeople who want a job and who don't have one today, who are counting on \nus to help them make it through this and do what they need to do to \ncare for their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan, and I \nyield the remaining time of the 15 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in talking about the \nchallenge that is faced by America's working families. Back home in \nOregon, our economy has been hit pretty hard. We have a timber \nindustry, and when you aren't building houses across the country, then \nyou can't sell lumber. So we have mills going out of business across \nthe State of Oregon and a lot of people unemployed--a lot of unemployed \npeople who would be working in the woods cutting down the trees as well \nas working in the mills. Then we have the challenge of our \nmanufacturing industry that has been hit pretty hard too. We build a \nlot of RVs and light planes, and those products aren't selling too well \nin this recession. We have a fruit industry and we have a Christmas \ntree industry. We ship a lot of that overseas, but the foreign demand \nis down, and domestic demand is down as well. We have those Mexican \ntariffs that have been applied to Christmas trees and fruit as well, \nwhich has had a pretty strong impact.\n  You pile up all of this on a State that is on the Pacific Rim and add \nto that the fact that the entire Pacific Rim economy is depressed, and \nyou have a State that not so long ago was second in the Nation only to \nMichigan in terms of unemployment.\n  Well, things have improved a little in Oregon. We are no longer \nsecond worst, partly because many other States have continued to get \nworse. We are at about 11 percent. That is just about twice the \nunemployment we had not so long ago. That is a lot of struggling \nfamilies. Unemployment is a program that helps keep the economy in gear \nduring a difficult recession. It helps break the headlong rush into a \ndepression. It helps families stabilize while they are looking for a \njob.\n  Unemployment compensation is not a sweet deal. You don't get paid a \ngreat deal with unemployment but maybe just enough to get by so your \nhouse isn't one more foreclosed property; so you are not one more \nfamily on the street, wondering where you are going to live; so there \nisn't one more set of children whose schooling has been disrupted and \ntheir path in life has been disrupted and as a parent you wonder how it \nwill impact them down the road. This is about us watching out for each \nother here in America.\n  I can tell you it has been very frustrating to me to watch Members of \nthis body during the last two administrations decide to do things in \nwhich they said: You know what, we are going to give away the Treasury \nto the wealthiest Americans, and we are not going to have any way of \npaying for it because we just to want give away money to the wealthy. \nSo the wealthy are doing very well in America. But what about the \nworkers in our Nation? The average compensation for a working family \nplateaued the year I graduated from high school--1974. During the 36 \nyears since, working families have been earning the same amount. Yet \nthe productivity of our Nation has gone up enormously. Where did all \nthat wealth go? All that wealth went to the wealthiest Americans. Then \nmy colleagues across the aisle are going to stand up tonight and self-\nrighteously proclaim we should not do this without paying.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. We need to extend this unemployment for working \nfamilies, not kick them when they are down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think we had an agreement with the majority whip that\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nsome unanimous consent requests would come in; is that correct? I will \nbe happy to yield out of our time to the majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am now going to be asking unanimous \nconsent that would extend the unemployment benefits for an additional \n30 days. I make it formally in this form.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 323, H.R. 4851, to provide a temporary \nextension of certain programs; that the bill be read three times, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding if \nwe were to do that we would add $9.2 billion to the debt. I am \nwondering if that is correct. The same unanimous consent request was \nasked earlier today, and the head of the Finance Committee said it \nwould add $9.2 billion to the debt. So given the fact that it will add \nto the debt rather than us making choices, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate so much Senator Coburn's \nleadership on this very important matter. I think we are at a defining \nmoment. I take offense for those who say we have no interest in \nextending unemployment insurance. My State has high unemployment. We \nwere doing very well, and it has doubled now from where we were in \nunemployment.\n  My home area is one of the worst in the State. I am well aware of \nthat. Members of the Senate on this side of the aisle strongly favor \nextending unemployment insurance and actually extending other benefits, \ntoo, such as the doctors fix that we need to do, the COBRA and FMAP and \nmatters of that kind which are in the legislation and we believe should \nbe passed into law. There is just one thing that I would raise, and \nthat is that we want it to be in a way that does not increase, again, \nthe debt because here we go again.\n  Our colleagues passed an amendment, passed the pay-go law a few weeks \nago, and within a few days they were violating it. This violates it \nagain. What we need to ask ourselves, then, is how we are going to help \npeople who are in need. Are we going to do it in a responsible way or \nwill we take the easy way out, pass the debt on to our children and \ngrandchildren without the least concern, it seems, about how we are \ngoing to pay for it?\n  My colleague just recently said we should call it an emergency. \nUnemployment insurance is fundamentally one of our established \ngovernment programs, he said, because that allows us to provide this \nbenefit without an offset. That is precisely what the deal is, you \nunderstand. He was quite honest about it. We do not have to pay for it; \nwe don't have to look for money; we don't have to cut waste, fraud, and \nabuse; we don't have to reach into the stimulus bill that we passed, \nwhich was announced to be for unemployment insurance as one of its \nprimary motives and use that money that is unspent--and $100 billion or \n$200 billion still remains unspent. Why don't we use that money? It \nwould not then increase the debt larger than we now have.\n  We proposed a number of other offsets, offsets that our Democratic \ncolleagues have utilized in legislation they have offered. We have \nsuggested to our colleagues, what other containment of spending would \nyou propose, and we would be willing to consider if you would use that \nto pay for this. But the day of just continuing to increase our debt is \npassed.\n  This Senate needs to face the truth, and the truth is we will double \nthe entire debt of the United States in 5 years, ending 2013. We will \ntriple the entire debt of the United States in 2019. In 2019 the \ninterest on the debt that we will be paying in that 1 year will be $800 \nbillion. Just last year the interest on the total debt of the United \nStates was $170 billion. We cannot continue this. Every economist who \nhas ever testified before our Budget Committee has said repeatedly this \nis unsustainable. When do we stop if it is unsustainable? Members of \nour Senate say it is unsustainable, on both sides of the aisle. When do \nwe stop?\n  Senator Coburn had the courage to say: Now, we can pay for this. We \nhave moneys unspent that we can use to pay for the extension of \nunemployment insurance, and we will not agree that we will just add \nmore to our debt.\n  I have in my pocket, I just happened to notice, pictures of three of \nmy grandchildren. I have had three--one born in November, one born 2 \nweeks ago, one born Sunday. We are talking about hundreds of thousands \nof dollars that they are going to have to pay off.\n  It is an addiction and a habit that we must break. This is $9 billion \nadded to the debt. I hope and pray this courage by Senator Coburn that \ncalls us to account and says let's face the music and let's be honest \nwith ourselves is respected, as I respect it. I think the American \npeople respect it. When I am out talking in my townhall meetings and in \nmy communities and in the airplanes, they tell me: You guys are \nspending recklessly. We can't believe it. What has happened?\n  The American people understand we cannot do this. There is no free \nlunch. Nothing comes from nothing. Somebody pays, and we cannot just \nspend and take the easy way every time without facing the consequences \nof a debt that we create. When we spend more than we take in, we borrow \nthe money. We borrow it on the open market and we pay interest on the \ndebt.\n  I want to say my Democratic colleagues are at it again, spending more \nand not paying for it. Have the Republicans failed in their \nresponsibility when they had the Presidency and a majority in the \nSenate? Yes, we should have done much better. But we have never seen \nthe deficits we are seeing today--never, ever.\n  President Bush had a record deficit of $450 billion his last year in \noffice. This year, ending September 30, it was $1.4 trillion--$1,400 \nbillion--three times. This year, when September 30 arrives, our budget \nexperts tell us our annual deficit for this 1 year will be $1.5 \ntrillion, and we will average $1 trillion a year for the years to come, \nmore than twice the highest deficit we have ever had. We cannot do \nthat. This is serious business.\n  I hope and pray the stimulus package will give us some benefit. I \nknow it will. When we spend $800 billion, every penny of it is \nborrowed, to be paid back someday, or the interest paid back by our \nchildren or grandchildren. This stimulus package, hopefully, will give \nus some lift, but we will carry the debt.\n  Do you know what the Congressional Budget Office told us when they \nanalyzed the $800 billion stimulus package? They said: Yes, it will \nprovide a benefit for a few years. You will get a lift in the economy. \nBut over 10 years, just over 10 years, it will have a net negative to \nthe economy, a slight negative because you have to carry this debt, and \nit is crowding out private sector borrowing because the government \nborrowed it first. The government has to pay interest to all these \npeople around the world who loan us this money.\n  There is no easy way out of this. It is time for us to be mature and \ngrown up and make good decisions. It is time to say no to this \nlegislation unless it is paid for, and we can pay for it. There are \nplenty of places in our budget it can be paid for.\n  I thank colleagues for allowing me to share these thoughts. I thank \nSenator Coburn for raising this important issue, for his courage in \nsaying it is time to do better. We can do better. We can do this in the \nright way. We came close tonight to getting it done, I thought, in a \npaid-for way--so close. If we stand in there, maybe in a week or 2 we \nwill be able to take care of the unemployment insurance and pay for it \nin a sound way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise tonight and follow, \nfirst of all, Senator Sessions. He has come to the floor many times on \nthis issue and talked about the crisis that is building in our Nation \nrelative to the spending and the debt. He always speaks with such \neloquence.\n  I also want to say thank you to my colleague, Senator Coburn, for \ngiving me an opportunity to come down tonight and offer a few thoughts \nin the\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\ntime that we have. I appreciate it immensely.\n  Senator Coburn puts himself in a very difficult situation by standing \non principle because, of course, he makes himself a target of somebody \nwho wants to say he is not caring about the people who are out there \nand looking for work. I know him and very much that is the opposite. \nBut here is the point. Here is what we are facing in this Nation. We \nare literally getting to a stage in our history where the cascading \namount of debt is like a huge snowball that now is gaining enormous \nmomentum as it comes down the mountain. It is just growing bigger and \nbigger.\n  I am going to head back home to Nebraska tomorrow. I am going to have \nan opportunity to get across the State. I have some--we call them \ncommunity coffees but townhall meetings. I am going to talk to the \npeople of Nebraska. I will guarantee that one of the first things on \ntheir agenda will be to raise concern about the spending and the debt \nthey see going on here in Washington.\n  Let me, if I might, take a moment and talk about the ethic of the \nState that I come from because I think it is enormously important in \nterms of what we are doing. I might add, I have had an opportunity as \ncounty commissioner, as city council member, a mayor, and a Governor to \nrepresent this great State.\n  In my job as mayor of Lincoln, I was a strong mayor, so I was the guy \nresponsible for the budget. Here is how we did it. There was only so \nmuch money that was available, and what we would do is we would put a \nlist down, page after page, of very important priorities for the \ncommunity. At some point on this list there would be a line drawn and \nmy budget director would say to me: Mayor, if you want to go below that \nline and fund some of these other important priorities, you are going \nto have to look above that line and figure out what you can live \nwithout because it is at this line that we have to quit spending. \nOtherwise, our bond rating will be in jeopardy. Otherwise, the economic \nstability of this community will be in jeopardy.\n  You know what. We made some very hard choices. We had some things we \nwould have loved to have done, but we began to realize we just couldn't \nfit them into the budget.\n  Then I had the good fortune of becoming the Governor of the State of \nNebraska, and it didn't change anything. The Nebraska Constitution says \nwe can only borrow $50,000. Maybe at some point in our State's history \nthat was a handsome sum of money, but in effect what the constitution \nsays is we cannot borrow money.\n  While other Governors were balancing budgets by issuing bonds and \ndebt, we did not have that alternative. I had really three choices: \nraise taxes, which I did not like and opposed, cut spending, or do \nboth. And I cut spending.\n  You could look at many places in that budget and say, well, Mike, why \ndid you choose this versus that? And you could have a great debate \nabout why this priority versus that priority. But in the end, what we \nwere doing was trying to choose the priorities for our State without \nborrowing money, without putting our State in debt, while maintaining \neconomic stability.\n  I want to share that our State has fared as well as any State in the \ncountry during this very tough economic time. Our unemployment rate is \nabout 4\\1/2\\ percent. We value our businesses, we create jobs, and we \ndo not spend money we do not have.\n  I came out here a year ago--a little more than a year ago--to join \nthe Senate. I am as proud today as I was then to be here on the Senate \nfloor. But here is what I will tell you: I am worried about where we \nare headed with this budget. You see, this $9 billion is very \nmanageable. We want to provide unemployment insurance to the people who \nneed it. We all do. We want to help these people. But we have a \nmultitrillion-dollar budget here, and in effect what we are saying to \nthe American people is that we cannot find $9 billion to offset the \ncost of that.\n  We can do better than that because, if that is what we are \nacknowledging, that we cannot find $9 billion to offset the cost of \nthat important priority, then, my goodness, how will we ever deal with \na budget deficit that is over $1 trillion annually--annually--as far as \nthe eye can see.\n  I see I am running out of time, but I want to end with this thought. \nI had a wonderful group of schoolkids from Nebraska in today, from \nSuperior, NE. I have been to Superior many times. It is a great \ncommunity. And these kids are great kids. As I was talking about the \nvarious things that had happened here, I said something to them that I \nhope made the point of the need to take responsible action on this \nbudget. I said this year I will celebrate my 60th birthday. God will \nnot keep me on this Earth long enough to pay the debt that has been \nincurred.\n  It is no consolation to Nebraskans that I go home and say to them: I \nhave been here over a year, and I figured out who is at fault, because, \nyou know what, they are not caring about who is at fault. They are \nsaying: Mike, we elected you to go back there and lend your voice to \ntry to fix these problems.\n  It will be of no consolation for me to go home and say, well, it was \nthe Democrats or it was the Republicans. It will be no consolation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell.) The Senator has used the time \nthat has been yielded to him.\n  Mr. COBURN. I continue to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I said to those kids: I will not be on Earth long enough \nto pay this debt. I said to them: That means that will fall to you.\n  Do you know what I am saying to those kids? I am saying that the \nquality of their lives will be impacted by the fact that we could not \ntake responsible action to deal with this debt.\n  I would like to say to them: You will not have any more wars. But \nthey will have their own wars to fight. They will have their own \npandemics to deal with. They will have their own recessions they have \nto somehow fund and finance. And they will have their own challenges \nthey will have to deal with. You know what. If we do not start coming \nto grips with this debt, they will not have the resources to manage \ntheir way through those challenges.\n  You see, tonight is not about unemployment insurance. We want to help \nthose people. Tonight is about making the statement that we have to \ntake control of this because it is taking control of the future of \nthose young people.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time to Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will consume the remainder of our time.\n  I thank Senator Johanns and Senator Sessions for being here.\n  We have heard the word ``emergency.'' The emergency that is in front \nof us is, we are a boat upside down fiscally, and there has to be a set \nof competing priorities for how we right that boat. But the No. 1 way \nwe do not right the boat is to continue to add to the debt when we have \nprograms that are not working and are wasting money, that are consuming \nprecious resources we need to spend in other areas.\n  I am particularly interested in the very fast revisionist history \nthat has been presented by the Senator from Michigan.\n  Let me tell you what happened here today. What happened here today \nwas that a bill was offered and a motion to proceed on a bill that \nwould accomplish this was totally paid for. That motion was tabled, \nwith all of the Republican Senators voting against that, and some \nDemocrats. We worked, through the next couple of hours, negotiating \nwith the majority leader, with great help from Senator Durbin, the \nsenior Senator from Michigan, and a compromise was reached that we \nwould, in fact, make sure no interruption would happen over the next 2 \nweeks to those who are dependent on unemployment insurance. That was \ncommunicated to the House of Representatives and the majority there, \nand it was rejected.\n  Then the final thing that happened is we had an adjournment \nresolution, for which everyone on our side of the aisle voted against \nto stay here. Now, that probably was not a truly sincere vote. I would \nput that out to my colleagues. But the fact is, the Senate does not \nhave to go home. And the reflection for this not passing should not \nfall on the Senate; it should fall on the fact that the Senate came \ntogether and agreed on a solution that was not acceptable to the \nleadership in the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\n  So if there is a problem with what we have done today, it is that \nwhen we compromised in the Senate, the House would not take it. And we \ndid compromise. We compromised on spending. We compromised on time. We \ncompromised on making sure the people who needed to have this extension \nwere going to get it.\n  I started out the debate earlier today on the basis of, where are we \ngoing in our country and what is our problem? Our problem is that we \nare drowning in debt, that our foreign policy is affected by it today, \nour ability to borrow is affected by it, and the manipulation of our \nability to stabilize our own economy is affected by it. But, most \nimportantly, what we do today has dramatic impact on those who know us.\n  It is unfortunate that we did not work out a deal tonight. So we are \ngoing to have a week of exposure for people who actually need the help. \nIt is actually going to be harder on the bureaucrats to handle this. \nBut it did not happen.\n  But I think the bigger question is, Should we just lay down and add \nmore money to the debt because we could not get agreement across the \nCapitol? And so what we are going to do, when we come back, the day \nafter we get back, we are going to have a cloture vote, which I think \nwill be very difficult to achieve, but it may be achieved, because the \nsame principle is going to lie here.\n  With over $300 billion worth of waste, fraud, and duplication in the \nFederal budget every year, there are many of us who believe sincerely \nthat it is time to stop spending money on lower priorities, time to \nstop calling things an emergency when we actually have the money in \nwaste and fraud and duplication that we can use to pay for this.\n  We needed to start somewhere. The unfortunate aspect that we did not \naccomplish that this evening means some people will suffer. But I want \nyou to contrast that with what the suffering is going to be in 2019 \nwithin our country when we have double-digit interest rates because we \ncan no longer maintain our borrowing; when we are, in the next 9 years, \ngoing to pay $5.6 trillion in interest on $9.8 trillion we are going to \nborrow. Of that $9.8 trillion, $5.6 trillion is going to be interest \npayments.\n  What is coming is a tsunami to our country. So I feel a failure \ntonight because I could not accomplish both goals, both protecting our \nchildren and their future opportunity and taking care of those who need \nus right now. But the principle is still there.\n  We have to, in fact, start making tough choices. If we learn to do \nthat together, the country benefits. And the future of our children is \nat hand. But we can no longer make the decision that we steal from our \nchildren to take care of things we are responsible for today. And I \nunderstand the resistance to that, but the fact is, our future depends \non us starting today. It does not matter if you are liberal in \nphilosophy or conservative in philosophy, the economics will be borne \nhome to everyone. It has to stop. And we have to start with us.\n  I appreciate the congeniality of my friend from Illinois. Tough week \nfor us all--probably more tough for us than you. I congratulate you on \nyour victory on the yearlong battle with a difference in philosophy on \nhow we fix health care. But I know that 20 years from now, the Senator \nfrom Illinois and I will suffer the same pain if our kids are \ndiminished by our lack of action here. So I will say, let's let it not \nbe so. Let's let it not be so. Let's start making hard choices. Let's \nstart doing what is in the best long-term interests of our country.\n  With that, I yield back a minute of our time to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \nprofessionalism and his own decorum during the course of this debate. \nWe want to maintain that on this side of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2104-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION ACT OF 2019\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senators who spoke \nbefore him are obviously right. This country has a record-breaking \ndeficit, a huge national debt, and it is an issue that has to be dealt \nwith. The debate is, how do we deal with it? Let me very briefly \nmention some of the factors--not all, but some of the factors, some of \nthe policies that got us into the national debt situation we are in \nright now. Six years ago or so, President Bush decided to take us to \nwar in Iraq. That war was misguided. It was a mistake. But in terms of \nthe issue of tonight, that war was not paid for and will end up costing \nthis country some $2 or $3 trillion. Many of my friends on the other \nside who now decry the national debt voted for that war without \nworrying about how it was going to be paid for.\n  During the Bush era, despite the growing gap between the very \nwealthiest people and everybody else, our Republican friends, who then \ncontrolled the House, the Senate, and the White House, decided that the \nvery richest people, millionaires and billionaires, needed huge tax \nbreaks, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. That is what \nthey wanted. I didn't want it. I didn't vote for it.\n  During the Bush era, we passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug \nbill, a huge bill written by the insurance companies. We could have had \na much better bill, if we negotiated prices with the pharmaceutical \nindustry. We chose not to do that. A prescription drug Part D bill, \nunpaid for. That is what they voted for.\n  After the bailout, after the collapse of Wall Street, President Bush \nand others came together and said: We ought to bail them out. Unpaid \nfor. I brought an amendment on the floor to pay for that. It fell. \nUnpaid for.\n  Ironically, within the next couple of weeks or months--I am not sure \nwhich--many of our friends are going to come back to the floor and say: \nWe need to loosen up the estate tax. We need to give massive tax breaks \nto the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 percent of the population, the very \nrichest people in the country. Estimates are it is going to cost $350 \nbillion over 10 years, giving it to the richest people.\n  My point is, if we are going to deal seriously with our national debt \nand our deficit--enormous problems--let's be honest and let us get our \npriorities right.\n  In terms of today's debate, let us not on the one hand say we are \ngoing to give massive tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires by \nloosening up on the estate tax, but today we cannot regard as an \nemergency situation extending unemployment compensation to people who \nare in desperate economic trouble.\n  Since December of 2007, over 8 million Americans have lost their \njobs. Sixteen-and-a-half percent of the American workforce is today \neither unemployed or underemployed. Here is the important point. Over 6 \nmillion Americans have been out of work for more than 6 months, the \nhighest on record. What we are experiencing now is not only \nunacceptably high unemployment but a level of long-term unemployment \nthis country has never seen before. In other words, people are losing \ntheir jobs, but they are not getting them back, not in 2 weeks, not in \n4 weeks. Month after month people are wondering how they are going to \nget a job, how they will feed their family, how they will take care of \nbasic needs. That is what we are talking about today.\n  When we talk about deficit reduction and dealing with the national \ndebt, in my view we don't do that by denying unemployment benefits to \nfamilies in desperate need. I think we take into consideration the \nreality that the top 1 percent of this country now earns more income \nthan the bottom 50 percent. And those very same people, the top 1 \npercent, over the last number of years have been given huge amounts in \ntax breaks. We take into consideration the fact that as a nation, we \nare spending a very significant and growing amount of money on the \nmilitary. There is study after study which indicates there are \nsignificant amounts of money that can be saved, if we take a hard look \nat military spending, including a number of weapons systems that are \nnot designed to fight international terrorism but to continue the \neffort in the Cold War which no longer exists.\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\n  It seems to me we have two issues we have to address. No. 1, how do \nwe create the jobs this country desperately needs? How do we protect \nthe most vulnerable people? And simultaneously, how do we address the \ndeficit crisis and our national debt?\n  I suggest now is the time to rethink the priorities that have existed \nfor a number of years. Now is the time to ask the wealthiest people to \nstart paying their fair share of taxes. Now is the time to take a hard \nlook at all of our Federal agencies for waste and fraud and abuse but \nalso including the military.\n  The issue is not whether we deal with the national debt and our \ndeficit. The question is, how we do it, and how we do it in a way that \nprotects the middle class and some of the most vulnerable people in \nsociety.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont and those who are \ngathered this evening. This was such an important day. Some in this \nChamber may have heard some cheering in the hall. I believe that \nsignifies that the House of Representatives has finally passed the \nreconciliation bill which passed this Chamber earlier this afternoon. \nNow health care reform, with its improvements, is on its way to being \nsigned by the President and becoming the law of the land. It is a day \nof great celebration for those of us who had the privilege and honor to \nvote for it but to participate as well in the difficult task of putting \nthis bill together--a controversial bill; lots of people hate it; lots \nof people love it across America. Many of us believe it is an \nextraordinary improvement. It is progress in America. It will give \nfamilies across America a fighting chance to get health insurance they \ncan afford, to be able to fight the health insurance companies that \nturn them down when they need it the most.\n  Thirty million Americans will have health insurance who don't have it \ntoday. It is going to give seniors on Medicare better assistance to pay \nfor their prescription drugs. It is a plus in many directions.\n  We left the euphoria and happiness of that moment on the floor, when \nthey announced the vote of 56 to 43, and within minutes, we were told \nthere is another battle. This time the Republicans have come to the \nfloor and refused to extend unemployment benefits to those unemployed \nin America. The date that occurs is April 5. In State after State, \nhundreds and then thousands of people will see their unemployment \nchecks stop. These are people who lost a job and they can't find one. \nWe estimate there are five unemployed people for every available job. I \nhave met with the unemployed in my State. They are desperate. They have \ntried everything they could think of. We think our economy is starting \nto turn but not quickly enough for them. Out of work for weeks, months, \nsometimes years, they have exhausted their savings. They are living \nliterally hand to mouth. Some have lost their health insurance. The \nonly thing that keeps them going, that keeps the lights on and the food \non the table, is the unemployment check.\n  The Republicans came to the floor today and said: Cut it off. They \nsaid cut it off, because they believe this is the moment and this is \nthe issue to take a stand against the national deficit.\n  Do we have a national debt that should concern us all? Of course. The \ndeficit we have is growing because of the recession, unemployment, \nfewer tax revenues by the government, and we understand that. Should we \ndeal with it? Of course. But it is interesting that these Republicans \nwould take their stand on fiscal conservatism and deficit reduction \nwhen it comes to unemployment benefits.\n  Twenty-four hours ago, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican, \nfloor manager for their side, offered an amendment on the floor to the \nreconciliation bill to pay for the compensation of doctors treating \npatients under Medicare. It added $65 billion to the deficit, and it \nwas not paid for. Every Republican voted for it. I think it is a good \nthing to do. It is a policy we should support, because we want doctors \nto treat Medicare patients. But how can these same Republican Senators \nignore the fact that they voted to do so last night and then come here \ntonight and say: Unemployment benefits for a month in America? That \nwill cost $9 billion. It is time to take a stand against the deficit. \nSixty-five billion last night, these same Senators voted to add to the \ndeficit; $9 billion for the unemployed today, they say, is the straw \nthat broke the camel's back.\n  This is unfair and unfortunate. Here is what we know. Every dollar in \nan unemployment compensation check that goes to an unemployed person is \nspent directly into the economy. The CBO says there is no faster and \nbetter way to inject billions of dollars into the economy that \ntranslates into the purchase of goods and services, helping small \nbusinesses and creating jobs. For the question of economic development, \nunemployment compensation is the most valuable thing to do. What \nhappens to these poor people when we cut off their unemployment \ncompensation? I am not sure where they will go.\n  Bill from Illinois writes: I have been unemployed as a steel salesman \nsince June of 2009. I am sitting in the Naperville library, as I do \nevery day, applying for jobs on line. And still no luck. I will be \nruined financially if you stop my unemployment benefits. Please extend \nthem.\n  Elliot from Illinois writes: As a citizen of the United States and a \nU.S. Navy veteran, I cannot believe the Senate would let unemployment \nfunding stop for the millions of people struggling to make ends meet. \nJust one unemployment check not processing will hurt thousands of \npeople and, with the lack of life-supporting employment, will push a \nbunch of folks closer to the edge of foreclosure and other losses.\n  I acknowledge this deficit and this debt and what we need to do about \nit. This issue is a defining issue for this Congress and this Nation. \nIf we have reached the point that we will turn around and walk away \nfrom those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, if \nwe will turn a blind eye to families who are doing without the basics \nof life, if we believe this is the best fiscal policy for America, then \nwe have lost our way. We are a caring nation. We care for one another. \nWe are a community, a community that reaches out, through the taxes we \npay and the good deeds that many do, to help the less fortunate. Yet \nwhen it comes to unemployment benefits, the Republican Senators have \nsaid: This is where we make our stand. This is where we enforce our \ndeficit.\n\n  Well, I think they have taken off and created more victims in our \neconomy at a time when so many have lost their jobs.\n  I looked at the States represented by the Republican Senators who \nspoke earlier today. The Senator from Nebraska is fortunate in one \nrespect. His State has an unemployment rate of 4.6 percent. The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, he, too, is fortunate. His State has an unemployment \nrate of 6.7 percent. My State is up at 12 percent unemployment, and \nothers such as Michigan are over 14 percent unemployment.\n  This is a crisis in our State, and it is a crisis that will be made \nworse when these checks are cut off. I would urge my colleagues to view \nthis unemployment benefit request as the emergency that it is. If \nnations can rise to the occasion of disasters--unanticipated \ncalamities, natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes--if we can \nview those as emergencies, shouldn't we look at the hurricanes that \nhave hit the lives of those unemployed Americans and be ready to stand \nby their side?\n  I hope when we return after the break over Easter and have our chance \nto vote, we can finally bring forward enough moderate Republicans on \nthat side of the aisle to join us and say: Yes, we need to fight the \ndeficit, but let's not do it at the expense of the neediest people in \nAmerica.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor at this time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to sound an alarm about a \nthreat to coal-mining businesses in Kentucky. Coal is a vital part of \nmy State's economy, and a vital part of America's energy portfolio. The \ncoal industry creates over 60,000 jobs in Kentucky, including \napproximately 15,000 coal miners. More than half the country's \nelectricity is generated by coal, electricity those workers help \ngenerate.\n  But this important sector of the economy now faces a back-door \nattempt to restrict coal mining, one that was implemented without a \nhearing or a vote by this administration's Environmental Protection \nAgency. The EPA is overstepping its authority by using an approval \nprocess meant to assess the environmental impact of mining operations \nas a means to halt those mining operations altogether.\n  According to one study by the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, it could be estimated that roughly 3,500 mining jobs in \nKentucky are in jeopardy if the EPA does not let go its stranglehold on \nthe growth of that industry. And mining industry jobs are not the only \njobs lost thanks to this wrongheaded, bureaucratic overregulation. For \nevery coal-mining job, 11 other jobs are dependent on it. That means up \nto 38,500 jobs in my State alone could be affected.\n  Let me give a concrete example of how what the EPA is doing directly \naffects jobs. Out of 49 Kentucky applicants for permits under section \n404 of the Clean Water Act, only one application--that is right, one--\nis actually under review. 1 out of 49. Actually, that should be 1 out \nof 42 because seven applicants were kept waiting so long by the EPA's \nfoot-dragging tactic that they had no choice but to withdraw their \napplications.\n  After all, during this whole length of time that the EPA unfairly \nprolongs the process, mine operators must still spend resources to keep \ntheir mines ready to operate. Eventually paying these costs while \nearning no profit in return forces many of these businesses to just \ngive up.\n  While the rest of the permits are technically pending a review, in \nreality they are in limbo and essentially dead as long as the EPA \nrefuses to even begin its official review process. This ``run out the \nclock'' tactic is bad news for Kentucky's economy.\n  I know I don't have to tell my colleagues we are in a recession. \nUnemployment is higher than any of us would like it to be. In Kentucky \nit is 10.5 percent, higher than the national average. My highest \npriority as the Senator from Kentucky is to help everyone from my State \nwho wants a job to find one.\n  That is why I must speak out against what the EPA is doing. Their \nattack on an important Kentucky industry hampers the growth of jobs, \nand it especially hampers the growth of small businesses--the greatest \nengines of job creation.\n  The EPA has turned the section 404 permitting process, already a \ncumbersome process to begin with, into an illegitimate, backdoor means \nof shutting down Kentucky coal mines. This is outside the scope of \ntheir authority and the law. It represents a fundamental departure from \nthe permitting process as originally envisioned by Congress.\n  This Senate needs to make it clear to the EPA that they must complete \nthe permit review process in a timely manner, and provide complete \ntransparency along the way to all sides. They cannot continue to impose \na backdoor ban on mining operations in Kentucky through an illegitimate \nprocess.\n  Let me add one more thing. The section 404 permit review process is \nonly one aspect of the EPA's war on coal. They are also seeking to \nimpose a backdoor national energy tax by regulating carbon dioxide \nemissions from coal plants under the Clean Air Act, which will hurt our \neconomy and endanger millions of jobs across the country. The Senate \nwill have an opportunity to vote on the EPA's actions in that regard in \nthe near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2107-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MINIMUM ESSENTIAL COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, concerns have been raised to me about a technical \nerror in the health care reform bill that was recently passed, the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590. In drafting the \nPPACA, a provision was included which designates health care provided \nunder VA's authority as meeting the minimum required health care \ncoverage that an individual is required to maintain.\n  However, due to the way this exemption was worded, this definition \nmay exclude children with spina bifida, who are seriously disabled and \nto whom VA provides reimbursement for comprehensive health care. The \nunderlying bill gave authority to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to designate other care, which could include the VA spina \nbifida program, as meeting the definition of minimum essential \ncoverage. This bill would simply clarify what was originally intended.\n  Chapter 18 of title 38 contains the Spina Bifida Health Care Program, \nwhichis a health benefit program administered by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to provide reimbursement for comprehensive health care \nfor children with spina bifida who are born to veterans of the Vietnam \nWar and to some veterans who served in Korea during specified times, as \nwell as children of women Vietnam veterans with certain birth defects. \nThe program provides reimbursement for medical services and supplies.\n  My legislation corrects this small error. Additionally, this \nlegislation would clarify that recipients of CHAMPVA would also be \nconsidered as meeting the requirement for minimum essential coverage. \nThis legislation is currently supported by 59 cosponsors, including my \nfriend from North Carolina, and the ranking member on my Committee, \nSenator Burr. Additionally, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, and the Military Officers Association of America \nhave endorsed this bill.\n  Thank you, Madam President and I thank my colleagues for their \nsupport in making this small but important clarification for veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2107-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2107-S2108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             chief special warfare operator adam lee brown\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Madam President, the U.S. Senate recently approved a 1-\nyear extension of the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act with a \nvoice vote. The extension was subsequently approved by the House and \nsigned into law by President Obama. As I have argued for years that the \nPatriot Act is in need of serious reform, I would like to outline the \nchanges I will keep working for as a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Many of my colleagues who agree with me that reforms are needed think \nit would be difficult to have a constructive debate on domestic \nsurveillance in the Senate right now. They think that next year will be \na better time to have this debate, and that waiting will lead to a \nbetter opportunity to restore the best possible balance between \nfighting terrorism ferociously and protecting American rights and \nfreedoms.\n  Personally, I think that the reforms I am outlining today should have \nbeen made years ago. But based on the debate on the Patriot Act that \ntook place in the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, I agree that \nthose of us who believe in reform need to spend more time making our \ncase to our colleagues and the American people. So I will briefly \naddress those reforms that I think are necessary, and the ways that I \nwould like to see this debate move forward between now and next \nFebruary, when these provisions will come up for renewal again.\n  The three expiring provisions all involve domestic surveillance in \none way or another. One regards the use of roving wiretaps for \nintelligence purposes, one regards the surveillance of so-called ``lone \nwolf'' terrorist suspects, and one involves government access to \nbusiness records. I have cosponsored legislation that would create \nadditional safeguards on the use of roving wiretaps, and I think that \nit is appropriate to debate whether the ``lone wolf'' statute should be \nreformed or repealed, particularly given the fact that it has never \nbeen used. But it is the business records provision, section 215 of the \nPatriot Act, which I believe is most in need of reform.\n  Section 215 of the Patriot Act is referred to as the ``business \nrecords'' provision, but it actually covers any personal information \nthat is held by any sort of institution or third party--including \nbanks, hospitals, libraries, and retail stores of all types. And it \ndoesn't just apply to documents; it applies to ``any tangible thing'', \nwhich means it covers things like blood or tissue samples as well.\n  Prior to 9/11, if the FBI or another government agency was conducting \nan intelligence investigation and wanted to obtain an individual's \npersonal records from the business or institution that was holding \nthem, the government agency had to have evidence indicating that the \nperson whose records they wanted was a terrorist or a spy. Section 215 \nof the Patriot Act lowered this standard to permit the government to \ncollect any records deemed ``relevant to an investigation''.\n  ``Relevant'' is an incredibly broad standard. In fact, it could \npotentially permit the government to collect the personal information \nof large numbers of law-abiding Americans who have no connection to \nterrorism whatsoever.\n  As an alternative to ``relevance'', I and other senators have \nadvocated for what I call the ``nexus to terrorism'' standard. Under \nthis standard, the government could use the Patriot Act to obtain any \nrecords pertaining to a terrorist suspect, or the suspect's activities, \nor any individual that the suspect has been in contact with or directly\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\nlinked to in any way. This is a much broader standard than the one that \nexisted before 9/11, and it would give the FBI and other government \nagencies significant flexibility in terrorism investigations. But it is \nmuch tighter than the standard that is currently written into law as \npart of the Patriot Act, and it would greatly reduce potential \nintrusions on the privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  Switching to a ``nexus to terrorism'' standard is not a radical \nproposal. In 2005, the Senate passed a bill that would have replaced \nthe ``relevance'' standard with one requiring a ``nexus to terrorism''. \nIn fact, this bill was passed by unanimous consent. And President Obama \ncosponsored similar legislation in 2007. So this proposal has received \nsignificant bipartisan support in the past. And in my judgment, it \nwould go a long, long way toward restoring the balance between security \nand freedom that is so important to Americans.\n  I have cosponsored legislation that would make ``nexus to terrorism'' \nthe standard for accessing individuals' business records for \nintelligence purposes. Over the next year, I will continue to argue for \nthe merits of this standard. I will also continue to press for more \ntransparency about how the Patriot Act has actually been interpreted \nand applied in practice. As I have said before, there is key \ninformation that is relevant to the debate on the Patriot Act that is \ncurrently classified. Over the past two and a half years, I have \npressed the executive branch to declassify this information in a \nresponsible way, so that members of Congress and the public can have an \ninformed debate about what the law should actually be.\n  I have raised this issue numerous times, in classified letters and in \nmeetings with high-level Administration officials. Many of these \nclassified letters were also signed by other senators, including \nSenator Feingold and Senator Durbin. In a partial response to our \nrequests, the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence have prepared a classified paper that contains details \nabout how some of the Patriot Act's authorities have actually been \nused, and this paper is now available to all members of Congress, who \ncan read it in the Intelligence Committee's secure office spaces.\n  Providing this classified paper to Congress is a good first step, and \nI would certainly encourage all of my colleagues to come down to the \nIntelligence Committee and read it, but by itself this step does not go \nnearly far enough. Ensuring that members of Congress have information \nabout how the law has been interpreted and applied is obviously \nessential, but it is just as essential for the public to have this \ninformation as well. Most members of the public do not expect to have \ndetailed information about how intelligence collection is actually \nconducted, but they do expect to understand the boundaries of what the \nlaw does and does not allow, so that they can ratify or reject the \ndecisions that public officials make on their behalf.\n  I am particularly concerned about this because I believe that there \nis a discrepancy between what most Americans believe is legal and what \nthe government is actually doing under the Patriot Act. In my view, any \ndiscrepancy of this sort is intolerable and untenable, and can only be \nfixed by greater transparency and openness. This is why I think it is \nso important for the executive branch to declassify the information \nthat I have asked them to take action on.\n  I expect that convincing the executive branch to take decisive action \non this issue will not be easy, and that it will not happen quickly. \nBut I have been engaged on this issue for two and a half years already, \nso I think it should be clear by now that I do not intend to give up. \nAs Congress prepares to resume debate on the Patriot Act next year, I \nwill continue to press the administration to find a way to release this \ninformation in a manner that serves the public interest and does not \nharm national security. And I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nthis effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2109-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to address \ntransparency concerns with the Independent Payment Advisory Board \nestablished in H.R. 3590.\n  As Medicare enrollment grows, the issue of cost-containment becomes \nmore pressing. To address this issue the Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard was included as part of health reform legislation. The Board's \ntask is to slow the rate of growth in the Medicare Program--a goal \nwhich is important if the program is going to remain solvent for years \nto come. It has been suggested that this Board will operate in secret, \nwithout public input and its meetings and decision-making process will \nnot be transparent. This belief is inaccurate. The legislation ensures \nthat the Board operates in an open and transparent way that facilitates \nopen discussion and input from the public at large and from Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The legislation specifically authorizes the Board to \nhold open and public meetings and I would expect that the Board will do \nthis often as it gathers input from various stakeholders in the health \ncare sector and Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Further, the bill creates a Consumer Advisory Council to advise the \nBoard of the impact that its recommendations will have on consumers and \nMedicare beneficiaries. The Advisory Council is directed to meet at \nleast twice a year in a forum open to the public. I fully intend and \nexpect that as the Board creates its recommendations it will give ample \nweight to the views and concerns of the Consumer Advisory Council, as \nit is consumers that will ultimately be impacted by the decisions of \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board.\n  The Board and the Consumer Advisory Council must engage in an open \nand transparent decision making process, with ample opportunity for \ninput from Medicare beneficiaries as well as other health care \nstakeholders as is intended by this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2109-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2109-S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GLOBAL INTERNET FREEDOM CAUCUS\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, yesterday I was joined by Senators \nBrownback, Lieberman and Casey, in introducing the newly formed Senate \nCaucus for Global Internet Freedom. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of my comments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Senator Brownback and I created this caucus--together with Senators \nDurbin, Lieberman, Casey, McCain, Johanns, Barrasso, Menendez, and \nRisch--to promote the right to free expression, free press, free \nassembly, and free speech via the Internet and other forms of \nconnective technology.\n  The Internet has presented infinite opportunities for communication \nthroughout the world. It is an incredible tool for reaching people of \nall nationalities, faiths, and ethnicities in their own language, and \npromoting new channels for education and news. The free exchange of \nideas in a globalized world is essential to economic and political \nprogress, and we are gathered here today to reaffirm our commitment to \nthis issue.\n  The Caucus will provide bipartisan leadership within the Congress \nsupporting robust engagement by the public and private sectors to \nsecure digital freedoms throughout the world. Joining with our \ncolleagues who have established a similar caucus in the House, the \nSenate will continue to advance global Internet freedom as an essential \ncommunications tool. The power to connect and access information is a \nfundamental right which we seek to protect, and the caucus establishes \nan additional vehicle for doing so.\n  Our goals are three-fold. First, we will continue to draw attention \nto this critical issue. Second, we will continue to highlight attempts \nby foreign governments to restrict the Internet through resolutions, \nlegislation, and hearings. And third, we will continue to promote \nmethods of evading Internet restrictions, including censorship \ncircumvention technology and tools.\n  I emphasize that we will ``continue'' to take these steps because--\nwhile today marks the formal creation of the Caucus--this bipartisan \ngroup of Senators has been working to advocate for global Internet \nfreedom for more than\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\na year. We have worked together to pass numerous resolutions supporting \nglobal Internet and press freedom, and highlighting restrictions in \nChina and Iran. Many of us also authored the Victims of Iranian \nCensorship, or VOICE Act, which passed as part of the FY2010 Defense \nAuthorization and was the only bill specifically regarding Iran signed \ninto law last year.\n  The VOICE Act authorized funding for additional U.S. broadcasting \ninto Iran and the development of censorship circumvention tools. This \neffort was spearheaded by Senators McCain, Lieberman, Casey, Graham and \nmyself, while Senator Brownback has worked to secure funding for such \ntechnology in consecutive Foreign Operations Appropriations spending \nbills.\n  The 111th Congress, with strong bipartisan support, has done more to \npromote Internet freedom than any other Congress in history. We have \nset a standard that places cyber-journalists on equal footing with the \nbroadcast and print press; we have funded the dissemination and use of \ncensorship evasion technology at an unprecedented level; we have made \nInternet freedom a foreign policy priority and an integral part of the \ninternational agenda on human rights; and we will continue to take \nimportant policy positions on this pressing issue.\n  More remains to be done, and the caucus will fill that role. Internet \nrestrictions, censorship, manipulation, and monitoring continues to \nrise in China, Iran, and elsewhere around the world. The annual Freedom \nHouse Freedom of the Net Report shows a decline of digital freedom \nevery year. Nations around the world are using sophisticated censorship \ntechniques and abusing national security laws to crackdown on access to \nweb-based information, communication, and news.\n  Today, we reaffirm our commitment to this cause, and look forward to \ncontinuing to work together to promote Internet freedom around the \nglobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2110-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               189TH ANNIVERSARY OF GREECE'S INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 189th \nanniversary of the day in 1821 when the people of Greece declared \nindependence from the Ottoman Empire, launching the country's heroic 8-\nyear struggle to end centuries of political, religious and cultural \nrepression of their proud and ancient culture. This is a truly \ncherished milestone for the Greek people, Greek Americans, and for all \nthe friends of Greece around the globe.\n  The ancient Greeks developed the concept of democracy, in which the \nsupreme power to govern is vested in the people, and it was based on \nthis political model and philosophy that our Founding Fathers formed \nour democratic republic. Today, our two nations are not only faithful \nallies, but also close friends bound by a shared heritage of democratic \nvalues and together we are at the forefront of freedom, democracy, \npeace, stability, and human rights.\n  Nearly two centuries after the rebirth of Greek independence, there \nis much to celebrate, but there are also many significant challenges \nwhich we face in the 21st century. Ongoing provocations by Turkey in \nthe Aegean and irredentist actions by the Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia thwart Greece's quest for a stable southeastern Europe free \nof past centuries' often devastating territorial disputes. Protecting \nthe Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople the leader of Greek \nOrthodox Christians around the world from persecution, and ending the \nillegal occupation of the north of Cyprus remain as enormous \nimperatives that will require constructive engagement and a strong \ncommitment from those willing to champion human rights.\n  Overcoming these hurdles will require us to strengthen the \nrelationship that exists between our two great nations, so as to defend \nour foundational principles and ensure our vitality in the centuries to \ncome. On this anniversary of Greek independence, let us not only \ncelebrate and congratulate our friends in Greece, but also rededicate \nourselves to bolstering the relationship that exists between our \ncountries.\n  Madam President, as the first Greek-American woman elected to both \nthe U.S. House and U.S. Senate, I extend my warm congratulations and \nbest wishes to the people of Greece and all Greek Americans as we \ncelebrate the 189th anniversary of Greece's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2110-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED CROSS MONTH\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX.

From assisting victims of \nhouse fires or catastrophic storms here in my home State of Florida to \nhelping those affected by the devastating earthquake that took place in \nHaiti a couple of months ago, the American Red Cross is there, \nmobilizing our fellow Floridians in its mission to alleviate human \nsuffering and to assist us in disaster preparedness, lifesaving \ntraining and addressing an array of emergencies. Locally, the American \nRed Cross is also a leader in providing aquatic safety programs--\nsomething of great importance to the State of Florida. Every day the \nRed Cross trains our friends and neighbors in lifesaving CPR, first \naid, swimming lessons, drowning prevention and water safety \ninstruction.\n  Globally, the American Red Cross International Services Program \nreestablishes communication with loved ones separated by armed \nconflicts or natural disaster. Recently, the Red Cross provided family \nlinkages from Haiti earthquake survivors to family members living \nabroad. In addition, our American Red Cross is unique in its mission to \nuse archives located around the world to trace missing Holocaust family \nmembers.\n  A community-funded and supported organization, the American Red Cross \nprovides around-the-clock emergency services, every day, 24/7. When the \nAmerican Red Cross arrives on the scene, its staff and volunteers are \narmed with compassion and support. As we saw during the response to the \nearthquake in Haiti, you can always count on our Florida chapters of \nthe American Red Cross to be in the forefront when our community needs \nthem, time and time again.\n  I am proud to join with my colleagues in recognizing the Red Cross \nand thanking the staff and volunteers for their many contributions to \nour neighborhoods, communities and State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2110-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2110-S2111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LANCE MACKEY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am excited today to congratulate \nAlaskan dog musher Lance Mackey and his team of dogs that carried him \nacross the Iditarod finish line for a first-place finish in Nome, AK, \nat 6:59 p.m. on March 16, 2010. The Iditarod is known as the toughest \nrace on Earth. The trail spans across a significant portion of Alaska, \nand is roughly 1,100 miles long. The race begins in Willow, AK, and \nmushers cross the finish line in Nome--a small community on the coast \nof Norton Sound of the Bering Sea. Mackey and his team rode into Nome \njust 51 seconds short of 9 days on the trail--this is the second \nfastest time in the 38-year history of the race. He crossed the finish \nline with 11 of the 16 dogs he started the race with--tired but still \nstrong after the 1,000-mile journey. This victory landed Mackey his \nfourth win in a row--a title no Iditarod musher has claimed before.\n  Mackey's trademark strategy of long runs and little or no rest has \nconsistently landed him victories over the other faster dog teams \ncompeting against him. His lead dogs this year, or superstars as he \ncalls them, are named Maple and Rev. Alaskans and fans of this great \nrace are well aware that in order to race among the great dog mushers, \na pair of lead dogs with endurance and good judgment is just as \nimportant as a strong musher. The Iditarod is not for the faint of \nheart--the trail is made up of some of the harshest terrain in North \nAmerica and if the musher and his lead dogs are not in sync, there are \nabout a million things that can go wrong. Mackey has\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nshown a true bond with his team of dogs year after year, and this race \nwas no different.\n  Lance Mackey's story is not only amazing because of his determination \nand skill in the sport of dog mushing but his victories over personal \nlife challenges which are also significant. He is a cancer survivor--a \nvictory that preceded his success in the sport of dog mushing. Lance is \na lifelong Alaskan and a friend to many. He married his high school \nsweetheart and they have four children together. His family cheered him \non as he took first, and was by his side when he was diagnosed with \nthroat cancer after finishing the 2001 Iditarod race, where he took \n36th place. After that race, Lance did not give up. He had extensive \nsurgery and radiation and competed again the very next year. Although \nhe had to drop out of that race to take time off to recover from his \ncancer and the surgery, Mackey's dedication and love of the sport is \nclear. He is now cancer free.\n  Mackey went on to win the Yukon Quest several times, one of the two \nmajor sled dog races in Alaska. In 2007 and 2008, he won both the Yukon \nQuest and the Iditarod, two incredibly difficult races, with only a \nweek and a half in between each race to rest before he moved on to the \nnext event. For the first time in the history of the races, Lance had \nwon both, and he did so 2 years in a row.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight just how unique this sport \nis--not only to Alaska, but to America as well. The Iditarod and the \nYukon Quest are the world's two longest sled dog races. Both races span \nover 1,000 miles of rugged mountains, frozen tundra, and dense forests. \nThese races truly know how to test a man or woman's dedication and \ndetermination. Not only does the ruthless terrain of Alaska pose \nimmense obstacles to the mushers, but weather can be a major deterrent. \nTemperatures on the trail during the race have dropped down to 30 below \nzero. I don't know how many Members in this Chamber have experienced 30 \nbelow zero weather, but I can assure you it is no cakewalk. When that \nwind kicks up, gusts can shoot down through valleys and across the \ntundra at 100 miles per hour. You can imagine what the wind chill \nfactor is as you are racing a dog sled team across vast open spaces for \n1,100 miles. To give you an idea of just how long this race truly is--\nthe distance between this Chamber here in Washington and Miami, FL, \nwould fall roughly 100 miles short of the length of the trail. And the \nIditarod trail spans only a mere portion of our great State.\n  The Iditarod commemorates the diphtheria serum relay that took place \nin 1925. The diphtheria vaccine was needed in Nome to counteract an \noutbreak that was threatening the community. Alaskan mushers came \ntogether and ran a series of dog teams to Nome carrying the vaccine to \nsave the lives of those who were infected. This story is treasured in \nAlaska and each year, during the Iditarod, we remember the true spirit \nof the Alaska Natives and early pioneers and the obstacles they faced \nand ultimately overcame.\n  Today, the Iditarod is no longer run as a relay, but it is a race of \nindividual dog sled teams. The Alaskan wilderness the teams travel \nthrough is as exceptionally beautiful as it is difficult. Mackey said \nafter his win that this was the most tiring race yet for his team, and \nalso the toughest in terms of competition. Rookie musher Pat Moon \ncrashed after hitting a tree and falling unconscious and Bruce Linton \nof Kasilof, AK, who is diabetic, reported that his insulin froze while \nmushing along the Yukon River. Sixteen of the original seventy-one \nmushers dropped from the race this year. Many dogs, including five from \nMackey's team, were dropped from the race and sent to Anchorage to \nawait their mushers to return. Hans Gatt of Whitehorse, Canada, also a \nYukon Quest winner, trailed Lance Mackey by only an hour. He was \nfollowed by Jeff King, a four-time Iditarod winner.\n  Mackey says that what he does well is understand his team, allowing \nfor calculated risks that can change a race in an instant. He said:\n\n       I don't think that I do anything with my running to \n     jeopardize the dogs, or the future of the dogs. I gamble but \n     I'm not going to win the Iditarod at the expense of my team.\n\n  Lance Mackey, like all mushers, cares deeply for the health and \ncondition of their four-legged athletes. Last year the Anchorage Daily \nNews stated while covering the race:\n\n       A musher doesn't win by making dogs run. He wins by making \n     dogs want to run.\n\n  Lance describes working with his dogs this way:\n\n       The biggest challenge working with a large team of dogs is \n     the individual personalities. Like a classroom full of kids, \n     all with issues, wants, questions, some barking wildly to get \n     my attention, and then there are some who just do what needs \n     to be done and require only a nod or a smile. Every dog is \n     different. Every need is different. That is what I love. The \n     reward is seeing them all come together as a team working for \n     a common goal.\n\n  I had the opportunity when I was up in the State for the ceremonial \nstart of the Iditarod to go around and talk with the mushers and visit \nwith the dogs. You can really tell how close the mushers are with their \nteams and when they come together as a team they can truly go the \ndistance. We should acknowledge and respect them.\n  On Tuesday, March 16, thousands gathered at the famous burled wood \narch on Front Street in Nome, AK, to cheer on Lance Mackey as his dogs \ncarried him to victory over his talented competitors from all over the \nworld. It is my honor today to stand before the Senate to congratulate \nLance Mackey and his team, and to recognize this amazing race. The only \none of its kind. Lance continues to be a world-class musher and a true \nAlaskan hero, along with his remarkable team. I join Alaskans in \ncongratulating Lance Mackey on yet another Iditarod victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2111-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MIDDLETON, IDAHO\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, today I congratulate and acknowledge the \n100th anniversary of the founding of the city of Middleton, ID. On \nApril 10, 2010, the citizens of Middleton will gather at Roadside Park \nto commemorate the 100th year of its founding. This is a very historic \nand special day for this western Idaho community.\n  From its early days as a settlement in 1863, Middleton's history has \nembodied the frontier spirit and entrepreneurship that makes the United \nStates a promised land of opportunity. After a gold rush struck Boise \nBasin, Middleton became the earliest settlement in what is now Canyon \nCounty. Middleton was named for its location on the old Oregon Trail \nmidway between Boise City and Olds Ferry on the Snake River.\n  Primarily an agricultural community, Middleton became a center for \nmilling in the West in 1871 when J.M. Stephenson and J.C. Isaacs opened \ntheir flour mill. The turn of the century brought the Idaho Northern \nRailway to Middleton and with it a bank, hotel and other business \ndevelopment. A few short years later, the town was officially \nincorporated on April 10, 1910.\n  Today, Middleton remains rooted in agriculture with potatoes, sugar \nbeets, corn, mint, grains and dairy among its products. At the same \ntime, it is one of Idaho's fastest-growing communities with greater \nportions of the Treasure Valley workforce moving there to enjoy the \namenities of country living and small-town friendliness.\n  In 2006, Middleton celebrated the election of a hometown girl, Donna \nJones, Idaho's first female State controller. Donna was raised in \nMiddleton, went to school there, and married in the historic Methodist \nchurch.\n  Middleton gained national prominence in the summer of 2007, when the \ncommunity came together to build a home for the Stockdale family on the \ntelevision show ``Extreme Makeover Home Edition.'' Over the course of a \nweek, hundreds of volunteers worked side by side in 100-degree heat to \naccomplish the task, demonstrating the true spirit of their community.\n  Middleton has much to celebrate and look forward to in its next \ncentury as it provides important goods and services at home and abroad. \nCongratulations to the city of Middleton for 100 years of service and \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2111-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2111-S2112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING MIDGE COSTANZA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Midge Costanza, a dear friend and great \nAmerican who passed away this week. This woman of\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\ngreat passion, compassion, vitality, kindness, and commitment died \nafter a long battle with cancer in San Diego, CA, where she had lived \nand worked for the past 20 years.\n  I first heard of Midge in 1976, when President-elect Jimmy Carter \nmade history by making her the first woman ever named Assistant to the \nPresident. As President Carter's public liaison, she reached out to \nAmericans who had previously been denied access to the White House.\n  By the time I first ran for Senate in 1992, Midge had moved to San \nDiego, where she worked tirelessly on behalf of my campaign. She ran \nour San Diego office, introduced me to local leaders, and often spoke \non my behalf at rallies and other speaking engagements. She was a \nriveting speaker who inspired even the toughest crowd.\n  The daughter of Sicilian immigrants, Midge was born in 1932 in LeRoy, \nNY, and grew up in Rochester. After high school, she went to work and \nbecame active in several community organizations. Soon she was \nvolunteering for Democratic political campaigns, including Averell \nHarriman's successful campaign for governor of New York. In 1964, she \nserved as the Monroe County director for Robert F. Kennedy's Senate \ncampaign.\n  Midge served a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1972 \nto 1977. In 1973, she ran for an at-large seat on the Rochester City \nCouncil and won in a landslide. In 1974, she lost a congressional race \nto a popular Republican incumbent. Two years later, she served as State \ncochair for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign. At the 1976 \nDemocratic National Convention, she gave an inspiring speech seconding \nCarter's nomination.\n  After leaving the White House, Midge served on the board of directors \nfor several organizations, including the National Gay Rights Advocates \nand the AIDS research group Search Alliance.\n  Following my 1992 campaign, Midge worked on the 1994 campaigns of \ngubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown and Congresswoman Lynn Schenk. \nOver the years, she also coached many candidates in strategy and public \nspeaking.\n  In 2000, she was appointed Special Assistant to the Governor by \nCalifornia Governor Gray Davis and served as his liaison for women's \ngroups and issues.\n  Since 2003, Midge has been an adjunct professor at San Diego State \nUniversity and established the Midge Costanza Institute for the Study \nof Politics and Public Policy at SDSU.\n  For the past 5 years, Midge has served as public affairs officer for \nSan Diego district attorney Bonnie Dumanis. Last year, when she and the \ndistrict attorney visited my Washington office, we shared some laughs \nand stories about our early days together.\n  Shortly before Midge died, she received a call from President Carter, \nwho expressed his love for her and his gratitude for her outstanding \nservice to the Nation. Today I want to echo those sentiments and bid a \nfond farewell to my dear friend Midge Costanza. Midge was a great role \nmodel for women in public service. Her insight and wit will be missed \nby all of us who knew her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2112-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING DR. EDGAR WAYBURN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I \nask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary environmental pioneer and wilderness champion, Dr. Edgar \nWayburn. Ed was a soft spoken yet remarkably successful conservationist \nwhose legacy is enjoyed by millions. Ed passed away on March 5, 2010, \nat his home in San Francisco at the age of 103.\n  Born in Macon, GA, in 1906, Ed made his first trip to California in \n1927, at the age of 21. He was immediately struck by the awe-inspiring \nvistas of Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada. He was \ncaptivated by the majestic beauty of California and knew he would one \nday return. After graduating from Harvard Medical School, Ed served in \nthe U.S. Air Force during World War II. In 1939, Ed joined the \nfledgling Sierra Club, an organization he would later serve as the \npresident of five times. By 1947, Ed was living in the San Francisco \nBay area and had grown active in efforts to protect the beautiful \nlandscapes of coastal California.\n  Ed's career in conservation spanned 60 years, during which he was \nnever compensated financially for his efforts. Ed maintained his \nprivate medical practice while dedicating evenings, weekends, and \nvacation time to his relentless pursuit of protecting lands for public \nenjoyment. In California, Ed was instrumental in the creation of \nRedwood National Park, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and \nPoint Reyes National Seashore. Working tirelessly alongside the late \nCongressman Phil Burton, Ed won support for protecting these parks, \nwhich today are some of my great state's most revered natural \ntreasures.\n  Ed's environmental legacy stretches far beyond California. He and his \nbeloved wife Peggy, who passed away in 2002, worked tirelessly to \nprotect the Alaskan wilderness. After Ed and Peggy's first life-\nchanging visit to Alaska, they inspired a national campaign that \nultimately culminated in the passage of the Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act, signed into law by President Carter in 1980. As \na result, the National Park system nearly doubled in size, adding 10 \nnew national parks with the stroke of the President's pen. To this day, \nthe Alaska Lands Act is the largest public lands legislation in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  Ed Wayburn possessed a deep understanding of the value of our public \nlands and precious wild places. In Ed's 2004 publication ``Your Land \nand Mine,'' he states that ``in destroying wilderness, we deny \nourselves the full extent of what it means to be alive. In preserving \nwilderness, we not only recognize our place in the chain of life, but \nwe also invite ourselves to reach, to explore, to wonder, and to make a \ndifference.'' Ed held an unshakable belief in the natural world's \nability to provide humanity with critical opportunities for \nintrospection and inspiration. As a doctor, Ed understood the \nconnection between an individual's well-being and the health of the \nenvironment. As a leader, he understood the importance of providing the \npublic with wild places to foster that connection.\n  In August of 1999, President Clinton presented Ed with the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom. President Clinton said of Ed, ``He has \nsaved more of our wilderness than any person alive.'' The Presidential \nMedal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor an American can receive, \nand signifies the magnitude of the legacy left to us by this great and \nhumble man.\n  Ed has left an indelible mark on the landscape of America. He was a \ncompassionate physician, an inspiring conservationist, and a wonderful \nfamily man who served his country both in and out of uniform. Though he \nwill be deeply missed, Ed has left us with so many priceless gifts. The \nparks he helped to build, and the lands he helped to protect, will be \nenjoyed by Americans and visitors to our great nation for many \ngenerations to come. And as our world continues to change, and wild \nplaces grow increasingly rare, the gifts that Ed bestowed upon us will \nbecome evermore valuable.\n  Ed is survived by his daughters Laurie, Cynthia, and Diana; his son \nWilliam; and his three grandchildren. My thoughts and prayers are with \nEd's family during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2112-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2112-S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING THOMAS F. STROOCK\n\n Mr. ENZI. Madam President, Diana and I, along with so many of \nour neighbors, family and friends from every corner of Wyoming were \nvery sorry to learn of the passing of Thomas Stroock. Tom was one of \nWyoming's most remarkable citizens, a rugged individualist who wore \nmany hats in life and traveled many roads--all of which always brought \nhim back to the State he loved and called home--Wyoming.\n  God puts us where He wants and needs us to be and how what we do--and \nwhat we fail to do--can have a great impact on the world around us and \nmake the lives of all those we meet very different than they might \notherwise have been. That is the kind of lesson you could draw from the \nlife of Thomas Stroock. Born in New York City, Tom quickly showed the \nkind of character and values that would guide him throughout his many \nchosen careers. He was an excellent student, and\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nwhen the opportunity presented itself, he enrolled at Yale University, \nand then enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps so he could serve his \ncountry at a time when tensions were running high around the world.\n  After he completed his service in the Corps and graduated from Yale, \nhe made what he would always say was the most important and the \nsmartest move of his life when he married Marta. Marta was to be a \nstrong and powerful influence as she helped to give his life balance \nand direction. Thus began a marriage that was to last for 60 years.\n  Now that Tom had found the love of his life, it was time for Tom and \nMarta to start making plans for their lives together. A business \nopportunity had brought them to Casper, WY, but they had no plans to \nstay. Fortunately, the beauty of the surrounding area, and the spirit \nand hospitality of the people they met soon changed their minds. So \nmuch so that when Tom's employer wanted to transfer him from Casper he \ndecided instead to try his hand at running his own firm. That is how \nthe Stroock Leasing Corporation came to be born.\n  Tom, to no one's surprise, soon proved to have an excellent mind for \nbusiness. In just a few years, Tom had founded other business entities \nand he was making even greater strides on the path to success.\n  For many people that would have been enough. They would have been \ncontent to just sit back and enjoy all that life had already brought \ntheir way. That is how it would have been for most people, but not for \nTom and Marta.\n  Tom's unshakeable determination to do everything he possibly could to \nimprove the lives of those around him--to make his part of the world a \nbetter place wherever he happened to be--which had always served as his \ninternal compass--now became stronger than ever. It became part of his \npersonal mission statement that he worked very hard to fulfill time and \ntime again, at home and abroad.\n  That is why, now that his businesses were doing so well, Tom decided \nto take that philosophy to the next level. He ran for and won a seat on \nthe Natrona County School Board so he could help to make the local \nschools more effective and efficient. Tom knew from his own life the \nbenefits that a good education can provide and he wanted all of our \nstate's young people to have that same chance.\n  Then, after serving on the school board, he was elected to represent \nNatrona County in the Wyoming State Senate--a post to which he was \nreelected several times. In both positions Tom showed that he was a \nmaster strategist. In the State legislature, no one ever paid closer \nattention to Wyoming's resources and our stream of revenue than Tom \ndid. He watched every penny--how each one was earned and how each one \nwas spent. Wyoming was then placed on better and more sound financial \nfooting because of what he did.\n  Throughout his life Tom was profoundly influenced by his years at \nYale. It was there that he met George H.W. Bush and the two soon became \ngood friends. He must have been impressed with Tom because, when he was \nelected President and the opportunity presented itself, he named Tom \nStroock to serve as our Ambassador to Guatemala.\n  Tom preferred Guatemala to the other available posts because it was \nin the midst of a great civil war and of all the nations in the area, \nTom felt that he could do the most good there.\n  At the conclusion of his service in Guatemala, Tom and Marta headed \nright back home to Wyoming. To no one's surprise, Tom hit the ground \nrunning and was once again involved in a wide variety of issues that \nranged from the status of our energy industry to the future of the \nUniversity of Wyoming. He even wrote some guest columns for the Star-\nTribune. Never one to mince words or water down his ideas and views, \nhis columns often raised eyebrows--and the attention of people with \nother points of view!\n  During these years, he also found the time to start and fund the \nStroock Forum on Wyoming Lands and People. The Forum, which was held \nevery year, brought an interesting speaker to Wyoming to share their \nviews on many different issues.\n  As we look back in the years to come, we will always remember Tom as \none of our state's strongest leaders. He led the best way--by example--\nand by so doing encouraged others to follow his lead and do their best \nat whatever they felt called to do in life.\n  Tom's service can best be summed up by the words Mike Leon of \nSheridan used when he was in the Legislature to emphasize the \nimportance of maintaining the individuality of our state. Tom quoted \nthem himself in one of his speeches--``We don't want to make Wyoming \nlike every place else, when every place else wants to be just like \nWyoming.''\n  That was Tom's No. 1 goal in life--to make things better in Wyoming \nor wherever he happened to find himself, but, as he did, to ensure that \neach place maintained its own style and character so that it would \nnever become a place that was just like every other.\n  In their travels, and throughout their lives, Tom and Marta have made \neverywhere they have been a better place for their having passed by. \nTogether they were a remarkable team and they produced tremendous \nresults and touched more lives than we will ever know.\n  Diana and I join with all those who knew and loved Tom in expressing \nour great sympathy for the loss we all share. We will keep all of Tom's \nfamily, his many friends and all those who were a part of his extended \nfamily in our prayers. He has gifted our state and our people with a \nlegacy of which we can all be very proud. He will be greatly missed and \nhe will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2113-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING STEVENS POINT POINTERS\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the University of Wisconsin--Stevens Point Pointers \nmen's basketball team on capturing their third national title after \ntheir exciting win in the 2010 NCAA Division III Basketball \nChampionship. The Pointers' hard work year-round has made them widely \nrespected, and this achievement has made many Wisconsinites and \nPointers fans very proud.\n  The team's perseverance and commitment to excellence throughout the \nseason were on display during their journey to this year's title game, \nwhere guts and determination produced a thrilling game from start to \nfinish.

Madam President, today I honor a small business in \nmy home State of Maine that has faced substantial adversity and \ndemonstrated incredible resolve and determination. Located on the \nbeautiful Damariscotta River in midcoast Maine, Washburn & Doughty \nAssociates, Inc., has manufactured steel and aluminum commercial \nvessels since 1977. Founded by Bruce Doughty, Bruce Washburn, and Carl \nPianka, the company delivers an assortment of tugboats, commercial \npassenger vessels, fishing boats, barges, ferries, and research vessels \nto a wide variety of clients.\n  In July of 2008, at their facility in East Boothbay, a fire torched \nthe company's central construction location, leaving the operation in \nshambles. The company faced a steep uphill climb as they began seeking \ngrants, loans, and insurance funds to recover their operation. \nFollowing the blaze, the company battled the Maine winter and forged \nahead to continue building its vessels outdoors.\n  With fortitude and grit the company was the only boatyard in Maine to \nwin\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\na grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The boat \nmaker earned a $2.6 million grant under the Maritime Administration's \nSmall Shipyards Grant Program which it has put to use in helping to \ndesign a new, state-of-the-art construction building. The spacious \nfacility, which was unveiled in September of last year, measures 42,000 \nsquare feet and is able to maneuver vessels up to 200 feet long and 50 \nfeet wide. It features two construction bays, each equipped with two, \n20-ton cranes. A central mezzanine contains shop space and offices for \nproduction support, supervision, design, and engineering. The company \nalso purchased modern shipbuilding tools and equipment to sharpen their \nboat-making skills.\n  In conjunction with this critical Federal aid, many members of the \nlocal community collaborated to help the company, raising an \nastonishing $140,000 to help replace tools and provide general \nassistance to the employees. Indeed, the town of Boothbay joined \ncountless organizations like the Boothbay Harbor Region Chamber of \nCommerce and the Boothbay Region Land Trust to support Washburn & \nDoughty and its outstanding workers. Their working in concert is truly \na testament to Maine's culture of cooperation and its deep sense of \ncommunity values.\n  Since the fire of 2008, Washburn & Doughty Associates, Inc. has \nrebounded at an incredible pace. Late last year, the company posted \npositive job growth, having gone from 92 employees during early 2008 to \n125 employees at present. This 35-percent increase in employment can be \ndirectly attributed to the steely resolve and dedicated work ethic of \nthe men and women of Maine's working waterfront.\n  Undeniably, Bruce Doughty and Bruce Washburn embody these attributes \nas evidenced by their deep and abiding commitment to the firm's \ndedicated workforce and their unwavering resolve to rebuild. When times \nwere bleak, they maintained their unyielding focus, and despite \nencountering countless hurdles along the way, persevered, rebuilt the \ncompany, and further solidified its reputation as one of the top steel \nconstruction shipyards in the Northeast. I applaud the strong efforts \nof everyone at Washburn & Doughty to rebuild their company in such an \nimpressive manner, and wish them a smooth road forward full of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2113-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2113-S2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING WASHBURN & DOUGHTY ASSOCIATES, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to waive the non-Federal share requirement under certain \nprograms; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Chair of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to join the Committee's \nRanking Member, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, and my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Richard Durbin, in introducing the \nSmall Business Community Partners Relief Act of 2010. This bi-partisan \nlegislation will provide much-needed relief to Women's Business \nCenters, WBCs, and SBA Microloan intermediaries--two Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, resource partners that provide critical assistance \nto our Nation's 29 million small businesses.\n  For my colleagues who may not be familiar with these programs, let me \nfirst explain the vital role of WBCs and Microloan intermediaries and \nthe importance of aiding the small businesses these centers target.\n  Women's Business Centers provide quality counseling and training \nservices to all entrepreneurs, primarily women, and especially those \nwho are socially and economically disadvantaged. More than 110 centers \nacross the country help more than 150,000 clients annually on a vast \narray of topics--from how to write a business plan to where to get \nfinancing. Many WBCs provide multilingual services and a number offer \ndaycare services, allowing mothers with children to attend training \nclasses.\n  Microloan intermediaries provide small, short-term loans to start-ups \nor small growing firms that cannot access credit through traditional \nloan programs. Like WBCs, the 160 Microloan\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nintermediaries throughout the nation also help entrepreneurs manage \ntheir start-up and expand while creating or saving thousands of jobs. \nAlso like WBCs, the Microloan intermediaries tend to serve \ndisadvantaged businesses in areas of the country that have been hit the \nhardest by the recession. About 48 percent of microloans go to small \nbusinesses owned by women, and about 53 percent to minority-owned small \nbusinesses.\n  Aiding women and minority small business owners is vital to the \neconomic success of our nation because women-owned and minority-owned \nbusinesses are the fastest growing segments of the small business \ncommunity--creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Women-owned \nbusinesses contribute nearly $3 trillion to our economy and create or \nsave 23 million jobs each year, according to the Center for Women's \nBusiness Research. Minority-owned firms contribute nearly $700 billion \nto the economy and create or save 4.7 million jobs, according to the \nDepartment of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency.\n  While minority and women-owned firms do contribute greatly to the \neconomy, they still need our help. Even though the number of minority-\nowned firms has grown by 35 percent, the average gross receipts for \nthose firms dropped by 16 percent. Women-owned firms meanwhile have \nlower revenues and fewer employees than their male-owned counterparts--\nalthough 6 percent of men-owned businesses have revenues of $1 million \nor more, only 3 percent of women-owned firms reach the $1 million \nmarker.\n  In this economic downturn, minority and women-owned businesses are \nstruggling even more than usual. When they go to their local WBC or \nMicroloan intermediary they are finding these centers of aid and \ncounseling struggling as well. That's because, in order to receive \nFederal money, the centers and intermediaries must also find matching \nlocal funds. This funding often comes from local governments, \nuniversities and private entities. But these partners have had to \ntighten their belts, cutting much of their funding to the WBCs and \nMicroloan intermediaries.\n  Without matching funding from their local partners, some WBCs and \nMicroloan intermediaries have had to reduce or refuse Federal money. \nNine WBCs have closed or requested reduced funding in the last year and \nmany intermediaries are struggling to keep their doors open, even in \nthe face of record demand for their services.\n  The Small Business Community Partner Relief Act would enable the SBA \nAdministrator to temporarily waive the non-Federal match funding \nrequirement, allowing struggling WBCs and Microloan intermediaries to \nreceive the full amount of Federal support available. This change will \nmake it possible for the centers and intermediaries to continue serving \nthose small businesses that need help the most in these difficult \ntimes.\n  I look forward to working with Ranking Member Snowe, Senator Durbin \nand my colleagues in the Senate to make this necessary change a reality \nfor the hundreds of centers and intermediaries throughout the country, \nand the millions of small businesses that rely on these programs to \nhelp them survive, grow and create jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 13 of the United States Code to \nprovide for a 5-year term of office for the Director of the Census and \nto provide for authority and duties of the Director and Deputy Director \nof the Census, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nFederal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, \nand International Security, I introduce the Census Oversight Efficiency \nand Management Reform Act of 2010.\n  With exactly one week left until Census Day, I think we can all take \npride in the excellent work that the Census Bureau has done over the \npast few months to get the 2010 Census back on\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\ntrack. The Census Bureau's significance and the importance of its work \ncannot be overstated.\n  In fact, the requirement to enumerate the population is enshrined in \nthe American Constitution. And the founding fathers asked us to do this \neach 10 years, as a cornerstone of their aspiration for effective \nrepresentative democracy. They even went so far as to levy a $20 fine \nfor noncompliance in 1790. They knew the fairness of our government \nrequired everyone to participate in the census.\n  Over the time, the Census process and procedure has changed \nremarkably from when the very first Census was conducted on horseback \nto today where Census workers utilize cutting edge technology to \ncollect and transmit data. Even as the technology surrounding the \nCensus has evolved the importance of its work has remained constant \nthroughout American history. Yet despite its critical importance, the \npast three censuses have been deemed ``at risk'' and have been the \nsubject of great controversy under Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike.\n  Just over 2 years ago, there were serious last-minute census design \nchanges due to the failure of a project involving the census takers \nusing handheld computers which threatened to derail the 2010 Census. \nFurther, the cost of census taking has continued to escalate over the \nyears. The cost of the 2010 Census is estimated to be $14.7 billion, \nmaking it the most expensive census in history.\n  Looking ahead, research and development for the 2020 Census is \nalready underway and we must begin to think now about how we can \nadvance the Census Bureau into a 21st century statistical agency.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would make the Director \nof the Census Bureau a presidential appointment of 5 years, creating \ncontinuity across administrations. The bill would also require annual \nreporting on the Bureau's performance goals and risk mitigation \nstrategies.\n  This will provide Congress with regular updates throughout the decade \non the progress being made and an earlier warning when there are \nproblems on the horizon. Further, encouraging the use of the Internet \nfor data collection in the decennial census presents important \nopportunities for cost reductions and improvements in data quality.\n  I believe that these legislative reforms will ensure that the 2020 \nCensus will be conducted without the operational problems we have seen \nin the past and with the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars \npossible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993 to require the Bureau of Land Management to provide a claimant of \na small miner waiver from claim maintenance fees with a period of 60 \ndays after written receipt of 1 or more defects is provided to the \nclaimant by registered mail to cure the 1 or more defects or pay the \nclaim maintenance fee, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nin the Senate that has already been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Alaska Congressman Don Young to clarify federal \nmining law and remedy a problem that has arisen with the extension \nprocess for ``small'' miner land claims.\n  Under revisions to the Federal Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 28(f), \nholders of unpatented mineral claims must pay a claim maintenance fee \noriginally set at $100 per claim by a deadline, set by regulation, of \nSeptember 1st each year. Since 2004 that fee has risen to $125 per \nclaim. But Congress also has provided a claim maintenance fee waiver \nfor ``small'' miners, those who hold 10 or fewer claims, that they do \nnot have to submit the fee, but that they must file to renew their \nclaims and submit an affidavit of annual labor by Dec. 31st each year, \ncertifying that they had performed more than $100 of work on the claim \nin the preceding year, 30 U.S.C. 28f(d)(1). The waiver provision \nfurther states: ``If a small miner waiver application is determined to \nbe defective for any reason, the claimant shall have a period of 60 \ndays after receipt of written notification of the defect or defects by \nthe Bureau of Land Management to: cure such defect or defects or pay \nthe $100 claim maintenance fee due for such a period.''\n  Since the last revision to the law last decade, there have been a \nseries of incidents where miners argued that they submitted their \napplications and affidavits of annual labor in a timely manner, but due \nto clerical error by BLM staff or for unexplained reasons the \napplications or documents were not recorded as having been received in \na timely fashion--and that BLM has then moved to terminate the claims, \ndeeming them null and void. While mining claim holders have argued that \nthe law provides them time to cure claim defects, BLM has argued that \nthe cure only applies when applications or fees have been received in a \ntimely manner. Thus, there is no administrative remedy for miners who \nbelieve that clerical errors by BLM resulted in loss or the late \nrecording of claim applications.\n  There have been a number of cases where Congress has been asked to \noverride BLM determinations and reinstate mining claims simply because \nof the disputes over whether the claims had been filed in a timely \nmanner. Congress in 2003 reinstated such claims in a previous Alaska \ncase, and claims in another incident were reinstated following a U.S. \nDistrict Court case in the 10th Circuit in 2009 in the case of Miller \nv. United States.\n  This bill is intended to short circuit continued litigation and pleas \nfor claim reinstatement by clarifying the intent of Congress that \nminers do have to be informed that their claims are in jeopardy of \nbeing voided and given 60 days notice to cure defects, including giving \nthem time to submit their applications and to submit affidavits of \nannual labor, should they not be received and processed by BLM \nofficials. If all defects are not cured within 60 days--the obvious \nintent of Congress in passing the original act--then claims still will \nbe subject to voidance.\n  The transition rule included in this measure will solve two pending \ncases in Alaska, one where a holder of nine claims on the Kenai \nPeninsula, near Hope, Alaska, has lost title to claims that he had held \nfrom 1982 to 2004. In this case, John Trautner had a consistent record \nof having paid the annual labor assessment fee for the previous 22 \nyears and the local BLM office did have a time-date-stamped record that \nthe maintenance fee waiver certification form had been filed weeks \nbefore the deadline, not just a record that the affidavit of annual \nlabor had arrived. In the second case Don and Judy Mullikin of Homer, \nAlaska, is in the process of losing title to nine claims on the Seward \nPeninsula outside of Nome in Alaska because the Anchorage BLM office \nhas no record of them receiving the paperwork, even though the owners \nhave computer time stamps of them having completed the paperwork five \nmonths before the deadline, but no other evidence of filing to meet BLM \nregulations in support of an appeal. These are claims that have been \nworked in Alaska yearly since 1937 and are the main livelihood for the \nMullikins.\n  This legislation, supported by the Alaska Miners Association, clearly \nis intended to remedy a simple drafting error in congressional crafting \nof the small miner claim defect process. While only a few cases of \npotential clerical errors have occurred over the past decade, it still \nmakes sense for Congress to clarify that claim holders\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nhave a right to know that their applications have not been processed, \nin time for them to cure application-claim defects prior to being \ninformed of the loss of the claim rights forever. Simple equity and due \nprocess requires no less.\n  Given the minute cost of this administrative change to the Department \nof the Interior, but its big impact on affected small mineral claim \nholders, I hope this bill can be considered and approved promptly this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Specter, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3176. A bill to further the mission of the Global Justice \nInformation Sharing Initiative Advisory Committee by continuing its \ndevelopment of policy recommendations and technical solutions on \ninformation sharing and interoperability, and enhancing its pursuit of \nbenefits and cost savings for local, State, tribal, and Federal justice \nagencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Department of \nJustice Global Advisory Committee Authorization Act of 2010. This \nlegislation will make it easier and less costly for local, state, \ntribal and federal agencies to share public safety and criminal justice \ninformation and to better protect our communities. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Arlen Specter, the chairman of the Crime and Drugs \nSubcommittee, and Senator Patty Murray in introducing this legislation. \nI look forward to working with all my colleagues to see it enacted into \nlaw.\n  Ensuring the public's safety often depends on effective information \nsharing. In recent years, criminal gangs, fugitives, illegal \ntrafficking networks, cybercriminals and terrorist organizations have \nincreased their ability to operate across jurisdictional boundaries. \nHowever, too often the public safety agencies charged with combating \nthese threats have operated without all the information that should be \navailable to them. Inconsistent information-sharing protocols and \ndatabases that are not interoperable with one another are barriers the \nlaw enforcement and public safety communities have identified. Quite \nsimply, if we want to combat the threats of the 21st century, we need a \n21st century information-sharing framework.\n  The U.S. Department of Justice has long recognized the need to bring \nlaw enforcement and public safety stakeholders together to take on this \nchallenge of improving information sharing. In 1998, the Justice \nDepartment established the Global Justice Information Sharing \nInitiative Advisory Committee, also known as the ``Global Advisory \nCommittee''. Chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the \nGlobal Advisory Committee brings together key representatives from law \nenforcement, judicial, correctional, and public safety agencies to \nadvise the Attorney General on information-sharing policies, practices \nand technical solutions.\n  Over the years, the Global Advisory Committee has developed a strong \ntrack record of consolidating stakeholder views and developing \nconsensus information-sharing solutions that local, state, tribal and \nfederal agencies all agree upon. The Committee has recruited experts on \na pro bono basis to develop new interoperable technological standards, \nand they have already developed a criminal justice information sharing \nstandard--the Global Justice XML Data Model--and a broader justice and \nhomeland security information exchange--the National Information \nExchange Model--that enable agencies to convert their own database \ninformation into a common format which can be shared.\n  The Global Advisory Committee also created the ``National Criminal \nIntelligence Sharing Plan,'' a blueprint for agency intelligence-\nsharing procedures that has been endorsed by the Departments of Justice \nand Homeland Security. And the Committee has drafted ``Fusion Center \nGuidelines'' which have helped communities throughout the country \nestablish information-sharing ``fusion centers'' for responding to \nsecurity threats. The Justice Department plans to involve the Committee \nin crafting new information-sharing strategies and protocols for \ncombating gang violence, improving correctional information, and \nsharing fugitive information.\n  In addition to its work developing information-sharing standards, the \ncharter and bylaws of the Global Advisory Committee prioritize civil \nliberties and privacy protection and promote database security and \nshared information accuracy. The Committee has established a working \ngroup specifically dedicated to protecting privacy and information \nquality, and has also created resources to help jurisdictions develop \nprivacy and civil liberties programs.\n  The Global Advisory Committee's work has already led to cost savings \nin the design and procurement of interoperable information systems. \nThese cost-saving benefits are likely to grow if the Committee's \ninformation-sharing standards become increasingly adopted and if \ninteroperability among local, state, tribal and federal databases \nincreases. With Congress's help, the Committee can revolutionize \nefficient information-sharing among public safety and law enforcement \nagencies, which will both lower information technology costs and help \nprevent and fight crime.\n  While the Global Advisory Committee's value has been recognized \nthroughout the law enforcement and public safety communities, it has \nnot yet been recognized by Congress. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday will give Congress's blessing to the Committee by authorizing the \nJustice Department to provide it with technical and financial support \nand dedicated funding.\n  Currently, under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Global \nAdvisory Committee must terminate and reestablish itself every two \nyears, but my legislation will keep the Committee in continuous \noperation. The bill also directs the Committee to make recommendations \nto the Attorney General on interoperability and information-sharing \npractices and technologies, and to report to Congress at least annually \non its recommendations. My legislation also expresses the sense of \nCongress that agencies across the country should adopt the Global \nAdvisory Committee's recommendations in order to improve their \ninformation sharing. The bill further directs the Attorney General to \nsubmit a report to Congress regarding the state of information sharing \nbetween corrections and law enforcement agencies through the Interstate \nCompact for Adult Offender Supervision, including suggestions for \nimprovement.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the National Sheriffs Association, the National Narcotics \nOfficers' Associations' Coalition, the National Criminal Justice \nAssociation, the National Association of Counties, the American \nProbation and Parole Association, the American Correctional \nAssociation, the Association of State Correctional Administrators, and \nthe National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics, SEARCH.\n  The Global Advisory Committee has already achieved great success in \nbringing together local, state, tribal and federal agencies to develop \nconsensus information-sharing solutions. With Congressional \nauthorization and a consistent funding stream, the Committee can build \nupon that success in a way that will benefit justice and public safety \nagencies across the nation. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a Home Star \nRetrofit Rebate Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Warner and \nSenator Graham in introducing the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of \n2010. This legislation will save consumers money, create American \nskilled labor jobs, and reduce home energy consumption.\n  If enacted, HOME STAR will build on existing policies and initiatives \nthat have already proved effective. The program is supported by a broad \ncoalition of over 600 groups including construction contractors, \nbuilding products and mechanical manufacturers, retail sales \nbusinesses, environmental groups and labor advocates.\n  HOME STAR will provide point-of-sale instant savings to encourage \nhomeowners to install residential energy upgrades such as air sealing, \ninsulation, and high efficiency furnaces and water heaters.\n  HOME STAR will have a two-tiered approach that will offer flexibility \nto homeowners when choosing retrofits to install. Under the Silver Star \nprogram, rebates averaging $1,000 will be offered for the installation \nof each eligible energy-saving measure such as new insulation and high-\nefficiency heating and cooling systems, up to maximum of $3,000 per \nhome. Under the Gold Star program, there will be performance-based \ngrants of $3,000 for a 20 percent reduction in home energy consumption \nand $1,000 for each additional 5 percent of verified energy reduction \nas determined by a comparison of the energy consumption of the home \nbefore and after the retrofit.\n  HOME STAR will also create American jobs in the construction \nindustry, which has lost 1.6 million jobs since December 2007, with \nunemployment rates topping 25 percent in some regions. HOME STAR \nleverages private investment to create a strong market for home energy \nretrofits, and will put hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans \nback to work as well as stimulating demand for building materials \nproduced by American factories.\n  Finally, HOME STAR will reduce home energy consumption and dependence \non foreign oil. HOME STAR helps Americans pay for cost-effective home \nimprovements, create permanent reductions in household energy bills, \nand reduce our national carbon footprint. Residential energy efficiency \nimprovements covered by the HOME STAR program reduce energy waste in \nmost homes by 20 to 40 percent. When combined with low-interest \nfinancing, these retrofits can be cash-flow positive upon project \ncompletion. An initiative with a potential to retrofit over 3 million \nhomes, HOME STAR will achieve significant reductions in building-\nrelated greenhouse gas emissions while generating long-term energy \nsavings for American consumers and reducing energy usage by an amount \nequal to four 300-megawatt power plants.\n  In the interest of time we will postpone our remarks on this \nimportant bill until the Senate is back in session. Meanwhile, members \nwill have an opportunity to review the legislation with their \nconstituents. We hope that many members of the Senate will become \ncosponsors of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3177\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the rights of consumers to diagnose, \nservice, maintain, and repair their motor vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join Senator \nBrownback in introducing bipartisan automotive right to repair \nlegislation.\n  Our bill, the Motor Vehicle Owners Right to Repair Act, allows \nconsumers the freedom to choose which repair shops they use for auto \nrepairs and routine vehicle maintenance.\n  Consumers today have many choices when it comes to the vehicle they \ndrive, but not necessarily when it comes to the maintenance or repair \noptions for those vehicles.\n  Most cars today rely on computers to perform many of the automobile's \nvital functions including brakes, airbags, ignition and other operating \nsystems.\n  If an electronic component of a car fails or needs tuning, an access \ncode is often needed in order to repair or replace the necessary part. \nThese codes are currently provided on a voluntary basis to repair shops \nby car manufacturers.\n  Unfortunately, many local independent repair shops are provided only \nlimited or incomplete information by manufacturers to access and repair \nmost elements of those vehicles. This lack of information puts \nconsumers at a disadvantage, forcing many to pay premium prices to \nrepair simple parts at dealerships or travel long distances to reach \nrepair shops that take valuable time away from families and work.\n  There are over 219,000 employees working in over 26,000 independent \nrepair shops in California, providing those workers with good paying \njobs. In this economy, we can't afford to disadvantage small businesses \nworking hard to support their families.\n  The Boxer-Brownback bill will require car manufacturers to provide \nall information and tools necessary to diagnose, service, maintain and \nrepair a motor vehicle, including all safety alerts, access codes and \nrecalls. This information must be provided to all repair shops, not \njust dealers or manufacturers' designated shops.\n  Our bill also protects the integrity of manufacturers' concepts and \nsystems by not requiring manufacturers to make public any information \nthat is entitled to protection as a trade secret.\n  As cars become more complex and expensive to repair, consumers \ndeserve to have choices when it comes to repairing their auto vehicles. \nThis bill provides consumers that choice, while ensuring small \nbusinesses have the information they need in these difficult economic \ntimes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 3185. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Federal land to Elko County, Nevada, and to take land into \ntrust for the Te-moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Elko Motocross and Tribal Conveyance Act of \n2010.\n  As you may know, the Federal Government manages more than 87 percent \nof the land in Nevada, which equates to more than 61 million acres. \nThis fact makes it necessary for our communities to pursue Federal \nremedies for problems that can be handled in a much more expeditious \nmanner in States that have more private land than we do. This bill, for \ninstance, would transfer one small parcel of land to Elko County and \nanother to the Elko Indian Colony. Both conveyances will provide \nimportant benefits to the residents of northeastern Nevada, and both \nconveyances require congressional action.\n  The first title of this Act would convey approximately 300 acres of \npublic land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, Elko Field \nOffice to Elko County. This proposal, which is strongly supported by \nthe local community, would clear the way for the construction of a BMX, \nmotocross, off-highway vehicle, and stock car racing area. It is worth \nnoting that Elko County tried for many years to work\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\nthrough the normal administrative process to get a recreation and \npublic purposes lease on this land, but the local BLM field office has \nbeen unable to process the request due to a very high workload.\n  Off-road vehicles are an important part of life in rural Nevada. In \nresponse to this interest, Elko County has attempted to provide a \nvariety of motorized recreational opportunities for both residents and \nvisitors. This legislation will help the City of Elko develop a \ncentralized, multipurpose recreational facility on the western edge of \nthe city with easy access to Interstate-80. The new Elko Motocross Park \nwill eliminate traffic and noise issues caused by the existing stock \ncar racing track. The new park will also draw OHV enthusiasts from \nacross northeastern Nevada, which will, in turn, provide an economic \nboost to local businesses.\n  Beyond the convenient location, economic benefits, and potential for \ndiverse recreational opportunities at the Elko Motocross Park site, \nthis new complex will provide a place for people to learn responsible \nuse and enjoyment of recreational vehicles. I believe this facility \nwill be a model for other communities in the West that are interested \nin creating safe, centralized recreation areas for motorsports. I would \nalso like to commend Elko County, the State of Nevada, the Nevada \nAssociation of Counties and many others for working together on recent \nstatewide initiatives that will encourage the sustainable use of off-\nhighway vehicles on public lands.\n  Title II of this Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to make a \nreasonable expansion of the Elko Indian Colony by taking approximately \n373 acres of land into trust for the Elko Band to address their need \nfor additional land. The Elko Band is one of four constituent bands \nthat make up the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada. \nEach band has a separate reservation or colony in northeastern Nevada. \nWhile the Elko Band's population has steadily grown, their land base \nhas remained the same for over 75 years.\n  The histories of the City of Elko and the Elko Indian Colony have \nlong been intertwined. Elko was established as a railroad town in 1868 \nwith the construction of the Central Pacific, part of the first \ntranscontinental railroad. Shoshone families lived nearby and worked on \nthe railroad as well as in the nearby mines and on local ranches. \nDespite government efforts to relocate the Elko Band in the late \nnineteenth century, these families persevered and remained in the Elko \narea. In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson created the Elko Indian Colony \nwhen he reserved 160 acres near Elko for the Shoshone Indians by \nexecutive order.\n  The Elko Indian Colony has always been a thriving part of the greater \nElko community. Unfortunately, while more than half of the Elko Band's \nenrolled members live and work in Elko, the Elko Colony has one of the \nsmallest land bases of the four constituent bands. Over 350 tribal \nmembers must live outside of the colony because it lacks land for \nadditional housing and housing related community development. Our \nlegislation would address this need by making land available for \nresidential and commercial development, or for traditional uses, such \nas ceremonial gatherings, hunting and plant collecting.\n  I also want to highlight that this legislation is designed to protect \nthe city's rights-of-way that cross the land in question. We have also \nreceived letters expressing strong support for this tribal conveyance \nfrom both the City of Elko and Elko County.\n  It is always encouraging when communities come together to support \nprojects like these and we are grateful for their collective work on \nthis effort. This bill is vital to the growing communities we serve. We \nlook forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member \nMurkowski and the other distinguished committee members to move this \nbill through the process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan investment tax credit for biomass heating property; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help grow the U.S. manufacturing base in alternative energy \ntechnologies, create jobs and help get our country running on clean \nenergy.\n  We have known for decades that our Nation's dependence on foreign oil \nundermines our economic and national security.\n  According to the Department of Energy, New Hampshire households are \nsome of the most petroleum dependent in the country due to our reliance \non heating oil to provide heat. Almost 60 percent of homes in New \nHampshire use oil for heating purposes. Many New Hampshire businesses--\nlarge and small--are also dependent on heating oil.\n  In fact, thermal energy, or heat, accounts for roughly 30 percent of \ntotal U.S. energy consumption. Thermal energy is used every day by \nhomes, businesses and industrial facilities across the country for a \nvariety of needs--most commonly for space heating, heating water and \nindustrial processes that require heat.\n  We need to move away from our dependence on fossil fuels and I am \nconvinced that biomass, used effectively and sustainably, can help to \ndo that by, in part, meeting our country's thermal energy needs.\n  Forests are one of our Nation's greatest assets. In my home State of \nNew Hampshire, the second most forested State in the country, forestry \nis an important part of our economy. Forestland supports a thriving \nforest products industry and provides many outdoor recreational \nopportunities that play a key role in attracting tourists to the State. \nBut I think greater potential exists for our forests in New Hampshire \nand across the country to help meet our energy challenges--using \nbiomass to meet the heating needs of our homes, businesses and \ncommunities.\n  New Hampshire and a number of other States are already leading the \nway to address how high efficiency biomass systems can cut our energy \ndependence on foreign oil and support our forest industry. Communities \nand businesses across New Hampshire are putting our State's immense \nbiomass resources--from forestry and agricultural residues--to use for \ncreating electricity and thermal energy. These investments in clean, \nrenewable biomass energy are supporting our forest industry and also \ncreating new industries and jobs across New Hampshire.\n  There is so much untapped potential for biomass energy, and that is \nwhat my legislation is about.\n  The American Renewable Biomass Heating Act would provide an \ninvestment tax credit, ITC, of 30 percent of the cost of installing a \nhigh efficiency biomass system in commercial and industrial buildings. \nThe tax credit would be available for biomass heating systems placed in \nservice on or before December 31, 2013.\n  By incentivizing high efficiency biomass boilers and furnaces, we can \nhelp to replace our reliance on fossil fuel with clean, domestically \nproduced renewable energy.\n  This bill would also put biomass on an even playing field with other \nalternative energy technologies and fuel sources, such as wind, solar, \nand geothermal. Thus far, Federal policies to promote the development \nand use of alternative energy have focused largely on transportation \nfuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, and electricity from hydro, wind, \nand solar. My legislation puts high efficiency biomass on an even \nplaying field with other alternative energy technologies.\n  Most importantly, my legislation will help jumpstart the domestic \nmanufacturing base. For years, European countries have invested in and \nincentivized the development of these technologies. There is no reason \nwhy we cannot build this equipment right here in the U.S.\n  The bipartisan legislation I am introducing today with Senators Lisa \nMurkowski, Mark Begich and Mike Crapo will provide the incentives \nbusinesses are looking for to invest in clean energy. Our legislation \nis about American power--clean energy technologies and equipment that \nare made right here in America and create jobs for American workers.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me in \nintroducing this important, job-creating legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass the American Renewable Biomass Heating \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Renewable Biomass \n     Heating Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT FOR BIOMASS HEATING PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 48(a)(3) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining energy property) \n     is amended by striking ``or'' at the end of clause (vi), by \n     inserting ``or'' at the end of clause (vii), and by inserting \n     after clause (vii) the following new clause:\n       ``(viii) biomass heating property, including boilers or \n     furnaces which operate at output efficiencies greater than 75 \n     percent and which provide thermal energy in the form of heat, \n     hot water, or steam for space heating, air conditioning, \n     domestic hot water, or industrial process heat, but only with \n     respect to periods ending before January 1, 2014,''.\n       (b) 30 Percent Credit.--Clause (i) of section 48(a)(2)(A) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``and'' at the end of subclause (III) and by inserting after \n     subclause (IV) the following new subclause:\n\n       ``(V) energy property described in paragraph (3)(A)(viii), \n     and''.\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to periods after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, in taxable years ending after such date, under \n     rules similar to the rules of section 48(m) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (as in effect on the day before the date \n     of the enactment of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/25/senate-section/article/S2129-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2129-S2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 469--RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                     FULBRIGHT PROGRAM IN THAILAND\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Bond) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S.
