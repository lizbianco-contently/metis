Mr. President, I realize we are not on the Interior \nappropriations bill at this point; we are in morning business, but I \nwanted to speak briefly about three amendments I plan to offer, when we \ndo go on the Interior appropriations bill, and to alert colleagues \nabout those amendments and, hopefully, persuade them that they are \nmeritorious.\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\n  The first amendment incorporates the key provisions of the FLAME Act, \nwhich establishes a separate appropriations account to fund Federal \nemergency wildfire suppression costs in an effort to initiate a more \nsustainable effort for funding Federal firefighting activities.\n  We have seen a dramatic growth in the number, the size, and the \nseverity of wildfires in recent years. The trend and the number of \nacres burned by wildfires each year has tripled over the last 25 years, \nexceeding 8 million acres in 4 of the last 5 years.\n  While the agencies consistently have put out about 98 percent of the \nfires quickly and inexpensively, we have seen many fires that have been \nso extreme it takes weeks and months of effort and many millions of \ndollars to get those fires under control. The recent Station fire in \nsouthern California is one example. It is now nearly 4 weeks since that \nfire started. It has burned more than 160,000 acres. It still is not \n100 percent contained. At times, there have been over 5,000 personnel \nassigned to the fire. Fire crews have built more than 130 miles of fire \nline, with the support of more than two dozen helicopters and \nairplanes, hundreds of fire engines, and more than 65 bulldozers. The \npricetag for these efforts is more than $85 million and still counting.\n  The Forest Service's costs for fighting wildfires have increased \nsevenfold over the last 20 years. Yet we still budget for wildfires the \nsame way we did 20 years ago. We take the average of the previous 10 \nyears of fire suppression costs out of the agencies' budgets, and we \nmake that their standard appropriation for each year. Back then, \nwildfire management accounted for less than 20 percent of the Forest \nService's budget. That was 20 years ago. Today, wildfire management \naccounts for 50 percent of the Forest Service's budget.\n  Not surprisingly, the Forest Service has exceeded that budget every \nyear for more than a decade--as it is mathematically guaranteed to do \nwith the wildfire trends we have seen. As a result, the agencies have \nhad to borrow and to steal literally billions of dollars from other \nprograms--such as recreation and grazing and wildlife and even fuels \nreduction--to pay for emergency wildfire suppression.\n  In sum, our wildfire budgeting practices are broken, and they are \nsteadily breaking the Forest Service and the communities and businesses \nand natural resources that the Forest Service is committed to serving. \nThese troubling trends are only expected to get worse as a result of \ncontinuing climate change and population growth in and around our \nnational forests.\n  The amendment I plan to offer seeks to establish a new paradigm for \nfunding Federal wildfire suppression activities. Under the amendment, \nthe agencies would continue to rely on their regular appropriations \naccounts to fund their routine wildfire suppression costs; that is, the \napproximately 98 percent of fires they can either swiftly put out or \ncan manage for a resource benefit. But when they end up battling a \nlarge and extreme wildfire--such as the fire in southern California--\nthey could access a new emergency account to cover the exorbitant costs \nof fighting those kinds of fires.\n\n  If funded as intended, the new emergency account would ensure \nCongress would not have to raid the rest of the agencies' budgets to \nmake appropriations for wildfire suppression. It also would ensure that \nthe agencies would no longer have to steal funds from the other \nprograms for which Congress has proposed funding in order to pay for \nunbudgeted costs of fighting the massive fires that require an \nemergency response.\n  Thanks to the leadership of the administration, Senator Feinstein, \nand the Appropriations Committee, for the first time in many years, the \nunderlying bill would provide an appropriate amount of money for \nwildfire suppression. As a result, the amendment I am offering merely \nshifts money into a new emergency account. It does not result in any \nincrease in spending.\n  The amendment will be cosponsored by a number of other Members. I \nappreciate their support, as well as support of many dozens of interest \ngroups. I would also like to mention that the FLAME Act passed the \nHouse of Representatives in March by a vote of 412 to 3. So I believe \nthis is a proposal that has broad support on both sides of the aisle \nand on both sides of Capitol Hill.\n  The second amendment I plan to offer simply provides for the funds \nthat are already allocated to the Forest Landscape Restoration Act to \nbe deposited in the special fund that was established to carry out that \nact. This amendment also will be cosponsored by a number of other \nMembers. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Chairman \nFeinstein, who coauthored the Forest Landscape Restoration Act with me, \nand Senator Domenici and Ranking Member Alexander for including funding \nfor this important program.\n  Finally, Senator Murkowski and I plan to offer an amendment that \nwould make two technical improvements to the National Forest Foundation \nAct. Again, I hope these amendments will be adopted. I appreciate the \nconsideration of the two managers of the bill for these three \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9576-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9576-S9578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the last several months Congress has \nbeen engaged in a vigorous debate about how to achieve health care \nreform. Despite the President's repeated claims to the contrary, we all \nagree, Republicans and Democrats, that some reforms are necessary.\n  Costs are too high for families and businesses. Too many Americans \nlack access to affordable options. We need to make health insurance \nmore affordable and more portable.\n  There are two basic approaches before Congress: reforms that impose \nmuch more government control over health care or reforms that provide \nconsumers with more affordable options and keep control of health care \ndecisions with families and doctors.\n  I happen to believe that the latter approach is better, that we must \nempower patients and doctors, not bureaucrats and politicians, to make \nhealth care decisions. I think it is clear that after the August \nrecess, a majority of Americans rejected a Washington takeover of \nhealth care, along with the mountains of new taxes and debt and \nbureaucracy it would create.\n  While I appreciate the hard work of the Finance Committee chairman in \ntrying to write a more acceptable bill, the end result is little better \nthan the others, that is, the government's near total control over \nhealth insurance, and therefore the delivery of your health care.\n  Along the way, it would also spend nearly $1 trillion and cut \nMedicare benefits by nearly half a trillion. The Finance Committee \nchairman's bill is a tangled web of federally documented insurance \nregulations which would control every aspect of health insurance from \ncovered benefits to permissible premiums.\n  The bill would centralize the power of medical decisions with \npoliticians and bureaucrats, not patients and doctors. It would result \nin higher health insurance premiums, less consumer choice, and \nultimately the rationing of health care.\n  How would the government take over health care under this bill? There \nare two key provisions that would result in government-run health care \nfor practically all Americans, and empower bureaucrats at the expense \nof patients.\n  The first is a requirement that every American buy an insurance \npolicy. The second is a regulatory entity called the insurance \nexchange. First, let's talk about this mandate for everyone to buy an \ninsurance policy. The chairman's plan imposes this individual mandate \nfor all individuals to purchase a government-approved policy. To \nrepeat, not just any insurance, but government-approved and therefore \ngovernment-defined insurance.\n  Those who do not comply face steep fees--or fines, I should say--\nranging from a $750 to a $3,800 per-year fine. The mandate constitutes \ndirect interference in health care with a host of\n\n[[Page S9577]]\n\nnew regulations that control the insurance plans that would become \navailable to consumers.\n  Michael Cannon, a health policy expert at the Cato Institute, says \nthat the individual mandate would be the ``most sweeping and dangerous \nmeasure in any of the bills before Congress.''\n  He goes on to say: ``Compulsory health insurance is nationalized \nhealth insurance, with all that implies for health costs and quality.''\n  The second control mechanism is an insurance exchange through which \nall small business and individual market policies must be sold, and \neventually large plans would participate as well.\n  The exchange's core function is to impose a new set of Federal rules \nthat literally control everything the companies can and must do. Here \nare some examples. All companies must offer two government-specified \nbenefit options--they define it as a silver and gold plan--or else the \ninsurer cannot offer any insurance at all. So they have to offer two \nspecifically defined insurance plans. But they can't offer more than \nfour specific types regardless of consumer needs or preferences. It is \nlike telling the car companies they each have to make two kinds of cars \nand they can't make any more than four kinds of cars. That is exactly \nwhat we are talking about, the Federal Government telling the insurance \ncompanies: This is the way you have to offer it--you have to offer at \nleast two and you can't offer any more than four.\n  All of the plans must comply with new Federal rating rules. That is \nhow limits on premiums are established. They have to issue coverage to \neveryone regardless of health status and not cap total coverage \nregardless of cost. They have to comply with mandatory limits on copays \nand deductibles. They have to cover a broad range of medical benefits \nin addition to State-mandated benefits regardless of whether consumers \nwant them.\n  All of this is subject to change from Washington depending on what \npoliticians or bureaucrats believe you need. Remember, it will be \nillegal for you not to buy this insurance. You will notice that all of \nthese things are required, and it is Washington that is doing the \nrequiring.\n  Under this plan, insurers would no longer retain the flexibility to \ndesign insurance products that would satisfy specific consumer \npreferences. The Federal Government would dictate that all policies \nmust offer the same package of benefits, the same types of plans.\n  Rather than having the freedom to compete, insurers would in essence \nbecome prepaid health payment utilities since the Federal Government \nwould, as the Wall Street Journal editorialized last Thursday, \nessentially be writing all insurance contracts. Since every aspect of \ninsurance coverage would be controlled by Washington and everyone would \nhave to buy the insurance, the government would control how your health \ncare is paid for and therefore how it is delivered.\n  A final point about this insurance exchange. Since it will change the \nkind of insurance that can be sold, if you lose your current insurance, \nregardless of whether you bought the policy yourself or you got it \nthrough an employer, you will likely not be able to find that similar \npolicy in the future. They will all be different. Insurers will have to \ncomply with the new Federal rules, and that will change the coverage. \nThis is one of the reasons the President was wrong when he repeatedly \nsaid: If you like your insurance, you get to keep it. That insurance \nsimply is not going to be around anymore once the companies have to \ncomply with the requirements of the exchange. There will be all new \ninsurance policies written at that point.\n  The proponents of this radical change justify it on the assertion \nthat it will bend the cost curve. In other words, it will reduce costs. \nBut the problem is that massive new regulations will actually increase \ncosts. The Council for Affordable Health Insurance found that mandating \nuniversal coverage and regulations in the bill, such as guaranteed \nissue and modified community rating, will increase the cost of health \ninsurance between 75 and 95 percent.\n  In addition, note that the chairman's plan does not grandfather \ninsurance plans currently offered by small businesses, so they would \nhave to comply with these new Federal rating rules over a 5-year \nperiod, so that in short order premiums would rise for many small \nbusinesses and their employees as well. Of course, the newly \nestablished mandated benefits would also add to the increased cost.\n  Suppose, for example, a healthy individual or family prefers to have \na less comprehensive package with a higher deductible. Say a young \nfamily of four with two children and two 35-year-old parents wants to \nbuy a CIGNA PPO plan from the individual market with a $2,000 \ndeductible. In my hometown of Phoenix, that plan currently costs $512 a \nmonth. If the reforms included in the chairman's plan were implemented, \nthe price of that plan would nearly double to $998 per month.\n  The experts who said the cost of health insurance premiums would rise \nbetween 75 and 95 percent are right on the mark with regard to this \nreal-life example I gave with a real-life insurance policy for a family \nof four in Phoenix. Instead of purchasing health care coverage that is \npersonalized to their needs and budget, this family would be forced to \npurchase coverage they may not want for routine care that can be paid \nout of pocket or coverage for diseases and conditions that tend not to \nafflict their age group. Since insurers would not be allowed to charge \naccording to risk, a low-risk family such as this one would have to pay \nmore to make up for coverage needed by high-risk individuals.\n  Of course, I am not suggesting we turn a blind eye to the needs of \nAmericans, for example, suffering from preexisting health conditions. \nThey struggle to purchase affordable health insurance. We have to \naddress that issue. But that does not require a total Washington \ntakeover of all insurance policies, and it doesn't require raising \ninsurance premiums for millions of other Americans and small \nbusinesses.\n  In my view, despite all of these other problems I have discussed, the \nmost damaging impact of this takeover by the Federal Government is the \ninevitable rationing, the delay and denial of health care to American \ncitizens. Since new Federal mandates and requirements would raise \nhealth care costs, politicians will have to search for ways to control \nspiraling premiums. When traditional cost-containment measures fail, \nsuch as reducing provider reimbursements or reducing how much doctors \nget paid, the government's only option is to control how much health \ncare everyone receives. That means rationing.\n  For a preview of how this plan would lead to rationing, we need only \nlook to the State of Massachusetts where a law was passed in 2006 \nrequiring all residents to obtain health insurance. In fact, the State \ninsurance market now looks like the market that would be created by the \nchairman's bill, with its guaranteed issue and modified community \nrating, State-approved plan types and benefit mandates.\n  Massachusetts health care spending is consuming an increasing share \nof the State's budget. The State passed a $1-per-pack increase in the \nState's cigarette tax, $89 million in fees and assessments on health \ncare providers and insurers, and cost-sharing increases. It has even \nordered insurers to cut provider reimbursements by 3 to 5 percent. But \nthese measures still do not produce enough revenue to cover costs, \nleaving the State with few options. As a result, a special commission \nwas created by the State legislature which developed a list of options \nto control costs, such as ``exclud[ing] coverage of services of low \npriority/value'' and ``limit[ing] coverage to services that produce the \nhighest value when considering both the clinical effectiveness and \ncost''--in other words, rationing. You ration health care when you say: \nWe will figure in here how much it costs, how much we have available, \nand therefore how much we can afford to provide. People who have to \nhave that care are therefore going to be the ones who suffer.\n  This is exactly what happens under the chairman's proposal as well. \nIt would establish a panel of health care stakeholders to identify \nphysician services that are overvalued in the Medicare physician fee \nschedule and create a Medicare commission that would propose automatic \nMedicare cuts, even if Congress fails to adopt them. Our constituents \nrely upon us to protect the benefits we have promised\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\nthem, but what we are going to do in this legislation is establish a \ncommission which would provide for automatic Medicare cuts. If Congress \ndoesn't act affirmatively to somehow stop that from going into effect, \nit goes into effect. That is abdicating our responsibility to act as \ntheir representatives and, worse, putting somebody else in charge of \ndeciding what is best for our Medicare constituents.\n  So when costs grow out of control, the government will adjust the \nvolume of care provided based on how much it is willing to spend; that \nis to say, to ration your health care.\n  The fact that the Baucus bill does not include the so-called public \noption, the government-run insurance company, does not mean it does not \notherwise totally regulate health care delivery. Together, an \nindividual mandate to buy particular insurance and the regulatory \ninsurance exchange, the two key provisions in the plan, facilitate the \ngovernment's takeover of health care--some of it government run, all of \nit government controlled. No longer would families and doctors have the \nfinal say. It is almost unthinkable that this could happen in the \nUnited States.\n  Republicans have proposed ideas that would improve access and lower \nthe cost of care, including real medical liability reform, allowing \npeople to buy lower cost insurance across State lines, making the tax \ntreatment of health care more fair for those who purchase insurance on \ntheir own, and removing barriers to health savings accounts.\n  These are better alternatives than the entire takeover of the system \nas proposed in the chairman's bill. We all favor health care reform. \nRepublicans favor measures that lower costs and improve access and, \nimportantly, empower patients, not government bureaucrats.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2996, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2996) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior, environment and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are back on the fiscal year 2010 \nInterior appropriations bill, which we started on Thursday of last \nweek. Chairman Feinstein will be joining us shortly, but she asked me \nto say there is no reason why Members cannot come to the floor now and \noffer their amendments for the purposes of debate.\n  We have a busy schedule ahead of us and want to try to complete \naction on this bill and the remaining appropriations bills for fiscal \nyear 2010, so I ask my colleagues to please come and offer your \namendments and work with our respective staffs so we can get as much \ndone today as possible.\n  Mr. President, I see no other Senator on the floor, so I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. But what I plan to do is, if a Senator comes with an \namendment for the appropriations bill, I will yield to that Senator, \nand then after that I will resume my remarks if I am not finished.\n\n\n                             Nuclear Power\n\n  Mr. President, if health care were not our first concern today, \nenergy and climate change would be. It is lurking in the shadows, \nhaving had a lot of work done in the House, and it is about to come \nbefore the Senate. So as to the remarks I wish to make today, if I had \nto put a title on them, I would choose this: What the United States \nshould really fear about nuclear power.\n  Communications experts say fear is the best way to get attention when \nyou are trying to win an argument. Groups who oppose nuclear power have \ncertainly mastered that technique by playing to economic, \nenvironmental, and safety fears.\n  So I wish to introduce a little element of fear into my argument \nhere. I want to suggest what could happen if we do not adopt nuclear \npower as a more important part of our energy future, if Russia and \nChina and India and a lot of other countries go with nuclear--as they \nare now--while we get left behind. Are we going to be able to compete \nwith countries that have cheap, clean, reliable nuclear power while we \nare stuck with a bunch of windmills and solar farms, producing \nexpensive, unreliable energy or, more likely, not much energy at all? \nThe whole prospect of the United States ignoring this problem-solving \ntechnology that we invented is what I fear most about nuclear power.\n  Let me give you an idea of what I am talking about. A few years ago, \nin January 2006, the Chinese sent a delegation of nuclear scientists \nand administrators to the United States on a fact-finding mission. They \ntoured the Idaho National Laboratory, the Argonne National Laboratory, \nand they visited GE and Westinghouse, trying to decide which technology \nto choose for their nuclear program.\n  Now you might wonder why anyone would be seeking our advice about \nnuclear power when we haven't issued a construction permit to build a \nnew reactor in the past 30 years. But as Kathryn McCarthy, deputy \ndirector of the Idaho National Laboratory, said at the time:\n\n       The world still looks to us for leadership in this \n     technology. They'd prefer to copy what we've already done. \n     They don't like being on the cutting edge.\n\n  Well, that may have been true in 2006, but it's not anymore. The \nChinese eventually chose Westinghouse technology for their first \nreactors. At the time, Westinghouse was an American company. In 2007, \nToshiba bought Westinghouse, so now it is a Japanese-based company. \nThen when the Chinese got their Westinghouse reactor, they insisted on \nhaving all the specifications so they could see how it was put \ntogether. That is what we call ``reverse engineering.'' As you might \nguess, China's next wave of reactors is going to be built with Chinese \ntechnology.\n  By 2008, the Chinese had shovels in the ground. The first four \nWestinghouse reactors are scheduled for completion by 2011. They also \nbought a pair of Russian reactors, which should be finished around the \nsame time. They started talking about building 60 reactors over the \nnext 20 years and just recently raised it to 132. They're in the \nnuclear business.\n  What have we accomplished in the meantime? Well, people in the United \nStates have been talking about a ``nuclear renaissance'' in this \ncountry since the turn of the century. In 2007, NRG, a New Jersey \ncompany, filed the first application to build a new reactor in 30 \nyears. They're still at the beginning of what promises to be at least a \n5-year licensing process before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. No \none really knows how long this will take, since as soon as the licenses \nare issued, opponents will file lawsuits and the whole thing will move \nto the courts. If they are lucky, they might have a reactor up and \nrunning by 2020. Other companies have followed suit, and there are now \n34 proposals before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but nobody in \nthe United States has yet broken ground. So it is not likely the \nChinese will be coming to us any time soon for more tips on how to \nbuild reactors. In fact, we will probably be going to them.\n  That is one aspect of what is going on in the world today. Here is \nanother. As countries began constructing new reactors, it quickly \nbecame clear that the bottleneck would be in forging the steel reactor \nvessels. These are the huge, three-story-high, forged steel units that \nhold the fuel assembly--the reactor core. That means forging steel \nparts that may weigh as much as 500 tons.\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\n  In 2007, the only place you could order a reactor vessel was at the \nJapan Steel Works, and they were backed up for 4 years. Everyone \nstarted saying: This is going to be what holds up the world's nuclear \nrenaissance. They will never be able to produce enough of those \npressure vessels.\n  So what happened? Well, first, Japan Steel Works invested $800 \nmillion to triple its capacity. They are going to be turning out 12 \npressure vessels a year by 2012. Then the Chinese decided to build \ntheir own forge. In less than 2 years, they put up a furnace that can \nhandle 320-ton parts. They turned out their first components in June. \nNow they are building two more forges. So, you see, the Chinese will \nnot be standing in line in Japan any time soon. The Russians are doing \nthe same thing. They are in the midst of a big revival, planning to \ndouble the production of electricity from nuclear power by 2020. They \nare also building a forge and just cast their first 600-ton ingot in \nJune. France, Britain, South Korea, and India are all following suit. \nVery soon, every major nuclear country in the world is going to be able \nto forge its own reactor vessels, except one--and that is us, the \nUnited States.\n  No steel company in America is capable of forging ingots of more than \n270 tons. We are still stuck in the 1960s. That means when it comes to \nbuilding reactors, we will have to stand in line in Japan or somewhere \nelse. In fact, just about everything in our first new reactors is going \nto be imported. The nuclear industry tells us that at least 70 percent \nof the materials and equipment that go into these first few reactors \nwill come from abroad. That is because we have let our nuclear supply \nindustry wither on the vine. In 1990, there were 150 domestic suppliers \nmaking parts for nuclear reactors. Today, there are only 40, and most \nof them do their business overseas. Of the 34 proposals before our \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, 20 are designed by Westinghouse, now a \nJapanese company, and nine are from AREVA, the French giant. General \nElectric, the only American company left on the field, has partnered \nwith Hitachi. They together sold five reactors to American utilities \nbut fared poorly in the competition for Federal loan guarantees. Two \nutilities have now canceled those projects, and there are rumors that \nGE may quit the field entirely. They do not seem very enthusiastic \nanymore about nuclear anyway. Have you seen those GE ads for windmills? \nThey are all over the place. Have you seen their ad for the smart grid, \nwhere a little girl says: ``The sun is still shining in Arizona''? That \nwas pretty good too. Now have you seen any GE ads, in this day of \nconcern about climate change, that say that 70 percent of our carbon-\nfree electricity comes from nuclear power? I certainly haven't.\n\n  Babcock & Wilcox is the one American company that stirred some \ninterest recently when it announced plans for a new ``mini reactor.'' \nThis is a 125-megawatt unit that can be manufactured at the factory and \nshipped by rail to the site, where several units can be fit together \nlike Lego blocks. This left the impression that America might be \ninnovating again, forging back into the lead. But the complete \nprototype for the Babcock & Wilcox reactor is still 2 years away, and \nthen it may take another 5 years to get the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission's design approval. Meanwhile, the Russians are already \nbuilding a mini reactor that will be floated into a Siberian village on \na barge to produce power. The Russians have already got orders for mini \nreactors from 12 countries. So in spite of Babcock & Wilcox's fine \neffort--and I am certainly proud of them--the Russians are considerably \nahead of us.\n  Let's take stock. There are 40 reactors now under construction in 11 \ncountries around the word--not one of them in the United States of \nAmerica. In fact, only two are in Western Europe: one in Finland and \nthe other in France, both built by AREVA. All the rest are in Asia. \nAlthough we have not gotten used to it, Asia may soon be leading the \nworld in nuclear technology.\n  Japan has 55 reactors and gets 35 percent of its electricity from \nnuclear energy, almost double the 19 percent we get here in the United \nStates. The Japanese have two reactors under construction and plans for \n10 more by 2018. The Japanese are finding they can build a reactor, \nstart to finish, in less than 4 years. That is less time than it takes \nto get one American reactor through licensing at the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  South Korea gets nearly 40 percent of its electricity from nuclear--\nthat is twice as much as we do--and is planning another 8 reactors by \n2015. So far, they have bought their reactors from the Japanese, but \nnow they have their own Korean next-generation reactor--a 1,400-\nmegawatt giant evolved from an American design. They plan to bring two \nof these on line by 2016. Taiwan also gets 18 percent of its \nelectricity from nuclear and is building two new reactors.\n  In September, Bloomberg News reported that Japan Steel Works' stock \nhad risen 8 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange because of China's \ndecision to double future construction from 60 to 132 new reactors. \nThey figure they will get some of the action at Japan Steel Works. Much \nof China's $586 billion stimulus package is going toward developing \nnuclear power. ``While China had been focusing on building new coal \nplants,'' said Bloomberg, ``it has now shifted its focus to nuclear \nbecause of the environmental issue,'' said Ikuo Sato, president of \nJapan Steel Works, in Bloomberg.\n\n  Meanwhile, India is embracing thorium, a technology a lot of people \nthink may eventually replace uranium as nuclear fuel. Thorium is twice \nas abundant as uranium and doesn't produce the plutonium everybody \nworries will be used to make a bomb. There is a lot of enthusiasm for \nthorium among scientists in our country. But it is India that is going \nahead, with 6 reactors under construction and 10 more planned. They \nbegan with a Russian design, but they are also trying some American \ntechnology they acquired in signing their 2005 agreement with the Bush \nadministration.\n  What about Chernobyl. Well, just like everybody else, Russia stopped \nall construction on new nuclear reactors after that horrible accident. \nBut they learned their lesson and started constructing much safer \nreactors in the 1990s, completing the first in 2001. Now they have \nplans to expand along the lines of France, building two reactors every \nyear from now through 2030. They have a very good reason. Russia has \nhuge natural gas supplies, but it is wasting them by using one-third of \nit to produce electricity. They could get six times the price by \nselling natural gas to Western Europe. So they are replacing gas \ngeneration with nuclear--which is exactly the opposite of what we are \ndoing here. Since 1990, every major power plant built in this country \nburns natural gas. We now get 20 percent of our electricity from \nnatural gas--more than nuclear's 19 percent, and the natural gas \npercent is still going up.\n  And be aware, all these countries that are developing nuclear just \naren't building them for themselves. They are selling to the rest of \nthe world as well. AREVA is building reactors in Finland, China, Italy, \nBrazil, and Abu Dhabi. The Russians have signed deals with China, Iran, \nIndia, Nigeria, and Venezuela. They are even selling to us. In July, \nTenex, Russia's uranium corporation, signed a long-term contract to \nsupply fuel to Constellation Energy, which has reactors in Maryland and \nupstate New York. It was the sixth contract Tenex signed with an \nAmerican utility in the past 2 months.\n  How did the Russians end up supplying us with uranium? It is a long, \ninteresting story and the most important players stood and worked on \nthis Senate floor. In 1996, Senator Sam Nunn, Senator Pete Domenici, \nand Senator Richard Lugar pioneered a remarkable deal with the post-\nSoviet Government, in which we would buy highly enriched uranium from \nold Soviet bomb stocks. The uranium would be sent to France, where it \nwould be ``blended down'' from 90 percent fissionable material to 3 \npercent to be used in American reactors. For the last two decades, old \nSoviet stockpiles have supplied half our nuclear fuel. One out of every \nten light bulbs in America is now powered by a former Soviet weapon--\none of the greatest swords-into-plowshares efforts in history, although \nfew people seem to know about it. Now the Russians have learned to do \nde-enrichment themselves. They have decided they don't need France. \nThey say: Hey, we don't have to import this stuff anymore; we will \nproduce it here.\n\n[[Page S9580]]\n\nOf course, producing things is one way countries get rich and its \ncitizens improve their standard of living.\n  Once upon a time we were pioneers in nuclear technology. Forty years \nago, we were the only people in the world who knew how to deal with the \natom. That is not true anymore. We have shied away from the technology \nwhile everyone else has forged ahead. Even Europe is coming back. The \nBritish have announced they are going nuclear. They have hired the \nFrench national electric company to help. Italy closed all its nuclear \nreactors right after Chernobyl but ended up importing 80 percent of \ntheir electricity at a huge cost. Now they have announced they are \ngoing back to nuclear as well. France already gets 80 percent of its \npower from nuclear and has the cheapest electricity in Europe, not to \nmention the second lowest carbon emissions, behind Sweden, which is \nhalf nuclear. France also sells $80 billion worth of electricity to the \nrest of Europe each year. Notice how well France did in the last \nturndown--it barely went into recession at all. That is not because the \nFrench spend less on government or work harder than us or take fewer \nvacations. It is because nuclear power is helping to keep their whole \neconomy afloat.\n  So does that mean we have fallen completely behind? Not at all. In \nfact, there is a great irony to all this. We still know how to run \nreactors better than anyone else in the world. Our fleet of 104 plants \nis up and running 90 percent of the time. No one else even comes close. \nFrance, for all its experience, is still at 80 percent. Other countries \nare even lower. We still understand the technology better than anyone \nelse in the world. But because we have placed so many obstacles in our \npath, we aren't allowed to build reactors anymore. And that is what \nscares me. We are gradually losing our economic place in the world.\n  Now a lot of people say: Well, what is the difference? So what if we \nfall behind on nuclear technology. We will forge ahead with something \nelse. Well, there are several reasons to be concerned:\n  First, there is energy security. America already spends $300 billion \na year importing two-thirds of our oil from other countries. If we \nremain on the current path of no new nuclear power or start depending \non other countries to build our reactors and supply us with fuel, we \nare going to be even more vulnerable than we are today. The best way to \nreduce imported oil, aside from ramping up domestic production, will be \nto use electricity to power cars and trucks. At first, we can plug our \nelectric vehicles in at night when there is much unused electricity. \nAfter that, we should be using nuclear. We can't have Americans going \nto bed every night hoping the wind will blow so they can start their \ncars in the morning.\n  Second, there is the matter of technological leadership. Americans \nproduce, year in and year out, 25 percent of all the wealth in the \nworld. Most of that wealth has been driven by new technologies. We were \nthe birthplace of the telephone, the electric light, the automobile, \nthe assembly line, radio, television, and the computer. But nuclear \nenergy--perhaps the greatest scientific advance of the 20th century--is \npassing us by. The 21st century is going to run on clean, cheap, \ngreenhouse-gas-free nuclear power. And, how can we criticize India and \nChina for not reducing their carbon emissions when we refuse to adopt \nthe best technology ourselves?\n  Then there is weapons proliferation. In the 1970s, we gave up on \nnuclear reprocessing in the hope that by not dealing with plutonium, we \nwould prevent nuclear weapons from spreading around the world. That has \nturned out to be an unwise decision. France, Britain, Russia, Canada, \nand Japan went right on reprocessing and no one has stolen plutonium \nfrom them. Instead, rogue countries, such as North Korea and Pakistan, \nhave found their own ways to develop nuclear weapons. The technology of \nbomb making is no big secret anymore. The real problem is that by \nreneging on world leadership, we have left the field to others. For \ninstance, right now the Russians are building a commercial reactor for \nHugo Chavez in Venezuela. He is not exactly friendly toward the United \nStates. To make things more interesting, Manhattan District Attorney \nMorganthau recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal that his office \nhas recently uncovered evidence that Iran may be providing Venezuela \nwith missile technology.\n  But what worries me are these two issues: First, if we do decide to \nmove toward a nuclear-based economy and we have to import 70 percent of \nthe technology and equipment, how are we any better off than when we \nwere importing two-thirds of our oil? We will just be creating jobs for \nsteelworkers in Japan and China instead of the United States. Second, \nif we don't move toward a nuclear-powered economy but try to do \neverything with conservation and wind and solar, we are going to be \nsending American jobs overseas looking for cheap energy.\n  So to ensure we have enough cheap, clean, reliable, no-carbon \nelectricity in this country to create good, high-quality, high-tech \njobs, here is what I believe we have to do. The United States should \ndouble its production of nuclear power by building 100 nuclear reactors \nin 20 years. Nuclear today provides 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity. Wind and solar provide 4 percent. Nuclear plants operate \n90 percent of the time. Wind and solar operate about one-third of the \ntime.\n  The Obama administration's Nobel Prize-winning Energy Secretary, \nSteven Chu, says nuclear plants are safe and that used nuclear fuel can \nbe safely stored onsite for 40 to 60 years while we figure out the best \nway to recycle it. Producing 20 percent of electricity from wind, as \nthe Obama administration proposes, will require building 186,000, 50-\nstory turbines--enough to cover an area the size of West Virginia--plus \n19,000 miles of new transmission lines to carry electricity from remote \nto populated areas. One hundred new nuclear plants could be built \nmostly on existing sites.\n  To produce 3 percent to 6 percent of our electricity, the taxpayers \nwill be subsidizing wind to the tune of $29 billion over the next 10 \nyears. The 104 nuclear reactors we have today were built basically \nwithout taxpayer subsidies. It will cost roughly the same to build 100 \nnew nuclear plants, which will last 60 to 80 years, as it would to \nbuild 186,000 wind turbines, lasting 20 to 25 years. And this doesn't \ncount the cost of transmission lines for wind. Finally, there will be \ntwice as many green jobs created building 100 nuclear reactors as there \nwould be created building 186,000 wind turbines.\n  An America stumbling along on expensive, unreliable renewable energy, \ntrying to import most of our energy from overseas, is going to be an \nAmerica with fewer jobs and a lower standard of living.\n  Nuclear opponents continue to prey on fear of nuclear power. The \ntruth is, if we want safe, cost-effective, reliable, no-carbon \nelectricity, we can no longer ignore the wisdom of the rest of the \nworld. The real fear is that we Americans are going to wake up on one \ncloudy, windless day, when the light switch doesn't work, and discover \nwe have forfeited our capacity to lead the world in creating jobs \nbecause we ignored nuclear power, a problem-solving technology we \nourselves invented.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to repeat for our colleagues and \ntheir staffs that the Interior appropriations bill, one of the most \ninteresting pieces of legislation before the Congress, is before the \nSenate right now. We know some of our colleagues have amendments to \noffer. We have already received some of them.\n  If any Senator would like to come to the floor to speak on those \namendments this afternoon, there is time for him or her to do that. If \nthey have not offered their amendments, I encourage them to do that \nbecause we would like to move the bill along.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2460\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 2460:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 2460\n\n       On page 219, line 5, before ``and including'' insert the \n     following: ``of which $250,000 shall be made available to \n     carry out activities under the Civil Rights History Project \n     Act of 2009 (20 U.S.C. 80s et seq.), to remain available \n     until expended;''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this amendment is cosponsored by the \nranking member of this committee, Senator Alexander, Senators Bennett, \nCochran, Levin, and Schumer. Representative Carolyn McCarthy has been \nthe leader in the House. I thank her for her leadership in enacting the \nCivil Rights History Project Act into law.\n  This is an amendment that would direct $250,000 in salaries and \nexpenses at the Smithsonian Institution to be used for the Civil Rights \nHistory Project. This is a project that was authorized by law in May of \nthis year. It will give us a permanent historical record of the \nfirsthand stories of the individuals who risked and sacrificed in the \ncivil rights movement. The project is modeled after the Veterans \nHistory Project and will be housed in the Smithsonian's National Museum \nof African American History and the Library of Congress. So for \ngenerations to come, historians, students, and the public will be able \nto listen to civil rights pioneers tell their stories and describe a \ntime that is quickly receding into history. If you think about it, this \ncould be a very exciting teaching tool for future generations.\n  I am very pleased to support this amendment, along with the ranking \nmember of this committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia for thinking of this. The late Alex Haley, the author of \n``Roots,'' used to say: When an older person dies, it is like a library \nburning down. And many who participated in it or many who even saw the \nmajor events of the civil rights movement are growing older and their \nstories need to be told. So this is an important amendment with \nbipartisan support. I am glad the Senator from California so \nthoughtfully offered it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the ranking member. I agree with him \nstrongly. I believe it is important to hear the voices of the actual \npeople so the students 20, 50, 75 years from now can really listen to \nwhat happened from the mouths of the people who were actually there and \nparticipated.\n  You should, once again, know this has been authorized, and it is \nsimply coming right out of salaries and expenses of the Smithsonian.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, are we in a quorum call?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are not.\n\n\n                   McCHRYSTAL COUNTERINSURGENCY PLAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, eight years ago America was attacked at \nhome by an enemy that we had underestimated for too long. As a result \nof this single planned attack, thousands of innocent people were \nkilled, the Twin Towers were left in ruins, and our long-held \nconfidence as a Nation in the security of our homeland was seriously \nshaken.\n  The horror of that day brought our country together, including \nlawmakers of every ideological stripe. And it was in this context of \nunity that we resolved to do everything in our power to ensure that \nAmerica never experienced a day like September 11 again.\n  At the heart of that resolve was a recognition that al-Qaida and \naffiliated terrorist groups had been at war with the United States long \nbefore September 11, 2001. September 11 may have been the day that we \nsaw the terrible consequences of inaction, but the pattern of smaller-\nscale attacks leading up to that day was also suddenly, undeniably \nclear. On 9/11, we saw that this was a war not of choice but a war of \nnecessity that would take time and require great sacrifice, and that \nwar continues.\n  From the very start, the centerpiece of our strategy has been the \nsame: to deny al-Qaida and its affiliates sanctuary, and, crucially, to \ndeny them a staging ground from which they can plan, prepare, or launch \nanother attack on U.S. soil. We have carried out this strategy using \nthe vast tools of intelligence, diplomacy, and force at our disposal, \nand our future success depends on our continued use of all these tools.\n  We have also recognized from the first moments of this fight that we \ncan't succeed alone. America is not al-Qaida's only target, and we are \nnot capable of defeating al-Qaida without the cooperation of many \nallies and friends, many of whom have experienced terrorism firsthand. \nThe fight against al-Qaida is a global fight, and its success will \ncontinue to depend on a division of labor among many nations.\n  Nowhere is our reliance on partners and allies more apparent at the \nmoment than in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Just as progress in Iraq \ndepended on the training of an indigenous security force, so too does \nour progress in Afghanistan depend on the training of security forces \nthere; and so too does our success in Pakistan depend upon the ability \nof the Pakistani Army to fight terrorists in the tribal areas.\n  Still, while Afghanistan and Pakistan may now be at the center of the \nfight, it's important to realize that our success will mean continued \nreliance on the cooperation of other friends and allies across the \nglobe, from our own borders to other distant places where our forces \ncan not go or where our presence is of limited use.\n  This is why I and others have pointed out that our success in \npreventing inmates from Guantanamo from returning to the fight depends \non cooperation from political leaders in places like Yemen and Saudi \nArabia. And this is why many of us have pointed out that al-Qaida's \npresence is growing in Yemen and threatens Saudi Arabia, where al-Qaida \nclaimed credit just last month for the first terrorist attack on a \nmember of the Saudi royal family in recent memory.\n  Many countries are engaged in the same fight that we are. As the war \non terror continues, these countries need to be assured of our \ncooperation just as much as we need to be assured of theirs.\n  So far on Afghanistan, the President has shown admirable consistency. \nHe has not lost sight of the need to pressure al-Qaida's senior \nleadership; he has stated, rightly, in my view, that the core goal of \nthe war there is the disruption, dismantling, and defeat of al-Qaida \nand the prevention of safe havens for terrorists. And he was wise \nearlier this year to appoint General Stanley McChrystal to command our \nforces in Afghanistan in pursuit of these goals.\n  By now, General McChrystal has had time to develop an initial \nassessment of the situation. That assessment, elements of which are now \npublic, calls for a genuine counterinsurgency. Soon, he will make a \nformal request for the resources he needs to carry this strategy out. \nWe don't know all the details yet, but we do know that much more hard \nwork lies ahead. And we also know that, according to General \nMcChrystal, ``failure to provide adequate resources . . . risks a \nlonger conflict, greater casualties, higher overall costs, and \nultimately, a critical loss of political support . . . [and that] any \nof these risks, in turn, are likely to result in mission failure.''\n  Looking back, we can see that the work of fighting terrorism at home \nand abroad has been difficult, it has been long, and it has tested our \nresolve. But here is the good news: It has been a success. By searching \nout terrorists where they are, keeping up the pressure, and remaining \nflexible, our Armed Forces, intelligence professionals, and the help of \nour allies and\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\nfriends has achieved something few people thought possible on September \n11, 2001. America has not been attacked at home since.\n  But this much is also clear: al-Qaida remains intent on attacking the \nUnited States. Its terror network is lethal, resilient, determined, and \nmobile, and the day we lose sight of this is the day that our good \nfortune in preventing another attack may run out.\n  The President, to his credit, has not lost sight of this sobering \nreality. But any failure to act decisively in response to General \nMcChrystal's request could serve to undermine the other good decisions \nthe President has made.\n  General McChrystal has made clear that more forces are necessary. But \neven that won't be enough. Even with the best strategy and the finest \nimplementation, our efforts in Afghanistan will not succeed without the \nsupport of the American people. This is why, in my view, the President \nmust soon explain to the American people his reasons either for \naccepting the McChrystal Plan or, if he chooses an alternative, explain \nwhy he believes the alternative is better.\n  As the President has noted, any commitment of additional forces is a \ndecision of the gravest importance. No President takes a decision like \nthis lightly. And this is why General McChrystal and General Petraeus \nshould also come to Washington to explain to Congress and to the \nAmerican people how their strategy will work.\n  Despite our best efforts to defeat al-Qaida and deny them sanctuary \nin Afghanistan and Pakistan, they remain a serious threat. The Taliban \nis gaining ground. But if our recent experience with Iraq shows us \nanything, it is that our commanders in the field are in the best \nposition to tell us what will work. General McCyrstal says that without \nadequate resources, we will fail. In my view, we should listen to that \nadvice.\n  Leading up to and during the surge in Iraq, many voices in Washington \nhad given up hope of success. One prominent Senator said that a surge \nof American forces would do nothing. One of the Nation's top newspapers \nsaid that staying the course in Iraq would only make the situation more \nbloody and frightening, and that there was nothing ahead for Iraq but \neven greater disaster.\n  But we know what happened. By listening to our commanders in the \nfield, the tide in Iraq began to turn. We salvaged our chances. And \nnearly 3 years later, a country and a war that many had given up for \nlost is showing strong signs of stability.\n  At the time, America was fortunate that in its moment of need, GEN \nDavid Petraeus came forward with a plan to secure Iraq and implemented \nit with the help of brave soldiers and marines in Baghdad and Anbar \nProvince. General McChrystal has now sent his recommendation for a \ncounterinsurgency strategy to protect the population and defeat the \nTaliban in Afghanistan. Congress should support it.\n  The war ahead in Afghanistan would not be easy. Counterinsurgency is \nvery demanding in terms of people, resources and vigilance. But the \nconsequences of withdrawal, or even of a plan that is more narrowly \nfocused on developing Afghan security forces, would likely be worse, \nsince neither plan will lead to the defeat of al-Qaida or reverse the \ngains that the Taliban has made in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  By ceding Afghanistan to the Taliban and al-Qaida, we would all but \nensure that the terrorists have the ability to plan and carry out \nanother attack from the very same place that they plotted and carried \nout the attacks of 9/11; al-Qaida in Pakistan would serve as a magnet \nto every young man wishing to enter the jihad; and our ability to stop \neither of these frightening developments would be severely diminished.\n  The President has said he will not allow these things to happen: For \nthe sake of our long-term security, we should support the McChrystal \nPlan. Anything less would confirm al-Qaida's view that America lacks \nthe strength and the resolve to endure a long war. We have proved them \nwrong before. Let's prove them wrong again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2456\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside in order to call up amendment No. 2456.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself, Mr. \n     Merkley, and Ms. Klobuchar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2456.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n          Agency to conduct a study on black carbon emissions)\n\n       On page 192, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n          General Provisions, Environmental Protection Agency\n\n\n                              black carbon\n\n       Sec. 201.  (a) Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation \n     with other Federal agencies, shall carry out and submit to \n     Congress the results of a study to define black carbon, \n     assess the impacts of black carbon on global and regional \n     climate, and identify the most cost-effective ways to reduce \n     black carbon emissions--\n       (1) to improve global and domestic public health; and\n       (2) to mitigate the climate impacts of black carbon.\n       (b) In carrying out the study, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) identify global and domestic black carbon sources, the \n     quantities of emissions from those sources, and cost-\n     effective mitigation technologies and strategies;\n       (2) evaluate the public health, climate, and economic \n     impacts of black carbon;\n       (3) identify current and practicable future opportunities \n     to provide financial, technical, and related assistance to \n     reduce domestic and international black carbon emissions; and\n       (4) identify opportunities for future research and \n     development to reduce black carbon emissions and protect \n     public health in the United States and internationally.\n       (c) Of the amounts made available under this title under \n     the heading ``Environmental Programs and Management'' for \n     operations and administration, the Administrator shall use up \n     to $2,000,000 to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to take the next several \nminutes to speak about an amendment that Senators Merkley and Klobuchar \nand I have to the Interior and Environment appropriations bill. With \nthis amendment, we are asking the Environmental Protection Agency to \nconduct a comprehensive study on something called black carbon \nemissions. This is very similar to a bipartisan bill I worked on with \nSenators Inhofe, Boxer, and Kerry that actually passed the Senate EPW \nCommittee. Taking steps to reduce black carbon emissions is a win/win \nsituation. We can lessen the threat of global warming, and at the same \ntime we can improve global public health.\n  Black carbon emissions, sometimes called soot, are the dark particles \nemitted when fossil fuels, biomass, and biofuels are burned. In the \nUnited States we see mainly black carbon from old, dirty diesel \nengines. Internationally, black carbon comes from old cook stoves, \ninefficient industrial processes, and also dirty diesel engines. Black \ncarbon contributes to serious global respiratory and cardiovascular \nhealth problems and even to death. Scientists also believe black carbon \nemissions contribute to global warming. In fact, it is estimated to be \nthe second largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide. \nHowever, there is still a lot we don't know about black carbon.\n  Our amendment asks EPA to do several things: One, to identify global \nblack carbon sources and cost-effective reduction technologies; two, to \nidentify the public health, economic, and climate impacts of black \ncarbon; three, to identify opportunities for current and possible \ninternational funding for mitigation; and four, to identify \nopportunities for future research and development.\n  We ask the EPA to use funds already allocated to them from their \noperations budget to fund this study.\n  Here in the United States we have made great progress in reducing \nblack carbon by regulating the new diesel engines and through a \nvoluntary national diesel retrofit program. We still have over 11 \nmillion old diesel engines without proper emission control technology. \nThere is good news and bad news about diesel engines. One is they last \na long time. That is the good news. The bad news is they last a long \ntime.\n  Black carbon remains a problem worldwide. This amendment will enable \nus to build on the progress we\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nhave already made and to use our resources wisely to reduce black \ncarbon emissions at home and abroad.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their interest in working with \nus on this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWarner of Virginia be added as a cosponsor on the civil rights oral \nhistory project amendment, amendment No. 2460, which is before this \nbody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the ranking member will \nconcur with this. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2460, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of \nthe amendment on the Smithsonian Civil Rights History Project, \namendment No. 2460. What this amendment does is simply on line 2 change \nthe word ``shall'' to ``may.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To support the participation of the Smithsonian Institution \n   in activities under the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009)\n\n       On page 219, line 5, before ``and including'' insert the \n     following: ``of which $250,000 may be made available to carry \n     out activities under the Civil Rights History Project Act of \n     2009 (20 U.S.C. 80s et seq.), to remain available until \n     expended;''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 \nnoon Tuesday, September 22, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \namendment No. 2460, as modified, with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote, with the time until 12 noon equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Feinstein and Alexander or \ntheir designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Jones Academy was founded over 100 years \nago, in 1891, on the site of an earlier school operated by the Choctaw \nNation. Its sister institution was the Wheelock Academy for Girls, \nfounded earlier than Jones and providing an academic curriculum for \ngirls. Both programs were federally funded through the Office of Indian \nAffairs--later renamed the Bureau of Indian Affairs--with many private \nand tribal donations.\n  Until 1950, the situation worked. While the Bureau of Indian Affairs \ntechnically ran the school, the relative isolation of the school and \nthe constant presence of a large Indian Tribe meant that the children \nat Jones Academy received an education adequate for their academic and \npersonal needs. In 1952, the Federal Government instituted the \ntermination policy. In 1953, the BIA approached the Public School \nDistrict of Hartshorne, OK. They offered to close the academic programs \nfor Jones Academy and totally close Wheelock Academy. The children were \nto be bused to Hartshorne School District, in exchange for local public \neducation of these children. The school district agreed, provided they \ncontinued to receive Johnson-O'Malley payments as well as impact aid \npayments for Indian students. Over tribal objections, this arrangement \nwas instituted and Jones Academy became a dormitory-only program. It \nhas remained such for 45 years.\n  An agreement between the Choctaw Nation and the Hartshorne School \nDistrict was reached in 2003 to allow children in the lowest grades, 1-\n6, to attend classes on campus, at Jones Academy, thus receiving better \nsupport and avoiding lengthy busing. As part of this agreement, and to \nassist the children through better programs, the Choctaw Nation has \nconstructed and equipped state-of-the-art facilities, and it did so \nwithout any Federal assistance. In recent years, the programs at Jones \nAcademy School site have won numerous awards for being one of \nOklahoma's highest achieving schools.\n  However, the Choctaw Nation is not able to implement control over the \nJones Academy program or exercise self determination as other tribes \ndo. They wish to do so, as a normal extension of Jones' recent success \nand the Choctaw Nation's desire to improve continuously. This can only \nbe done if the tribe is allowed to actually operate Jones Academy \nacademic program under its own policies and programs, reflecting its \npush for excellence.\n  Because of a moratorium enacted in 1995, which prevents any tribal \nschool from receiving Federal academic program support for any program \nnot operated at that school, the Jones Academy is prevented from \nreestablishing their programs and entering the Federal grant schools \nsystem. This moratorium was originally enacted as a ``temporary'' halt \nto changes to allow the BIA time to develop and institute a new \nconstruction and facilities system. However, the moratorium has been \ncontinued as a provision of the law.\n  My Oklahoma colleague in the House, Mr. Boren, has been working on \nthis issue, and the House committee report accompanying the proposed \nfiscal year 2010 Interior appropriations bill contains language to \naddress the issue in the form of a BIA study. I support the inclusion \nof this language and support the prompt completion of the study. I \nsupport the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and Chief Pyle on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9583-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the 16th \nannual National Public Lands Day, which will be celebrated on Saturday, \nSeptember 26. I am pleased to acknowledge the efforts of volunteers \nacross our Nation who will come together to improve and restore one of \nAmerica's most valuable assets, our public lands.\n  National Public Lands Day started in 1994 with 700 volunteers working \nin just a few locations. This year, over 130,000 volunteers will come \ntogether to work at more than 2,000 locations across all 50 States. \nThese people come from all walks of life, holding a shared interest in \nprotecting our public lands for the enjoyment of future generations.\n  Our Nation has a grand tradition of conservation. When Yellowstone \nNational Park was established in 1872, it was the world's first \nnational park. The idea of a national park was an American invention of \nhistoric proportions that led the way for global conservation efforts. \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, one of our earliest and most energetic \nconservationists, dedicated 194 million acres of national parks and \nnational preserves over the course of his Presidency. America has \ncontinued to build on this tradition with endeavors such as the \noperation of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and 1940s, \npassage of the Wilderness Act in 1964, establishment of Earth Day in \n1970, enactment of the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act in \n1997, and the signing into law of this year's Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act, to name just a few examples. National Public Lands Day \nprovides an annual opportunity for the American public to devote a day \nto conservation and to give back to the public lands that give so much \nto us.\n  Public lands make up over one-third of our country and are places of \ncontinuous discovery, where we go to find ourselves, to uncover our \nhistory, and to explore for new resources. Our public lands provide \nwide open spaces, deep\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nforests, dramatic vistas, and opportunities for solitude that not only \nfulfill us individually but form a fundamental part of the American \ncharacter. Our public lands are part of who we are and the diversity of \ntheir uses, like the diversity of their landscapes, reflects our \nidentity. In many areas, they provide timber, ore, and forage that are \nthe economic bedrock of rural America. In other areas, Congress has \ndesignated them as wilderness, places ``untrammeled by man, where man \nis a visitor who does not remain.''\n  I recognize and thank the thousands of Federal employees who manage \nthese lands year-round. The Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, \nFish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and other Federal \nland management agencies ensure that public lands in Nevada and across \nthe Nation meet the changing needs of our communities. They provide a \nvital, though rarely reported, service to our nation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge and thank the many Nevadans who will \nspend September 26 improving our public lands. Volunteers across \nnorthern Nevada will be working to improve our public lands in places \nlike the Carson and Truckee Rivers, Cain Spring, the East Fork of the \nWalker River, Eight Mile Creek, Dry Mountain, and Sacramento Pass. At \nthe same time, southern Nevada volunteers will work in sites like Ash \nSprings, Gold Butte, Lake Mead, Pittman Wash, Red Rock Canyon, and the \nGreat Unconformity.\n  The focus of National Public Lands Day this year is water on the \npublic lands. Clean water is essential to the health of our environment \nand the health of our citizens. Many parts of our Nation have faced \nsevere droughts in recent years, and caring for our water resources is \nas important as it has ever been. In Nevada, as the driest State in our \nNation, we are particularly aware that water is a precious resource.\n  The preservation of our public lands is a priority for me. Mr. \nPresident, our public lands are part of what makes the United States a \ngreat nation. I voice my gratitude to all who will participate in \nNational Public Lands Day this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9584-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9584-S9585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD ALZHEIMER'S DAY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today is World Alzheimer's Day, a day to \nraise awareness about this neurodegenerative disease that afflicts over \n5 million Americans, including about 600,000 people in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S9584, September 21, 2009, the Record reads: WORLD \nALZHEIMER'S DAY Mr. President, today is World Alzheimer's Day . . \n.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: WORLD ALZHEIMER'S \nDAY Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today is World Alzheimer's Day . . \n.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  It has been 100 years since Alzheimer's was first identified, yet \nthere is still no cure and no proven way to prevent the disease. In \nfact, every 70 seconds another American develops Alzheimer's, this is \nalarming.\n  People who suffer from Alzheimer's disease experience symptoms that \ntake an extreme toll on both those afflicted with this disease, and \ntheir loved ones.\n  Certainly the most well-known symptom of Alzheimer's is amnesia, or \nloss of memory, but Alzheimer's can also disrupt a person's ability to \ncommunicate or accomplish daily tasks. These debilitating symptoms \ncreate large challenges for Alzheimer's sufferers, their caretakers, \nand their loved ones.\n  Unfortunately these symptoms tell only half the story. Those \nafflicted may also suffer from psychiatric symptoms like personality \nchanges, depression, hallucinations, and delusions. These terrible \nsymptoms may cause people with Alzheimer's not to recognize familiar \nfaces, including their own children and grandchildren. They may also \nbecome fearful, paranoid, irritable or withdrawn.\n  The number of people living with Alzheimer's disease is expected to \ntriple by 2050. If nothing is done, Alzheimer's will cost Medicare and \nMedicaid $19.89 trillion between 2010 and 2050. Already, Alzheimer's \ndisease costs the nation $175 billion annually, and caregivers spend 10 \npercent of their household income caring for a loved one who is \nsuffering from this horrible disease.\n  That is why I have joined 29 of my colleagues in cosponsoring the \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2009, which responds to this crisis by \nhelping us learn more about Alzheimer's disease, develop better \ntreatments, and prevent this disease. This legislation will help \nadvance the study and treatment of Alzheimer's to make a difference in \nthe lives of millions of Americans by equipping caregivers with the \nresources and support services they need to care for their loved ones.\n  This bill would double funding for Alzheimer's research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, create the National Summit on \nAlzheimer's, support public education campaigns, and expand the \nAlzheimer's 24/7 call center, which provides assistance to caregivers.\n  I am also pleased to be joined by Senator Collins in sponsoring the \nCaring for an Aging America Act. This legislation would make critical \ninvestments in the workforce specially trained to care for older \nAmericans, many of whom suffer from this disease. By working to train \nmore of these essential health professionals, I am hopeful that we can \nnot only improve the quality of care for Alzheimer's patients, but also \nprovide their caregivers and family with better resources to meet the \nneeds of their loved ones.\n  On this World Alzheimer's Day I am happy to join the millions of \npeople coming together across the globe to raise awareness about this \ndevastating disease, and to support these two bipartisan bills, which \nare critical in the fight of our Nation, our Nation's citizens, and our \nfamilies against this terrible affliction.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on World Alzheimer's Day, it is \nimportant that we pause to consider the devastating impact of this \ndebilitating disease and the importance of scientific research into its \ncauses, effects, and treatment.\n  More than 5 million Americans are affected by Alzheimer's, and it is \nestimated that this number will increase to between 11.3 and 16 million \nby the year 2050. One in 10 individuals has a family member with the \ndisease.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of S. 1492, which would increase National \nInstitutes of Health funding for Alzheimer's research to $2 billion for \nfiscal year 2010 and provide grants for research designed specifically \nto help caregivers. This bill would establish a National Summit on \nAlzheimer's to examine promising research programs and raise awareness.\n  We must find ways to prevent this disease before it starts. The vital \ninvestments made by this bill will put us ahead of the curve, both in \nterms of research and increasing public understanding of the disease. \nOn this day, when we remember those suffering from Alzheimer's disease \nand those who have succumbed to it, let us recommit ourselves to meet \nthe challenge posed by this disease and do everything we can to \nalleviate the suffering it causes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to increase awareness of a \ndebilitating and ultimately fatal disease that right now, more than 5 \nmillion Americans and 35 million people worldwide live with--\nAlzheimer's.\n  Today is World Alzheimer's Day, a day when the individuals and \nfamilies affected by this devastating disease around the globe unite to \nincrease understanding about the disease and its impact. Unfortunately, \nas this disease continues to steal an ever growing number of memories \nand ultimately lives, this global recognition continues to grow in \nimportance.\n  According to new data released in the 2009 World Alzheimer Report, \nthe 35 million people worldwide suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia \nis a startling 10 percent increase over the 2005 number. This \ndevastating number is only expected to grow. In fact, according to the \nnewly released report, the number of people with Alzheimer's is \nexpected to nearly double every 20 years, to 65.7 million in 2030 and \n115.4 million in 2050.\n  For too many years the millions of Americans living with this disease \nand their families suffered silently in a nation that misunderstood the \ntragedy of Alzheimer's and dementia. In 1994, the courage of one family \nchanged the public face of Alzheimer's when in a letter to the American \npeople Ronald Reagan announced he was one of the millions of Americans \nliving with the disease. With this selfless act, the former President \nand his wife Nancy increased the public awareness of Alzheimer's and \nincreased the awareness of the need for research into its causes and \nprevention.\n  Public awareness is a key part of the fight against this disease, \nwhich is why I thank actor David Hyde Pierce for\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\nbeing a vocal champion in the fight against Alzheimer's and Lisa Genova \nwho wrote the moving book, ``Still Alice,'' about a brilliant woman \nblindsided by the disease.\n  In 2004 Senator Mikulski and I first introduced legislation in honor \nof Ronald Reagan, who took public awareness of Alzheimer's to the \nnational stage. This legislation--a living tribute to the courage of \nour 40th President-- made a Federal commitment to increase research for \nAlzheimer's and increase assistance to Alzheimer patients and their \nfamilies.\n  Today, Senator Mikulski and I are still leading the fight in the \nSenate to pass this critical legislation. This year we reintroduced the \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act. This bipartisan legislation strengthens \nour nation's commitment to Alzheimer's research and to finding cures \nand treatments for this devastating disease.\n  This legislation doubles funding for Alzheimer's research at the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, to $2 billion and makes Alzheimer's \nresearch a priority at NIH. The bill also provides support for families \nby providing caregivers with the vital resources and tools to assist \nthem.\n  We can't afford to wait another 5 years to pass this bill. After all, \nin this country, someone develops Alzheimer's every 70 seconds. Experts \nestimate Alzheimer's could affect as many as 10 million baby boomers as \nthey age. And in my State of Missouri, there will be as many as 110,000 \npeople age 65 and older who will have Alzheimer's disease by 2010.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me and Senator Mikulski in \nour fight against this terrible disease and cosponsor the Alzheimer's \nBreakthrough Act. I also ask that today you keep all those who have \nlost loved ones to Alzheimer's, all those living with Alzheimer's and \nall those carrying on the fight against Alzheimer's in your thoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9585-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Sergeant Youvert Loney\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of Army Sergeant Youvert Loney. \nSergeant Loney, a member of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, \n4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO, died on September 5, 2009. \nSergeant Loney was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAbad, Afghanistan, and sustained injuries when insurgents attacked his \nvehicle using small arms and rifles. He was 28 years old.\n  A native of Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia, Sergeant Loney \nmoved to Fort Carson in 2006 when he was assigned to the 4th Infantry \nDivision. Sergeant Loney joined the Army in October 2005. He served in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom from October 2006 until December 2007, \ncontributing to renewed efforts to successfully secure Baghdad. He had \nserved in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan with Fort Carson's \nFourth Brigade Combat Team since June. Last month, his battalion worked \nto ensure security for Afghanistan's recent presidential elections.\n  During his nearly 4 years of service, Sergeant Loney distinguished \nhimself through his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to \ntake on any challenge--no matter how dangerous. Commanders recognized \nhis extraordinary bravery and talent, bestowing on Sergeant Loney more \nthan 12 awards and medals, including two Purple Heart Medals, the \nBronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, \nand the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Sergeant Loney is remembered by those who knew him as a consummate \nprofessional and friend who they could turn to in times of need. Most \nof all, they remember his devotion to his wife, his children, and his \ncountry.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nLoney's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived without \nfear.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Sergeant Loney will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Sergeant Loney's father Loakim, his wife Flora, his children, and \nall his friends and family--I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be \nfeeling. I hope that in time the pain of your loss will be eased by \nyour pride in Youvert's service and by your knowledge that his country \nwill never forget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9585-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator Mel Martinez, who recently resigned his Senate seat. Senator \nMartinez has represented the State of Florida in the Senate since his \nelection in 2004.\n  Mel Martinez's inspiring personal story is an example of how the \nAmerican dream can be attained through hard work and determination. \nBorn in Sagua La Grande, Cuba, Mel fled to the United States when he \nwas 15 years old after the Castro government came to power in his \nhomeland. Arriving in Florida with one suitcase and limited English \nlanguage skills, Mel spent the next few years in youth facilities and \nwith foster families until he was later reunited with his parents in \nOrlando.\n  He went on to earn a law degree from Florida State University, and he \npracticed law in Orlando for over two decades. In 1998, Senator \nMartinez was elected chairman of Orange County. He went on to serve as \nthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George \nW. Bush. Since 2004, Mel Martinez served the people of Florida in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Reforming our immigration system was an issue close to Senator \nMartinez's heart. Mel worked vigorously with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to try to advance a solution to one of the most difficult \nproblems confronting our Nation. As the only immigrant in the Senate, \nSenator Martinez brought a unique perspective to the immigration \ndebate. By striving for comprehensive immigration reform, he hoped to \nshare the American dream.\n  Senator Martinez was deeply concerned about advancing the cause of \nfreedom in the most oppressive corners of the world. Mel experienced \nthe loss of liberty that resulted from Castro's rise, and he often \nspoke out for those who lost their voices--not only for those in Cuba, \nbut for those who suffered anywhere from tyranny and despotism.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and drought in the Midwest, \nSenator Martinez and I worked together in an attempt to bring relief to \nAmerica's farm and ranch families. Even though agricultural production \nin North Dakota and Florida is far from similar, we were able to unite \nto support legislation that would have provided much-needed disaster \nassistance to affected farmers and ranchers throughout the country.\n  I thank Senator Martinez for his public service and wish him and his \nfamily the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9585-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9585-S9586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ALAN D.

Through her work and volunteer activities she has made a \ndifference.\n  Betty began her career at the hospital in Montgomery, WV. She then \nworked at the Hinton Hospital until it closed, and spent the rest of \nher career at the Greenbrier Valley Hospital in Fairlea. Compassionate \nand thoughtful, she was beloved by patients and colleagues alike.\n  Betty has always possessed a love of learning and curiosity that led \nher to learn more and do more, both in her work and in her life. She \nfaces challenges straight on, and stands up for what she believes in. \nShe has always been involved in community service, running the \nelementary school carnival when her children were young, singing in the \necumenical choir around the holidays, and spearheading a food pantry at \nher church that has been extremely important in times of hardship. When \nfriends are ill, she is always there to lend a hand to help or an ear \nto listen.\n  She values family and friends, loyally supporting those she loves. \nBetty is the proud mother of two children, Ted and Terri. I was proud \nto have her daughter Terri as a member of my staff for many years.

Mr. President, today I acknowledge an \nincreasingly popular event that celebrates a truly unique aspect of \nwestern history and culture in Pueblo, CO. Fifteen years ago, Pueblo's \nChamber of Commerce created a festival highlighting the anthropological \nsignificance of regionally important foods: chile and beans. Although \none might think that this festival is just a celebration of an \nagricultural harvest of two crops, it is much more. These foods have \nbeen part of southern Colorado's history for centuries. From 1842 to \n1854--in the same location this festival takes place today--French and \nAmerican traders, native peoples, and Spanish and Mexican settlers \ntraded these staples and several other goods, making the lower Arkansas \nRiver Valley in Colorado a major trading hub during Western settlement.\n  Now in its 15th year, the 3-day Chile and Frijole Festival celebrates \nand fortifies a vibrant and rich culture through traditional regional \nmusic and distinctive regional dishes, which truly makes Pueblo, CO, a \ncultural gateway to the American Southwest. It also emphasizes the \nimportance of southern Colorado's agricultural community, which \nsupplies the locally grown green chile and produce that is the center \nof this event.\n  Pueblo and southern Colorado have historically played an integral \nrole in Colorado's economic and cultural development. From the days \nwhen native tribes traded with Hispanic, French and American settlers \nfrom Bent's Fort to Fort Pueblo, to more contemporary days as an \nindustrial and agricultural powerhouse of Colorado, Pueblo and southern \nColorado continue to evolve and contribute positively to Colorado's \ngrowth. The Chile and Frijole Festival in Pueblo is a true testament to \nthe region's continuing contributions to our State.\n  I congratulate the Pueblo Chamber of Commerce and the city of Pueblo \nfor another year of celebrating the region's heritage and \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9586-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9586-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9586-5", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2006--PM 31\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                              S. Res. 275\n\n       Whereas, since September 21, 1959, Minute Man National \n     Historical Park has preserved key sites where the first \n     battles of the American Revolutionary War occurred, and \n     educated millions of people in the United States about the \n     extraordinary events that led to the birth of the United \n     States and the ideals embodied in the courageous actions that \n     led to such events;\n       Whereas Minute Man National Historical Park encompasses \n     more than 1,000 acres in the historic communities of \n     Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord that were at the center of \n     the American Revolution;\n       Whereas the events, places, and people recognized by the \n     Minute Man National Historical Park have become enduring \n     testaments to the values of the people of the United States \n     and are among the most celebrated and cherished symbols in \n     the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the Minute Man National Historical Park includes \n     multiple sites and vistas along the route from Boston to \n     Concord, known as the ``Battle Road'', where American militia \n     and British soldiers fought several times on April 19, 1775;\n       Whereas American militia were first ordered to return \n     British fire at Concord's North Bridge, a heroic action \n     commemorated by the United States poet Ralph Waldo Emerson in \n     his poem ``The Concord Hymn'' as the ``shot heard round the \n     world'';\n       Whereas the park celebrates the legendary ``midnight ride'' \n     of Paul Revere on April 18, 1775, that warned American \n     colonists that British soldiers were marching to Concord to \n     destroy key military stores; and\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 people from States across the \n     United States and from around the world visit Minute Man \n     National Historical Park each year to learn about the role \n     that the New England communities of Lexington, Lincoln, and \n     Concord played in the American Revolution: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Minute Man National Historical Park serves an essential \n     role in preserving the sites and vistas in New England where \n     the American Revolution began and in educating the public \n     about these historic events;\n       (2) Minute Man National Historical Park honors and \n     commemorates the ideals of democracy, liberty, and freedom \n     that are the foundation of the United States and sources of \n     inspiration for people everywhere; and\n       (3) the creation of Minute Man National Historical Park 50 \n     years ago represents a remarkable achievement that continues \n     to benefit the people of the United States, to preserve the \n     proud legacy of the American Revolution, and to serve as an \n     enduring resource for future generations.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution to \nhonor the 50th Anniversary of the Minute Man National Historical Park. \nSince September 21, 1959, the Minute Man National Historical Park has \npreserved landmarks from the earliest days of the American \nRevolutionary War. It has educated millions of visitors from around the \nworld about these historic events that led to the birth of our nation \nand the ideals embodied in those courageous actions.\n  The Minute Man National Historical Park encompasses more than 1,000 \nacres in the historic communities of Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord, \nMassachusetts. It includes areas such as Concord's North Bridge, where \nthe American militia were first ordered to fire on British soldiers, an \nevent immortalized by Ralph Waldo Emerson in ``The Concord Hymn'' as \n``the shot heard round the world.'' It features Paul Revere's capture \nsite, where his famous ``Midnight Ride'' to warn the colonists that \nBritish soldiers were marching to Concord came to its conclusion. The \nPark also features The Wayside, a house that was in turn home to \ncelebrated authors Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Margaret \nSidney.\n  More than just preserving these treasured sites and landscapes, the \nMinute Man National Historical Park preserves the spirit of our \nnation's history, the American Revolution, the ideals of democracy, \nliberty, and freedom. The creation of Minute Man National Historical \nPark 50 years ago showed our commitment to honoring the proud tradition \nof the American Revolution and maintaining these historic sites for \ngenerations to come. I ask all my colleagues to honor our history and \nrenew that commitment today by supporting this resolution.\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9591-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 276--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 22, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                    FALLS PREVENTION AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Casey, Mr. \nSanders, and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 276\n\n       Whereas older adults age 65 and over are the fastest \n     growing segment of our population and whose numbers will \n     increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 55,000,000 in 2020;\n       Whereas 1 in every 3 people in the United States who are 65 \n     years of age or older falls each year;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury, deaths, and \n     hospital admissions for traumatic injuries among adults 65 \n     years of age and older;\n       Whereas, in 2007, approximately 1,900,000 people with fall-\n     related injuries were treated in hospital emergency \n     departments and approximately 492,000 were hospitalized after \n     treatment;\n       Whereas, in 2006, more 16,600 people aged 65 and older died \n     from injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas, in 2000, direct medical costs for fall-related \n     injuries for adults aged 65 and older totaled more than \n     $19,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, \n     annual direct treatment costs under the Medicare program will \n     reach $32,400,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas research indicates that fall prevention programs \n     for high-risk older adults have a net-cost savings of almost \n     $9 in benefits to society for each $1 invested;\n       Whereas the Safety of Seniors Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-\n     202) was enacted to amend the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280b et seq.) to create a national education campaign \n     aimed at older adults, their families, and healthcare \n     providers, and injury prevention programs that focus on the \n     reduction and prevention of falls among older adults; and\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group and \n     its numerous national and State supporting organizations \n     should be commended for their efforts to raise awareness and \n     to promote better understanding, research, and programs to \n     prevent falls among older adults: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 22, 2009, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group \n     and the 22 State falls coalitions for their efforts to work \n     together to increase education and awareness about the \n     prevention of falls among older adults;\n       (3) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and \n     local governments, the public health community, and health \n     care providers to work together to promote the awareness of \n     falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among \n     older people in the United States;\n       (4) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent \n     falls among older adults that can be used in effective \n     community-based fall prevention programs;\n       (5) encourages State health departments to use their \n     significant leadership to reduce injuries and injury-related \n     health care costs by collaborating with colleagues and a \n     variety of organizations and individuals to reduce falls \n     among older adults; and\n       (6) recognizes proven, cost effective fall prevention \n     programs and policies and encourages experts in the field of \n     fall prevention to share their best practices so that their \n     success can be replicated by others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9591-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 277--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2009 AS ``NATIONAL \n                   PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Specter, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \nWhitehouse, and Mr. Wicker) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 277\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States live with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with prostate cancer in his lifetime;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly-diagnosed non-\n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas in 2009, 192,280 men in the United States will be \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer and 27,360 men in the United \n     States will die of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 30 percent of new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old \n     approximately every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of \n     developing cancer, including prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American males suffer a prostate cancer \n     incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than white males and \n     double the prostate cancer mortality rates of white males;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the probability that the disease will \n     lead to death, and high cholesterol levels are strongly \n     associated with advanced prostate cancer;\n       Whereas if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has a 1 in 3 chance of \n     being diagnosed with prostate cancer, if he has 2 family \n     members with such diagnoses, he has an 83 percent risk, and \n     if he has 3 family members with such diagnoses, he then has a \n     97 percent risk of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination and \n     a prostate-specific antigen blood test can detect the disease \n     in its early stages, increasing the chances of surviving more \n     than 5 years to nearly 100 percent, while only 33 percent of \n     men survive more than 5 years if diagnosed during the late \n     stages of the disease;\n       Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer \n     while it is still in the early stages, making screening \n     critical;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2009 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that steps should be taken--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods for, and treatment of, prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding that is commensurate with \n     the burden of the disease so that the screening and treatment \n     of prostate cancer may be improved, and so that the causes \n     of, and a cure for, prostate cancer may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider ways for improving access to, \n     and the quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9591-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9591-S9592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 278--HONORING THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL PAINTERS FOR \n                THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 276\n\n       Whereas older adults age 65 and over are the fastest \n     growing segment of our population and whose numbers will \n     increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 55,000,000 in 2020;\n       Whereas 1 in every 3 people in the United States who are 65 \n     years of age or older falls each year;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury, deaths, and \n     hospital admissions for traumatic injuries among adults 65 \n     years of age and older;\n       Whereas, in 2007, approximately 1,900,000 people with fall-\n     related injuries were treated in hospital emergency \n     departments and approximately 492,000 were hospitalized after \n     treatment;\n       Whereas, in 2006, more 16,600 people aged 65 and older died \n     from injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas, in 2000, direct medical costs for fall-related \n     injuries for adults aged 65 and older totaled more than \n     $19,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, \n     annual direct treatment costs under the Medicare program will \n     reach $32,400,000,000 by 2020;\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards;\n       Whereas research indicates that fall prevention programs \n     for high-risk older adults have a net-cost savings of almost \n     $9 in benefits to society for each $1 invested;\n       Whereas the Safety of Seniors Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-\n     202) was enacted to amend the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 280b et seq.) to create a national education campaign \n     aimed at older adults, their families, and healthcare \n     providers, and injury prevention programs that focus on the \n     reduction and prevention of falls among older adults; and\n       Whereas the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group and \n     its numerous national and State supporting organizations \n     should be commended for their efforts to raise awareness and \n     to promote better understanding, research, and programs to \n     prevent falls among older adults: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 22, 2009, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the Falls Free Coalition Advocacy Work Group \n     and the 22 State falls coalitions for their efforts to work \n     together to increase education and awareness about the \n     prevention of falls among older adults;\n       (3) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and \n     local governments, the public health community, and health \n     care providers to work together to promote the awareness of \n     falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among \n     older people in the United States;\n       (4) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent \n     falls among older adults that can be used in effective \n     community-based fall prevention programs;\n       (5) encourages State health departments to use their \n     significant leadership to reduce injuries and injury-related \n     health care costs by collaborating with colleagues and a \n     variety of organizations and individuals to reduce falls \n     among older adults; and\n       (6) recognizes proven, cost effective fall prevention \n     programs and policies and encourages experts in the field of \n     fall prevention to share their best practices so that their \n     success can be replicated by others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/21/senate-section/article/S9615-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9615-S9616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.
