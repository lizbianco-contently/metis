Mr. President, according to news reports, President \nObama called congressional Democrats down to the White House the other \nnight to talk about treating this bill more like a stimulus and less \nlike a free-for-all. I commend him for the effort, and I appreciate it. \nBut after yesterday, it looks like they might need a little stronger \nmedicine.\n  The day after meeting with President Obama, Democrats offered several \namendments, and every single one of them added to the total cost of \nwhat is already nearly a $1 trillion spending bill--$11 billion here, \n$25 billion there, another $6 billion somewhere else. In other words, \nreal money. By the end of the first day of debate, the Democrats had \nadded more than $41 billion to a bill that just about everybody else in \nAmerica already thought was way too large.\n  On this side, Republicans offered some amendments too. All but one of \nthem, however, sought to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. The President \nhas tried to set some priorities. Unfortunately, Democrats keep \nthrowing more money on top of an already incredibly bloated bill. At \nsome point, we are going to have to learn to say no. If we are going to \nhelp the economy, we need to get hold of this bill. Making it bigger \nisn't the answer.\n  The President seems to recognize the problem. Last night, he repeated \nhis call for discipline and restraint in a letter from OMB Director \nPeter Orszag. Its message was clear: The Nation is in a financial \ncrisis and this bill should be stripped of everything that doesn't aim \nto solve the crisis. As Mr. Orszag put it:\n\n       We need to recognize that this recovery and reinvestment \n     plan is an extraordinary response to an extraordinary crisis. \n     It should not be seen as an opportunity to abandon the fiscal \n     discipline that we owe each and every taxpayer in spending \n     their money and in keeping the United States strong in a \n     global, interdependent economy.\n\n  This bill needs to be cut down, and we should start with permanent \nspending increases, which only increase the deficit from here on out. \nThis is a permanent spending bill that has been slipped into a bill \nthat was supposed to be timely, temporary, and targeted. Many of these \nadditions may be very worthwhile, but they still don't belong in a \nstimulus bill. So the first thing we need to do is to make a \ndistinction between what grows the economy and what doesn't. Anything \nthat doesn't ought to be cut out. That is what the President said \nMonday night, that is what he repeated last night; that we need to be, \n``trimming out things that aren't relevant to putting people back\n\n[[Page S1474]]\n\nto work right now.'' Add up the interest payments and the total \nnonstimulus spending in this bill and it is in the hundreds of billions \nof dollars. That is completely unacceptable. So there is plenty of room \nto cut wasteful spending. As Mr. Orszag said in his letter, the \nPresident is ``insistent that the bill not include any earmarks or \nspecial projects.''\n  Another target-rich area is all the spending for new programs that \nclaim to create new jobs. What people don't realize is how much it \ncosts to create some of these jobs. Analysts have gone through some of \nthe new programs and here is what they have found: $524 million for a \nprogram at the State Department that promises to create 388 jobs here \nat home. That comes to $1.35 million per job. Let me say that again--\n$1.35 million per job; $125 million to the DC Water and Sewer \nAuthority. That comes to $480,000 per job; $100 million for 300 jobs at \nUSAID. That is $333,333 per job. That is just a few. Surely there are \nmore efficient ways to create jobs with taxpayer dollars than this.\n  So there is plenty of room to cut in this bill. It is time we started \ndoing some of it. America is already staring at a $1 trillion deficit. \nThe bill before us, in its current form, will cost, with interest, $1.3 \ntrillion. Soon we will vote on an Omnibus appropriations bill that will \ncost $400 billion. The President is talking about another round of bank \nbailout funds that some say could cost as much as $4 trillion.\n  This isn't monopoly money. All of it is borrowed money that the \ntaxpayers will have to pay back at some point. I think we owe it to \nthem to lay all these things out on the table now so America can see \nwhat it is getting into. I think we owe it to the American people to \nshow some restraint on the bill that is before us.\n  Republicans have a number of better ideas for making this bill \nsimpler, more targeted, and more directly beneficial to workers and to \nhomeowners. We have been sharing those ideas for the last week.\n  Economists from both sides of the political spectrum recognize that \nhousing is at the root of the current downturn. We believe we should \nfix this problem first before we do anything else--certainly before we \nbuild a fish barrier, spruce up offices for bureaucrats or build a \nwater slide. I mean, let's get serious. We can either talk about fixing \nthe problem or we can take immediate action to help 40 million \nAmericans stay in their homes or buy a new one. That is our choice.\n  We need to act now, and soon we will be voting on a Republican better \nidea to do that. But first there are plenty of areas in this bill we \ncan cut, even before we consider some of the good Republican ideas that \nPresident Obama has said he wants to incorporate into the final bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/04/senate-section/article/S1474-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1) making supplemental appropriations for job \n     preservation and creation, infrastructure investment, energy \n     efficiency and science, assistance to the unemployed, and \n     State and local fiscal stabilization, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Inouye-Baucus) amendment No. 98, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Murray amendment No. 110 (to amendment No. 98), to \n     strengthen the infrastructure investments made by the bill.\n       Vitter amendment No. 179 (to amendment No. 98), to \n     eliminate unnecessary spending.\n       Isakson-Lieberman amendment No. 106 (to amendment No. 98), \n     to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n     Federal income tax credit for certain home purchases.\n       Feingold amendment No. 140 (to amendment No. 98), to \n     provide greater accountability of taxpayers' dollars by \n     curtailing congressional earmarking and requiring disclosure \n     of lobbying by recipients of Federal funds.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to engage in a colloquy with my colleagues for 30 minutes, if \nthat is acceptable to the Democratic leader.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, Republicans believe we ought to fix housing first, and \nwe would like to talk about that for the next 30 minutes. Mr. Kyl, the \nSenator from Arizona, is here for that purpose. Senator Ensign is here, \nwho is the author of an amendment that would provide 4 to 4.5 percent \nmortgages for up to 40 million Americans so they could buy new homes or \nrefinance their homes. Senator Isakson is here, who is the author of an \namendment to provide a $15,000 tax credit for the next year to home \nbuyers. We believe these proposals would provide instant jobs. Housing \ngot us into this economic mess and housing will help get us out of the \neconomic mess.\n  The Republican leader, Senator McConnell, stated that this is a big \nspending bill. I was on the telephone last night with the former budget \nchairman, Senator Domenici of New Mexico, who has been counting in his \nretirement. He said it took our country from the time of its founding \nuntil the mid-1980s to build up a national debt of $850 billion, which \nwas the size of this so-called stimulus package when it came over here. \nSo we are talking about real borrowed money, and our goal is to \nreorient the whole discussion: first, to housing; second, to letting \ntaxpayers keep more of their own money; and, third, to get out of the \nbill those items that don't belong in the bill.\n  The former Congressional Budget Office director in a previous \nDemocratic administration, Alice Rivlin, said we needed two bills: one \nthat would include legislation that created jobs now, and the second \nwould be legislation that might take care of long-term investments that \nmight help our country. She also said there should be a very high \nstandard before we borrow money to spend on anything. Especially, as \nthe Republican leader said, at a time when next week we may be hearing \nfrom Secretary Geithner that we need several hundred billion more for \nbanks, and then more for housing, and then more for the annual \nappropriations bill, and then, on down the road, more for a health care \nbill.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona, and he is a leading member of the \nFinance Committee, and as we think about reorienting toward housing, it \nwould seem to me, Senator Kyl, that we should focus whatever money we \ndo have on the problem we have, rather than borrowing money to dribble \naway on good-sounding projects that don't actually create jobs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator from \nTennessee, I appreciate his focusing laser-like on this subject \nbecause, in many respects, we are treating the symptoms of the problem \nrather than the cause of the problem. While treating the symptoms can \nhave some salutary effect, we are not going to ultimately solve the \nproblem until we get to the root cause. I think virtually everybody \nagrees on what the root cause of our current problem is: the collapse \nin the housing market.\n  That caused a cascade of other effects, and some of those can be \ndealt with simultaneously, but the bottom line is, as the Senator from \nTennessee noted, we have to fix housing first. Because until that is \ndone, all of these other symptoms are going to remain.\n  There are a lot of smart people whose comments I am going to quote in \na moment because they are well-respected--they are Democrats, they are \nRepublicans--but I would like to turn, first, to my folks in Arizona, \nwhom I like to go to for advice. So last weekend I met with Marge \nLindsey and her group of realtors from Arizona. I started out by \nsaying: All right, tell me how it is. She said: It is not good. They \nwent on to point out that between 40 and 50 percent of what they are \ndoing right now is dealing with foreclosed homes, or what they call the \nshort sales--getting ready for foreclosure--and that the rest\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\nof the market has virtually collapsed. She said something has to be \ndone to prevent the continual decline in housing values.\n\n  My home is in a perfectly good neighborhood, I pay my mortgage and \nall, but it is out of my control because all around me others are \nhaving problems first, and because they are having problems, it is \ndrawing down the value all around. So the people who play by the rules \nand are not doing anything wrong are along for the ride down. Until \nthat is arrested somehow, all of these other symptoms are going to \nexist. That was their analysis.\n  Now, if I can quote some other really smart people, if the Senator \nwould allow me? The New York Times editorialized toward the end of last \nyear, November 11:\n\n       Clearly, the [financial] system won't stabilize until house \n     prices stabilize, and banks won't lend freely until losses on \n     mortgages abate. . . .All roads, into and out of this crisis, \n     run through the housing market.\n\n  Exactly the point the Senator from Tennessee is making.\n  Very recently, January 28, the new CBO Director, Director Elmendorf, \nsaid this in testimony:\n\n       Turmoil in the housing and financial markets is likely to \n     continue for some time, even with vigorous policy actions and \n     especially without them. Most economists think that to \n     generate a strong economic recovery in the next few years, \n     further actions to restore the health of the housing sector \n     and the financial system are needed.\n\n  A lot of folks rely on the advice of Warren Buffett. I probably \nshould have relied more on the advice of Warren Buffett in my \ninvestments. I wouldn't be where I am today. Here is what he said in \nApril of last year:\n\n       Things connected with housing, whether it's in brick or \n     whether it's in carpet, those businesses have shown no uptick \n     at all.\n\n  His point is that once housing is affected, everything else that has \nanything to do with it is affected.\n  He made this comment as well:\n\n       The market won't really come back until you get a close to \n     normal ratio of vacant homes, homes up for sale, compared to \n     current sales, and that's a ways off.\n\n  We all listened with interest to Alan Greenspan. Here is what he \ntestified to in October of last year before Congress:\n\n       A necessary condition for this crisis to end is a \n     stabilization of home prices in the United States.\n\n  Here is how I conclude all of this. The experts back home agree. They \nare seeing it on the ground. The experts who look at this from an \neconomic standpoint, from a national macroeconomic standpoint, all \nagree. We need to heed their advice and address the housing crisis \nfirst. We cannot wave a magic wand and stop housing prices from falling \nfurther. Would that we could--we would do that. That is the market, and \nwe cannot stop it.\n  What is happening is that home values, in a ratio to mortgages, are \ndeclining. So the other point the realtors told me was a lot of folks, \nthrough no fault of their own, are now paying mortgages on homes that \nexceed the value of the homes. That is the upside-down element. We can \naffect that part of the equation. That is to say, we can't stop home \nvalues from going down until we do something else first. The thing we \ncan affect is that ratio--what people are paying in their monthly \nmortgage payments. I am going to leave that to my colleagues. The \nSenator from Nevada is here. The Senator from Georgia is here. They \nwill talk about a better Republican idea of how we can address the \ncosts people pay every month in their mortgages as a way of making them \nmore healthy, able to pay the mortgage, not going to foreclosure, and \nultimately fix that value of homes, and then we are on the road to \nrecovery.\n  The last thing I wanted to say is that the secondary market is a big \npart of this. When people lend money, they want to then be able to sell \nthat mortgage to somebody. That has been the whole cause of this, the \ntoxic loans in the secondary market.\n  In the Financial Times of August 26 of last year, Dr. Martin \nFeldstein said:\n\n       Mortgage-backed securities cannot be valued with any \n     confidence until there is more certainty about the future of \n     house prices.\n\n  That is precisely what this better Republican idea will get to. As my \ncolleagues discuss these ideas of how to relate to this, remember what \nthe original cause of the problem is, what we can affect and we cannot \naffect, and how we want to focus laser-like on fixing housing first.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank my colleague for so clearly outlining the \nnature of the problem.\n  I ask the Chair to let me know when we are about 3 minutes from the \nexpiration of the time.\n  There are two proposals we want to discuss which will be voted on \nhere which will help fix housing first. The first is by the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Ensign. Senator Ensign's idea will create instant jobs \nand give a jolt to the economy by giving an opportunity for lower \nmortgage interest rates to those persons who can afford to buy or \nrefinance their home.\n  There are other proposals, such as one by Senator McCain, to help \npeople who are in trouble with their mortgage. The focus of my \ncolleague is primarily on creditworthy Americans who could refinance \ntheir homes, save money, and get the economy moving?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The case has been made that we need to fix housing first \nbecause it is the underlying cancer that is affecting our economy, and \nthat cancer is spreading to other parts of the economy. If we don't fix \nthe underlying problem, it will not matter what we do with the rest of \nthe spending bill. The spending bill will not help the economy. It is \ngoing to continue to get worse and worse. If home values continue to go \ndown, no amount of money will help. We will have to have three or four \nTARP funds, trillions of dollars, and it is not going to help because \nwe have not fixed the underlying problem.\n  Several of us got together. I happen to be the lead author on the \nbill, but this is really a compilation of many minds trying to fix \nhousing. We have incorporated one of the ideas from Senator Isakson. I \nwill let him describe that.\n  One of the hallmarks of the bill is we try to fix housing in the \nbill. We eliminate the wasteful spending, and we have some targeted tax \ncredits for families and small businesses to create jobs. We try to \ntake care of the whole package, and we do it in a fiscally responsible \nway, so the total cost will be under $500 billion. It is not the $1.1 \ntrillion the other side of the aisle has put forward. Such spending \nwould put a tremendous burden on future generations.\n  What we have said is that we are going to allow anybody who has at \nleast a 5-percent equity in their home, or if they already have a \nFannie Mae-Freddie Mac-backed loan, would be able to refinance at about \n4 to 4.2 percent interest. The average American family who refinances \nwill save over $400 a month. That is not a one-time saving, that is a \nsaving through a 30-year fixed loan. That is like a permanent tax cut.\n  All of the economists have told us that one-time tax rebates give a \nlittle bit of stimulus, but they cost more in the long run. Permanent \ntax relief is really what stimulates the economy. If a family only \nreceives a one-time check, all they are going to do is pay down debt or \nsave the money. But if they know they have over $400 per month, that is \nsomething they can count on. They can budget that. They can start \nspending that money. That will actually help stimulate the economy.\n  The economists who have done the studies are Glenn Hubbard and \nChristopher Mayer. They said this proposal will stabilize housing \nprices next year because they expect housing prices to go down by about \n12 percent. If you lower interest rates on the average of about 1 \npercent, that historically has meant housing prices will rise about 7 \nto 8 percent. If we can get them down about a point and a half, they \nfigure, instead of going down by 12 percent, housing prices next year \nwill stabilize. We all know that if you do not stabilize housing prices \nin the United States, the economy is going to continue to go down.\n  I see the Presiding Officer from Colorado. Colorado is one of those \nStates that is having pretty severe housing problems now. These housing \nproblems started in my State, Nevada, and in Arizona, Florida, and \nCalifornia. They have spread to the rest of the country, so we need to \nfix this problem.\n  We have also put a limit on it. This is not for the rich. This is for \nloans of $750,000 or less. That is going to take\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\ncare of about 40 million Americans. That is what this takes care of, 40 \nmillion people refinancing their homes--40 million households, not \nAmericans--40 million households getting on average of over $400 a \nmonth. Put the numbers to that. That is a huge amount of money.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I understand the proposal, if I am a creditworthy \nperson, I can either refinance my home or buy a new home at this lower \ninterest rate, which today would be between 4 and 4.5 percent for a 30-\nyear mortgage. I would have that fixed mortgage all during that 30-year \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is correct, this is a 30-year fixed. This is not an \nadjustable rate mortgage where there are catches and in a couple of \nyears it is going to go up again and I am going to have to worry about \nthat. This is a 30-year fixed mortgage that can be very significant to \nthe average family's budget.\n  We believe this is going to be one of the big fixes. You combine this \nwith the other proposals, such as Senator Isakson's proposal, and the \nother things Senator McCain and Senator Martinez have come in with, \nwith mitigation for those who are underwater--ours does some for houses \nthat are underwater if they are backed by Fannie and Freddie right now. \nBut all of the proposals together--I believe we can do exactly what we \nsay needs to be done, and that is fix housing first.\n  But our proposal also takes out all of the spending in the bill that \ndoes not create jobs. We still have tax incentives in there for \nfamilies and small businesses to create jobs, but we take out all of \nthe $200 billion in new entitlement spending, all of the other 34 new \nprograms that are created. There are some worthy programs in there that \nmost of us would support. At this time, we should not be spending money \non new programs, especially without eliminating other programs.\n  We believe this is fiscally responsible. It is going to help the \neconomy. It is going to help the housing problem. I appreciate your \nleadership, Senator Alexander, for bringing this colloquy together so \nwe can talk about the underlying problem.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank Senator Ensign for his leadership and the \nothers on his proposal for their leadership. We hope it will attract \nsignificant Democratic support because I have heard a number of them \nsay we need to reorient this toward housing.\n  Senator Isakson was in the real estate business, and he often reminds \nus that this is not the first housing crisis we have had. As I \nunderstand, Senator Isakson, the proposal you made, which would be a \ntax credit to homeowners, was originally tried in the 1970s and worked?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. That is right, and I am delighted the Senator from \nTennessee called this colloquy today so we could talk for a few minutes \nabout what Jon Kyl and John Ensign said is the heart of the problem, \nand that is the U.S. housing market. Our houses are down 25 percent in \nthe last 18 months. Equity lines of credit are dissolved because houses \nare underwater. One in five houses in the United States is worth less \nthan what is owed on it.\n  It is rare when you come to the Senate at a time of crisis that you \nhave a roadmap to success. Most of the time, we are trying to feel our \nway through to find out what to do that is right. We have a roadmap to \nsuccess.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles \nfrom the New York Times, one from April of 1975 and one from July of \n1975.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 7, 1975]\n\n             New Housing Tax Credit Prompts Rise in Buying\n\n                            (By James Feron)\n\n       White Plains.--The recently enacted Federal tax credit on \n     the purchase of new homes and condominiums signed into law \n     last weekend seems to be achieving or even surpassing its \n     goal, according to initial reports on the situation in the \n     metropolitan area.\n       Robert Jacobs, marketing director of One Strawberry Hills, \n     a 118-unit condominium in Stamford, Conn., said today that \n     the idea was to reduce the number of empty and unsold housing \n     units, ``and to that we can only say, ``Amen.''\n       Mr. Jacobs closed deals on four apartments yesterday and \n     today, he said. ``All were borderline cases where the $2,000 \n     tax credit was evidently the deciding factor. We expect to \n     sell at least 10 of our 35 unsold units the same way.''\n       He reported that ``one man who had been renting in this \n     area, who was married but with no children, said he was in a \n     50 per cent tax bracket and the $2,000 credit would mean more \n     like $4,000 to him.''\n       The new Federal law calls for a 5 per cent tax credit up to \n     a maximum of $2,000 on the purchase of a new home providing, \n     among other things that the title be taken or the purchase be \n     made between March 12 and Dec. 31 of this year, that \n     construction began before March 26 and that the house or \n     condominium is the purchaser's principal residence.\n\n\n                            builders pleased\n\n       Builders interviewed in several suburban areas were \n     generally delighted with the law although they agreed that \n     one provision in particular would create difficulties until \n     the Internal Revenue Service produced a clarified regulation.\n       The difficult clause provides that purchases eligible for \n     the tax credit be made at the lowest price the home was \n     offered for sale. There is vast uncertainty over how to \n     determine ``lowest price'' in an industry where prices listed \n     in prospectus offerings can be adjusted upward, where rebates \n     and other incentives change price levels and where subsequent \n     additions to unsold units change their value.\n       John Tedesco, president of Kaufman and Broad Homes of New \n     Jersey, said a few days ago that ``if the I.R.S. doesn't set \n     some limit, such as `lowest price since Jan. 1, 1975,' for \n     example, the incentives will evaporate.''\n       Potential buyers, meanwhile are said to have been visiting \n     housing developments and condominiums throughout the \n     metropolitan area in increasing numbers since last Sunday, \n     the day after the measure became law. Martin Berger, \n     president of. Robert Martin Corporation, Westchester's \n     largest builder, said a few days ago:\n       ``We couldn't believe it. Easter Sunday is not usually a \n     big day and the weather was bad, but people came to us asking \n     about the credit and others reported the same thing. This \n     could provide a tremendous boost to the sagging residential \n     construction business and to the economy in general.''\n\n\n                             interest grows\n\n       The initial interest of last weekend was intensified \n     yesterday and today, especially where builders linked the \n     $2,000 credit to their advertisements in today's newspapers.\n       At Applehill Farm, in Chappaqua, Westchester County, where \n     56 homes are being built in a ``cluster'' development on a \n     former estate, Tom Bisogno said couples shopping for the \n     $70,000 to $90,000 units were asking if they qualify for the \n     rebate. ``We believe they do,'' he said, ``because ours is a \n     new development, less than a year old.''\n       Mr. Bisogno said he expected the real crush to come when \n     the I.R.S. clarified its ``lowest price'' ruling: Louis \n     Buonpane of the Parker Imperial, a condominium on the \n     Palisades in North Bergen, NJ, opposite 86th Street in \n     Manhattan, said traffic increased ``right after the President \n     signed the bill.''\n       Like Strawberry Hill, Parker Imperial is adding the tax \n     credit to previously announced price reductions necessitated \n     by a sluggish market. ``It's a good selling tool, this tax \n     credit, added to everything else,'' Mr. Buonpane said.\n       Another question puzzling some builders was how to define \n     when construction began. Many felt that the I.R.S. would \n     refer to putting down a ``footing,'' or pouring concrete, but \n     Mr. Tesdesco asked, ``If you clear the plot and install \n     services have you started construction on a house?''\n       Builders said that setting Dec. 31 as the cut-off date \n     would force quick decisions, which they liked. One builder \n     said, ``We're going to begin `countdown' advertising as soon \n     as we can--`You have only 100 days to make up your mind, \n     etc.,'--to encourage decisions. It could be dynamite for this \n     market.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 27, 1975]\n\n                    Home Buyers Get A New Enticement\n\n                         (By Ernest Dickinson)\n\n       Thousands of new housing units throughout the nation that \n     failed to meet the price qualification for 5 per cent Federal \n     tax credit will do so now because of an amendment \n     liberalizing the law.\n       The change, builders predict, will give an added boost to \n     new-home buying, especially between Labor Day and the end of \n     the year.\n       The law as it was passed in March specified that new \n     houses, condominiums and mobile homes had to be sold at the \n     lowest price for which they had ever been offered if their \n     buyers were to be eligible for the credit of as much as \n     $2,000.\n       But some builders with units that had been on the market \n     many months did not roll back prices to their original levels \n     because, they said, they could not do so without losing \n     money.\n       Under the amendment, which was signed into law June 30, the \n     builder must certify only that the price is the lowest at \n     which the home has been offered since Feb. 28, 1975.\n       The change greatly enlarges the number of qualifying \n     properties from which home buyers can choose this summer and \n     fall. The increase is most apparent among high-rise \n     condominiums.\n       At The Greenhouse In Cliffside Park, N.J., for example, 100 \n     of the 340 units remain\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\n     unsold. None of them qualified for the tax credit previously, \n     but all of them do now.\n       Ira Norris, the president of the Kaufman and Broad \n     Development Company, the builder, explained why. A high-rise \n     condominium is a large project, he noted, and once \n     construction starts, the entire building must be completed. \n     During the two-year construction period, however, many costs \n     escalated month by month. So completed apartments cannot be \n     sold at the price for which they were offered two years \n     earlier.\n       Ordinarily, builders of low-rise or single-family detached \n     housing can avoid that trap. If houses are not selling, the \n     builder can simply stop construction.\n       The new tax-law provision helps not only future buyers but \n     some past buyers as well. Its benefits are retroactive. A \n     buyer who closed a deal in the spring but did not qualify for \n     a tax credit then may now be able to obtain it.\n       This will be true if the only reason the property was not \n     eligible then was that the builder had sold it at a price he \n     raised before Feb. 28. A recent buyer who believes that his \n     new-home purchase may now entitle him to a tax credit should \n     contact his builder or local Internal Revenue Service office.\n       Some developers are taking the Initiative in such \n     situations. The builder of High Point of Hartsdale, in \n     Westchester County, for example, will soon be sending letters \n     of congratulation and the required certificates to about \n     eight buyers who previously purchased condominium apartments \n     that only now qualify for the credit.\n       Leland Zaubeler, a vice president of the Robert Martin \n     Corporation of Elmsford, which is building the 500-unit High \n     Point, said that about 15 per cent of the unsold partments \n     that previously did not qualify for a tax credit do qualify \n     now. ``The amendment is beneficial,'' Mr. Zaubeler said. ``It \n     helps carry out the original intent of the law--to move new \n     housing.''\n       The biggest problem with the legislation, according to many \n     builders, is that many people still do not understand what a \n     tax credit is.\n       According to Mr. Norris, they refuse to believe it is not \n     simply a tax deduction. ``We've had people bring lawyers into \n     our offices because they think we are trying to sell them a \n     bill of goods,'' he said. A tax credit is subtracted from the \n     final sum one owes the Government. If a home buyer qualified \n     for a $1,750 tax credit and his tax bill came to $1,750 or \n     less, he would not pay any tax.\n       Despite widespread misunderstanding, however, people are \n     starting to shop around again at last,'' said a spokesman for \n     U.S. Home Corporation in Clearwater, Fla., one of the \n     nation's largest builders. ``The tax credit has gotten people \n     out looking, though they may end up buying homes that don't \n     qualify.''\n       George A. Frank, who heads the Builders Institute of \n     Westchester and Putnam counties, agrees.\n       Westchester has about 800 new unsold condominium units but \n     very few new single-family homes, he said, adding: ``Because \n     of costs, with new houses bringing about $75,000 here, there \n     has been no large-scale building.''\n       But Mr. Frank and others believe that a ``countdown \n     psychology'' will develop in the fall as more and more buyers \n     realize that they have only until the end of the year to get \n     a tax credit.\n       ``It's a very persuasive opportunity,'' said one builder. \n     ``If the average condominium sells for $50,000, you can put \n     down $5,000, or 10 per cent, because most developers offer a \n     90 per cent mortgage. Then the $2,000 off your income tax \n     represents 40 per cent of the down payment''\n       The amount of the tax credit is figured by taking 5 per \n     cent of the total cost of acquisition (including closing \n     costs), minus any profit the buyer might realize in selling \n     his old house. The credit cannot exceed the total tax \n     liability. If a buyer qualifies for a maximum $2,000 credit \n     but his Federal tax totals only $1500, the latter amount is \n     all he can claim.\n       In general, homes that were never before occupied and that \n     were under construction or completed before March 26, 1975, \n     qualify for the credit.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will read the headlines: ``New Housing Tax Credit \nPrompts Rise in Buying; Consumers Respond to Federal Law by Closing \nDeals on Condominiums and Homes Here, Builders Say,'' and ``Home Buyers \nGet a New Enticement.''\n  In 1975, when the average price of a house was $35,000, the United \nStates was in worse shape than we are in today. We are fast approaching \nit, but we were worse. There was a 3-year supply of unsold houses on \nthe market, and there were no buyers.\n  Congress, the Democratic Congress, and Gerald Ford, a Republican \nPresident, passed a housing tax credit of $2,000 for a family who \nbought and occupied as their home a standing vacant house in inventory \nat the time, which is because all the inventory was new homes. That \n$2,000 tax credit spurred people to go to the marketplace, spurred them \nto buy those houses, and in 1 year's time we went from a 3-year supply \nof housing to a 10-month supply of housing. We solved 70 percent of the \nproblem with a tax credit.\n  What we are talking about in our legislation is a bill I introduced \nin January of last year. Everybody said it cost too much. Then, it cost \n$11.4 billion. We have now spent $3 or $4 trillion, and we have not \nsolved the problem yet. I suggest it is time we looked at an economical \nsolution.\n  What we have offered is a $15,000 or 10 percent of the purchase price \nof the house, whichever is less, tax credit which could be claimed \nagainst the 2008 tax return that will be filed in April or can be taken \n50 percent in 2009, 50 percent in 2010. What the family gets is a \n$15,000 tax credit or, as I said, 10 percent of the purchase price, \nwhichever is less.\n  This is going to benefit mainstream America. When they receive it, \nthey have to live in the house for 3 years as their home. If for some \nreason they move out during that time, it is prorated. But what will \nhappen in America now is what happened in 1975 when these articles in \nthe Times reported: Sales will come back, the floor will be put under \nthe housing market, values will stabilize, and they will begin to \nappreciate. And, as they do, equity will return to America's families; \nstability will return to the basic biggest asset our families have, \ntheir home; and we will begin to work our way out of this deep downward \nspiral we are currently in.\n  As has been said, it is not a catch phrase and it is not a slogan. If \nwe do not fix housing first, it does not matter what else we fix \nbecause throwing money at the symptoms, as Jon Kyl said, will not work. \nIf you are a doctor and you are trying to cure a patient, you go to the \nroot of the infection or the root of the problem, and you cut it out or \nyou deal with it.\n  This proposal, providing good, efficient, effective mortgage money \nfor refinance for Americans with good credit or those with Freddie Mac \nand Fannie Mae loans, this will bring borrowers who are in the market \nback to the market and will solve the problem.\n  My last comment to the Senator from Tennessee--I call people who used \nto work for me all the time to see how it is going. I call them in \nvarious States, including the State of Tennessee.\n  In Atlanta, GA, a couple of weeks ago, I talked to Glennis Beacham, \nwho is very successful. I said: Glennis, have you got a lot of buyers?\n  She said: I have a lot of buyers, Johnnie. They have money. They want \none of two things: They want a foreclosure or a short sale.\n  Right now you have a bottom-fishing market. You do not have people \nwho see any opportunity, and the buyers who are in are exploiting; they \nare not investing. It is time we incentivize all American families with \ntheir own money because it is their tax money against which the credit \nwill be taken to go out and buy a house. When we do, we will begin to \nfix housing first, and we will begin to stabilize a very teetering \neconomy.\n  I commend the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Georgia. Just to make sure it \nis clear, sometimes we confuse tax deduction and tax credit. This is a \n$15,000 tax credit. That means cash money, real money, that you can, \ninstead of paying it to the IRS, put in your pocket. Am I correct?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. You can invest it in your house.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. You can invest it in your house. The Senator from \nWyoming is here.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 7 and a half \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, please let me know when 2 minutes is \nremaining.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia. We have now heard a proposal to \ngive to all creditworthy Americans, which can be up to 40 million, the \nopportunity to buy or refinance a house with a Treasury-backed 4- to \n4.5-percent mortgage. We have heard Senator Isakson's proposal to give \neveryone who buys a home within this next year up to a $15,000 tax \ncredit.\n  The Senator from Wyoming was a small businessman before he came to \nthe Senate and is our only accountant here. What is the Senator's \nreaction to that, and how does he see housing fitting into the economic \nstimulus package that is being discussed?\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. We need to pass a bill that will fix housing first. We \nrecognized the problem about a year and a half ago, but Congress has \nnot focused on the housing piece of that and come up with a solution \nthat will work to fix housing.\n  ``Fix Housing First,'' the slogan the Senator came up with, I \nappreciate the efforts of the Senator from Tennessee and the \nunderstanding that he has of this and the ability to pull people \ntogether. I thank Senator Ensign for all of the work he has done on a \nsubstitute bill. I particularly thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nIsakson, for an idea that he has seen work before and knows will work \nagain and has done the math on it to update it to today. But we have to \nfix housing first. That is what started the problem, that is what is \ncontinuing the problem, that is what has tightened the pocketbooks of \nAmericans.\n  A realtor from Buffalo, WY, was in my office yesterday. He said the \nbanks do have some money, that they had made 50 loans, they were \nprocessing 50 loans at the moment. He said, unfortunately, only two of \nthose were for house sales. The rest of them were all refinancing as \nthe interest rates have come down.\n  Even people who can afford to buy a house are not buying a house \nbecause they do not know where the bottom is in the housing market. So \nuntil we do something to put a bottom in the housing market and assure \npeople who have bought houses as part of their retirement that their \nvalue is not going to go clear through the floor, America is not going \nto recover from this. People are not going to start spending. It is not \nGovernment spending that solves the problem, it is individual spending \nthat solves the problem. And the individuals have stopped spending.\n  Government money spends twice, circulates twice; private money \ncirculates seven times. We have to get the private money, the \nindividual money, the personal money, back into the economy again, and \nthat will make a difference.\n  The crisis began with the decline of housing prices in our Nation, a \nrising tide of foreclosures from homeowners who could no longer afford \nto make mortgage payments. The decline in the housing market sent \nshockwaves through our financial system as everybody realized their \ntriple-A-rated investments looked more like junk bonds. With banks \nunwilling to lend against assets of an unknown value, our credit market \ncame grinding to a halt. That is where we are today.\n  Now, the original plan of TARP was to buy toxic loans, to get those \nout of the market, to stabilize the banks. That did not happen. When we \nwork in a hurry to pass something around here, particularly if it deals \nwith a lot of dollars, we can often wind up in a different direction \nthan where we thought we were going. Right now this bill is not focused \non housing. It needs to be focused on housing, and focused on housing \nfirst.\n  Government spending by itself will not solve the problem. We cannot \nspend our way out of it. We have tried that before. We tried it in the \n1930s. Government interference did not help. So we need to take some of \nthis money and devote it to stemming foreclosures, invigorating the \nhousing market, and getting our financial institutions and individual \ninvestors to step back into the market without fear.\n  I have a lot more I would like to say, but I know our time is \nlimited. I would like the Senator from Tennessee to be able to conclude \nthis discussion, conclude the beginning of the long discussion I hope \nwill put housing first. Until we solve housing first, we do not have a \nsolution.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his leadership \nand his understanding of business that has come the hard way, through \nexperience in his town.\n  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, is on the Senate floor to speak \non a different amendment. But he, too, has a proposal that will deal \nwith fixing housing first. So our point is this: We understand \nAmericans are hurting, that our economy is in a slump. But we also \nunderstand that if we do not deal with the national debt, we will be \ndoing the worst thing that we could ever do to the working men and \nwomen of America: that is, having long-term inflation where dollars do \nnot amount to anything and you cannot buy anything.\n  So our focus, instead of adding to the debt by over $1 trillion, is \nto reorient the stimulus package toward a true stimulus and fix housing \nfirst. That is what the 4-percent mortgage for creditworthy Americans \nis for. That is what the $15,000 tax credit for home buyers is for. \nThat is what the Republican proposals to help people with foreclosures \nare for. That is part 1, fix housing first.\n  Part 2 is let people keep more of their own money. Those are tax \nreductions. Then part 3 is take off this bill all of the spending items \nthat do not have anything to do with creating jobs now. So we welcome \nthe calls for bipartisan work. We are ready to work. We have good \nideas: fix housing first, let people keep more of their own money, and \nfocus the bill on spending projects that create jobs today, not those \nthat do not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of Senator \nFeingold and Senator McCain, who I know have a very important \namendment. They have allowed me to come to the floor before them and \nspeak about the amendment Senator Snowe and I will be offering later.\n  I thank Senator Feingold and Senator McCain, and it is not my \nintention to give a lengthy speech at this point.\n  Last week, Americans were horrified to hear the news that Citigroup \nand other companies receiving taxpayer money from the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program were paying their employees billions and billions of \ndollars in bonuses.\n  Today, along with Senator Olympia Snowe, our colleague from Maine, I \nwill offer a bipartisan amendment to this legislation that makes it \nclear it is not enough to say these Wall Street bonuses are wrong; they \nhave to be paid back.\n  Taxpayers must be protected, and that is what the amendment Senator \nSnowe and I are offering will do. Our proposal gives the institutions \nthat received Troubled Asset Relief Program money and paid these \noutlandish bonuses a simple choice: The institutions will pay back the \ncash portion of any bonus paid in excess of $100,000 within 120 days of \nthe amendment's enactment or those institutions would face an excise \ntax of 35 percent on what is not repaid to the Treasury.\n  The money can be repaid by buying back the preferred stock the \nFederal Government owns in these companies or in any other fashion the \ninstitution chooses. Senator Snowe and I have had extensive legal \nreview with respect to the constitutionality of this provision. We \nbelieve it passes constitutional muster.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter sent to me yesterday by Edward Kleinbard of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Wyden: You have asked me whether I believe \n     that there is a constitutional issue associated with your \n     legislative proposal to impose an excise tax on certain 2008 \n     bonuses paid by TARP recipients that do not repay the amount \n     of those bonuses in 2009 (through redeeming the preferred \n     stock issued to the United States). There are many Supreme \n     Court and other cases that have considered the question of \n     when a tax might be held to be unconstitutional by virtue of \n     its retroactive application, and as a result I am not able to \n     answer your question definitively without more time to read \n     the extensive jurisprudence. As a very preliminary matter, \n     however, I believe that your proposal would be held to be \n     constitutional if challenged in court.\n       First, I believe that there is a powerful argument that \n     your proposal is simply not retroactive. Taxpayers can avoid \n     the tax completely by repurchasing shares they sold to the \n     United States; the excise tax would be imposed, not on prior \n     bonuses, but on the taxpayer's affirmative post-enactment \n     decision not to repurchase those shares at the same price \n     that the shares were sold to the United States. Moreover, the \n     timing, repurchase price and amount of shares that must be \n     repurchased are not punitive, and are commensurate with the \n     conduct that Congress can rationally find to be contrary to \n     the purpose and intent of the EESA legislation that \n     authorized the Treasury's investments.\n       Even if the excise tax were (contrary to the conclusion \n     suggested above) viewed as having retroactive effect, the \n     Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\n     has generally given a high level of judicial deference to \n     economic legislation and has repeatedly upheld retroactive \n     taxation as constitutional, so long as the legislation is \n     ``supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by \n     rational means . . .'' Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. \n     Gray & Co., 467 U.S. 717 (1984). For example, under the Tax \n     Reform Act of 1969, an individual was permitted a $30,000 \n     exemption in calculating his minimum tax liability. The \n     Revenue Act of 1976, passed in October of 1976, reduced the \n     exemption to $10,000 and applied the change retroactively to \n     all tax years beginning after December 31, 1975. The Supreme \n     Court upheld this retroactive amendment in United States v. \n     Darusmont, 499 U.S. 292 (1981).\n       As another example, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 granted a \n     special deduction for the sale of employer securities by an \n     estate to an employee stock ownership plan (``ESOP''). In \n     December of 1987 Congress amended the statute to provide that \n     the securities sold to an ESOP must have been directly owned \n     by the decedent immediately prior to his or her death, and \n     made the amendment effective as if it had been contained in \n     the statute as originally enacted. In United States v. \n     Carlton, 512 U.S. 26 (1994), the Supreme Court once again \n     upheld the retroactive application of the tax, in this case \n     against an estate that had relied on the original language to \n     engage in a transaction that it believed would have reduced \n     its tax liability by several million dollars. There are \n     numerous other appellate and Supreme Court cases to similar \n     effect.\n       Your legislative proposal presents a particularly strong \n     case for constitutionality since it has only a modest look-\n     back period, as was the case in Darusmont, and is arguably a \n     curative measure (with regard to the executive compensation \n     provisions of TARP), as was the case in Carlton.\n       Please let me know if you have any further questions.\n\n                                                 Edward Kleinbard,\n                                      Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will read briefly now from the letter from Mr. \nKleinbard. I will quote from the second paragraph:\n\n       There is a powerful argument that your proposal is simply \n     not retroactive.\n\n  It is his judgment, based on what he has been able to look at thus \nfar, it would be constitutional.\n  Mr. Kleinbard states specifically:\n\n       Taxpayers can avoid the tax completely by repurchasing \n     shares they sold to the United States; the excise tax would \n     be imposed not on prior bonuses, but on the taxpayer's \n     affirmative post-enactment decision not to repurchase those \n     shares at the same price that the shares were sold to the \n     United States. Moreover, the timing, repurchase price and \n     amount of shares that must be repurchased are not punitive, \n     and are commensurate with the conduct that Congress can \n     rationally find to be contrary to the purpose and intent of \n     the EESA legislation that authorized the Treasury's \n     investments.\n\n  I think anyone who looks at the letter from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation will see that the bipartisan amendment Senator Snowe and I \nwill be offering with respect to excessive cash bonuses is a matter \nthat does pass constitutional muster and clearly is in the taxpayers' \ninterest.\n  I note my colleagues, particularly from Tennessee and Georgia, have \nmade a number of good points that I happen to feel strongly about with \nrespect to the need to address the current housing crisis, and one of \nthe things we have seen with respect to housing and all of the other \neconomic challenges we have is we have to get people's confidence back \nin the American economy.\n  I believe the Snowe-Wyden amendment will help to generate that \nconfidence by saying at some point we are going to say excessive \nbonuses are being paid, in effect, with taxpayer money. I mean these \nare companies who received billions and billions of taxpayer dollars.\n  If we are going to have the confidence we need to promote housing, as \nthe distinguished Senators from Tennessee and Georgia both noted, we \nhave to make sure taxpayers do not say: This is wrong. This is not \nright to give these excessive bonuses with taxpayer money.\n  I would note that Senator Snowe and I set the limit for bonuses at \n$100,000. So, clearly, we want to be sensitive to the young person \ngetting started in financial services, someone, perhaps, who was a \nsecretary. But it is the outlandish bonuses that we are concerned \nabout.\n  I would also note these TARP institutions have not yet paid their \n2008 taxes. So what we have is a situation where a number of these \ncompanies have not yet paid their 2008 taxes. In other parts of this \neconomic recovery legislation we are giving retroactive tax benefits. \nCertainly, that is the case with the net operating loss provisions, the \ncarryback provisions, with respect to business.\n  So it seems to me, if you are giving those kinds of retroactive tax \nbreaks, you surely ought to take steps to protect taxpayers, as Senator \nSnowe and I seek to do with our legislation. The bottom line is, the \nWall Street firms that took bailout money knew they were not supposed \nto pay their executives lavish bonuses, but they went ahead and paid \nout more than $18 billion in bonuses anyway.\n  The Wyden-Snowe amendment makes sure these firms can't take the money \nand give the Congress and taxpayers the runaround. If they took the \nbailout money, the Wall Street firms either have to pay taxpayers back \nfor the excessive bonuses, or they ought to pay a tax on these bonus \npayments. Either way, they should not be allowed to pay outrageous \nbonuses to executives and stick taxpayers with the bill. It is \nfundamentally wrong to reward with billions of taxpayer dollars this \nkind of conduct. We have all heard about handing out of bonuses to \nexecutives at firms responsible for the current economic meltdown. But \nwhat happened a couple of weeks ago takes this to a completely \ndifferent level. At a time when the Congress is faced almost on a \nweekly basis with requests for billions of dollars of additional money, \nhow in the world can we allow these kinds of bonuses, with taxpayer \nmoney, to stand, as if the economy were booming?\n  My colleagues from Wisconsin and Arizona have been waiting patiently. \nI hope Members will look at the amendment Senator Snowe and I are \noffering. I hope they will look at the legal analysis provided by the \nJoint Committee on Taxation with respect to how and why this particular \nproposal passes constitutional muster. I hope the Senate will say it is \nnot enough to just give speeches about how it is wrong to hand out \nthese bonuses with taxpayer money but will back bipartisan legislation \nto correct it and to protect taxpayers at a critical time when we must \nincrease confidence in how major economic decisions are made.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be \nset aside and that we take up amendment No. 140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to be working with a \ntripartisan group on this issue: Senators McCaskill, Graham, Lieberman, \nBurr, and Coburn and, of course, most significantly, how great it is to \nbe working again with my friend John McCain. This is an issue, in \naddition to ones we have worked on over the years, that he and I care \ndeeply about, trying to deal with the abuse of earmarks. It is a real \ncancer in our budget system.\n  Our amendment is straightforward. It establishes a 60-vote point of \norder against unauthorized earmarks in appropriations bills. It also \nrequires that recipients of Federal funding disclose what they spend on \nlobbying.\n  Before arguing the need for the amendment, I want to briefly \nacknowledge that we have actually come a long way in recent years in \ndisclosing earmarks. In the last Congress, we passed the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act of 2007, more commonly referred to \nas the ethics and lobbying reform bill. That measure was the most \nsignificant earmark reform Congress has ever enacted, and it reflected \nwhat I think is a growing recognition by Members that the business-as-\nusual days of using earmarks to avoid the scrutiny of the authorizing \nprocess or of competitive grants are coming to an end. It was no \naccident that the two Presidential nominees of the two major parties \nwere major players on that reform package. It would be a mistake not to \nacknowledge how far we have come. The Honest Leadership and Open \nGovernment Act was an enormous step forward. I commend the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, as well as our former colleague from Illinois, \nPresident Obama, for their work in ensuring that landmark bill passed. \nBut it would be a mistake not to admit that we still have a long way to \ngo.\n  Our amendment will build on the significant achievements of the 110th \nCongress by moving from what has largely\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\nbeen a system designed to dissuade the use of earmarks through \ndisclosure to one that actually makes it much more difficult to enact \nthem. The principal provision of this amendment is the establishment of \na point of order against unauthorized earmarks on appropriations bills. \nObviously, to overcome the point of order, supporters of the \nunauthorized earmark will need to obtain a supermajority of the Senate. \nAs a further deterrent, the bill provides that any earmarked funding \nwhich is successfully stricken from the appropriations bill will be \nunavailable for other spending in the bill. It isn't the sort of a \nthing where you can borrow from one piece and fix it with another. You \nhave to reduce the bill by that amount.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the amendment also requires all recipients of \nFederal funds to disclose any money spent on registered lobbyists. It \nis only fair that the American people know which entities receiving \nFederal funding are spending money to lobby Congress. There may be no \nconnection between the lobbying and the Federal funding, but a little \ntransparency would help everyone decide that for themselves.\n  I truly am delighted that President Obama is committed to keeping \nthis stimulus package free of earmarks. We can ensure that his \ncommitment is made good on future appropriations bills by adopting this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my good friend \nSenator Feingold in offering this fiscally responsible amendment, along \nwith Senators McCaskill, Burr, Lieberman, Graham, Coburn, and others. \nMay I say that I find there are very few pleasant aspects of losing an \nelection, but one of them that I most value is going back to work with \nmy friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, whom, for now many years, I \nhave had the great honor and privilege of working with as we attempt to \nbring about the reforms which will help restore the confidence and \ntrust of the American people in the way we do business in Washington \nbut also in our stewardship of their tax dollars. I am pleased to join \nwith my good friend Senator Feingold.\n  Senator Feingold outlined the provisions of the amendment so I don't \nwant to repeat them. But I also want to point out that some people are \nsaying: Why should we have this on this legislation, when this stimulus \npackage does not directly apply? We know there is an omnibus \nappropriations bill coming down the pike. The House of Representatives \nintends to take it up soon. There is apparently, unfortunately, another \nTARP that may be coming, not to mention the other appropriations bills \nthat will be coming. So the sooner we address this issue, the better \noff we will be. I also think one of the reasons why support for the \nstimulus package is rapidly eroding is because you don't have to call \nit an earmark and it doesn't have to be technically an earmark, but \nwhen you see many of the provisions in this stimulus bill, they have \nnothing to do with stimulus and everything to do with spending. They \nare fundamentally earmarks as well, certainly in their effect.\n  It is not only appropriate but necessary to adopt this amendment so \nthat the American people will know in the future, when we make tough \ndecisions, this kind of practice of adding absolutely unnecessary, \nunwarranted spending of their tax dollars on appropriations bills \nwithout a proper process of scrutiny and ability to reject them will \nnot occur. It will not restore their confidence. The stimulus package \nbefore us is important, but right now the American people see it not as \na stimulus but a spending package. That is why this provision will \nrestore some confidence in the future way we address their tax dollars.\n  Every time Senator Feingold and I have tried to kill off a specific \nunwanted and unnecessary and, many times, outrageous appropriation, if \nwe had succeeded, it would have taken down the whole bill. So one of \nthe important aspects of this legislation is to allow us to rifleshot \nand remove unnecessary and wasteful spending.\n  I don't have to go through the list, but it is always kind of fun to \ndo it. Even though we passed in January 2007, by a vote of 96 to 2, an \nethics and lobbying reform package that had meaningful reforms, by \nAugust of 2007, we were presented with a bill containing very watered-\ndown earmark provisions and doing far too little to rein in wasteful \nearmarks. Since we adopted the much heralded reforms of January 2007, \nwe have spent $188,000 for the Lobster Institute, which includes a \nlobster cam at the bottom of the ocean, which so far we have been \nunable to make work; $98,000 to develop a walking tour of Boydton, VA, \npopulation 454; $212,000 for olive fruit fly research in Paris, France; \n$1.95 million for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service; \n$150,000 for the Montana Sheep Institute--almost every one of these \nearmarks location specific required--$345,000 for tree planting in \nChicago; $196,000 for the renovation of an historic post office in Las \nVegas; $150,000 for the STEEED program, Soaring Towards Educational \nEnrichment via Equine Discovery, a youth program in Washington, DC; \n$100,000 for Cooters Pond Park in Prattville, AL; $50,000 for \nconstruction of a National Mule and Packers Museum in Bishop, CA; \n$244,000 for bee research in Weslaco, TX.\n\n  The point is, some of these projects I am talking about may have \nvirtue. It may be of the utmost national importance in this time of \nrecord deficits that we have a lobster cam at the bottom of the ocean \nand that we should spend $188,000 for it. But it should be subject to \ndebate and discussion and amendment and acceptance or rejection.\n  What Senator Feingold and I are seeking is a process where these \nearmarks can be judged on their value, their contribution to the \noverall economy, and whether they are necessary. Under the present \nsystem, they are still inserted without the Congress having the ability \nto carefully examine them.\n  It also would require recipients of Federal dollars to disclose any \namounts that the recipient has expended on registered lobbyists. There \nis a new game in town--not so new, it has been going on for some years, \nbut it grows--and that is that special interests, universities, others \nwill go to a specific lobbying group, and they will then seek the \nearmarks this interest desires and believes is required. There are \ncertain, obviously, amounts of money given to those lobbyists for their \nwork. We are not saying they should not do that. We are saying that the \namounts of money given to the lobbyists as a result of the recipients \nof Federal dollars obtaining those funds should be revealed.\n  Again, $446,500 for horseshoe crab research at Virginia Tech in \nVirginia; $500,000 for a maritime museum in Mobile, AL; $360,000 for \nHawaii rain gauges; $401,850 for the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, IL.\n  This process has got to end. The American people do not trust the \nCongress to dispose of their tax dollars without these billions of \nearmarks, or at least a process where they are scrutinized and Members \nof Congress have the ability not to just vote on an appropriations bill \nthat appears on the Member's desk shortly before the vote takes place. \nThe appropriators will tell us these are all worthwhile projects. They \nare not, and they have resulted in corruption. There are former Members \nof Congress residing in Federal prison today because this process--this \nprocess--has corrupted people. It has to be fixed.\n\n  So I could go in citing examples of unauthorized earmarks and policy \nriders in appropriations bills and conference reports. But I think you \nhave the picture. By the way, an egregious example that is being \ninvestigated today is that for one of the appropriations bills, \nappropriations were inserted after the bill was passed and signed by \nthe President of the United States--a remarkable occurrence--a \nremarkable occurrence. It shows how far we have gone in our obligations \nto the American people.\n  I would like to say a word to my own side of the aisle. We just lost \nan election, and I will take the responsibility for that. But I can \nassure my colleagues on this side of the aisle that one of the reasons \nwhy Republicans lost the last election is because our base, who are \nconcerned about our stewardship of their tax dollars, believes we got \non a spending spree which has mortgaged our children's futures.\n\n[[Page S1481]]\n\n  If there is a future on this side of the aisle, then we have to clean \nup our act on spending. Time after time, when some of us said: You have \nto veto these spending bills, the answer was: Well, we have to please \nMembers. What we did was we alienated those American citizens--frankly, \nof all parties--who feel strongly we have lost our sense of obligation \nto them as far as careful stewardship of their tax dollars is \nconcerned.\n  I wish to mention one other thing. I had a very good conversation \nwith the President of the United States. We all want to work together \nto pass this stimulus, a stimulus package that will get our economy \ngoing again. I look forward, as do other Members on this side of the \naisle, as well as the other side, to sit down, and let's have some \nserious negotiations so we can eliminate wasteful and unnecessary \nspending that is part of the stimulus package that is before the Senate \ntoday.\n  We should make sure we adopt an amendment that as soon as the GDP \nimproves for two quarters by 2 percent, we will then enact spending \ncuts to put us on the road to a balanced budget. We need to do that. We \nused to talk about millions of dollars and then we started talking \nabout billions of dollars and now we are talking about trillions of \ndollars of deficits that will be run up that we will lay on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  With this stimulus package, there must be a commitment to stop this \nspending and to reduce spending once our economy recovers, so we can \nhave some sense of ability to put this Nation on a path to a balanced \nbudget to eliminate the debt and deficit we are laying on future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Americans are beginning to turn against the stimulus package as it is \npresently designed. They are doing that because they do not believe it \nis a stimulus package. They believe, correctly, it is a spending \npackage. I urge my colleagues to help restore confidence in whatever \nthe outcome is, that we adopt this amendment, so in the future the \nAmerican people can be sure we will have done our very best to \neliminate unnecessary, wasteful, and corrupting spending that has \ncharacterized the expenditures we have made in the past on \nappropriations bills that contained those unwanted, unnecessary \nspending practices.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, again, and my friend, Senator \nLieberman, and Members on both sides of the aisle who will support this \namendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the Feingold-McCain amendment. I heard my \nfriend from Wisconsin refer to this as an amendment with tripartisan \nsupport. Hearing that, I rushed to the floor to validate his \ndescription of it.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. It is quite \nappropriate that this amendment is being offered on this Economic \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act. I support this act strongly. It is \ncritically important. It is gravely important we adopt this \nlegislation, and adopt it soon, to kick start our economy, to start \ncreating and protecting jobs again.\n  But there is an awful lot of money in this measure that has to be \nspent quickly. There are oversight actions and institutions that have \nbeen made part of the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act. But it \ngives us an opportunity to deal directly with what has become known as \nthe earmark problem or the earmark crisis or the earmark scandal to \nsome.\n  I support this amendment and have cosponsored it because it does not \nend what has begun to be described as earmarks. It reforms the process. \nIt creates a legislative vehicle for any 1 of 100 of us to stand and \nsay: Hey, wait a second. What is this appropriation without \nauthorization that has been put into this bill and to essentially \ndemand, by raising a point of order, that 60 of the 100 of us agree \nthat it is worth spending taxpayers' money on this particular \nappropriation.\n  This is necessary because we have taken a legitimate constitutionally \ncreated function of Congress--the power to appropriate--and we have \nmisused it in too many cases that it now requires us to create a \nprocess to basically say, at times when it is justified: Stop. Stop \nthis particular appropriation, this particular earmark.\n  When I talk about a constitutionally ordained process, I am talking \nabout the fact that the Constitution gives Congress, uniquely, the \npower to appropriate public funds. It is simply a matter of record, \nwhich my colleagues from Wisconsin and Arizona have made more than \nclear this morning again, that the power we have been given to \nappropriate has, in some cases, been misused in what now are called \nearmarks. So we need to create this checkpoint to say: No, let's demand \n60 votes for this one.\n  The amendment would also require all recipients of Federal dollars to \ndisclose any amounts the recipient has expended on registered \nlobbyists. This is a way also to create some transparency--the sunlight \nthat Justice Brandeis, I believe it was, said was the best disinfectant \nfor bad behavior in Government.\n  So I am proud to be a cosponsor. I hope we take this moment, as we \nappropriate necessary funding--hundreds of billions of dollars--to say \nthat on all other appropriations bills coming along, every Member of \nthis Senate will have the opportunity to ask something very reasonable \nand sensible: If they doubt the necessity, the validity of a particular \nappropriations earmark, that 60 of us have to say: No, we think it is \nOK.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 106\n\n  Madam President, I am not sure, at this point, what the regular order \nis. I also have come to the floor to speak about an amendment the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, and I have offered. If it is \nappropriate, now I would speak for a few minutes on it. If not, I will \nwait until that amendment comes up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I promise my colleagues I will \nbe brief.\n  Senator Isakson and I have offered an amendment which will create a \n$15,000 tax credit for any purchaser of a home within a year after the \ndate of enactment. There is no recapture clause for that. We do so to \noffer one of what we hope will be a series of measures to revive the \nhousing market and housing values as a critical part of reviving our \neconomy and creating jobs.\n  Very briefly, it was the subprime mortgage scandal, the bubble in \nhousing prices, the collapse of housing prices, that has been at the \nheart of the follow-on collapse in our financial institutions and the \ncollapse in confidence, particularly, the confidence of the American \nconsumer, whose demand, whose consumption, drives 70 percent of the \nAmerican economy.\n  So bottom line: I saw a statistic from a reputable economist about a \nweek ago, 2 weeks ago now, that estimated in the last year there had \nbeen a loss of $4 trillion in the value of real estate in our country--\n$4 trillion. We are talking about $4 trillion of value in houses, which \nfor most Americans--middle-income, lower middle, and lower income--who \ncould afford to own a house, was the major asset they had, the major \nasset of value, the major source within them for which they had \neconomic confidence because it was worth something beyond what the \nmortgage was. That is part of what gave them the confidence then to go \nout and consume, to drive our economy forward.\n  The collapse of housing values, the dramatic drop in activity--\nhousing purchases and sales--is at the heart of the collapse in \nconfidence and the spiraling downward of our economy today, and we \nsimply will not get our economy going again unless we get that moving.\n  This credit Senator Isakson and I are proposing--we are not saying is \ngoing to solve all the problems. There has to be action in other ways. \nThere has to be action through the Treasury Department in the second \ntranche of the so-called TARP money to help people stay in their homes, \nparticularly those who are in homes that are now worth less than the \nmortgage they have. There has to be action to try to lower interest \nrates and so on.\n  But we think this action will really kick start the housing market by \ngiving a $15,000 tax credit, refundable, to anybody who buys a house \nwithin a\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nyear of the date of enactment. That will drive sales. As you watch the \ninterest rates coming down--and interest rates are at a low of many \nyears, when you can get a mortgage--and then with the action through \nthe Treasury Department to increase liquidity, and you add on a $15,000 \ntax credit, I think people are going to go out and buy homes. That is \ngoing to begin to raise the value of homes. If a home sells on the \nstreet, everybody else's house goes up in value. Then people's sense of \ntheir own wealth, their own economic well-being, is going to increase, \nand I think it will give them the confidence to go out and begin to \nconsume.\n  In 2008, I can tell you, Connecticut's housing market experienced its \nsharpest decline in home sales and median home prices in 20 years. \nSingle family home sales fell nearly 24 percent. This proposal Senator \nIsakson and I are making obviously costs some money. But compared to \nother proposals that have been made, this one will pay a return on the \ndollar.\n  Although we are waiting for a final estimate, I would anticipate the \namendment could cost as much as $20 billion. However, we have had \neconomic estimates from credible economists who have looked at the \namendment Senator Isakson and I are offering and said they believe it \ncould lead to as many as 1.1 million home purchases within this year, \nthat it would generate 539,000 new jobs, mostly in construction, and \n$14 billion in Federal tax revenues. So that is a tremendous return on \nwhat this will cost the Treasury. Senator Isakson will show it in his \ncomments, because we have talked about this--this has been tried once \nbefore in a terrible housing crisis in the 1970s and worked very well.\n\n  I am proud to stand with my friend from Georgia. This is a bipartisan \namendment; perhaps I should say tripartisan. It deserves to have \ntripartisan and, I would hope, unanimous support as something that has \nbeen proven in the past and will work again today to get people's home \nvalues rising, because there will be the demand to buy houses in \nAmerica once again.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nafter the Senator from Georgia has completed his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Reserving the right to object, would it be good to lock \nin the speakers who are here at the same time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I don't want to do that because I am \nthe manager for this bill and I have been waiting to speak. I want the \nfloor after the Senator from Maryland completes his remarks, and I \nthink I am entitled to it.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would never cross the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, first, I want to thank Senator \nLieberman for his very responsive remarks and for his cosponsorship for \nthis legislation that creates a floor for housing once again and for us \nto end what has become a terrible economic crisis.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 106, As Modified\n\n  I called this amendment up last night and now I wish to ask unanimous \nconsent to send a modification of the amendment to the desk for \nreplacement of the existing amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the amendment is merely a technical \namendment on dates and no other substantial change.\n  It is rare that we have a roadmap to success in times of difficulty, \nbut this country has once before realized a housing crisis every bit as \nbad as the one we have today and economic troubles and unemployment \nevery bit as dangerous, and that was in 1974. In 1975, the Democratic \nCongress and a Republican President, Gerald Ford, came together for the \nAmerican people and passed a $2,000 tax credit for the purchase of any \nstanding, vacant, new house and in one year's time a 3-year inventory \nhad been dissipated to 10 months, housing was restored, values \nreturned, and the economy again began to prosper.\n  Thirteen months ago, in January of last year, I introduced this same \namendment. It was scored at that time by Joint Tax at a cost of $11.4 \nbillion. The Finance Committee in its wisdom elected not to include \nthis in the proposal because they said it was too expensive. Since they \nsaid that was too expensive, we have spent $4 trillion between the \nFederal Reserve and the Congress and the U.S. Treasury, and the problem \nis worse. So I would submit this is a very small price to pay for a \nsolution that at least we have an historical precedent that it works.\n  The score on this legislation is $18.9 billion. The legislation \nprovides a $15,000 tax credit, or 10 percent of the purchase price, \nagainst either 2008 income where one can monetize it at the closing \ndate this year, or half in 2009 and half in 2010, for anyone who buys \nas their principal residence any single-family dwelling or single-\nfamily condominium or attached townhouse available in the United States \nof America. We have a pervasive housing problem, and the worst hurt \nright now are the people who are paying their mortgages, the people who \nare in decent shape, the people who are having to sell because of a \ntransfer; they have no market and they don't because everybody is going \nfor short sales or they are going for foreclosures or they are going \nbottom fishing. They are bottom fishing with your equity and mine. They \nare bottom fishing to find the best deal they can get at the bottom of \nthe trough. It is going to keep spiraling down until this Congress and \nthis country address the root of the problem which is the death of the \nhousing market, puts a floor under it, stabilizes it, and gives it a \nmotivation to improve.\n  Senator Lieberman's quote is absolutely correct. Right now, we are at \na housing sale rate of a half a million houses a year. This country \naveraged 1.2 million in the last 10 years. This bill will take us back \nto 1.2 million, as his statistics prove. We have tremendous \nunemployment. This legislation will bring about estimates of 500,000 to \n600,000 jobs back to America, not in 2 years, not in 10 years, but now. \nSo I respectfully submit we have a chance to join together, learn from \nhistory, repeat history that worked, and adopt this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his support. I thank Senator Chambliss \nfor coming on as a cosponsor and Senator Corker and, as I understand \nfrom the calls I have had in the last day, many more from both sides of \nthe aisle. It is time to fix America's problem, not throw money at the \nsymptoms. It is time to fix housing first in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me comment on the underlying bill \nand then I will ask unanimous consent to set aside an amendment so I \ncan offer an amendment.\n  First, let me comment on the underlying bill. We need to give \nPresident Obama the tools necessary for our economic recovery. \nPresident Obama said 2 weeks ago in his inaugural address the \nchallenges we face are real, they are serious, and they are many. They \nwill not be met easily or in a short span of time, but they will be \nmet.\n  I think our responsibility is to make sure he has the tools necessary \nin order to be able to deal with our economic crisis. The current \nstatus of our economy is worse than any of us have seen in our \nlifetime. The gross national product fell 4 percent in the final \nquarter of 2008; our unemployment rates are at 7.2 percent.\n  Regarding home ownership and foreclosure, I know my Republican \ncolleagues have had some discussion about trying to do more in that \nregard. This bill will save homeowners their homes. In my State of \nMaryland, we had 41,500 foreclosures in 2008, an increase of 71 \npercent. I need to point out that last year, it was the Senate \nRepublicans who required seven cloture votes on the Foreclosure \nPrevention Act before we could take it up. At that time, 8,500 families \nwere in some stage of foreclosure every day. The five months of \nstalling caused 1.2 million families to receive some form of \nforeclosure filings. The Republicans blocked amendments to provide \nadditional funding for housing counseling and to let bankruptcy judges \nmodify terms of subprime mortgages which could have kept 600,000 \nfamilies in their homes.\n  So let me make it clear. We all want to preserve home ownership. We \nall want to prevent foreclosure. The underlying bill will help us get \nto that moment which we should have done earlier, and I regret that the \nfilibusters prevented us from doing that.\n  Now, it is not only home ownership. People are losing their jobs. \nRetailers, automobile dealers, and restaurants are feeling the pinch. \nSmall business owners are closing their doors. We need jobs and we need \nconsumer confidence. The underlying legislation will allow for job \ngrowth. That is the No. 1 objective: Create more jobs in America \nbecause we are losing them today. President Obama made it clear the \ncriteria for this bill must be that the investments we make must be \ntargeted to new job growth. He does that through targeted tax credits \nand tax cuts, through aid to our local governments to avoid the layoffs \nthat each one of our States will confront with State workers. In my \nState of Maryland, Governor O'Malley is having a very difficult time \nwith the State budget. He knows we need help in order to preserve State \nemployment and to preserve the type of services that the State must \nprovide for essential services during a recession.\n  This legislation provides direct investment for projects that are \nready to go, that will create jobs, and that are the right investments \nfor America's future. I don't disagree with my colleagues as we look at \neach individual request that is made here. There are no earmarks in \nthis legislation, but we\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nwant to make sure there are right investments for America's future, \nwhether it is improving education, educational facilities, energy so we \ncan become energy independent, broadband so that we can compete in the \nfuture, health care technology so we can become more efficient in the \nway we deliver health care, our transportation system--I particularly \nmention public transportation which is critically important for our \ncommunities--or whether it is preserving home ownership. Also, the \nunderlying bill must be temporary. We need to get back to balancing the \nbudget; we understand that.\n  So what does this bill mean for the people of Maryland? Well, our \nState will receive directly $3.1 billion. We will receive $420 million \nfor highways, $240 million for transit projects, $27 million for \ndrinking water improvements, $96 million to improve wastewater facility \nplants, which is in desperate need in Maryland. The State energy \nprogram will get $8.5 million; weatherization assistance so that \nhomeowners can have their homes much more efficient as it relates to \nthe use of energy, $56.5 million. Many of the infrastructures that are \nbeing improved by this bill are 30, 40, 50 years old. A lot of our \nwastewater treatment facilities are in need of modernization. They are \nready to go. The money has not been there for it. These are capital \nimprovements so we can compete and have a better society. Once it is \ndone, we can get back to being more competitive and get back to the \nbudget discipline that is so necessary in this Congress.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the real estate market. The real \nestate market triggered this recession. We know that. I was listening \nto my colleagues talk about that on the floor and I agree with them. It \nis difficult for people to get into the mood to buy a home. They don't \nknow whether we have hit bottom. So I particularly appreciate the \nFinance Committee for bringing out in this legislation the first-time \nhomeowners tax credits, legislation that I introduced last Congress. It \nwas included in the bill we passed in the last Congress, but it was a \nnoninterest-bearing loan of $7,500. The Finance Committee has now \nchanged that to a credit, which I think will be much more effective. \nFirst-time home buyers now know that if they get into the home buying \nmarket, the Federal Government is going to help them with a credit. \nThat is what it should be, and I know there will be some additional \nefforts made to strengthen that amendment.\n  In regards to small business, I said earlier small businesses are the \nheart of America. It is where our economic strength is. The American \ndream is not only owning a home; the American dream is also owning a \nsmall business, being your own boss. Unfortunately, too many small \nbusinesses today have on their front door ``going out of business.'' We \nhave to do more to protect small businesses. At the end of the day, \nwhen we pull out of this recession, we need to have small businesses in \nplace because they are the economic engine of America. Madam President, \n99.7 percent of the businesses in Maryland are small businesses and 80 \npercent of all new job growth is created by small businesses.\n  We had in the Small Business Committee a roundtable where we talked \nto small businesses in our State, in our country. It is interesting \nthat a year ago, one out of every seven small business owners used \ntheir personal credit cards in order to get credit for their business. \nWe understand that. Today that is 50 percent. It is the only place they \ncan get credit. It is the most expensive and it can be pulled at any \ntime. We have to help small business owners with their credit problems. \nWe have to make sure the government procurement actually gets down to \nthe small business owner. In this underlying legislation, the SBA \nloans, the 504 program, the 7(a) loans, there are major provisions to \nmake it less expensive for small businesses. That is good. I support \nthat. There is a microborrowing provision in this legislation for small \nbusinesses. That is important. That is going to help. But we need to do \nmore. We need to do more to help small businesses, minority businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, veterans' businesses.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 237 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  For that reason, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so that I may offer amendment No. 237.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself and Ms. \n     Landrieu and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 237 to \n     amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend certain provisions of the Small Business Investment \n       Act of 1958, related to the surety bond guarantee program)\n\n       On page 105, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 505. SURETY BONDS.\n\n       (a) Maximum Bond Amount.--Section 411(a)(1) of the Small \n     Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 694b(a)(1)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(A)'' after ``(1)'';\n       (2) by striking ``$2,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$5,000,000''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) The Administrator may guarantee a surety under \n     subparagraph (A) for a total work order or contract amount \n     that does not exceed $10,000,000, if a contracting officer of \n     a Federal agency certifies that such a guarantee is \n     necessary.''.\n       (b) Size Standards.--Section 410 of the Small Business \n     Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 694a) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any \n     rule, regulation, or order of the Administration, for \n     purposes of sections 410, 411, and 412 the term `small \n     business concern' means a business concern that meets the \n     size standard for the primary industry in which such business \n     concern, and the affiliates of such business concern, is \n     engaged, as determined by the Administrator in accordance \n     with the North American Industry Classification System.''.\n       (c) Sunset.--The amendments made by this section shall \n     remain in effect until September 30, 2010.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me very briefly explain this \namendment.\n  This amendment improves the SBA program for surety bonds for small \nbusinesses. In the underlying bill the committee has brought out an \nadditional $15 million that will allow SBA to help with the surety \nprogram.\n  The challenge today is that for small business to get a government \ncontract of over $100,000, they have to put up a surety bond. It is \nvery difficult for them to get that surety bond. The SBA has a program \nto help them obtain a surety bond. The challenge is that the current \nlimit is $2 million. For any contract over $2 million the program \ncannot be used. Well, with the underlying bill and the types of \nprocurement we are anticipating, there are going to be larger \ncontracts. What this amendment does is increase the $2 million to $5 \nmillion.\n  Secondly, in order to qualify for a small business, your annual \nrevenue must be below the Federal guidelines or State guidelines if it \nis a State contract.\n  What the underlying amendment does is use the Federal guidelines, \nwhich is $31 million, for construction contractor businesses and $13 \nmillion for specific trades as the standard for being eligible for the \nFederal SBA program on your surety bond. I am very pleased that this \namendment has the support of the leadership of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senators Landrieu and Snowe. It is bipartisan. The CBO \nscored this at no cost, so it will not cost money. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Lastly, Senator Snowe will be offering an amendment to make sure \nFederal procurement laws and regulations apply to all the contracts \nawarded under this legislation and that SBA regularly reports on these \ncontracts to Congress. I am a cosponsor of that amendment; I strongly \nsupport that amendment. I hope we will also consider that amendment.\n  In conclusion, I am optimistic about our future, but we have a lot of \nwork to do. We need to pass this legislation quickly and give President \nObama the tools he needs so we can see that our economy is rebuilt and \ngrown to its full capacity. I am confident we will reach that day by \nacting on this legislation, and it will be sooner rather than later.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of this \namendment I have cosponsored with Senators Cardin and Landrieu. This \namendment would reinvigorate the Small Business Administration's, SBA, \nSurety Bond Guarantee Program, to ensure that small businesses are able \nto secure the surety bonds they need to compete for contracts, grow, \nand hire more employees. In our current economic recession, small \nbusinesses are finding it even more difficult to secure the credit \nlines necessary to get bonds in the private sector.\n  As a result, the SBA surety bond program is more important than ever. \nSurety bonds are critical to small companies' survival and \ncompetitiveness. Our bipartisan amendment would increase, on a \ntemporary basis, the limits on the SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program \nfrom $2 million to $5 million for contracts awarded under the SBA \nprogram. This amendment would also raise the current small business \nsize standards for state and local contracts in order to update and \nmodernize the surety bond guarantee eligibility.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this crucial small business \nsurety amendment. This amendment was written after consulting with \nsmall business owners across the country, the SBA, and surety bonding \ncompanies on how best to revitalize this critical program. Without \nthese changes, fewer small businesses will have the opportunity to \nparticipate on the plethora of construction and infrastructure projects \nthat are likely to occur across the nation because of this stimulus \npackage. Without these bonds many small businesses will be unable to \ncompete for contracts and government work. For new companies, obtaining \na surety bond will become a barrier to entry and competition they are \nunable to overcome.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 168, 197, and 238, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, our Nation's fiscal outlook is very \ngrim. The Congressional Budget Office projects the Federal budget \ndeficit will exceed $1 trillion. Despite this enormous deficit, \nPresident Obama is urging Congress to enact a massive stimulus plan \nthat would add another $1 trillion in Government debt over the next 10 \nyears. The President and his advisers insist that we must spend this \nmoney as quickly as possible in order to save our economy.\n  In the grassroots of my State, I don't think people argue with things \nthat are in this bill that are truly stimulus, but I am getting outrage \nfrom my constituents about the large part of this bill that is strictly \nbig-time spending.\n  In normal times, such fiscal excess, stimulus or otherwise, would be \nwidely criticized and promptly rejected. But we all know these are not \nnormal times. Our economy faces the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. Such comparisons may be overblown but everybody is \nunderstandably concerned about the present state of our economy. \nCongress needs to take action--and we are doing that--to address \ndeclining growth and rising unemployment. But we must not let our \ndesire for a quick fix undermine our ability to address the real \nchallenges we face.\n  A sustainable fiscal policy depends on a growing economy. A sound \neconomy depends on a sound fiscal policy. Unfortunately, there doesn't \nseem to be any consensus on what constitutes sound policy. But I think \nwe can all agree that Government doesn't create wealth; Government only \nexpends wealth. So we have to be about the business of having an \nenvironment that creates wealth.\n  There are two opposing views on how to help the economy. Some people \nsay consumption is the key to economic growth. When people go shopping, \nthe economy is good, so we need to spend more, they say. Other people \nsay investment is the key. When businesses invest, the economy is good, \nso they say we need to save more.\n  Some economists try to reconcile these opposing views by suggesting \nthe correct route depends upon the circumstances. When workers are \nfully employed and factories are fully utilized, they say we need to \nsave more and increase supply. But when workers are unemployed and \nfactories are idled, they say we need to spend more and increase \ndemand. While this explanation is appealing, it doesn't withstand \ncareful scrutiny.\n  We are told that in order to stimulate the economy, all the \nGovernment has to do is put more money into the hands of consumers and \nthey will spend it back into prosperity. The problem with this approach \nis that the only way the Government can put money into somebody else's \nhands is by taking it from somebody else's pockets--either in the form \nof taxes or borrowing. Now, this is a zero-sum game in which one \nperson's loss is another's gain. Some economists try to obscure this \nfact by introducing a concept known as the marginal propensity to \nconsume. In my judgment, that is just a fancy way of saying some people \nspend more of their money than others.\n  According to this concept, low-income people are more likely to spend \nan extra dollar than higher income people; thus, taking from the rich \nand giving it to the poor will stimulate consumer demand and boost the \noverall economy. It is the Government kind of playing the role of Robin \nHood.\n  This concept is flawed because it ignores the very important role of \npeople saving. Money that is saved does not disappear; it flows back \ninto the economy in the form of business loans or consumer credit. \nSaving is just another form of spending--specifically spending on \ncapital goods, such as factories and equipment, or consumer goods such \nas cars and houses.\n  Of course, the critics say this is not always true. During a \nrecession, banks are less willing to lend and businesses are less \nwilling to borrow. Thus, some of the money previously available in the \neconomy is no longer being used, like right now with the credit crunch. \nIt has been stuffed, in some cases, under the proverbial mattress, \nwhether that is in anybody's home or in a bank vault. Thus, advocates \nof fiscal stimulus claim the Government can borrow and spend during a \nrecession without crowding out other private sector spending. This is \ntrue only in a very narrow sense that increasing money\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\nsupply allows the Government to borrow and spend without reducing the \namount of money available to the rest of our population. That is \nmonetary policy masquerading as fiscal policy. Moreover, when the \nGovernment borrows money, whether it is new money or old money, what \nthe Government is really borrowing is the resources it acquires; thus, \nevery dollar the Government spends has an ``opportunity cost'' in terms \nof the potential uses of those resources.\n  Much of the confusion over this point comes from the failure to \nrecognize the nature of money in our economy. Economists often talk \nabout the multiplier effect in order to explain how each dollar of \nGovernment spending can result in more than a dollar of economic \nactivity. But the multiplier effect is simply a way of illustrating the \nfact that if I give you a dollar, you will spend part of it and save \npart of it. The portion you spend goes to someone, who spends a portion \nand saves a portion, and so on and so on; thus, $1 effectively \nmultiplies into many dollars.\n  Contrary to what some people might have you believe, the multiplier \neffect applies to every dollar, not just the dollar spent by the \nGovernment. According to Federal Reserve data over the past 50 years, \nthe ratio between gross domestic product and our money supply--defined \nas currency plus bank reserves--has ranged from a ratio of 10 to 1, to \n20 to 1. In other words, every dollar in our economy supports between \n$10 and $20 of economic activity.\n  During a recession, there are fewer workers producing fewer goods and \nservices. That is why this is called a recession. Because the level of \noutput is lower, the level of spending is lower as well. That means the \navailable dollars are being used less. Economists often refer to this \nas a decline in the velocity of money. The money no longer being used \nreflects the goods and services no longer being produced. With fewer \ngoods and services available to buy, Government efforts to borrow and \nspend will increase the money supply. Instead of the Federal Reserve \nincreasing bank reserves to boost private lending, the Government will \nincrease borrowing to boost private spending. But this is really \nmonetary policy disguised as fiscal policy.\n  The success or failure of this policy will depend upon how the \nadditional money is used. Unfortunately, when some advocates of \nGovernment stimulus talk about priming the pump, they give the \nimpression that we can grow our economy by simply spending money and it \ndoesn't matter in any way how you spend that money.\n  Consider the following comments by the great economist John Maynard \nKeynes, whom I don't agree with very much. He said this:\n\n       If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, \n     bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines . . . and \n     leave it to private enterprise . . . to dig the notes up \n     again . . . there need be no more unemployment. . . .\n\n  People are probably laughing at that. Nearly everyone would recognize \nthe ill effects of printing up $1 trillion and dropping it from \nhelicopters. But what if the Government hired 10 million Americans to \ndig holes and fill those holes back up and paid them each $100,000? \nWould this prime the pump and get our economy moving again? The answer \nshould be obvious: It would be a complete waste of resources.\n  The 19th century economist Fredrick Bastiat once observed:\n\n       There is only one difference between a bad economist and a \n     good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible \n     effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect \n     that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.\n\n  When the Government borrows money for some activity, that is what is \nseen. But what is not seen is what could have been created had those \nworkers and resources been used in some different way. The benefit of a \nGovernment stimulus plan must then be weighted against cost. So far, \nthere has been no comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of this proposed \nstimulus bill.\n  I may have talked about a lot of economic philosophy, but it is \npertinent to what we are doing on the Senate floor this week, the \nstimulus bill. There is a glaring omission given in recent comments \nthat have been made by President Obama. So I want my colleagues to take \ninto consideration what my President says.\n  Shortly before his inauguration, President Obama gave a series of \nspeeches and interviews. I will read a couple sentences from them. \nAccording to the January 16 Washington Post:\n\n       Obama repeated his assurance that there is ``near \n     unanimity'' among economists that government spending will \n     help restore jobs in the short term, adding that some \n     estimates of necessary stimulus now reach $1.3 trillion.\n\n  The President-elect said he believes that direct Government spending \nprovides the most ``bang for the buck'' and that his advisers have \nworked to design tax cuts that would be most likely to spur consumer \nspending.\n  They quote President Obama:\n\n       ``The theory behind it is I set the tone,'' Obama said. \n     ``If the tone I set is that we bring as much intellectual \n     firepower to a problem, that people act respectfully toward \n     each other, that disagreements are fully aired, and that we \n     make decisions based on facts and evidence as opposed to \n     ideology, that people will adapt to that culture and we'll be \n     able to move together effectively as a team.''\n  Going on to quote President Obama:\n\n       I have a pretty good track record at doing that.\n\n  I was quoting from the Washington Post, but also quoting within that \narticle what the President said.\n  Now I want to go to a January 10 radio address by then-President-\nelect Obama, now our President:\n\n       Our first job is to put people back to work and get our \n     economy working again. This is an extraordinary challenge, \n     which is why I've taken the extraordinary step of working--\n     even before I take office--with my economic team and leaders \n     of both parties on an American recovery and reinvestment plan \n     that will call for major investments to revive our economy, \n     create jobs, and lay a solid foundation for future growth.\n       I asked my nominee for chair of the Council of Economic \n     Advisers, Dr. Christina Romer, and the Vice President-elect's \n     chief economic adviser, Jared Bernstein, to conduct a \n     rigorous analysis of this plan and come up with projections \n     of how many jobs it will create--and what kind of jobs they \n     will be. . . .\n       The report confirms that our plan will likely save or \n     create 3 to 4 million jobs. . . .\n       The jobs we create will be in businesses large and small \n     across a wide range of industries. And they'll be the kind of \n     jobs that don't just put people to work in the short term, \n     but position our economy to lead the world in the long term.\n\n  That is a quote from the January 10 radio address by then-President-\nelect but now our President.\n  These comments from President Obama are noteworthy for several \nreasons. First, he is our President, and we ought to respect his views, \nnot always agreeing with them but consider them. First, he suggests a \nlevel, in these quotes I just gave, of unanimity among economists, and \nthat unanimity does not exist. Second, he suggests his administration \nwill make decisions based on the facts instead of ideology. Third, he \nsuggests his plan will create jobs that are more than just temporary.\n  In that regard, I note that the Congressional Budget Office released \nan analysis of the House stimulus bill. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the House stimulus bill will create between 3 million \nand 8 million new jobs over the next 3 years, depending on whether the \nmultiplier assumption is low--that will be 3 million--or high--that \nwill be 8 million.\n  Given the cost of the House bill, these figures imply a very \nsurprising and a very troubling result. The CBO estimate shows it will \ncost between $90,000 and $250,000 per job created. These numbers should \nbe contrasted to those under the CBO baseline which show the gross \ndomestic product per worker is about $100,000.\n  In other words, the jobs being created by the House bill could cost \nas much as 2\\1/2\\ times more than the jobs that would be created \nwithout the stimulus bill. There has been a lot of talk about ``bang \nfor the buck,'' particularly during this debate. But there doesn't seem \nto be any interest in actually making sure it happens. In other words, \nthat it actually happens, we get bang for the buck. Before we spend \nanother $1 trillion, we ought to make sure we are getting our money's \nworth.\n  It should also be noted that the Congressional Budget Office's \nanalysis only covers the years 2009 through 2011, but if you assume the \nratio of employment to Government spending remains the same throughout \nthe 10-year projection period that we always have in our bills, there \nwill be only a few thousand new jobs. Moreover, if you adopt the \nstandard assumption that increasing the national debt by $1 trillion \nwill\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\ncrowd out private sector investment, the net result will be fewer jobs \nbecause of this stimulus bill.\n  I have written a letter to the Congressional Budget Office Director \nrequesting an analysis of both the House and Senate stimulus bills. \nThis analysis will cover the full 10-year period, consistent with the \nJanuary baseline.\n  The Director has indicated to me that this is a very complicated \nprocess, and their analysis may not be completed until next week. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to have the CBO analysis before we \nhave a final vote on this bill. The Senate must have the opportunity to \ncarefully review the Congressional Budget Office analysis.\n  Let me repeat what I said at the beginning. Congress needs to take \naction to address declining growth and rising unemployment. At the \ngrassroots of America, there may not be consensus on that, but there is \nan overwhelming feeling that Congress can do things that will help the \neconomy. But for sure, before we spend another $1 trillion, Congress \nmust take time to look before we leap.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Feingold-\nMcCain amendment. Yesterday, I received a message from the Obama \nadministration that concludes that the economy faces its most serious \ncrisis since the Great Depression, and I think that is something to \nwhich we all agree.\n  It goes further and says the economic recovery package now being \nconsidered by this body is an essential step in putting the economy \nback on the path of growth.\n  Our President, President Obama, has asked the Congress to send a bill \nto him before the February recess, and I believe we have that \nresponsibility to act quickly and responsibly. Therefore, I believe now \nis not the time to debate controversial legislation that is not \nrelevant to economic recovery.\n  There are no earmarks contained in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act that we are now considering before the Senate. I \nmaintain that now is not the time to debate Senate floor procedures for \nthe consideration of appropriations bills.\n  However, I oppose this amendment on its merits. This amendment is an \nattempt to undermine Congress's power of the purse. Under this \namendment, congressionally directed spending items that are not \nspecifically authorized could be stripped from legislation.\n  As Senators are well aware, Congress is often called upon to approve \nspending that is not yet authorized. In a January 15, 2009, report the \nCongressional Budget Office concluded that in recent years, the total \namount of unauthorized appropriations averaged between $160 billion and \n$170 billion per year.\n\n  In fact, for the current fiscal year, there are over $718 billion \nworth of authorizations that expire before September 30, 2009. This \nincludes funding for housing programs, energy programs, environmental \nprograms, transportation programs, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, homeland security programs, public health programs, \nveterans programs, and on and on.\n  This amendment could tie the Senate in knots. Conference reports \ncould be amended and returned to the other body, and once amended the \nHouse could further amend the bill. The regular order for producing \nspending bills is the best prescription for producing responsible \nspending bills, not creating new rules that will make the process so \ncumbersome that we will not be able to complete our work.\n  This legislation would also hand over to the President the authority \nto determine what spending should be considered by the Senate. Under \nthis amendment, if the President requests funding for an unauthorized \nprogram, the funding would not be subject to a point of order. The \nSenate should not give such power to any President.\n  Nor is it clear to me why it would be all right for authorizers to \nauthorize earmarks, for the President to earmark funds, but Members who \nare not authorizers could not earmark funds in spending bills.\n  I remind the Senate that the last highway authorization bill \ncontained over 6,474 earmarks, and the last water authorization bill \ncontained over 600 earmarks.\n  I believe Congress took significant action during the 110th Congress \nto add unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability to the \nprocess of earmarking funds for specific projects.\n  Under the rules in 2007, each bill must be accompanied by a list \nidentifying each earmark that it includes and which Member requested \nit. Those lists are made available online before the bill is ever voted \non.\n  In the Senate, each Senator is required to send the committee a \nletter providing the name and location of the intended recipient, the \npurpose of the earmark, and a letter certifying that neither the \nSenator nor the Senator's immediate family has a financial interest in \nthe item requested. This certification is available on the Internet for \nat least 48 hours prior to a floor vote on the bill.\n  We also significantly reduce the level of funding for earmarks. In \nthe 2008 bill, the total dollar amount of earmarks for nonproject-based \naccounts was reduced by 43 percent. In the fiscal year 2009 \nappropriations bill, we will further reduce earmarks.\n  In our continuing effort to provide unprecedented transparency to the \nprocess, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and I \nannounced new reforms to begin in the 2010 bills.\n  To offer more opportunity for public scrutiny of Member requests, \nMembers will be required to post information on their earmark requests \non their Web sites at the time the request is made, explaining the \npurpose of the earmark and why it is a valuable use of taxpayers' \nfunds.\n  To increase public scrutiny of committee decisions, earmark \ndisclosure tables will be made publicly available the same day as the \nSenate subcommittee or the full committee takes action.\n  We are committed to keeping earmark funding levels below 1 percent of \ndiscretionary spending in subsequent years.\n  The new requirements included in this amendment will hamstring the \nSenate from fulfilling its responsibility. The amendment says no funds \ncan be included in appropriations bills unless already included in an \nauthorization bill that has passed the Senate during this session.\n  I remind my colleagues the Senate has not passed a foreign affairs \nauthorization bill in many years. All these measures aren't authorized. \nIn the past 7 years, we haven't enacted an intelligence authorization \nbill. We don't have one for last year or the year before. It has been 7 \nyears since the Senate passed an authorization bill for Customs. Should \nwe stop funding the construction of ports of entry on our borders? The \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee does not report legislation \nthrough the Senate to authorize specific Federal buildings. Does that \nmean we should stop repairing and improving the security or \nconstructing Federal buildings that house over 1 million Federal \nemployees? The Agricultural Research Service has never been authorized. \nYet it has existed for 56 years. Should we stop funding agricultural \nresearch? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has never \nbeen authorized--NOAA has never been authorized--so does that mean we \nshould stop funding for hurricane forecasting and severe weather \nforecasting, tsunami forecasting? Congress has not authorized juvenile \njustice funding for the last 2 years. Does that mean we stop funding to \nkeep kids out of gangs and in school?\n\n  Under this amendment, the Senate would be required to defer action on \nall items which it feels are important when the companion authorization \nbill is tied up. Are we going to allow the filibuster of an \nauthorization bill to stop Congress from exercising its \nconstitutionally mandated power of the purse? This amendment also \napplies to items which have been approved by the House. Any such item \ncould be stricken if the authorization bill has not been completed.\n  Last year, we faced a situation on the Defense Subcommittee, which I \nam privileged to chair, in which we completed action on the \nAppropriations Act before we completed action on the Authorization Act. \nWe were told by the President, the Department of Defense, the \ncommanders on the field in Iraq\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\nand Afghanistan: You cannot stall this. So we passed the appropriations \nbill before the authorizing bill. Yet under this amendment, all the \nHouse items could be stricken by the Senate.\n  The Constitution gives the power of the purse to the Congress. It is \nour job to use that power responsibly. We have put procedures in place \nto make the process transparent and to hold Members accountable for \ntheir spending decisions. Rule XVI already establishes rules against \nfunding and including unauthorized spending in general appropriations \nbills. Rule XLIV already establishes rules concerning congressionally \ndirected spending items.\n  I can't speak for all my colleagues, but I can say this much. I was \nnot elected by my constituents in Hawaii to be a rubberstamp. They \nexpected me to use my initiative and to address my colleagues and tell \nthem about the urgent requests we need. I could go on and on and tell \nyou about many of the projects that have been part of the law today \nbecause we took congressional initiative. Therefore, I urge a ``no'' \nvote on the Feingold-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 238\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to speak to an amendment that I \nintroduced and filed and was made pending at the desk earlier today. \nWhat that amendment will do is eliminate new Government programs that \nare created by the proposed $1 trillion stimulus legislation that is \nbefore the Senate today.\n  Earlier yesterday, I presented some information about the size and \nscope of this legislation and tried to put in very visual terms the \nimmense amount of money we are talking about when you start looking at \n$1 trillion. It is $900 billion, but when you add interest on top of \nthis--$340 billion, $350 billion in interest--you have $1.2 trillion in \nnew spending included in the stimulus bill. I say that because I think \nit is important to point out that is not the end; it is, frankly, the \nbeginning.\n  We know for a fact the Omnibus appropriations bill--the sort of \ncatchall appropriations bill we didn't complete last year--is going to \nbe coming before the Congress, before the House first and then before \nthe Senate. For the first time ever, that is going to exceed $1 \ntrillion. So we have $1 trillion in the catchall appropriations bill. \nWe expect at least a request from the administration for additional \nTARP authority--emergency funding to provide stabilization to the \nfinancial markets--to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. We \ndon't know exactly what it will be, but we know it will be in the \nmultiples with respect to hundreds of billions of dollars. We also have \na supplemental appropriations bill that will be coming shortly after \nthat to fund the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  My point simply is this: This is trillions of dollars of spending. \nThis is a spending spree that is unprecedented even in this city, which \nis known for spending lots of money on lots of programs. What this \namendment attempts to do is to put a little bit of restraint on some of \nthat spending in the stimulus bill. Granted, many of us believe there \nare some things we should be doing, some steps we should be taking that \nwould help the economy to recover, that would stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs. Regrettably, the stimulus bill that is in front of us goes \nway beyond that.\n  The President's top economic adviser suggested when this whole debate \nbegan that whatever we do in terms of stimulus, it should be temporary, \nit should be targeted, and it should be timely. Much of what is \nincluded in this bill is none of the above. In fact, it is slow and \nunfocused and unending. So I am attempting, with this amendment, to say \nthat new programs that are created in this bill have to have been \nauthorized by February 1 of this year. In other words, earlier this \nweek. So if there is not an authorization for this new program--and we \nwould ask OMB to make that determination--that spending would be \nknocked out of the bill, essentially.\n  The whole purpose of the amendment is, again, to say that if we are \ngoing to do something that is meaningful in terms of stimulating the \neconomy, it should be temporary and it should be targeted and it should \nbe focused. Much of the spending that is in this bill is anything but \nthat. History has shown, time and again, when you put new programs on \nthe books, you almost always take a long time to get those programs off \nthe ground. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has examined this \nissue and they offered this insight:\n\n       Brand new programs pose additional challenges. Developing \n     procedures and criteria, issuing the necessary regulations, \n     and reviewing plans and proposals would make distributing \n     money quickly even more difficult--as can be seen, for \n     example, in the lack of any disbursements to date under loan \n     programs established for automakers last summer to invest in \n     producing energy-efficient vehicles. Throughout the Federal \n     Government, spending for new programs has frequently been \n     slower than expected and rarely been faster.\n\n  Again, that is the Congressional Budget Office. Given the current \nstate of the economy, we simply can't afford to enact costly new \nprograms that have little hope of making any real meaningful impact \nnow, when the American people need it the most.\n  There may be programs in this proposed legislation that are worthy of \nsupport--I am not arguing that point--but surely not under the guise of \neconomic stimulus. There are new programs that are created that will \nadd to the size of this, and many of us have reacted to the size of it. \nAs I have said already, we know for a fact there is going to be a lot \nof additional spending coming down the pike that we are going to be \nasked to consider. But adding to that $1 trillion for something that \narguably does not create economic stimulus, does not create jobs, seems \nto me to be the wrong direction in which to head.\n  My amendment would simply prevent any new funding under the economic \nstimulus plan from going toward new programs that were not authorized \nbefore February 1 of this year--2009. As I said before, the amendment \ncalls on the Office of Management and Budget to determine if a program \nwas authorized before February of 2009. If the program fails to meet \nthat standard, the program will not receive funding from the economic \nstimulus proposal.\n  Now, I would argue that this is a very commonsense proposal that \nprotects the taxpayer and ensures funds are spent in a timely and \neffective manner. That isn't to say--and I will repeat myself--as I \nsaid earlier, that many of these programs are not worthwhile and, \nfrankly, we ought to consider them. But we ought to do it under the \nregular order and procedures that we have in the Senate. We ought to \nhave committee action, we ought to have hearings, we ought to have the \nnecessary oversight, and we ought to be able to put these things on the \nfloor where they can be debated. We have a process for doing that.\n  There are lots of programs that are included in the stimulus bill \nwhich, I would argue, don't meet that criteria. They aren't stimulus \nbecause they are not targeted, they are not timely, and they are not \ntemporary. They are, in fact, creating new programs which, as I said \nearlier, the Congressional Budget Office has told us sometimes take a \nvery long time to roll out. I think any of us can speak from experience \non that point; that whenever we create any sort of a new Federal \nprogram, we have agencies that have to interpret it, regulations have \nto be promulgated, in many cases we are setting up new bureaucracies \nand people have to be hired and it makes no sense to me whatsoever for \nus to, in the context of an economic stimulus bill, start talking about \nnew programs.\n  I would also say the whole purpose of this exercise, in my opinion at \nleast, is job creation. It is to get the economy back on track and \nrecovering and creating jobs. We have been losing jobs. The economy is \nhemorrhaging and a lot of people are hurting throughout the country. \nWhat they don't need is more spending on Government programs in \nWashington, DC. What we ought to be doing, on the other hand, is \ngetting more money into the hands of the American people so they can \nspend it--more incentives for small businesses to begin to invest and \ncreate jobs because that is what they do best. In fact, two-thirds to \nthree-fourths of all the jobs created in our economy are created by \nsmall businesses.\n\n  Now, $900 billion, the principal amount--and with interest it is over \n$1\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\ntrillion in new spending--is proposed in the stimulus legislation. If \nyou divide that by the number of jobs that are proposed to be created--\nsomewhere around 3 million--that comes out to $300,000 per job. The \naverage annual wage in my State of South Dakota is under $30,000 a \nyear. It is very difficult to explain to a constituent of mine in South \nDakota how the Federal Government proposes to spend $300,000 of their \ntax dollars to create one job at a time when we are handing the largest \nburden of debt to the next generation in American history.\n  Many of these jobs that are proposed are Government jobs. The \nGovernment can create Government jobs, and many of the spending \nprograms in this bill do put money into Federal agencies which create \nGovernment jobs but at an enormous cost. I will use the example of the \nState Department, where it is over $1 million--I think $1.3 million, \nsomething to that effect--per job created. That doesn't seem to be a \nvery good use of taxpayer dollars, and it doesn't get us the bang for \nthe buck everybody has been coming to the floor and talking about.\n  As I said, it is a straightforward amendment. All it simply says is: \nNo new Government programs created in the stimulus. If that program was \nnot authorized by February 1 of this year, then any funding for it in \nthe economic stimulus proposal would be denied. It is a commonsense \nproposal that does protect the taxpayers, ensures the funds will be \nspent in a timely and effective way, and that we focus on keeping jobs \nout there in the economy, putting people back to work. It is not \nspending on new Government programs in Washington DC which, however \nwell intended, needs to go through a normal regular order process where \nMembers of the Senate have an opportunity to evaluate those at the \ncommittee level and go through all the appropriate oversight that we \nnormally include when it comes to create a new Government program.\n\n  Frankly, I do not think creating new Government programs, in the \nfirst place, is the way to do this, but at least this amendment brings \nsome semblance of sanity to a bill which, as I said, is sort of a \nshotgun approach. It throws money at all kinds of different programs in \nhopes it will do something to stimulate the economy--knowing full well, \nI believe, that many of these are not going to be stimulative but on \nthe other hand are creating new programs that people have wanted for a \nlong time but have never had the opportunity.\n  That is not what this is about. This economic stimulus debate ought \nto be focused on creating jobs and getting the economy on the pathway \nto recovery.\n  That is the amendment. I encourage my colleagues to support it. I \nthink it is very straightforward, very commonsensical, and, hopefully, \nit will meet with the approval of the majority of the Members of the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, let me start out and indicate I am \naware of the fact that Senator Baucus has deferred so I can speak now. \nI appreciate that professional courtesy.\n  I rise today to address the decision that is before us and to maybe \nshare some insight that I hope is relevant. I believe it is relevant to \nthe legislation we are debating, the stimulus package. Maybe I can \noffer some insight that is a bit unique from the perspective of a \nformer mayor and a former Governor.\n  The so-called stimulus would send a financial windfall to cities and \nStates. The hope is that somehow that will filter into the economy. I \nwill readily acknowledge that I have been on the receiving end of those \nkinds of windfalls--nothing this large--as both a mayor and as the \nGovernor of Nebraska. In my home State, fiscal responsibility is not \njust a worthy goal that we aspire to achieve. It is demanded of our \nelected officials by Nebraska taxpayers. So when the Federal Government \nsent an infusion of money for education or social programs, whatever it \nwas, the first place I looked as Governor or as a mayor was to the \nbottom line in my budget. I examined how much the State was budgeting \nfor these programs, and I examined whether the State should save those \nState dollars.\n  Today's Governors, mayors, and school boards have many budget options \nalso. They might allow this Federal money to pass on through. In the \nalternative, they might decide taxpayers are best served by allowing \nFederal funds to replace the State or local dollars. This would \nmaintain existing funding levels and allow them to tuck away their \nState dollars in anticipation of tougher times ahead. Perhaps they \nwould choose to pay down debt.\n  Keep in mind, choosing to turn on the Federal funding faucet means \nfacing the challenges that will occur when the funding faucet is later \nturned off. Just imagine the tremendous difficulty of that. It would \ncause yet a new crisis.\n  If Governors choose to hold on to their cash, or some of them, it is \ntrue it may provide them some security as they work through very \ndifficult budget issues. But to be very candid about this--and, again, \nI was in this position--it would do absolutely nothing to stimulate the \neconomy. The money simply would never reach the economy.\n  The first tranche of the TARP funds does illustrate the point I am \ntrying to make today. The Federal Government sent hundreds of billions \nof dollars to banks to get credit flowing. The expectation was that \nthis money would translate very quickly into car loans, student loans \nand operating loans for businesses. What happened? Lending has \ndeclined--for a variety of reasons, many legitimate, and some banks \nthat have received Government money have actually reduced lending more \nsharply than banks that chose not to take the money.\n  If we truly want to maximize our chances of boosting the economy, \nthen we must minimize the filters through which we send that money. In \nmy career I have had an opportunity to manage enormous bureaucracies. I \nhave watched as they devoured resources in the name of delivering \nresources to others. It seemed that no matter how forcefully and \nsternly I demanded effective operations, those filters oftentimes \nbecame very narrow funnels.\n  Tax relief, I would suggest, puts dollars directly in the hands of \ntaxpayers and businesses. That is not necessarily a guarantee it will \nflow to the economy, but it is very clearly the most direct route to \nthe people who are most in need.\n  I must also admit that I am deeply troubled by the rush to approve \nthe largest spending bill in history with no plan to pay for it. There \nreally is, literally, no plan--no plan at all. There is not even an \nattempt at a plan. It seems these days in Washington something can be \ndeemed an emergency and suddenly all fiscal restraint is checked at the \ndoor and everything in the bill becomes a piece of solving the \nemergency. I cannot imagine how we justify passing the cost of this to \nour children. It is as if some believe we can use a credit card and \nhistory will somehow forgive the debt.\n  Just last year when the deficit reached a half trillion dollars it \nsent a shockwave across this country. Yet the spending machine just \nrolled on. For this year, that number doubled to more than $1 trillion, \nand there was a collective outcry to rein in spending. Now we are faced \nwith legislation that would double the deficit in the blink of an eye. \nHow many times can it be doubled before the debt becomes insurmountable \nand, tragically, the dollar becomes worthless?\n  A group of Nebraskans came to see me recently. They brought me a \nbeautiful picture. I have it on display in my office. It was drawn by a \n2-year-old girl. We talked about the stimulus package, and I certainly \nreached the conclusion that they were advocating that somehow, if we \npassed this, it would deliver a benefit to this child. But I wondered \nout loud how our young people would feel about being asked to pay the \n$1.2 trillion pricetag. I wondered how they would manage a national \ndebt that now grows at a rate of $3 billion a day. I contemplated how \nthis little 2-year-old's quality of life would be so different from \nwhat we enjoy. If we do not take responsibility for spending, her \nquality of life will never match ours. She might never dream of going \nto college or owning a home, and here is why. As tough as the economy \nis today--and I do not debate anyone about how tough it is--there is a \nday of reckoning, when the burden of debt is crushing. If investors \nfinally lose confidence in our ability to manage our debt, who then \nbails us out? It\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\nis even more remarkable to me that we are contemplating the largest \nspending bill in history at a time when every one of us is aware that \nthe current level of spending is not sustainable. It is not an abstract \nproblem. It is real and it is growing with the passage of time. We \ncannot keep passing the buck with a promise to make tough decisions in \nthe year to come. It does begin with the decisions we make today.\n  Like every single Member of this body, I am proud of the State I \nrepresent. I want Nebraskans to know every day that I support them. But \nthat does not mean I support this bill. Some might be disappointed when \nI vote against this spending bill, but I believe Nebraskans understand \nwhat it means to take responsibility. They expect that of me today, \njust as they expected it when I served as their Governor.\n  The Nebraska State Constitution requires a balanced budget. That is \nnot unusual. But the constitution of the State also basically bans any \nborrowing of money. So when the economy collapsed post-9/11, we made \ndifficult decisions while other States issued debt. I not only had to \nbalance the budget, I had to do it without borrowing a dime. It was not \neasy, but we did it and the tough choices were worthwhile. When I came \nto the Cabinet, I did not have to turn to the Lieutenant Governor and \ntell him that I had left a pile of debt behind. The State has \nsteadfastly adhered to the principle of fiscal responsibility, and \nbecause of that it is better positioned to face the challenges of \ntoday.\n  I want to wrap up with this: I understand the significance of trying \nto do all we can to boost this economy. Of course I want people to have \njobs. I want them to be able to pay the bills. But this is not a \nstimulus plan; it is a spending plan. It will not create the promised \njobs, and it will not activate our economy. What it will do is place a \npunishing debt on our children and grandchildren.\n  I could not vote for this bill and still claim that I represent the \nprinciples and values of the State I come from, the State of Nebraska. \nI do want to say I will meet with my colleagues, any colleagues, across \nthe aisle, to roll up our sleeves to set a fiscally responsible course, \nnot only today but for the future. While we cannot solve all of our \nfinancial problems or balance the budget overnight--and no one is \nexpecting that we can--we must begin this important work today. I want \nto be a partner in that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I just had the opportunity to hear \nthe initial--what we used to call the maiden speech around here--of the \nnew Senator from Nebraska. I want to congratulate him on an \nextraordinarily insightful presentation that melded his own personal \nhistory in government with his thoughts about this massive bill that we \nwill be considering this week, and his feelings about it, which he \nexpressed to his constituents today. On behalf of all of us, I welcome \nthe Senator to the Senate. I would say he just made a great start, and \nI know he is going to have an incredibly effective career representing \nthe people of Nebraska and America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I first want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I have known him as Agriculture Secretary. He served the \npeople of his State as Governor and also as mayor. I compliment Senator \nJohanns for his service to his State and to his country. I very much \nlook forward to working with him in the Senate. Again, I extend my \ncongratulations.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 200 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  On behalf of Senator Dorgan I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so we can call up Senator Dorgan's \namendment No. 200 on runaway plants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. If the \nSenator will suspend, the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Dorgan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 200.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Madam President, for the benefit of Senators, I would \nlike to take a moment to talk about where we are in consideration of \nthe bill. Today is the third day of Senate consideration. Yesterday was \nquite productive. We had a full debate and very little downtime, which \nI especially appreciate.\n  The Senate considered nine amendments and had rollcall votes on four. \nOne was adopted by voice vote. The Senate adopted a Republican \namendment by Senator Coburn to strike a tax amendment related to film \nproduction.\n  And with an overwhelming bipartisan 71-to-26 vote, the Senate adopted \na Mikulski-Brownback amendment to allow a deduction for interest on the \npurchase of motor vehicles.\n  By voice vote, the Senate adopted a Harkin amendment on which Senator \nSpecter played a very important role, who worked very hard, Senator \nSpecter did, on the Harkin amendment, to provide additional funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  So where are we now? Pending are a Murray amendment to strengthen \ninfrastructure investments--these are all pending--a Vitter amendment \nto strike several spending items; an Isakson-Lieberman amendment to \nprovide a tax credit for home purchases; a Feingold-McCain amendment to \nprovide greater accountability of congressional earmarks; a Cardin \nsmall business bonds amendment; a DeMint amendment making a series of \ntax cuts in lieu of the pending substitute; a Thune amendment in the \nnature of a substitute; a Thune amendment on new programs in the bill; \nand a Dorgan amendment on runaway plants.\n  I might add that the Democratic caucus is conducting an issues \nconference today, but the floor is open for business. We expect a \nnumber of Republican amendments and also Democratic amendments. We hope \nto have several votes on amendments this afternoon and evening after \nthe Democratic issues conference concludes, perhaps starting about 5:30 \ntoday, although I cannot say that that is going to be an exact time. \nThat is for the leaders to determine.\n  For the information of Senators, let me say I expect that we hope to \nhave as many as 12 amendments pending today, and we hope to stack votes \non these at the end of the afternoon and into the evening. In addition \nto the Republican amendments that we expect to be offered, we also \nexpect Senator Bingaman, who has expressed an interest in offering an \namendment, as well as I mentioned Senator Dorgan's runaway plants. \nSenator Wyden also spoke to me about his amendment on bonuses that he \nintends to offer with Senator Snowe.\n  Once again, I urge Senators, let the managers know of their \nintentions to offer amendments. We want to give Senators as much notice \nas possible. I reemphasize notice is efficient. It helps us get our \namendments passed here.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  I wish to say a word or two on the DeMint amendment. I remind \nSenators that the DeMint amendment strikes the whole underlying bill \nand replaces that language with his amendment, which reduces the \ncorporate rate to 25 percent, and it makes permanent the 2001 and 2003 \ntax cuts, including capital gains. That is a big item, as we all know.\n  It further repeals, permanently repeals the alternative minimum tax \nprovisions in the Code today. It changes the estate tax treatments by \ncreating an exception up to $5 million per person. I do not know what \nhe does with the rates, but it is an estate tax reduction below what \nestate taxes are today.\n  I remind all Senators that next year, in the year 2010, the Federal \nestate tax is zero. If Congress does nothing, it reverts to quite a \nhigher level. The DeMint amendment takes the current 2009 level and \nlowers it even further. I do not know this, but I suspect it also is \npermanent.\n  The DeMint amendment further makes the child tax permanent. It \nrepeals all itemized deductions currently in the Code which itemizers \noften take, except for the mortgage interest deduction and the \ncharitable deduction; otherwise, all other deductions, if you itemize, \nare repealed; for example, State and local taxes, everything else in \nthe bill before us.\n  What is the effect of that? There are several effects. First, we are \ntrying to begin to address our health care system, and the DeMint \namendment strikes all the health information technology provisions in \nthe bill. We are trying to get health information technology up and \nrunning. I think it is a bad idea to strike health information \ntechnology. We have to get that started if we are going to begin to \nlower health care costs in this country.\n  It strikes the Medicaid provisions through aid to the States. It does \nnot take a rocket scientist to know what effect that would have on the \nStates. The States are in a recession. I think it was the Government \nAccountability Office that estimated about $230 billion is being cut by \nStates because they are in recession, and that basically comes out of \nMedicaid and other low-income programs.\n  The DeMint amendment says, oh, sorry, States, you do not get any \nassistance, which means all of those people getting cut are not going \nto have health care.\n  It strikes the changes to TANF. That is the program we put in place \nyears ago to reform the welfare program. It is a great program. It \nworks very well. It gets people off of welfare in a very solid way.\n  It also strikes provisions that extend unemployment insurance to \npeople who have lost their jobs. I cannot believe it would do something \nlike that, but that is what the DeMint amendment does.\n  It also strikes the COBRA provisions. That is very important. I can't \nbelieve that is what he wants to do. In current law, when somebody \nworks for a company and is laid off for reasons not of his or her own \nmaking, they are laid off and there are more than 20 people in that \nfirm, that person is entitled to keep health insurance offered by that \nfirm if that firm does offer health insurance, I think it is for 18 \nmonths.\n  But that person who is laid off can keep that health insurance only \nif the person laid off pays 102 percent of premiums, that is, the \nperson laid off has to pay for all of that health insurance, plus 2 \npercent administrative costs.\n  Now, clearly not many people who are laid off, not working, can \nafford to pay 102 percent of the health insurance premiums, especially \nwhen the premiums these days are going up at such a rapid rate.\n  We, in the underlying bill, say a person laid off in that situation \ngets a 65-percent subsidy so that person can keep health insurance for \n18 months. I think that is the right thing to do, given the current \ncircumstances. But, no, the DeMint amendment says you have to pay 102 \npercent, because we are not going to help you in these dire times.\n  I also say, these are permanent tax cuts in the DeMint amendment. The \n1-year deficit effects of this amendment are staggering. They are ugly, \nbecause basically this is a huge, big tax cut amendment is what it is.\n  Last night, Senator Coburn spoke eloquently about growing deficits in \nthe future, how fast they are growing. It begins to maybe put our \ncurrency in danger. Other countries might be not as interested in \nholding dollars, might not be interested in buying Treasuries.\n\n[[Page S1493]]\n\nCountries such as China come to mind, other countries come to mind.\n  Obviously the DeMint amendment would make the concerns of Senator \nCoburn balloon. I mean, if Senator Coburn is concerned about the \ndeficits today, Senator Coburn, I am sure, would be dramatically \nconcerned about the effects of this amendment, which would balloon the \ndeficits to an even greater amount.\n  So I think the underlying bill is important, it is crucial. The \nestimates are, between either passing the underlying amendments or not \npassing them, a difference of about 3 to 4 million jobs, 3 to 4 million \njobs in this country. We could choose not to pass this underlying bill. \nThat would mean no economic stimulus recovery package. That would also \nmean about 3 to 4 million further jobs lost. If we pass this \nlegislation, it would begin to create and bring some jobs back into \nthis economy.\n  Let's face it, banks are not lending for lots of reasons today. But \none reason is because they are having a hard time finding creditworthy \nborrowers. It is hard to get creditworthy borrowers, when the borrower \nis having a hard time finding demand, because people are not buying the \nborrower's products.\n  There are many parts to the overall solution. But one of them is \nhelping create some demand, and this underlying bill does create \ndemand. If, on the other hand, we do not pass the bill and pass these \nbig tax cuts, it further balloons the deficit to a staggering amount. \nIt is not going to have nearly the stimulative effect that the \nproponents might say. It will not.\n  Our goal here, in representing our constituents in our State, is to \ntake this kind of bad situation we find ourselves in--we kind of \ninherited this. This is where we are, these are the cards that were \nplayed, that is the hand we have right now. So let's do the best we can \nwith what we have got. My judgment is, and I think it is the judgment \nof most Members of this body, this economic stimulus package may not be \nperfect, but it is pretty good. It will help create some jobs. It is \ncertainly better than the alternative, which is nothing. Let's get on \nwith it and keep improving upon it as we proceed.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues not to adopt the DeMint amendment, \nwhich is a full repeal of the program and replaces it with a massive \nincrease in debt.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 159 to Amendment No. 98\n\n(Purpose: To reduce home foreclosures, compensate servicers who modify \nmortgages, and remove the legal constraints that inhibit modification, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 159.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Martinez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 159 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, February 3, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, Members on both sides of the aisle \nagree that any stimulus we pass must be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary. We need to put our economy back on track. The key to putting \nthe economy back on track is that the spending we do through this \nstimulus be targeted, temporary, and timely.\n  Each of these principles is important and they each are loaded with \nmeaning. It needs to be timely because it needs to be directed as soon \nas possible. As the President as early as this morning said, it is \nessential we get it out there.\n  It also has to be targeted because it cannot just go to all the \nwonderful things upon which the Congress might spend money. It has to \nbe targeted to that which the economy needs in order to create jobs at \nthis moment in time.\n  It must be also temporary because we well know at some point this \neconomy is going to recover, and as it recovers, it would not be a good \nidea for Government spending to be out of control and be the beast that \nfeeds inflation. We do not want to come out of this economic crisis \nonly to be creating the next one, which would be an inflationary \nproblem for our economy.\n  Americans want and deserve solutions that will create jobs and \nsupport the American worker. I have joined a number of my colleagues in \noffering an alternative with the right incentives to foster job \ncreation.\n  While creating jobs is essential if we want to achieve economic \nrecovery, it will not fix the problem with that alone. Our Nation is \nstill in the midst of the worst housing slump in decades, and many \nAmerican families face the frightening reality of foreclosure.\n  To date, Congress and the White House and the private sector have put \nforth a number of programs to help struggling homeowners, but we have \nyet to see significant results from any of these various programs that \nhave been out there. This is because at the core of the problem are \nprivately securitized mortgages, which were originated without a \nguarantee from the government-sponsored enterprises. These are the \nprivately securitized mortgages that are not Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or \nGSE sponsored. These mortgages account for only 15 percent of all \noutstanding mortgages, but they represent more than one-half of all the \nforeclosures that are taking place today.\n  If left alone, the crisis will only continue to worsen. According to \none expert, we can expect to see 1.7 million more foreclosures in the \nyear of 2009 alone. It is a downward spiral that seems to find no \nbottom.\n  Today I am proposing a plan that would provide troubled homeowners \nwith options and incentivize participation from the private sector from \nthese private securitizers who are out there in the private sector. \nIncluded in the plan is a loan modification program which will \nencourage mortgage servicers to help stem the tide of foreclosures.\n  Currently, there are two primary factors hindering mortgage servicers \nfrom modifying loans: a lack of proper compensation, and second and \nequally important is the threat of litigation.\n  The plan has a two-pronged approach that aims to address these \nconcerns by the properly compensating mortgage servicers and removing \nthe legal restraints that prevent modifications.\n  Under the plan, the Federal Government would temporarily provide a \nmonthly incentive fee to servicers who modify privately securitized \nmortgages. It also includes a safe harbor provision that removes the \nlegal constraints currently inhibiting modifications. This plan also \nrecognizes the integrity of contracts.\n  There is always the potential that a relatively small number of \njunior investors could be harmed by the modifications permitted by the \nprogram. With this in mind, the proposed legislation eliminates the \nneed for these junior investors to file suit by creating a small claims \nfund that the Treasury may use to resolve potential disputes. This will \ngo a long way in protecting investors acting in good faith for the \ngreater good--an incentive that is greatly needed if we want investors \nto be on board in helping to resolve this current crisis.\n  The plan has been supported by a number of economists, including \nColumbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard and Vice Dean Christopher \nMayer. According to a Columbia report, the plan could reduce up to 1 \nmillion foreclosures at a cost of about $11 billion--roughly 10 percent \nof the $100 billion required by other plans.\n  I have been supportive of similar concepts, including the plan put \nforth by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, which is based on the model used to \nmodify the loans the FDIC took over from IndyMac. I believe this plan \nis even more taxpayer friendly because future potential losses are \nshouldered by private investors, not the Government.\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\n  As we continue talking about the stimulus, I urge my colleagues to \nconsider the need to address the root cause of this crisis, which is \nthe housing market. Americans are struggling, and unless we provide \nthem with realistic alternatives to foreclosure, we will fail to fix \nthe larger problem at hand.\n  A lot of colleagues of mine have expressed support for this plan. I \nencourage Members on both sides of the aisle to please look at this \nplan carefully. Because as a result of what we are doing on stimulus, \nwe need to also deal with the housing problem. The housing problem is \nwhat brought us into this problem. We will not get out of this economic \nmess until we once again resolve the housing problem.\n  We need to tackle it in two ways, in my view. We need to tackle it in \nkeeping families in their homes, avoiding foreclosure where possible. A \nhuge number of today's inventory of unsold homes are homes that have \nbeen or are coming out of foreclosure. Those homes in and of themselves \nobviously tend to be sold at much lower prices. So it continues to \ndrive the market down. It depresses values. It depresses the market.\n  The second problem, obviously, is still the old law of economics of \nsupply and demand. We have a huge inventory of unsold homes. This \ninventory of unsold homes also impacts price. So I support not only my \nproposal but the proposal my colleague from Georgia, the Senator from \nGeorgia, Johnny Isakson, has proposed, which is to incentivize the \npurchase of homes by providing a $15,000 tax credit, over a year or 2 \nyears, to anyone in America who purchases a home.\n  The bottom line is, if we can get the market back again and people \nbuying homes again and we draw down that inventory of unsold homes, if \nwe slow down or can bring foreclosures to a halt, those two elements, \nworking together, will be a greater way in which we can now begin to \nsee the housing market stabilize in prices, which will also stabilize \nthe foreclosures of the future.\n  You see, families who are in trouble today were not the same families \nwho were in trouble 2 years ago when this crisis began. Families who \nare in trouble today are people who increasingly find themselves upside \ndown on their mortgage because of the continuing decline in home \nvalues.\n  I hope my colleagues will carefully analyze these proposals--not only \nmine, amendment No. 159, but also Senator Isakson's proposal. I think \nthese two proposals, hand in hand, will help us to make a difference in \nthe current housing crisis. Many other things we can talk about in the \nstimulus, but fixing housing is at the core of what we must do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment that would \nstrike the protectionist ``Buy American'' provision from the pending \neconomic recovery package. While the supporters of this provision state \nthat they intend it to save American jobs, it would have exactly the \nopposite effect, causing great harm to the American worker and global \neconomy.\n  In 1930, as the United States and the world was entering what would \nbe\n\n[[Page S1495]]\n\nknown to history as the Great Depression, this body considered issues \nsimilar to those we are discussing on the Senate floor today. Two men--\nMr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley--led the effort to enact protectionist \nlegislation in the face of economic crisis. Their bill, the Smoot-\nHawley Tariff Act, raised duties on thousands of imported goods in a \nfutile attempt to keep jobs at home. In the face of this legislation, \n1,028 economists issued a statement to President Herbert Hoover. This \nstatement, subsequently printed in the New York Times, is as relevant \ntoday as it was nearly 80 years ago. ``America is now facing the \nproblem of unemployment,'' these economists wrote. ``The proponents of \nhigher tariffs would claim that an increase in rates will give work to \nthe idle. This is not true. We cannot increase employment by \nrestricting trade.'' Mr. Smoot, Mr. Hawley, and their colleagues paid \nno heed to this wise admonishment, and the Congress went ahead with \nprotectionist legislation. In doing so, they sparked an international \ntrade war as countries around the world retaliated, raising their own \nduties and restricting trade, and they helped turn a severe recession \ninto the greatest depression in modern history.\n  We know the lessons of history, and we cannot fall prey to the failed \npolicies of the past. We should not sit idly by while some seek to \npursue a path of economic isolation, a course that could lead to \ndisaster. It didn't work in the 1930s, and it certainly won't work \ntoday. That is why I so strongly oppose the protectionist ``Buy \nAmerican'' provision in the pending bill and believe we must strike it.\n  The Senate version of the stimulus bill goes beyond the stark \nprotectionism of its House counterpart in a way that risks serious \ndamage to America's economic well-being. The bill currently on the \nSenate floor prohibits the use of funds in this bill for projects \nunless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in the \nproject are produced in the United States. These antitrade measures may \nsound welcome to Americans who are hurting in the midst of our economic \ntroubles and faced with the specter .of layoffs. Yet shortsighted \nprotectionist measures like ``Buy American'' risk greatly exacerbating \nour current economic woes. Already, one economist at the Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics has calculated that the ``Buy \nAmerican'' provisions in this bill will actually cost the United States \nmore jobs than it will generate. Some of our largest trading partners, \nincluding Canada and the European Union, have warned that such a move \ncould invite protectionist retaliation, further harming our ability to \ngenerate jobs and economic growth. And it seems clear that this \nprovision violates our obligations under more than one international \nagreement.\n  The purpose of this stimulus legislation is to create jobs and \ngenerate economic growth. I am very concerned about the potential \nimpact these ``Buy American'' policies will have on trade relations \nwith our partners, an impact that will directly affect the number of \njobs we are able to create at home. For example, in a few days, \nPresident Obama will embark on his first trip abroad to Canada. I \napplaud his decision to visit our neighbors to the north, as they are \none of our closest allies and strongest trading partners. Our two \nnations share an increasingly integrated trade relationship, resulting \nin nearly $1 million of trade and commerce crossing our border every \nminute, a level of trade that sustains approximately 7 million jobs \nhere in the United States.\n  Should we adopt protectionist legislation, however, President Obama \nis likely to visit our ally with a dubious gift indeed: legislation \nthat attempts to choke off Canada's access to the U.S. market. Prime \nMinister Stephen Harper said yesterday that the provisions ``are \nmeasures that are of concern to all trading partners of the United \nStates.'' In a recent letter, Canada's ambassador to the U.S. Michael \nWilson wrote, ``If Buy American becomes part of the stimulus \nlegislation, the United States will lose the moral authority to \npressure others not to introduce protectionist policies. A rush of \nprotectionist actions could create a downward spiral like the world \nexperienced in the 1930's.'' He writes further that this provision \nwould ``decrease North American competitiveness, thereby killing jobs \nrather than creating them.'' It is beyond my comprehension why we would \nseek to hamper such an important relationship by passing legislation \nwith provisions that have been proven counterproductive time and time \nagain.\n  The reaction of our Canadian friends is just the beginning of what we \ncan expect to occur should this provision become law. American trade \nwith the European Union currently stands at over $200 billion per year. \nJohn Bruton, the European Commission's ambassador to Washington, has \nraised serious objections to the ``Buy American'' provisions in a \nletter to Congress and the administration, saying that the provision \n``risks entering into a spiral of protectionist measures around the \nglobe that can only hurt our economies further.'' A European Commission \nspokesman noted, ``We are particularly concerned about the signal that \nthese measures could send to the world at a time when all countries are \nfacing difficulties. Where America leads, many others tend to follow.''\n\n  Should we enact such a provision, it will only be a matter of time \nbefore we face an array of similar protectionism from other countries--\nfrom ``Buy European'' to ``Buy Japanese'' and more. In fact, in the \n1980s we saw Japanese provisions that attempted to take the kinds of \nsteps we are contemplating now, and barred American goods in Japanese \ngovernment procurement. The U.S. Congress responded just as we can \nexpect others to do now--by threatening retaliation and considering \nlegislation that would restrict Japanese imports.\n  We took these steps in order to persuade our Japanese friends to \nabandon these protectionist moves, and in the end we succeeded. The \nUnited States has spent decades pushing toward a globalized world of \nopen trade and investment, governed by rules applicable to all. The \n``Buy American'' provision contained in this legislation would \nundermine this longstanding tenet of American trade policy and would \nviolate our international obligations and commitments. Just last \nNovember in Washington, the U.S. signed a joint declaration with \nmembers of the G-20 pledging that ``within the next 12 months, we will \nrefrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in goods \nand services.'' Yet here we are, barely 2 months later, contemplating \nwhether or not to go back on a commitment to some of our closest allies \nand trading partners, potentially damaging our credibility to uphold \nfuture agreements. Canadian Prime Minister Harper pointed out the irony \nhere when he noted that ``we all agreed that we had to have a global \nresponse to recession, which would include stimulus packages in all \nmajor countries and the avoidance of protectionism, and certainly not \nprotectionism in a stimulus package.''\n  In addition, it appears that the ``Buy American'' provision would \nviolate our obligations under the WTO Agreement on Government \nProcurement and, in fact, reports indicate that the European Union is \nalready considering a legal WTO complaint--and the procurement chapter \nof the North American Free Trade Agreement. Such action is not only \npotentially disastrous for our economic interests, it is also a \nterrible way to conduct foreign policy. Pascal Lamy, head of the World \nTrade Organization, said recently, ``I hope the senators will be wise \nenough . . . to make sure the U.S. complies with its international \nobligations.'' Will we?\n  In addition to the growing chorus of international opposition, there \nis also. opposition from the very American companies that would \ngenerate badly needed jobs at home. In a recent Washington Post \narticle, Bill Lane, government affairs director for Caterpillar, is \nquoted as saying that ``by embracing Buy American, you are undermining \nour ability to export U.S.-produced products overseas.'' Karan Bhatia, \nGE's senior counsel for international law, said that adoption of the \n``Buy American'' provision would ``be creating an ample basis for \ncountries to close their markets to U.S. products.'' Why then should \nthis body approve a bill that would potentially devastate the ability \nof American companies to tap into foreign markets and, in turn, \ncontinue to employ thousands of hardworking Americans? The short answer \nis that\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nwe should not. President Obama himself spoke out against the Buy \nAmerican provision. ``I think that would be a mistake right now,'' he \nsaid yesterday. ``That is a potential source of trade wars that we \ncan't afford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.''\n  I hope all senators will support this amendment, which would strike \nthe existing ``Buy American'' provision and replace it with a \nlimitation on ``Buy American'' clauses in this bill. To adopt \nanticompetitive, protectionist policies is to risk economic disaster, \nand it is the last thing we should consider at a time of economic \ndifficulty.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Record be held open \nfor my second statement concerning the other amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, there are other Senators who are waiting \nto speak and propose amendments, so I will come back at the appropriate \ntime to speak at some length on both amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 161 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, today I wish to talk about a number of \nconcerns I have about the underlying bill as well as some amendments I \nhave filed and propose to call up. I have offered the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee one amendment I wish to call \nup, and I will check with him before actually calling it up.\n  I think it is important to put this in context. Our Nation is in the \nmidst of a serious economic crisis. Workers in my home State of \nMissouri and across the Nation are facing job losses, small businesses \nare failing, and families are struggling to pay their bills and put \nfood on the table. It is clear we have to act quickly and boldly to \nprotect and create jobs and put people back to work immediately. \nHowever, it is not nearly as important to act quickly as it is to do it \nright. I don't believe this bill is right. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhy.\n  For any economic recovery package to work, there are three critical \ncomponents. First, we must invest in ready-to-go priority \ninfrastructure projects. America's decades-long lack of improvement and \ninvestment in infrastructure--in roads, bridges, river navigation, \nhousing, and all types of public improvements--is taking a huge toll on \nour economy. By investing now in shovel-ready projects, we will make \nsignificant long-term improvements to our aching infrastructure. Good \nroads and highways connect people to communities, attract and sustain \nbusiness, and are necessary to spur economic development in our \ncommunities. Also, investing in shovel-ready projects will create jobs \nin our communities now. New jobs and putting people back to work is the \nbest way to help struggling families now and start turning our economy \naround.\n  The second necessary component of any successful recovery package is \nreal tax relief for working families and small businesses. Working \nfamilies need real and significant tax relief--more than just a few \nextra dollars in their paycheck. They need to keep more money in their \npockets and send less to Uncle Sam. Tax relief for working families \nwill help folks weather this economic crisis.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, as I hope all of us \nhere recognize. Right now, small businesses across the Nation are \nstruggling to meet payroll, struggling to pay rent, struggling to keep \ntheir books in balance. Tax relief for small businesses would give them \nthe money they need to keep the workers they have now. Tax relief for \nsmall businesses would allow them to invest in new equipment. Most \nimportantly, tax relief for small businesses would give them the money \nto create new jobs and hire new employees.\n  The third and most important component of any economic recovery plan \nis attacking the root cause of the problem. Without help, our economy \ncannot recover from the breakdown in our financial and credit markets.\n  Bad debt is weighing down the banking system. Bad debt is creating \nfear and uncertainty about the solvency of our financial system. We \ncannot ignore this problem or wait until later to tackle it head-on.\n  Let me be clear. Without addressing the root cause of our economic \ncrisis, no economic recovery package, no stimulus bill can succeed. \nJust ask the Japanese, who ``lost'' a decade of economic growth, \nproviding money for more spending but without dealing with the bad \nassets that were on the financial books in the country. We cannot just \nthrow money at the problem. We already tried that last year, and it \nhasn't worked. It hasn't turned the economy around. There are a number \nof alternatives to fix the root of our economic crisis. It is \nimperative that we select and act on one now.\n  One option that makes a lot of sense to me is creating a new Federal \nentity that will take on the toxic assets that are weighing down the \nbanks. Acquiring these toxic assets would also address the housing \ncrisis by allowing the Government to modify home mortgages that will \nlikely default, be able to reduce the payments and allow those people \nin the homes with the bad mortgages to keep them.\n  During the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, the \nGovernment created the Resolution Trust Corporation to dispose of bad \ndebt. We know this method can work. It was paid for. I was on the \nBanking Committee. We worked through it. But the RTC was the key \ncomponent in helping our economy recover after almost 800 savings and \nloans failed. The good news is that a good deal of the money--not all \nof it--was brought back as the Federal Government disposed of those \nassets acquired.\n  Whether it is through an RTC or another alternative, such as a bad \nbank or guarantee program, or some other combination, addressing the \nroot cause of the economic crisis is the key component to economic \nrecovery.\n  Together, those three components--infrastructure investment, tax \nrelief, and attacking the root cause of the crisis--are critical to any \ntimely, targeted, and temporary economic recovery package. \nUnfortunately, I must say that the Democratic spending bill before us \ntoday fails on all three counts.\n  I have to say I was very disappointed that after many years where we \nworked together on appropriations matters and tax matters, these \nmeasures did not go through hearings, did not go through bipartisan \ncreation. We had a brief hearing, a brief markup session, and \nessentially the Democratic bill was reported out--without any \nRepublican fingerprints on it.\n  The bill that has come out stimulates the national debt, stimulates \nthe growth of Government, but will do very little to stimulate the \neconomy or job creation. First, the Democrats' spending bill \nshortchanges infrastructure. Next, the Democrats' spending bill fails \nto give working families and small businesses real tax relief. Third, \nthe Democrats' spending bill fails to address the root cause of the \neconomic crisis. The bill fails on all three counts.\n  Also, no one can ignore the massive price tag of this bill. The \nDemocrats' trillion-dollar spending bill is a huge debt to saddle on \nour children and grandchildren. The cost is too high--especially when \nmany economists agree it will do little to create jobs and stimulate \nthe economy today, when we really need it.\n  In other words, the Democrats' trillion-dollar spending bill won't \nwork for what we need it to do. The wasteful spending in this bill is \nrunning rampant. It seems this is a massive downpayment on the \nDemocrats' policy priorities masquerading as a stimulus bill.\n  I was glad that we were able to strike the $246 million tax break for \nHollywood movie producers from the bill yesterday. But I am \ndisappointed that even after the outpouring of calls from the American \npeople--we certainly heard a lot in our office--45 Democrats still \nvoted for that special interest tax break. I think it is insulting to \nstruggling families in Missouri and across the Nation that the \nDemocrats would try to sneak in an almost $250 million tax break for \nHollywood movie producers. Calling such a tax break for\n\n[[Page S1497]]\n\nHollywood movies an energy stimulus is outrageous.\n  There are many more examples of this in the trillion-dollar spending \nbill that will have zero stimulative effect on our economy. How about \nthe $75 million for smoking cessation or the $34 million to redecorate \nthe Department of Commerce? This bill is loaded with many spending \nitems that have nothing to do with stimulus or creating jobs. Maybe \nsome of these items have merit on their own, but they won't create jobs \nor grow our economy, and they don't belong in an emergency stimulus \nbill.\n  The figures I have seen from CBO say less than 10 percent of this \nwill be spent in the current year. Most of the spending is going to \noccur in 2011, 2012, and beyond. Only about 6 percent of it is on \nvitally needed infrastructure. We need a bill that meets the goals of \ncreating jobs and solving the credit problem and helping American \nfamilies now, not years down the road, if ever.\n  It is no surprise, Madam President, that the more Americans learn \nabout this bill, the more they oppose it. You can see the results from \nthe national polls. A recent Gallup poll shows that support is \ndeclining. A Rasmussen poll that came out today shows only 37 percent \nof Americans support this massive spending bill. In Missouri, our calls \nare running 9 to 1 against it. I think probably that 1 will even be \nreduced and the opposing figure will be greater as people learn more \nabout it. My offices in Washington and in cities across my State have \nreceived overwhelming phone calls saying stop this trillion-dollar \nspending bill.\n  I think it is critical that we pass legislation that will help our \neconomy recover, help create jobs, and help people get back to work \nnow. But I cannot support this spending bill that fails to stimulate \nthe economy or create jobs. I cannot support the bill that will saddle \nour grandchildren with even more debt. I cannot support this spending \nbill that would create a massive growth in Government programs, some of \nwhich may continue for years.\n  A critical ingredient to economic recovery is confidence that there \nbe discipline in Government. There must be some confidence that we will \nnot go hog-wild on a spending binge that saddles our kids with debt and \nsets off an inflationary cycle.\n  We must not repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression by throwing \nup trade barriers. We are living in a global economy, and we are in a \nglobal economic crisis. This demands more free trade, not less. I am \nheartened that just yesterday President Obama acknowledged the dangers \nof protectionism. I hope my colleagues don't follow the path of Smoot-\nHawley and cause further damage to our economy and jobs. Cutting off \ntrade not only threatens our export jobs, but many more jobs in my \nState depend upon exports and depend upon the one or two industries \nthat might be affected. Farmers in my State have been absolutely wiped \nout in the past when their exports to Southeast Asia, for example, a \ndecade ago were cut off. This retaliation that the European Union and \nothers have threatened could cut off the markets for our farmers.\n  Finally, the enormity of this spending bill sends the wrong signal \nabout creating jobs.\n  I hope this body will agree to a complete substitute to get a bill \nthat will work and work now. I think there are some improvements that \ncan be made in it. I have several of these I intend to offer at the \nappropriate time with several of my distinguished colleagues, including \nthe ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He \nand I, along with Senators Boxer, Baucus, Cochran, Crapo, Bayh, \nBrownback, and Voinovich, will be offering an amendment for better \nroads, bridges, and highways. That amendment would take $5.5 billion \nprovided in the new surface transportation investment program and put \nit into the highway and bridge formula, making the total for highways \nand bridges $32.5 billion instead of $27 billion. Every State wins, and \nit is offset. According to the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials, there are currently 5,148 ready-to-go \nprojects, with a total price tag of $64.3 billion.\n  In addition, I will introduce, with Senators Baucus, Voinovich, and \nSpecter, an amendment that eliminates the $8.7 billion rescission of \ncontract authority found in SAFETEA-LU for September 30, 2009. What we \nhad to do when we passed SAFETEA was put in a ``gimme'' at the end. \nUnfortunately, that ``gimme'' would cut off money that has already been \nauthorized and ready to go to the States to spend on the Nation's \nhighways and bridges. If this rescission is not revoked, we would see \nthe cancellation of hundreds of major projects and the loss of jobs in \nevery State. I think that for a stimulus it is appropriate to undo that \nartificial limit on spending on highways. For Missouri, the Department \nof Transportation estimates that this rescission would cost the State \n$205 million in lost projects and 9,600 jobs. This is not the year to \nbe losing those jobs. Our amendment would strike that destructive \nrescission.\n  On a totally different subject, I will join Senator Coburn in \noffering an amendment that will address a national health epidemic and \nempower families to make healthy food choices. The amendment is simple. \nIt would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to establish \nguidelines to ensure that Federal dollars are used to purchase food \nthat is nutritious and consistent with the food pyramid. These \nguidelines would be developed by the USDA, and they would give all of \nour important health and community advocates the opportunity to give \nthe Government their input about how to make the Food Stamp Program a \nhealthier program. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, poor nutrition leading to obesity can result in 1 out of 8 \ndeaths in America today, which is caused by illnesses linked to being \noverweight or obese.\n  Another program that I intend to offer, in addition to investing in \nour transportation infrastructure, is investment in early childhood \nfacilities. The shortage of these facilities is a chronic problem \nfacing prekindergarten programs. I will offer an amendment that takes \n$400 million out of the HUD Neighborhood Stabilization Program to fund \ncapital investments for new construction, rehabilitation, and \nretrofitting of early childhood development centers. There is almost \n$150 million in stalled capital projects in five States, which would \nserve 10,000 children. Projections on this survey suggest an immediate \nneed that exceeds a billion dollars over the next 2 years and would \nserve 30,000 children and generate at least 4,000 jobs.\n  Finally, this is the amendment I am going to call up. It deals with \nlow-income housing. Some of the folks who have been hit hardest by the \neconomic crisis are needy families. They have been hit doubly hard by \nthe reduction in available and affordable housing.\n  Today I intend to offer a bipartisan amendment with Senators Murray, \nDodd, Reed, and Kohl to address this problem by providing $2 billion in \ndirect equity grants to States through the low-income housing tax \ncredit program.\n  Much of these funds would be directed toward tax credit deals that \nhave already been approved by State credit agencies and have financing \nin place to proceed into construction, except for a recent equity gap \ncreated by the credit crisis. In other words, these funds are ready to \ngo. They are truly shovel ready, and they deal with a great problem.\n  The problem is, this crisis in the financial markets has made it \nimpossible for the normal low-income housing credit deals to go \nforward. This money would fill in that gap. In my State of Missouri, \nthere are about 703 affordable housing units approved by the Missouri \nHousing Development Commission that have been stalled. They are ready \nto go. For 2009, the States anticipate another 2,000 units would be \nstalled.\n  If the equity gap funding is provided, it not only will save these \nunits, but also create some 3,000 new jobs.\n  It is estimated the low-income housing tax credit will nationally \nbuild 120,000 homes annually, while supporting 180,000 jobs. These are \ngood to go, and when the President talks about shovel-ready projects, \nwhat better thing to do than to make sure we have affordable housing \nfor those who most need it.\n  I believe this amendment provides that affordable housing for \nfamilies displaced by home foreclosures.\n\n[[Page S1498]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, I wish to make a comment on the \nremarks of the Senator from Missouri.\n  One of the most disturbing things, other than the cost of this \nstimulus bill, is the fact there is nothing in there to stimulate. \nThere are two things that can be done that would be of great benefit to \nthe United States of America.\n  One is, as he talked about, infrastructure. I was somewhat shocked \nthat in the bill, on the other side, there was only $30 billion, in the \nSenate bill $27 billion that would go toward highways, bridges, and \nthat type of construction. I am very much in support of his amendment \nNo. 161 that will raise that amount by $5.5 billion. I have to say, it \nis not enough. That would still be less than 5 percent of the total \namount that would go to those items that would provide immediate jobs.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we can identify over $1.1 billion, just in \nOklahoma, of projects that are spade ready, with environmental impact \nstatements, everything has been done. We are ready to go on them. That \nis what will produce jobs tomorrow and the next day and the next day.\n  The other area is in the military. While those two amendments have to \ndo with the infrastructure of which I am in strong support, the Boxer-\nInhofe amendment has yet to be filed. It will be filed. We are talking \nthere about some $50 billion that would go toward construction and \ninfrastructure.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 262 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  I want to mention, though, there is one other amendment I do want to \nbring up for consideration. That is amendment No. 262. This is a \nrecognition of investing in our Nation's defense. It provides thousands \nof sustainable American jobs and provides for our Nation's security at \nthe same time.\n  Major defense procurement programs are all manufactured in the United \nStates, with our aerospace industry alone employing more than 655,000 \nworkers spread across the United States. At the end of last month, \nconservative economist Martin Feldstein wrote in the Washington Post \nabout the $800 billion mistake. He was referring, of course, to the \nstimulus bill.\n  In that article, he pointed out the value of infrastructure spending \non domestic military bases is the most significant we could do to try \nto stimulate the economy. In fact, it is clear that infrastructure \ninvestment alone with defense spending and tax cuts has a greater \nstimulative impact on the economy than anything else the government can \ndo.\n  If our infrastructure needs repair, we equally need the tools to \nreconstruct our military readiness. That is what I am trying to do with \nthis amendment. This is amendment No. 262.\n  I agree with everything that was said by the Senator from Missouri, \nthat we need to do a lot of this with infrastructure. But, equally, my \namendment increases defense procurement spending to manufacture or \nacquire vehicles, equipment, ammunition, and materials required to \nreconstitute military units.\n  We are accomplishing two things: We are providing the jobs; we are \nalso rebuilding our military. The one thing we hear on the floor over \nand over, with the activity that is now subsiding in Iraq but, of \ncourse, escalating in Afghanistan, is that we are overworking everyone. \nThe term we use in the military is the OPTEMPO is too high. We all \nrecognize that fact.\n  We know we went through the decade of the nineties reducing spending \non both end strength and modernization. What we need to do, if we are \ngoing to be having some kind of stimulative effect, if you can do it \nand rebuild our military, drop down the OPTEMPO for our people serving \nand at the same time do something about some of our FCS systems, for \nexample, the Future Combat System, so we will become superior to our \nprospective enemies on the field in terms of equipment we give our \nkids.\n  Right now, we all recognize that with the exception of the F-22 and \nthe Joint Strike Fighter, the Russians are making the SU series that is \nsuperior to our best strike vehicles, the F-15 and F-16. This is a \nprocurement problem. We already have the lines going on C-17s and other \nvehicles, and it is going to be necessary to augment that.\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\n  This is fully offset. It does have $5.3 billion that would increase \nprocurement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment for the \npurpose of bringing up Inhofe amendment No. 262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 262 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To appropriate, with an offset, $5,232,000,000 for \n  procurement for the Department of Defense to reconstitute military \n units to an acceptable readiness rating and to restock prepositioned \n                    assets and war reserve material)\n\n       On page 60, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                     GENERAL PROVISIONS--THIS TITLE\n\n\nadditional amounts for procurement for reconstitution of military units \n    and restocking of prepositioned assets and war reserve material\n\n       Sec. 301.

Madam President, I am hoping to be able to consider this \namendment in the near future. Let me mention one other point of equal \nsignificance, and it is somewhat controversial.\n  I just got back a couple days ago from Guantanamo Bay. I have been \ndown there several times. As a matter of fact, I was one of the first \nMembers--I think the first Member of Congress, of either House, to be \nthere after 9/11. I have watched it as the years have gone by, the \ncriticism of things happening at Guantanamo Bay that have never \nhappened at Guantanamo Bay. People are talking about torturing and all \nthese things. This is not the truth.\n  What really bothers me is, all you have to do, if you want to know \nthe truth about it, is pull up on your computer the Red Cross Web site. \nThey are down there with regularity talking about what is happening.\n  There are no human rights abuses. In fact, 3 days ago when I was \nthere, some of the detainees were kind of laughing about the fact they \nactually had better medical treatment than they ever had before. As far \nas the food is concerned, it is the best. There are six camps in \nconjunction with the severity of the problem with a particular \ndetainee, what level of terrorist activities he was involved in. The \nfirst three are the ones ready to go back, and the last ones are the \nmore severe.\n  In camp 5 and camp 6, we are talking about really bad guys up there. \nThey still have recreational activities, health care, dental care, \nfood. So things there are good.\n  I hope any preconceived notions by any Member of this Senate could be \nsatisfied by going and seeing for yourself or pulling up the Web site. \nWe even had al-Jazeera in there to evaluate how people are treated at \nGuantanamo Bay. It is an asset we have had since 1903. It is something \nwe cannot do without.\n  I have submitted an amendment, which I will not call up at this time, \namendment No. 198. People such as Senator Martinez, who is from Cuba, \nrecognize the fact that we have to keep that facility open.\n  Right now, even though it has a capacity of 11,000, we only have \nabout 425 detainees there. Of that, there are 170 who cannot be \nreturned to their home country, cannot be repatriated because they will \nnot let them back in. Of the 170, 110 are the real serious, most severe \nof the terrorists. What do we do with those? If something should \nhappen--and, of course, the President came out with two edicts. One was \nto suspend legal proceedings at this time, which the judge down there \nhas rejected, so they are continuing. The other is to close Guantanamo \nBay within 12 months.\n  The reason the second one is not workable is because you have to \nfigure out what to do with all these detainees. I don't know of one \nSenator on the floor who would like them sent to his or her State. I \nknow they have come up with some 17 institutions, one of which is in my \nState of Oklahoma, where they could relocate these detainees. That \nbecomes a terrorist target. It is something that is not acceptable.\n  All the amendment does, which I am hoping we get cleared before too \nlong, is to prohibit the use of funds in this stimulus bill to transfer \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay to any facility in the United States or \nto construct any facility for such detainees in the United States.\n  When I say that, it will be necessary to do it. The courtroom down in \nGuantanamo Bay cost $12 million to build. It took a year to get it \nbuilt. Because of the sensitive nature of the information, they cannot \nbe tried in a normal court facility. This would preclude funds from \nbeing allocated toward the relocation of those detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay to any of the Continental United States areas.\n  With that, I serve notice I would like to get others to look at this \namendment very carefully. This may be the\n\n[[Page S1500]]\n\nonly opportunity they have to ensure their State is not flooded with \ndetainees, with terrorists, and create the problems we all know would \ncome from that transfer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand there are roughly 10 \namendments pending. There is understandable concern about calling up \nadditional amendments at this time. If I am mistaken, I am more than \nhappy to call up my amendment. Failing that, for the time being, I \nwould like to talk a little bit about it.\n  I believe it is important we pass a true stimulus package quickly. \nAcross the Nation, we know millions of families and small businesses \nare suffering from the economic crisis in which we find ourselves. Many \nof these small businesses feel like families, and they are faced, of \ncourse, with tough choices.\n  Yesterday the New York Times featured a story about a small direct \nmail firm in Bellaire, TX, just outside Houston. Fewer orders combined \nwith rising health care costs will force this firm to cut staff or cut \nbenefits unless the economy turns around soon. So we must act quickly, \nbut we must act wisely.\n  I don't believe the pending bill on the floor today meets that latter \npart of my criteria, a wise bill. The most recent Gallup poll I have \nseen said only 37 percent of the people in the polling sample believe \nthe current bill would actually help stimulate the economy in a \npositive way. In the meantime, we would see in excess of $1 trillion of \nadditional new deficit spending passed on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  We have to not only act quickly, but we have to act wisely. We have \nto deliver a stimulus plan that will immediately benefit America's \nfamilies and small businesses. We have to avoid, as well, repeating \nmistakes of the past that failed to stimulate the economy--and I will \ntalk about that more in just a moment--and we have to resist the \ntemptation, which is all too common in Washington, DC, of trying to \nfund everybody's wish list. We know that wish list goes on and on \nwithout end, and we need to set the right priorities, the same thing \nfamilies have to do every day.\n  I believe one of the best ways we can stimulate our economy is to \nprovide true tax relief to everybody who pays taxes. Rather than \nreprocessing those tax dollars by having Washington redistribute them \nto the winners and losers in the political process, why not let the \npeople who earn the money keep more of it. We know that is a lot more \nefficient.\n  As we have seen, the new chairwoman of President Obama's Council of \nEconomic Advisers, Christina Romer, along with her husband, did a \nstudy--she is a real, live economist. We hear economist for this, \neconomist for that. Many are nameless and faceless. I thought how \ninteresting it would be, instead of citing unnamed economists, if you \njust plugged in the word ``lawyer'' or let's say ``veterinarians.'' \nVeterinarians believe this, lawyers believe that. We wouldn't accept \nthat at face value. We would want to know what it was and whether it \nwas credible and what they are talking about. Because we know there are \neconomists who disagree with each other, and it is plain silly to \nsuggest that among economists there is any consensus on these \nunprecedented times we find ourselves in.\n\n  But there are two economists--Christina Romer and her husband, she \nbeing the most recent chairwoman of President Obama's Council of \nEconomic Advisers--who found in a study they published in 2007 that a \ntax cut of 1 percent of GDP generates real output by about 3 percent \nover the following 3 years, a 1-to-3 ratio. Now, that strikes me as a \nlot better than some of what I have seen in terms of the stimulative \neffect in spending, which is roughly for every $1 spent, you may get a \n1.5-percent increase in growth.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 277 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. President, I just received a note from staff that indicates it is \nall right to go ahead and call up my amendment.\n  Let me pause, Mr. President, and call up my amendment No. 277 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Is there objection to setting \naside the pending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 277 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To reduce income taxes for all working taxpayers)\n\n       Beginning on page 435, strike line 4 and all that follows \n     through page 441, line 15, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1001. REDUCTION IN 10-PERCENT RATE BRACKET FOR 2009 AND \n                   2010.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 1(i) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Reduced rate for 2009 and 2010.--In the case of any \n     taxable year beginning in 2009 or 2010--\n       ``(i) In general.--Subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied by \n     substituting `5 percent' for `10 percent'.\n       ``(ii) Rules for applying certain other provisions.--\n\n       ``(I) Subsection (g)(7)(B)(ii)(II) shall be applied by \n     substituting `5 percent' for `10 percent'.\n       ``(II) Section 3402(p)(2) shall be applied by substituting \n     `5 percent' for `10 percent'.''.\n\n       (b) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall \n     apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008.\n       (2) Withholding provisions.--Subclause (II) of section \n     1(i)(1)(D)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added \n     by subsection (a), shall apply to amounts paid after the 60th \n     day after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, simply stated, the amendment I offer today \nis based on the experience of what works. We have been presented all \nsorts of economic theories, some of which I have even bought into \nbecause I thought the smartest people on the planet knew more than I \ndid, and perhaps I had to have faith in some of these smart people. But \nwe know based on experience, not just based on faith, that this \namendment will work to stimulate the economy.\n  This amendment cuts the income tax rate in the lowest tax bracket \nfrom 10 percent to 5 percent, so it will immediately help some of the \npeople who earn the least amount of money in our society, and it will \nin fact help all working Americans immediately. Currently, married \ncouples pay a 10-percent tax on income up to $16,050, which is roughly \n$8,000 for a single tax return. They pay a 10-percent tax on that now, \nand my amendment would cut it to 5 percent. That would put about $500 \nper year back into the family budget, or roughly the same amount as the \nprovisions in the current bill known as the ``Making Work Pay'' \nrefundable tax credit. And I will talk about that in a minute. But this \namendment would provide meaningful tax relief to more than 105 million \nAmericans--to everyone who must file a tax return by April 15.\n  This amendment would provide an immediate economic stimulus and jolt \nto our economy and would show the American people and the global \nfinancial community that we are serious about delivering an economic \nstimulus that will actually work. Isn't that the first question we \nought to ask: Will it work? This one will work, because experience \nproves it. This amendment will cut the size of this $1 trillion bill by \nabout $25 billion because it replaces the so-called ``Making Work Pay'' \nrefundable tax credit.\n  Now, the refundable tax credit, so everybody understands, is not like \nthe usual credit against income. This is cash money paid by the Federal \nGovernment to a person whether they pay income taxes or not. In fact, \nwhat it amounts to is taking money from people who do pay taxes and \ngiving it to people who don't necessarily pay taxes. It represents a \nhuge transfer of wealth. But even worse, in this bill it represents a \nrepetition of the failed stimulus bill that we voted on roughly 1 year \nago.\n  I am sorry to say now I was one of those votes in favor of that \nstimulus bill. That is in the category of what I described earlier, \nwhere I believed the smartest people on the planet were telling us we \nhad to spend this $150 billion-plus. And we had bipartisan support for \nthe bill. We borrowed $150 billion or so from our children and \ngrandchildren. In other words, we added it to\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nthe Federal deficit. You know what kind of impact it had? It had zero, \nzip, nada, no impact on the economy, other than to rack up another $150 \nbillion in debt for our children.\n  So this refundable tax credit, if passed in its current form, \nrepresents a repetition of what we know will not work and which will in \nfact make our economic situation worse. It will represent a $46 billion \ntransfer of wealth to folks who don't pay income taxes in the first \nplace. We should provide tax relief in a straightforward and \ntransparent way to all taxpayers who owe income taxes. In other words, \nthis amendment is about providing tax relief for taxpayers which, \naccording to Ms. Romer, is the most efficient way to get our economy \nmoving again, and one that will not pick winners and losers here in \nWashington, DC, after Congress takes its cut, but allows it to be kept \nby the people who earned it in the first place.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment when we have an \nopportunity to vote on it later on. This is, once again, amendment No. \n277, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 242 to Amendment No. 98\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 242.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 242 to amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to suspend for \n2009 the 1993 income tax increase on Social Security benefits, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       On page 570, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. TEMPORARY REPEAL OF 1993 INCOME TAX INCREASE ON \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 86(a) (relating \n     to social security and tier 1 railroad retirement benefits) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new flush \n     sentence:\n     ``This paragraph shall not apply to any taxable year \n     beginning in 2009.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2008.\n       (c) Maintenance of Transfers to Hospital Insurance Trust \n     Fund.--There are hereby appropriated to the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund established under section 1817 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) amounts equal to the \n     reduction in revenues to the Treasury by reason of the \n     amendment made by subsection (a).

Mr. President, I have three amendments. Since there are \nso many amendments, I am going to only offer one at this time. It is an \namendment I have offered on the floor numerous times on major bills. It \nhas something to do with a serious problem that 12 million American \nseniors face every year. My amendment puts more dollars in seniors' \nwallets, which will hopefully stimulate the economy by giving them more \nexpendable income.\n  My amendment would suspend for just 1 year, the year 2009, the \nincreased tax on Social Security benefits that Congress passed in 1993. \nI have been a strong advocate for eliminating this tax entirely for \nmany years. My amendment would give seniors a 1-year break from this \nunfair and punitive tax.\n  Let me start with a little background. Historically, Social Security \nbenefits were not taxed by the Federal Government at all. However, in \n1983, the Nation was facing an immediate shortfall in the Social \nSecurity Program, with the trust funds possibly running out of money in \nthe next couple years. Acting on the recommendations of the Greenspan \ncommission, Congress passed a law in 1983 that began taxing Social \nSecurity benefits for the first time. The new law required that 50 \npercent of a senior's Social Security benefit or Railroad Retirement \nbenefit be taxed if his or her income was above $25,000 or $32,000 for \nmarried couples. This tax, over the past 26 years, has been dedicated \nto shoring up the Social Security system or the Railroad Retirement \nsystem.\n  In 1993, when I was a member of the Ways and Means Committee in the \nHouse, Congress was faced with a similar problem. This time it was the \nMedicare trust fund that was going broke. Once again, Congress called \non American seniors to help fix this program by instituting another \nadditional tax on Social Security benefits. In 1993, Congress passed a \nlaw that required 85 percent of a senior's Social Security benefit be \ntaxed if their income was $34,000 for a single person or $44,000 for a \ncouple.\n  As a Member of the House in 1993, I thought this tax increase was \ngrossly unfair to our senior citizens. On one hand we tell seniors to \nplan for retirement and on the other hand we tax them for doing that. \nCRS estimates that there are 12 million seniors paying this tax on 85 \npercent of their Social Security benefits.\n  Also, since the income levels are not indexed to inflation, many more \nseniors become burdened each year as we go forward and inflation rises.\n  My amendment is very simple. It gives seniors a break for 1 year from \npaying this tax. While I would love to see this tax permanently \nrepealed, suspending it for 1 year is a start and a stimulus to get \nmoney into the pockets of our senior citizens so they can help \nstimulate the economy. It would help do it immediately, by allowing \nmillions of seniors to keep more of their Social Security benefits. \nWith wild fluctuations in gas prices and increases in health care and \nfood costs, this tax relief could make a difference to millions of \nseniors across this country.\n  The amendment holds the Medicare trust fund harmless so the solvency \nof Medicare is not jeopardized. The amendment is paid for by reducing \ndiscretionary spending in the bill, except spending for veterans.\n  In the past, many of my Senate colleagues have supported sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments to remove this unfair tax. Today, Senators will \nhave an opportunity to vote on actually giving seniors relief and \nremoving this unfair tax for just 1 year, 2009. It is the fair thing to \ndo. I hope my colleagues can support this amendment and support over 12 \nmillion seniors who are forced to pay this unfair tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \noffering his amendment. There are 14, I believe, maybe 15, pending \namendments to this bill. I think it is healthy. It means we are \nactively debating this issue and getting suggestions from Democrats and \nRepublicans about ways to change it.\n  But let's remember why we are here. This is H.R. 1, the first bill of \nthe session. It is the bill, in terms of priority, that has the highest \npriority for the President of the United States and for the Nation. It \nis the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n  It has been only 2 weeks now since we swore in a new President, the \n44th President of the United States. He comes to this office, I \nbelieve, with extraordinary talents and potential. But he also comes \nfacing some of the most serious challenges any President has faced in \n75 years. You have to go back to Franklin Roosevelt, in 1933, and the \nGreat Depression to find another time in American history that was any \nmore challenging than what we face today. I think most Americans know \nwhat we are talking about.\n  We found, for the gross domestic product; that is, the production of\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\ngoods and services in America, our growth in that area has started to \ndecline for the first time in 25 years. We have found that unemployment \nrates are higher than they have been in 15 or 20 years--in some places \neven worse. Ask the average person or family member: Does this affect \nyou? And they will say, of course, it does. My savings for my \nretirement are not what they used to be. I have lost a lot. I had \nplanned on a life of comfort and security and now I am not sure.\n  How about your home? For most people it is the most important asset \nin their life. Even if you are paying your mortgage payment, your home \nvalue has been going down in most communities across America. People \nunderstand, too, that many of their neighbors are losing their homes to \nforeclosure. Some of these are hard-working families who have played by \nthe rules and all of a sudden the world is upside-down. The principal \nthey owe on their mortgage is more than the value of their home.\n  Ask people about jobs, about all the jobs we have lost across \nAmerica--half a million jobs in December, even more in the month of \nJanuary. As we lose more and more jobs, of course, people face \nhardships. Part of our effort is to try to find a way to help them, \nprovide a safety net, to give them a helping hand--as we should.\n  Let me tell you what President Obama's proposal means to America. \nFirst, we are going to try to help those people who are suffering. For \nthose on unemployment right now, many of these people have been \nstretched to the absolute limit. Imagine losing your job and trying to \nkeep your family together and make the utility bill payments and not \nlose the house--in the hopes that this is going to turn around and you \nwill find another job. We provide an additional help to them. It is not \na lot. I would like to give more, but it means more money in \nunemployment relief for these families.\n  The second thing we find is that as soon as you lose your job, guess \nwhat happens next. You lose your health insurance. There is a program \ncalled COBRA where you can turn around and buy health insurance, but \ntake a look at the price. The price is dramatically larger than you \npaid as an employee, if you had coverage at your workplace. So we try \nto extend health insurance for these families. Shouldn't we, for the \nmillions of Americans who are out of work, give them a little more to \nlive on and a little helping hand when it comes to the paying of their \nhealth insurance? That is not just humane; if you are looking at the \npure economics of it, trust me, those unemployed families with an extra \nfew dollars a week are going to spend this money back into this \neconomy, keeping their families together.\n  Then we take a look at what we need to do to get this economy moving \nforward. President Obama said the first thing we need to do is to give \nworking families, middle-income families, a helping hand. Tax policy \nover the last 8 years has been geared primarily, most of the breaks, to \nthe wealthiest people in America. But the folks who have been falling \nbehind are those whose wages didn't keep up. The cost of living kept \nup, but their wages didn't keep up. President Obama says, as part of \nour recovery plan, let's give a helping hand, $500 to an individual, \n$1,000 to a family, at least so that these working families can pay \ntheir bills and maybe try to get ahead a little bit. That, to me, is a \nsensible economic recovery.\n  Wouldn't we start at the base of America, the strength of America, \nthe families of America, and make sure they get the first helping hand, \nafter we have taken care of those who lost their jobs, through \nunemployment? That is part of it.\n  He also has asked us, in the Obama plan: Help businesses, small \nbusinesses in particular, because they are the bedrock of the American \neconomy. They create most of the jobs. They are the most vulnerable. We \nhave seen it happen. We get the announcements of the big companies that \nare laying off thousands of workers: 20,000 at Caterpillar, thousands \nat Starbucks and INTEL and the list goes on and on. But it is the small \njob in the mall or downtown that lays off a worker or goes out of \nbusiness--then we start losing jobs that way. The President has \nproposed in his tax package, let's allow these businesses to write off \ntheir losses and apply them to previous years' tax liability. Give them \na helping hand. If they want to buy things that might expand their \nbusinesses, let's encourage them, give them more of a tax writeoff. So \nwe build this into the program here as well. I think these are all \nsolid investments in people who are struggling with unemployment and \nmiddle-income families finding it hard to pay their bills and small \nbusinesses that are vulnerable to a weak economy.\n  Then the President goes a step further and the President says: Let's \nnow create jobs, let's invest in America in a way that is going to \nbuild America's economy for decades to come. He has identified several \nareas of importance that I think will meet the test of time and I hope \nwill meet the approval of my colleagues.\n  The first thing he says is energy. We know, as long as we are \ncaptives of foreign oil producers who can run the price of gasoline up \nto $4.50 next week and back down again to $2.50 a month later, it is \ntough to build an economy.\n  So President Obama has told us, as part of this, build into this \nenergy-related investments, the kinds of things that make sense, \nresearch in areas that will give us energy capability.\n  We can't build an American economy without energy. Let's build it \nwith homegrown energy, energy that uses our creativity and our \nresources and builds on them.\n  He also said: Let's take a look at our schools, let's take a look at \nour Government buildings, and if the energy is going out through cracks \nin the windows and the doors, let's do something about it--more energy \nefficiency.\n  That is a good investment. That is going to pay itself back over a \nperiod of time.\n  Secondly, there is this whole element of health care. We know that \none of the crucial elements in our daily lives is the protection of \nhealth insurance, and we know the cost of that insurance and the cost \nof medical care continue to rise.\n  What President Obama has made part of this is something that is the \nmost important single downpayment to health care reform. He believes we \nshould start moving as a nation to put our medical records on computers \nso that we have technology that has my medical records, the records of \nmy family, so that when you go to the hospital, the doctors who are \nthere and the nurses who are there have access to solid available \ninformation. They are not going through pages hoping they don't miss \none. It is going to mean that there will be more affordable health \ncare, and it will be safer health care. That makes sense. That is a \ngood investment.\n  The third element is education. What the President has said as part \nof his proposal here is that we need to start building--by building, \nputting people to work--we need to start building the laboratories, the \nlibraries, and the classrooms of the 21st century.\n  Let's be honest about this. America is as ingenious, innovative, and \ncreative as any nation on earth. But the reason we are is because our \nschools prepare our children to meet that challenge and to lead. That \nis part of the investment of this bill.\n  Overall, what the President is asking us to do is to do our very best \ntoday to invest about $900 billion--a huge sum of money, I do not doubt \nthat--so at the end of the day we will have saved or created 3 to 4 \nmillion jobs.\n  My friends, some of them on the other side of the aisle, say that is \nway too much money, $900 billion. This $900 billion represents about \n6.5 percent of the gross domestic product of America. So you say: Is \nthat enough? Is that enough of a catalyst? Most of the economists say: \nErr on the side of providing enough water to put out the fire. Don't \nput so little on it that you will have to revisit that conflagration \ntomorrow. And if you follow the lead of some who want to cut back the \nsize of this program substantially, every time they cut back the size \nof it, they will cut back the number of jobs we will be creating in \nAmerica at a time when we desperately need more jobs.\n  We expect to lose in economic activity in America $1 trillion a year \nbecause of this recession. What we are putting back over 2 years, this \n$900 billion, means we are about at half of what we are going to lose. \nWe are going to put some $450 billion of economic spending into an \neconomy that is losing $1 trillion in activity. So we are\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\nnot even keeping up with what the recession is doing to us. So those \nwho want to cut this back dramatically, I can tell you, sadly, if they \nhave their way, we will be back here again.\n  You remember last year, President Bush said to us: I think the \neconomy is weak, and I know how to solve the problem. Tax cuts will do \nit. And he asked us, the Democratic Congress, to give the Republican \nPresident $150 billion in tax cuts. And we did. Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, worked to deliver a bill, a \nbipartisan bill, focusing on tax cuts.\n  If you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they \nbelieve this is the answer to every ill. If the economy is flourishing, \nmore tax cuts; if the economy is struggling, more tax cuts. Well, tax \ncuts have their place, and they are a part of this, but they are not \nthe complete answer. We learned that when we put $150 billion into the \neconomy in tax cuts last April, I believe it was, and it did not have \nthe kind of positive impact we expected on our economy.\n  The point I want to get to is this: We have to act, and we have to \nact now. Sure, we should have this debate on the amendments. Some will \nprevail, some will not. But at the end of the day, the American people \nwill not accept as a final verdict that the Senate did nothing. They \nwill find it absolutely unacceptable that one of the worst economic \ncrises in America was met with political resistance. They want us to \nwork together. And we should.\n  I am open--I believe most Democrats are--to good ideas and good \nsuggestions, and a lot of our colleagues are, in good faith, working \ntoward that end. But there is one basic thing we should remember: When \nwe get down to the bottom line, most of the critics of this program, \nthis $900 billion program, when you add up the total amount of their \ncriticism, it is less than 1 percent--less than 1 percent.\n  Well, let's try to cure that 1 percent. Let's do our best to make \nsure we do. But let's not walk away from this challenge. Let's not walk \naway from this crisis because we find in some paragraph in here \nsomething to which we object.\n  If there were ever a time when the American people expect us to rise \nto the occasion, to stand with President Obama and try to turn this \neconomy around, this is the time. I would say to my colleagues, let's \nget it done this week. We need to tell America first--and the world--\nthat we are not going to stand back and be victimized by this economy. \nWe are going to use every talent, every tool we can to get this \nAmerican economy moving again for the workers and families and \nbusinesses that count on us so much.\n  In the Senate, it is easy to get something lost in the debate and end \nup doing nothing. That is the one thing that is prevalent in the Senate \ntoo many times. But this is different. This is a historic challenge.\n  I hope Senators from both sides of the aisle will work in good faith \nto find a way to put together a product that will ultimately serve this \ncountry and serve it well. Two-thirds of the American people now say \nthey support this plan. They do not believe it is the last thing we are \ngoing to do, and they sure do not believe the economy is going to be \ncured in weeks or months; it may take us longer. But we need to start \nworking together and give this our best effort. We need to follow on \nfrom this doing something about the housing market, mortgage \nforeclosures, people who are underwater with their own home mortgages, \nfolks who will not consider buying a home because of the uncertainty of \nthe economy. That is absolutely a priority. It may not be included in \nthis bill. Perhaps it will be. But that is a priority we should turn to \nnext.\n  Then we need to look at these financial institutions.\n  Make no mistake about it, when this Bernard Madoff is found guilty of \na Ponzi scheme, people are wondering whether he will go to jail. I am \nnot going to say whether he should or should not. He needs to be held \naccountable for what he did. A lot of innocent people lost a lot of \nmoney because of what he did. He needs to be held accountable.\n  What about the financial institutions that brought us to this moment \nin American economic history? I think we need accountability there too. \nWe need to make sure these executives do not run off with millions of \ndollars in bonuses, capitalizing on the taxpayers' money, ignoring the \nfact that they failed in their business missions. We need to have a \ngood, strong law in that regard too.\n  We need to have proper oversight and regulation of financial \ninstitutions so America never goes down this road again. That is our \nresponsibility on our watch.\n  I sincerely hope both sides of the aisle will make it their business \nto get it done this week so the American people understand that we get \nit, we understand the severity of the crisis we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some comments \nthat were made about the----\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if there was an arrangement that I am \nunaware of, I would defer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we try to be evenhanded and fair and \nbalanced here. We have had a gentleman's agreement that we alternate \nsides on speakers. Since the Senator from Illinois last spoke, I think \nit is only fair and appropriate that we rotate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was unaware of that, and I defer to my \nfriend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will not take too long because I know there are other \nSenators waiting to speak.\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think the \npending amendments would have to be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We already have 16 amendments lined up in the queue. It \nis going to be a very late night tonight because of that great number \nof amendments.\n  I was wondering, I would be more than willing to work out an \narrangement where the Senator's amendment can be the next one available \nafter our votes tonight, the first Republican amendment tomorrow. I \nhave to draw the line somewhere here; otherwise, we would keep going. I \nrenew my offer to make it the first amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be pleased to accommodate the manager, who has \nbeen very accommodating to this side of the aisle, and he just \ndemonstrated that. So I would be glad, if it is agreeable to the \nmanager to allow me to propose the amendment now. Then I would be glad \nto ask for a vote on it at the convenience of the managers of the bill \nso that it is most convenient for them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would prefer that you offer the \namendment after we dispose of the 16 tonight.\n  Then we can agree by unanimous consent that it would be the first one \nup.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could ask unanimous consent that I would be the \nfirst amendment considered tomorrow.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will withhold proposing the amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that my amendment be allowed to be filed and \nconsidered at the beginning of legislative work tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So far, I have to object, and I have to figure out why. I \nmight say to my good friend, in order to get order here, they are \ntelling me we are coming in at 9:30 tomorrow morning. I know the \nSenator, a former military man, is used to early hours.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Whatever the floor staff wishes, as well as the manager. \nBy the way, I say that with great respect to the staff on the floor who \nare making this machine, this unwieldy machine, run in the most \nefficient fashion.\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will withhold until tomorrow morning, \naccording to the unanimous consent agreement, and file the amendment \nand ask for its consideration at 9:30 a.m.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Or whenever we come into session tomorrow morning. We \nexpect to be in about 9:30. There may be some leader time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to keep the floor, if I can, \nfor a couple of minutes.\n  Basically, tomorrow morning we will be considering this amendment. I \nwould like to say a few words because this is a proposal that I think \nshould be considered, along with the legislation that is pending. It is \na compilation of what we believe is the most effective way to address \nthe stimulus and job creation. It has tax provisions, such as \nelimination of the 3.1-percent payroll tax for all employees for 1 \nyear. It lowers the 10-percent tax bracket to 5 percent; lowers the 15-\npercent tax bracket to 10 percent; lowers the corporate tax bracket \nfrom 35 to 25 percent and has accelerated depreciation for capital \ninvestments for small business; the extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits; extension of food stamps, unemployment insurance benefits, \ntax-free training and employment services, as well as keeping families \nin their homes through a loan modification program. It has tax \nincentives for home purchases and GSE-FHA conforming loan limits; \nnational infrastructure and defense, which is very badly needed; \ntransportation infrastructure; and also contains the trigger that is \nalso the subject of a separate amendment I have proposed, with a total \nof about $420 billion.\n  Now, I know my friend from Wisconsin is waiting patiently, but I \nwould like to point out where I think we are at this moment; that is, \nwe basically have legislation which is too big, which is not \nstimulative, and which does not create jobs. The American people are \nbeginning to figure it out. In fact, polling numbers in the last couple \nof days have shown a significant shift in American public opinion \nbecause they are beginning to examine this proposal.\n  I argue that it is time we sit down, Republicans and Democrats, and \nbegin good-faith negotiations to create a real job creation and \nstimulus package. I think it would be unfortunate if this body passed, \non a party-line basis or largely party-line basis, this package in \nsimilar fashion as it did in the other body.\n  I think we have a proposal here that deserves consideration, but I \nalso think it is time that we had serious negotiations to try to reach \nsome kind of consensus on a package and legislation that truly \nstimulates and truly creates jobs.\n  My colleague from Arizona will be pointing out, as many others have, \nthat there are many programs here, moneys in the hundreds of millions \nand billions, that simply do not meet any criteria for job creation: \n$75 million for smoking cessation; $150 million for honeybee insurance. \nThe list goes on and on. We also have an obligation to future \ngenerations to understand that $1.2 trillion, followed by another TARP, \nfollowed by an omnibus appropriations bill, requires us to put this \ncountry, once the economy recovers, back on the path to a balanced \nbudget and reduce spending across the board once our economy has \nrecovered.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, the distinguished manager of the \nbill, for his consideration on my amendment. I thank my colleague from \nWisconsin, as always.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks by the \nSenator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 140\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to respond to some comments \nthat were made about the amendment I am offering with Senator McCain \nand others. Just to remind my colleagues, our amendment creates a point \nof order against unauthorized earmarks in appropriations bills. Again, \nit applies to unauthorized earmarks. If a provision is not both an \nearmark, as defined by the Senate Rule 44, and unauthorized, this point \nof order does not apply.\n  For the purposes of this amendment, we consider a program to have \nbeen authorized even if that authorization has only passed the Senate \nduring the same Congress as the proposed spending item.\n  Moreover, as a safeguard we have taken care to also exempt programs \nthat may have had their authorization lapse, but which are clearly \nneeded and are included in the President's budget request.\n  The Senator from Hawaii noted, for example, that we haven't \nconsidered an Intelligence authorization bill for some time, or a \nForeign Operations and State Department authorization bill. He argued \nthat the programs covered by those lapsed authorizations, or programs \nthat have never been authorized, would be subject to this point of \norder.\n  They would not be subject to the point of order established by this \namendment.\n  First, to my knowledge, few if any of the programs under those \nmeasures would be considered ``congressionally directed spending,'' and \nthus they could be funded without this point of order applying. Second, \nprograms covered by those authorizing measures are typically included \nin the President's budget request whether or not the authorization has \nlapsed and, as such, are fully exempt from this point of order.\n  Let me reiterate, in order to be subject to our point of order, the \nprogram must be an earmark; that is, ``congressionally directed \nspending'' as defined in Senate rules, and it must not be authorized or \nincluded in the President's budget request.\n  The Senator from Hawaii used the specter of an authorization bill \nbeing filibustered to stop the ability of Congress to use its power of \nthe purse as an argument against this amendment. Once again, if a \nprogram is not considered to be ``congressionally directed spending'' \nit will never be subject to this point of order, and Congress is free \nto fund it or not as it sees fit.\n  The Senator from Hawaii also raised the concern that this amendment \ncreates a point of order against unauthorized earmarks added to \nconference reports. Darn right it does. We shouldn't be adding earmarks \nto conference reports. Under the amendment, if a point of order is \nsustained against a provision in a conference report, that provision \nwould be stricken, but the legislative process would continue with no \nmore potential roadblocks than exist currently. The conference report \nwould revert to a nonamendable Senate amendment, which would be the \nconference agreement without the objectionable material, and the \nmeasure could then be sent back to the House. It won't tie the two \nHouses up in knots, as the Senator from Hawaii suggested. The House \nwill accept the Senate amendment or it won't. If the House makes a \nfurther change, the Senate can consider it. That is the regular order \nof business around here. The best way to avoid this issue is not to \nslip earmarks into conference reports.\n  The argument was also made that if our amendment was adopted, then \nauthorizers would have the power to earmark, but no one else. This \namendment doesn't give the power to earmark to anyone. All it does is \nreturn the Senate to what should be the proper way to consider special \ninterest spending. If you want some special project for your State or \ndistrict, the authorizing committee of jurisdiction should review it, \nand legislation authorizing it should pass both Houses and be signed \ninto law. That is the regular scrutiny we should require of special \ninterest spending. Then the Appropriations Committee can decide whether \nand at what level to fund the authorized program. That is the way the \nsystem is supposed to work. Unfortunately, we now have an alternative, \nshort-cut process, whereby Members stick spending provisions into \nappropriations bills without any scrutiny whatsoever. That is a recipe \nfor waste, fraud and abuse.\n  I have great respect for the Senator from Hawaii, and I appreciate \nhis willingness to debate my proposal on the merits. I wish more of my \ncolleagues were willing to have this kind of public discussion about \nearmarks. But I disagree with his arguments. This is a sensible \namendment. It will put some teeth into the earmark rules we adopted in \nthe last Congress. As we consider\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\na bill that proposes to increase our debt to the tune of $800 billion, \nwe should be doing all we can to assure our constituents that their \nmoney is not being wasted on pork-barrel spending. One way we can do \nthat is to pass the Feingold-McCain-McCaskill amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in \nthe February 4 edition of the Arizona Republic be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I will refer to that editorial, because it sets the stage \nfor what we need to do to fix this bill. The Gallup poll yesterday said \nthat 56 percent of Americans believe that either this bill should not \nbe passed or that it should require major changes before it is passed. \nThat is not only what most American people believe but also what most \nof the people on the Republican side of the aisle believe and I know \nsome Members on the other side as well.\n  This editorial is titled ``Senators should just start over in fixing \nfiscal mess.''\n  They say:\n\n       Far too much of the stimulus bill is simply unserious as \n     ``economic stimulus.'' The Senate would do us all a great \n     favor if it started again from scratch.\n\n  In a different part they write:\n\n       When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the stimulus \n     bill in its original configuration, it found that just 25 \n     percent of its content might have any effect on the economy \n     this year.\n       A similar analysis by the Wall Street Journal concluded \n     that just 12 cents of every dollar spent would have a chance \n     to create immediate stimulus.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       Make the measure look like a stimulus package rather than a \n     pork package.\n\n  That is what most of us believe we should do. You build the bill from \nthe bottom up. What actually stimulates the economy, what actually \ncreates jobs, you put that in the program. There may be a place for \nextending unemployment benefits, though that probably should be in a \nseparate bill, because it is clearly not stimulative even though it \nhelps people who are hurting. I doubt that there would be any objection \nto doing it. But we ought to focus the stimulus on exactly that; \nOtherwise the American people are going to be cynical when they look at \na bill that is $1.3 trillion in size, and the experts are saying a very \nsmall percentage of that actually does anything to create jobs or \nstimulate the economy.\n  Let's go back to last December. In the Washington Post, Lawrence \nSummers, head of the President's National Economic Council, said:\n\n       Investments will be chosen strategically based on what \n     yields the highest rate of return for the economy.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, projects that in fiscal \nyear 2009, the deficit is going to total $1.2 trillion, and that \ndoesn't include any of this stimulus bill which is about $1.3 trillion. \nAdd those two together, we are talking about $2.5 trillion. So we need \nto take Lawrence Summers' advice and only spend money that will yield \nthe highest rate of return for the economy. If we do that in building \nthis bill from the bottom, we can actually do something that is great \nfor the American people and still not be wasting taxpayer money. It \nmight take 2 or 3 more days, but this is the most important economic \nbill this Congress will have considered in decades. It is the biggest \nbill in the history of the United States. We spent yesterday, Tuesday, \non it, today, tomorrow, probably Friday, perhaps Saturday. We spent 5 \nweeks on an energy bill a couple years ago. Surely on a bill of this \nmagnitude and with the emergency facing the country, if it takes us 3 \nor 4 more days to do it right, we ought to do it right. That means \nconstructed from the bottom up with things we know will stimulate the \neconomy and create jobs, not just fulfill campaign promises, not just \nmake good on 8 years of things we wanted to spend money on but have not \nbeen able to find any other bill to stick it in until we got to this \nbill. Let's try to do this in a bipartisan way that will achieve the \nobjective.\n  The President himself, on Super Bowl Sunday, in a nationally \ntelevised interview on NBC, said:\n\n       There will be no earmarks in the bill.\n\n  He said he is going to be trimming out things that are not relevant \nto putting people back to work right now. My guess is he is fairly \nembarrassed with a lot of the earmarks that are in the bill. Most of my \nDemocratic colleagues are meeting now. I hope they are talking about \nwhat can be eliminated from this bill, what kind of earmarks or \nwasteful spending can be eliminated from the bill. It has become an \nembarrassment. We would be very happy to have them join in some of our \namendments which will eliminate that spending.\n  Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, knows what he is \ntalking about in these matters. He told Fox News:\n\n       There are other areas of the package that are really very \n     questionable in terms of whether they would stimulate the \n     economy. Some of the programs that are given money only have \n     10 percent spend out in the next two years.\n\n  He is correct on that. On the same day Senator Dorgan also commented \nto Fox News that ``major chunks of the package do not spend out for \nyears which is problematic.''\n  We all agree. We ought to start over and start by eliminating these \nprograms. If we do that, then we can meet an objective which is far \nhigher than either 12 percent or 25 percent in terms of the money we \nspend that will actually provide new jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, says only 12 percent of \nthe discretionary spending in the bill will be spent by the end of this \nyear and that less than half of the total of the discretionary money \nwill be spent by the end of the following year. So more than half of \nthe bill starts spending in the year 2011. I hope the recession is over \nby 2011. If it is not, obviously, we can look at that time to see \nwhether we need more stimulus. But having stimulus for 2 years, that is \na pretty long time to be stimulating. Let's adopt the McCain idea that \nafter 2 years we take a pause and see what else we might need to do. We \ncould probably save a lot of money. We would make wiser decisions, and \nwe would be stimulating in the short term which is what we want to do.\n  The President's Chief of Staff said last year: You never want to \nwaste a crisis. He was referring to the use of a crisis such as this to \naccomplish certain good. He was talking about reform ideas and so on. \nBut we have to be careful that others aren't using this as an excuse to \nput spending in a bill that has been pent up for 8 years, that some of \nour colleagues wish to have done but haven't found a vehicle to carry \nit and, thus, stick it in this bill. That is what the American people \nare so upset about.\n  If we will solve this problem, the American people will be a lot more \ngenerous in their support for the other things we want to do. I have \ntalked about some examples. I don't want to go through a laundry list. \nA lot of this is oriented to Washington, DC: $9 billion for a Federal \nbuildings fund; more money to help the auto companies, $600 million to \nbuy more cars for Government employees; $248 million for USDA \nfacilities modernization; $34 million to spruce up the Commerce \nDepartment headquarters; $125 million for the DC sewer system. All of \nthese may well be important things to do. You can't argue that they are \ndirectly stimulative, though some people will have to do the work \nassociated with them. But we have no idea whether these things are \nready to go, whether they can be done in the first 2 years, or whether \nthese are things that actually will be spent, as will the majority of \nthe money, in the 2 years after 2010.\n  In any event, we have a process, as Senator Cochran, the ranking \nmember on the Appropriations Committee, has said, that enables us to \nvet all of this spending and prioritize it so we put the most helpful \nspending first, and those things that are not as justified then fall \nout of the spending for this year and maybe come back next year. But it \nis our way of determining what we really want to do as a country that, \nobviously, cannot just have everything we want, and we cannot pay for \nsimply everything. So, as Senator Cochran said, we have the \nresponsibility to be deliberate and consider these items\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\ncarefully in the context of the President's formal budget request. It \nis a matter of making tough decisions, and I would hope we could do \nthat.\n  Now, let's assume--because I am sure our Democratic colleagues will \nagree to eliminate some of these wasteful programs--we still have the \nproblem that if the money is not reduced, then the money is still in \nthe bill to be spent by somebody somewhere. So it is not just a matter \nof taking earmarks out, but it is a matter of eliminating the funding \ncategories those earmarks are in, or as soon as we authorize the money, \nit will come right back in and we will have the same projects.\n  In this regard, I am very troubled by programs that would fund \ndirectly States and local governments because we have seen the lists \nthey have sent to us--their wish list of things they would like to get. \nIf we simply strike the exact delineation of where they want some of \nthis money to go but leave the pot of money there, I ask you, where is \nit going to be spent? It will not take 5 minutes for them to get that \nlist back out, put it on the table, and start going to town.\n  Just some general categories here:\n  There is $16 billion to repair and build schools. That has always \nbeen a local school function. It is not a Federal function.\n  There is $5.5 billion for a brandnew discretionary program on \ntransportation.\n  There is $2.25 billion for a neighborhood stabilization program. That \nis the same kind of program that would have made funding available for \ngroups such as ACORN that we took out of the housing bill in June of \nlast year. I do not think people want this kind of money going to ACORN \nor groups like that.\n  There is $500 million to upgrade fire stations. I know all our local \nfire departments would love to have money to upgrade their fire \nstations. Is that a Federal responsibility?\n  There is $9 billion to the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration for grants to provide access to broadband.\n  There are huge chunks that would go to local projects specifically \ndelineated by the Conference of Mayors. On January 17, they issued \ntheir fourth update of a report that details much of the spending they \nwould like to accomplish. It is a stunning list of porkbarrel projects \ninvolving swimming pools, water slides, corporate jet hangars, \nskateboard parks, dog parks, equestrian trails, golf courses, parking \ngarages, museums, bike paths, and so on. Some of those things might be \nperfectly appropriate; all of them should be local responsibilities. If \npeople in the community want something like that badly enough, they \nwill find a way to get the money to support it.\n  Just to illustrate the degree to which this prospect of free money \nhas motivated people to what I regard as silliness--again, some of \nthese projects may be perfectly appropriate; if they are, local \ngovernments will find a way to fund them--there is $8.4 million--a lot \nof money--for a polar bear exhibit in Providence, RI. There is $6.1 \nmillion for corporate jet hangars in Fayetteville, AK. There is--a \nsmall amount of money--$100,000 to create one cop job in Sulfur Creek, \nCA. I do not know what kind of community Sulfur Creek is, but surely \nCalifornia could come up with $100,000 to get a police officer on the \nforce for that community, I would think. There is a lot of money here \nfor California. There is money to rehabilitate a skateboard park in \nAlameda, CA; $500,000 for Sunset View Dog Park in Chula Vista, CA. \nThere is money for an equestrian park in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and so \non.\n  The bottom line is, these things ought to be subjected to the usual \nappropriations process. I guarantee you, the appropriators are pretty \ncareful when they go through these items. Yes, some of this stuff slips \nin, but they try to prioritize these projects, and it is not just a \ngiveaway to local communities.\n  I think it is worthwhile noting what some of the money is \nspecifically spent for in categories. Golf courses seem to be a big \nitem. Golf courses. There are several million dollars for golf course \nrenovations and construction in Shreveport, LA; Brockton, MA; \nRoseville, MN; Florissant, MO; St. Louis, MO; Lincoln, NE. There is an \nenvironmentally friendly golf course in Dayton, OH. That one might win \nthe approval of the appropriators. There is the renovation of a golf \ncourse maintenance building in Kauai County, HI.\n  Not to leave out my own State--there are a lot of museums that are \napparently in need of some renovation or construction here--there is \none in Scottsdale, $35 million for a museum of the West. I guarantee \nyou that will be a great museum, but I would hope we could help the \nfolks in Arizona generate the money for this museum. There are museums \nin Miami, FL; Meridian, MS; a Minor League Baseball museum in Durham, \nNC; a museum of contemporary science--there are several museums of \ncontemporary science; that must be a new trend--in Trenton, NJ. There \nis a music museum in Puerto Rico; a music hall of fame in Florissant, \nMO.\n  I may be mispronouncing the names of some of these communities, in \nwhich case I apologize.\n  There is a local history museum at Imperial Centre in Rocky Mount, \nNC. I bet that would be fun to go to. In Trenton, NJ, there is another \ncontemporary science museum--again, in Trenton, NJ. There is the Las \nVegas Historic Post Office Museum in Las Vegas, NV, and the Las Vegas \nPerforming Arts Center in Las Vegas. There is the Art Walk at the \nRochester Museum and Science Center in Rochester, NY; Lima, OH; Puerto \nRico--well, there are three more in Puerto Rico--four more; one in \nGreen Bay, WI. You get the drift.\n  Parking garages are a pretty big item, and I will not list them all \nhere, but there are a lot of them in California, Colorado, Connecticut. \nThere is a maintenance garage recycling and sanitation truck wash--let \nme say that again--a maintenance garage recycling and sanitation truck \nwash in Bridgeport, CT--I am sure that is necessary, actually--$27 \nmillion. I gather all other communities in the country find a way to \npay for theirs, but Bridgeport needs some help on that. Structural \nrepairs to Yankee Doodle Garage in Norwalk, CT. And that list goes on \nand on. In fact, the list goes on and on. I will refrain from reading \nabout another 30 of these.\n  Bicycles are a big item. Bike paths in Long Beach, CA; Miami, FL; \nLewiston, ME; St. Louis, MO; Austin and Arlington, TX; Salt Lake City.\n  Water slides are a pretty good item. There is one in Carmel, IN. \nThere is one in Shreveport, LA.\n  Pools--as I said, that is a big item. There is lots of swimming pool \nrebuilding and refurbishing and so on: California: San Leandro, CA; \nSulfur Creek, CA--a lot of California swimming pools. There are a \ncouple here in Connecticut, Colorado. There is one to replace pools at \ncity high schools in Meriden, CT; one to upgrade swimming pools and \nschool restrooms in New Haven, CT. Florida has several pools. They are \ngoing to build a fishing pier in Savannah, GA. This one I do not \nunderstand, Mr. President: millions of dollars for propane heating \nreplacement with solar water heating systems for county swimming pools \nin Maui, HI. I did not think they needed heated pools in Maui, but more \npower to them if they can go with solar. Again, the list goes on and on \nand on. This is the wish list.\n  These are the kinds of things that when you make money free, people \nwill line up to take part in. Even if we were to eliminate the pots of \nmoney here that these particular specific items would come from--let's \nassume all of the earmarks are gone but the pot of money is there--\nthere are still other pots of money in the bill worth billions of \ndollars that represent wasteful Washington spending, money that will \nnot go to create jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues here, as we talk about bipartisanship, as every \none of us is struck by the absolute seriousness of the crisis that \nfaces our country, we want to do something that works. And to ask \nsomebody to support this is to say, in 6 months or a year or a year and \na half, did it work? For those who support something that does not \nwork, not only is that not in the best interests of the United States, \nbut I think there will be a very high price to pay for wasting perhaps \na trillion dollars. It is money we do not have, and we cannot afford to \nwaste it.\n  So what I would urge my colleagues to do: We have several amendments \ntoday and tomorrow that will be offered to try to end the wasteful \nWashington spending and relegate those\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\nkinds of bills to the Appropriations Committee, where they can make the \ntough choices, and then focus on the things which can actually create \njobs and stimulate the economy. Our colleagues on our side of the aisle \nwill have several important suggestions in that regard. We probably \nneed to start with housing, which is where the problem started. \nExperts, as I read this morning, agree that until you solve that, you \nare probably not going to solve the rest of the problem.\n  So if we can approach the bill from a commonsense standpoint, which \nis what the American people want us to do, we can create a very good \npiece of legislation. But as it stands right now, there are going to \nhave to be fundamental changes in this bill, starting basically from \nscratch, in order for it to do the work we want it to do and to be \nsupported by the American people. We can afford the extra time, if it \nis 2 or 3 days, to get it done right.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's put the partisanship aside, the victory \ndances and all of that, and roll up our sleeves and try to see if we \ncan follow the admonitions of the President when he laid out the \noriginal concept of this bill--timely, targeted, and temporary--and try \nto focus on those things which will do the job rather than simply to \nfulfill our spending wishes or those of many of our well-meaning \nconstituents.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Feb. 4, 2009]\n\n         Senators Should Just Start Over in Fixing Fiscal Mess\n\n       In opposing President Barack Obama's economic-stimulus \n     package--now ballooned to more than $900 billion--\n     congressional Republicans risk letting Democrats earn all the \n     credit as stewards of a national economic revival.\n       Unfortunately, their strategy looks to be a safe bet.\n       Far too much of the stimulus bill is simply unserious as \n     ``economic stimulus.''\n       The Senate would do us all a great favor if it started \n     again from scratch.\n       Congress now enjoys a public mandate to spend like the \n     drunken sailor of its dreams . . . on one condition. That it \n     allocate spending not to its beloved ``pork,'' but to \n     spending projects that offer some promise, however slight, of \n     sparking the economy.\n       And just what constitutes an economy-igniting spending \n     project?\n       We know what doesn't. Smoking-cessation programs may be \n     helpful, but they are not ``stimulus.''\n       Spending $870 million to combat bird flu may be a \n     worthwhile investment in public health. But its prospects for \n     kick-starting the 2009 U.S. economy are pretty much nil.\n       When the Congressional Budget Office analyzed the stimulus \n     bill in its original configuration, it found that just 25 \n     percent of its content might have any effect on the economy \n     this year.\n       A similar analysis by the Wall Street Journal concluded \n     that just 12 cents of every dollar spent would have a chance \n     to create immediate stimulus.\n       And there are outright dangerous provisions to the bill.\n       The ``Buy American'' clause in the legislation, ensuring \n     that only American-made steel and manufactured goods are \n     purchased with stimulus money, is an open invitation to an \n     economy-wrecking trade war. Europeans are rightfully \n     infuriated by it.\n       So are serious Democratic-leaning economists like Lawrence \n     Summers.\n       Make the measure look like a stimulus package rather than a \n     pork package.\n       Then, Democrats might manage to peel off some of the GOP \n     support that the president deems so valuable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to speak for a few moments on a couple of amendments. \nBut before I do, I ask unanimous consent that following my talk that \nSenator Saxby Chambliss be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nbeen going back and forth, so if someone from this side of the aisle \ndoes appear by the time the Senator finishes his remarks, we could \neither have a gentlemen's agreement or I could ask unanimous consent \nthat the next speaker be a Democrat. Everyone is an honorable Senator \nhere, so if a Democrat is here, after you finish, I say to the \nSenator--\n  Mr. DeMINT. I revise my request, Mr. President, to fit that request.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as revised?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes about \nAmendment No. 168. It is the DeMint amendment we are calling the \nAmerican Option to the spending plan that has been proposed by the \nmajority. This is a complete substitute for the spending plan. We call \nit the American Option because it helps to develop a free market \nAmerican economy by leaving money in the hands of people and businesses \nrather than taking it and then having the Government direct where the \nmoney goes. So it basically puts our faith in the American people, in \nour free market economic system, instead of political decisions here in \nWashington.\n  Americans are very concerned about the direction of our country. In \nfact, I have never seen people more anxious about where we are. They \nare worried about the economy but even more worried about the reckless \nspending and Government intrusion into our culture and into our free \nmarkets.\n  Our economy is in trouble. That is obvious. The national unemployment \nrate is now over 7 percent and climbing. Stock markets have plunged, \njeopardizing the retirement security of millions of seniors. Nearly a \nmillion homes were repossessed last year, and in the last week, \nthousands of Americans have lost their jobs at some of our Nation's \nstrongest companies, including Home Depot, Microsoft, Caterpillar, and \nBoeing. In the midst of these difficult and uncertain times, Americans \nunderstandably voted for change. Frustrated with runaway spending, Wall \nStreet bailouts, and soaring energy prices, they voted for President \nObama who, as a candidate, promised to lower taxes, cut spending, \nincrease domestic energy, and create millions of new jobs.\n\n  I like President Obama very much. We were elected to the Senate \ntogether, and we have worked together on several common goals. I truly \nbelieve he wants to do what is best for our country, but our economy \nneeds more than slogans and empty promises.\n  As I have said before, I believe the stimulus bill that is being \nchampioned by President Obama and the Democratic majority is the worst \npiece of economic legislation Congress has considered in 100 years. Not \nsince the passage in 1909 of the 16th amendment which cleared the way \nfor Federal income tax has the United States seriously entertained a \npolicy so comprehensively hostile to economic freedom, nor so \narrogantly indifferent to economic reality. The bill, if it were a \ncountry, would have the 15th largest economy in the world--right in \nbetween Australia and Mexico and greater than the gross domestic \nproduct of Saudi Arabia and Iran put together. The American people will \nbe forced to borrow 100 percent of the unprecedented $1.2 trillion \npricetag when you include interest. The stimulus bill will cost well \nover $1 billion for every page it is printed on and $400,000 for every \njob it hopes to create or save.\n  Proponents argue that we are facing a once-in-a-lifetime economic \ncrisis and only an immediate and overwhelming stimulus bill can ignite \nthe economy, create jobs, and spur growth. That may very well be true, \nbut the spending bill before us today is just that: a spending bill, \nnot an economic stimulus bill. The Democratic bill takes money--it \nactually borrows money--and decides where it should go. It does \nvirtually nothing to stimulate the economy while it wastes billions of \ntaxpayer dollars. It is a hodgepodge of long-supported pet projects \nthat should be considered in the normal budget process but not an \neconomic stimulus bill. Using the troubled economy as their motive, \nDemocrats have opened the floodgates for all sorts of outrageous \nwasteful spending.\n  Here are just a few of the examples from the Senate substitute: $400 \nmillion for researching sexually transmitted diseases. They are telling \nus now that they took that out, but then we find they left the money in \nthere, which could be used for the same purposes once we pass the bill. \nThere is $200 million for bike and pedestrian trails and off-road \nvehicle routes; $200 million to force the military to buy electric \ncars; $34 million to renovate the Department of Commerce headquarters; \n$75 million for a program to\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nend smoking, which, if successful, will bankrupt the children's health \nprogram Democrats just passed last week.\n  Of the more than $800 billion in the bill that is being sold as \ninfrastructure investment, only $30 billion will actually go to build \nhighways, about $40 billion for upgrades in our telecommunications and \nelectricity infrastructure, and about $20 billion in business tax cuts. \nThese are the only three components of the bill that might arguably \nstimulate the economy and create jobs and, even then, only temporarily. \nAltogether, only 11 percent of this so-called ``American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009'' will have anything to do with either \nrecovery or reinvestment. And rest assured, the elevated spending \nlevels in this bill will never recede.\n  The tax side of the bill is not much better. We can think of it this \nway: If nearly every Democrat in Congress supports a tax cut, it is \nprobably not a tax cut. Indeed, the text of the Democratic plan reveals \nthat $212 billion of smoke-and-mirror gimmicks--temporary cuts and \nrebates exactly like those that failed to stimulate the economy last \nyear. Half of the tax changes in this bill are for people who don't \neven pay taxes, and all of them are temporary, which will undermine \ntheir impact. This bill is not an economic stimulus bill at all, but \nreally a political stimulus--a stimulus to grow Government in \nWashington.\n  Any doubters of the bare-knuckled partisanship at the heart of the \nDemocrats' trillion-dollar catastrophe will do well to ask a simple \nquestion: Who benefits from this legislation? Who, indeed? Alternative \nenergy companies, public employee unions, teachers unions, university \nfaculty and administrators, welfare recipients, ACORN-style community \norganizers, politicians who spend the money, Federal bureaucrats who \nallocate it, and the limousine liberal lawyers and lobbyists who will \ninfluence every dime behind the scenes. In other words, this bill is a \nmassive transfer of wealth not from the rich to the poor, but from \nmiddle-class families and small businesses to favored Democratic \nconstituencies who are not the poor and middle class we promised to \nhelp.\n  This bill is not a stimulus; it is a mugging. It is a fraud. \nConservatives who fear proponents of this bill want to inch our economy \ncloser to a European style of socialism are kidding themselves. The \nproponents of this bill want to strap a big rocket on the back of our \neconomy and launch it all the way to Brussels. This massive spending \nbill is fatally flawed. It will not rescue our economy; it will \nstrangle it.\n  That is why this bill must be stopped dead in its tracks. It cannot \nbe fixed by tweaking it here or tweaking it there. It must be scrapped \nentirely so the leadership in Congress will be forced to consider real \nalternatives.\n  Fortunately, there is another way, a better way, a way that will \nactually stimulate the economy, spur investment, and create jobs, a way \nthat will permanently and immediately save billions of dollars in the \nprivate sector and in the hands of Americans who buy goods, provide \nservices, start businesses, and hire employees. We call it the American \nOption because it relies on the American people to generate jobs and \ngrowth, not the Federal Government.\n  The plan I am offering is not new or clever. It is only 11 pages \nlong. It comes with no bells or whistles, no smoke and mirrors, but it \nwill work, and it is based on proven American principles of freedom, \nequality, and opportunity.\n  The plan--developed by scholars J.D. Foster and William Beach at the \nHeritage Foundation--is the best anyone has proposed since the \nrecession first took hold. The idea is simple. First, make the \ntemporary tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 that are currently set to expire in \n2011 permanent. Make our current rates permanent. This would create the \ncertainty for citizens and businesses they need to plan their spending \nand to grow their businesses. The short-term, temporary tax relief of \nthe sort envisioned by the Democratic plan does not stimulate economic \ngrowth; it is temporary and it creates economic uncertainty. It is the \ndifference between a $1,000 gift one month, which you might put away or \nuse to pay off some credit card, and a $1,000-a-month raise which might \nget you thinking about buying a house, a new car, or taking a summer \nvacation or starting a new business. To encourage people to take risks \nand create new jobs, we must make tax relief for families and small \nbusinesses permanent. Recessions are caused by uncertainty that keeps \ninvestors on the sidelines. Permanent low taxes allow for plans and \ndecisions to be made with an eye toward the future.\n  With the 2011 tax bomb diffused, part 2 of our plan will cut income \ntax rates across the board. The top marginal rate--the one paid by most \nof the small businesses that create new jobs--will fall from 35 percent \nto 25 percent. It simplifies the code to include only two other \nbrackets: 15 and 10. These marginal rate reductions would be permanent \nand give the private sector maximum predictability as it decides how to \nbest spend its recovered income. This is a matter of fairness. No \nAmerican family should be forced to pay the Federal Government more \nthan 25 percent of the fruits of their labor.\n  Just as we cut taxes for families and small businesses, we need to \ncut them for corporations as well, from 35 to 25 percent, and we \nshouldn't be afraid to say so. Our corporate tax rate is one of the \nhighest in the world, driving investment and jobs overseas. Lowering \nthis key rate will unlock trillions of dollars to be invested in \nAmerica instead of abroad. Rather than giving large companies loopholes \nand targeted tax benefits which only encourage them to spend money on \nlobbyists who secure such goodies, Congress should get out of the \nbusiness of picking winners and losers in the market and simply cut \neveryone's taxes and let's let the best companies win. This plan will \nmake businesses compete for consumers, not Congressmen and Senators.\n\n  To further simplify and improve the code, our plan would also \npermanently repeal the alternative minimum tax, permanently maintain \nthe capital gains and dividend taxes at 15 percent, permanently kill \nthe death tax for estates under $5 million, and cut the tax rate to 15 \npercent; permanently extend the $1,000-per-child tax credit, \npermanently repeal the marriage penalty, and permanently limit itemized \ndeductions to home mortgage interest and charitable contributions.\n  The Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis' widely respected \neconomic forecasting model projects this plan would result in nearly \n500,000 more jobs this year, almost 3 million new jobs by 2011, 7.5 \nmillion new jobs by 2013, and a total of nearly 18 million jobs over \nthe next decade. That is an average of nearly 2 million jobs every \nyear. Instead of taking $1 trillion out of the economy so politicians \ncan spread it around to special interests, the American Option will \nkeep a trillion more dollars in the hands of American families and \nbusinesses. Instead of growing Government where waste and corruption \nrun rampant, we grow the private sector where innovation flourishes. \nInstead of giving the power and control of our economy to politicians \nand bureaucrats, we give Americans and small businesses the freedom to \nspend and invest their own money. The positive effects of letting more \nmoney stay in the private economy immediately and permanently will \nquickly become apparent.\n  Beyond the job creation, I know we are all also interested in seeing \nour housing and real estate markets, as well as the automobile sector, \nemerge from the doldrums. Within 5 years, the American Option would \nproduce $175 billion in residential investment and $362 billion in \nnonresidential investment. That is more than a half trillion dollars \nleft to private citizens with the motivation to care for their \nfamilies, invest in a new business, or expand their current productive \nactivities.\n  The auto industry will also experience a dramatic increase in sales \nactivity. Between 2009 and 2011, total sales of new cars and light \ntrucks would rise $24.5 billion more than they would otherwise. Again, \nallowing private citizens and businesses to use their own capital \ninstead of sending it off to Washington benefits all sectors of the \neconomy.\n  The evidence in support of this legislation is not theoretical but \nhistorical, unlike the Keynesian arguments behind the Democratic \nspending and debt plan. In 1964 John F. Kennedy's tax reductions led to \n9 million private sector jobs in 5 years. Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts \nled to 7 million in the same\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\ntimeframe. Five years on, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts led to the \ncreation of 4 million and 6 million jobs, respectively. Every time the \nUnited States has cut marginal tax rates, millions of jobs have been \ncreated--jobs that lifted the unemployment into the workplace, the \nworking poor into the middle class, and the middle class into long-term \neconomic security.\n  Similar stories can be told of Great Britain's rescue under Margaret \nThatcher in the 1980s. More recently, Israel's economic reforms under \ntheir Finance Minister changed their whole economic platform.\n  President Obama's own chief economist has shown that tax cuts do \ntruly stimulate economic activity to the tune of $3 of increased output \nfor every dollar of tax relief.\n  On the other hand, the world's greatest experiments in spending our \nway out of a recession have three textbook examples. The first is \nFranklin Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression. The New Deal \nbegan in 1933 with unemployment around 25 percent and effectively ended \nwith the establishments of F.D.R.'s ``war economy'' in 1940 with \nunemployment still hovering around 20 percent. The second example is \nfrom the 1970s when huge deficits in the United States neither spurred \neconomic growth nor curtailed inflation. The third example is Japan, \ntheir so-called Lost Decade, in which the Japanese Government tried in \nvain for 10 years to spend its way out of a national real estate and \ninvestment collapse.\n  Every discredited idea from these three monuments to economic \nmismanagement can be found in the fine print of the Democrats' $1 \ntrillion socialist experiment we are considering this week: massive \nspending, skyrocketing deficits, inevitable tax increases, and the \ndisastrous unintended consequences of hurried and arbitrary meddling in \nour economy.\n  Finally, there is another issue I want to address. I have recently \nheard some of my colleagues say that this recession is the fault of the \nfree market, that President Obama has inherited the problems of a \nconservative ideology.\n  Mr. President, the charge is flatly, demonstrably false. In fact, it \nis incredible that anyone would say it.\n  Let me be clear: conservatism has nothing to apologize for.\n  It was not conservatism that foisted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac onto \nthe national credit market.\n  It was not conservatism that that shook-down the Nation's banking \nsystem with the Community Reinvestment Act.\n  It was not conservatism that asked for, lied about, and then wasted \n$350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\n  Nor did conservatism sign on to the second tranche of the TARP funds \nnow in the hands of our esteemed new Treasury Secretary.\n  It was not conservatism that used taxpayer funds to bail out the \nperpetrators of the Wall Street meltdown.\n  It wasn't conservatism that led our financial industry to make these \nreckless loans, and it certainly wasn't conservatism that made that \nindustry ask for the taxpayers to foot the bill for their idiocy.\n  It wasn't conservatism that bailed out an auto industry bankrupted by \nits inability to manage costs and strangled by the tentacles of \nunionism.\n  Every problem now plaguing our economy can be directly traced to some \nGovernment policy that was passed over the vehement objections and \nwarnings of principled conservatives.\n  The same scenario is playing out with this spending bill, but the \nresult is not preordained.\n  The Democrat plan will fail, it will hurt our economy, it will kill \njobs, it will lengthen and deepen the recession, and it will delay any \nhope of recovery.\n  But it is not enough to merely stop this, the wrong bill--we must \npass the right one.\n  It is not simply a viable alternative--it is the American option to \nrescue our economy from an inexorable slide toward European social-\ndemocracy.\n  With a troubled economy, mounting national debt, and an entitlement \ncrisis ready to explode, conservatives must offer bold and proven \nsolutions to secure America's future.\n  We cannot simply derail the ``liberal express''; we must show our \nfellow countrymen a better path.\n  There is nothing wrong with our economy that a free people cannot \nsolve. All we need is the freedom to take back from Washington control \nof our economic destiny.\n  The policy approach I have outlined can work, and if implemented, \nwill work. How do I know?\n  Because liberating people to pursue their own happiness and fortune \nis the only thing that ever does.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the economic stimulus \npackage. First of all, my friend from South Carolina has raised so many \nvalid points in his discussion. I know he has an amendment that is \nprimarily focused on reduction of taxes to stimulate this economy, \ncreate jobs, and put more money into people's pockets. I concur with \nhim 100 percent that this is the direction in which we need to go. I \nlook forward to further debate on his amendment and seeing his \namendment reach the floor.\n  This stimulus package we are now debating gets more expensive and, \nfrankly, less stimulating with every passing day. The Democrat's plan \nis not a job creating bill. Plain and simple, in its current form it is \na spending bill.\n  We have been going through a number of amendments over the last \nseveral days and I am pleased to see that some of those amendments have \nhad success. I think the bill looks somewhat better, but we still have \na long way to go. This bill should not be about pet projects. Instead \nof wasting $600 million, for example, of hard-earned taxpayer money for \nnew cars for the Federal Government or $650 million for a failed \ndigital TV transition program or even $120 million for the Census \nBureau to hire personnel who specialize in ``partnerships,'' we should \nbe spending Americans' money on creating jobs for Americans. These jobs \nshould allow Americans to go out and buy new cars themselves and \nthereby stimulate and energize a very struggling automobile industry. \nThis bill should put money in the pockets of individuals who can buy \nnew TVs instead of having to worry about the digital transmission issue \ncovered in this particular proposal.\n  I have been in discussions with Senators McCain, Martinez, and \nothers. We are in the process of finalizing an amendment that will be a \nsubstitute for the base bill that does exactly that--focus on creating \njobs and stimulating the economy.\n  Any package that is intended to focus on strengthening our economy \nshould focus on three things and three things only:\n  First of all, job creation. Despite an injection of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars into our banking system, the credit markets remain \nfrozen.\n  A lack of both confidence in the market and credible borrowers are \nprecluding our credit markets from thawing and freeing much needed \ncapital. Along with the current dual track of the TARP program, we can \nloosen this tight grip on capital is through job creation.\n  We must incentivize the creation of new jobs through favorable tax \ntreatment of businesses and individuals. My friend from South Carolina \nmentioned an issue we are going to have in our amendment that is very \ncritical, I think, to the long-term corporate structure in America. A \nsolution that really will provide for the creation of jobs is the \nreduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. We \nhave the second highest corporate tax rate in the world. What are we \ndoing about charging corporations that amount of money? What we are \ndoing is exporting jobs out of America.\n  I talked to one of the leading economists in the country this morning \nwho happens to be a resident of my State and is somebody whom I look to \nfor guidance from time to time. I asked him, ``If you could point to \nanything that would create jobs in America, what would the first thing \nbe?'' He immediately said, ``Cutting the corporate tax rate.'' He said \nit is ridiculous what we do and that what we are going to hear from \nfolks on the other side is that what we are doing by cutting the \ncorporate tax rate is looking after the big corporations. The fact is, \naccording to this renowned economist, the big corporations don't pay \nthat 35 percent\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\nanyway. It is the guys on Main Street, the insurance agencies in my \nhome State, the veterinary hospitals down the street, and all the other \nsmall businesses that are, in fact, paying that 35 percent. It is our \nsmall manufacturers that depend on export markets to be competitive \nthat are having to pay that 35 percent. If we reduce the corporate tax \non those entities, then we are going to have the potential and the \nreality of creating jobs in this country. We also need to put more \nmoney in the pockets of individuals. One way we can do that, which we \nare going to have in our amendment, is by the reduction of payroll \ntaxes. That will put a bigger paycheck into the pockets of every hard-\nworking American every single week; make no mistake about it.\n  We have to look at spending measures that will have an immediate \nstimulative effect on our economy. Military and highway construction \ncan provide jobs in the immediate future and put stability and \nconfidence back in the marketplace and start people spending their \npaychecks again. There is no better way to put money into the \nmanufacturing sector tomorrow than by putting money into defense \ncontracting if it's done in the right and responsible way. We need to \nincrease defense spending and make sure America remains safe and \nsecure. Yet there is nothing in the base bill that the Democrats have \noffered that will increase pure defense spending.\n  In addition to job creation, second, we have to focus on housing. The \nhousing crisis is what got us into this real financial mess that we are \nin today. I don't care what we do with respect to trying to spend or \ntax our way out of this; unless we fix the housing sector in this \ncountry, we are never going to recover from the economic crisis we are \nseeing today.\n  How do we do that? Again, you will see measures that have already \nbeen discussed in the form of amendments over the next couple of days--\namendments such as that from my colleague and friend, Senator Isakson, \nto provide a $15,000 tax credit to anyone who buys a house between \nJanuary 1 and December 31. Measures that are outside-the-box thinking \nsuch as the one by the Senator from Nevada that proposes to provide \nlong-term, low-interest loans for individuals seeking to either \npurchase a home or to refinance a home, where if they are not able to \ndo this, they will be subject to foreclosure. So it is these types of \nhousing measures and provisions that will allow us to stimulate the \nhousing sector and try to get that portion of our economy back on \ntrack.\n  Third, in addition to the job creation and housing, we have to focus \non compassion for folks who have lost jobs during these tough times, \nthrough no fault of their own. In my State, we have had 2 weeks of \nmajor announcements of job losses. It is simply due to the fact that \nthese corporations are having to develop cost-cutting measures that \nwill improve their bottom line because their sales are down \nsignificantly. Their workers are quality workers and they would like to \nkeep them on, but they simply cannot afford it. They have to find cost-\ncutting measures.\n  So when you find folks such as that who are in need of assistance, we \nhave an obligation, I think, to provide some relief to them. It is \nimportant that we prevent the bottom from getting deeper. We need to \nwork to assist those who have fallen as a result of this spiraling \neconomy and not from irresponsible fiscal decisions.\n  We must act to expand protections to serve as a compassionate step \ntoward regrowth of our economy, a restrengthening in our markets, and a \nreturn to fiscal security.\n  All these provisions are going to be included, along with others, in \nthe substitute amendment that will be forthcoming either tonight or \ntomorrow. We must be clear--job creation doesn't mean ``Buy American.'' \nIn tough economic times, it is all too easy to turn inward, to want to \nbuild protectionist walls around America. Nobody believes in buying \nAmerican more than I do, but it is not the time to pretend our economy \nknows only the bounds of our borders.\n  I say this as someone who represents a State with a strong \nmanufacturing sector. We live in an interconnected, global economy, \nwhere most manufactured products have at least one component not made \nin America. ``Buy American'' is the quickest way to export American \njobs.\n  The biggest problem I see with the current proposal that is under \ndebate, which came out of the Finance Committee from the Democratic \nside, is that we are now having to approach that bill in a top-down \nway. In other words, we are having to take the bill as it is and have \namendments forthcoming that seek to strip out provisions in there that \nare not stimulating. These are the pet projects for individuals in this \nbody, projects that will do nothing but take money out of taxpayers' \npockets.\n  What we should do is develop a system directed toward this crisis \nthat is a bottom-up review and a bottom-up attack on this financial \ncrisis. We can do that basically by scrapping the current bill and \nstarting over again. It is not that complicated to do.\n  I hope, at the end of the day, that this is the approach we will \nultimately take. It is not just this trillion dollar spending package \nwe are looking at in the Senate; we have to be responsible as we move \nforward because there are other bills that are coming right behind this \none. There is a TARP III, which we understand will be laid on the table \nwithin the next few days. We have heard numbers as high as another half \ntrillion dollars that may be asked for in TARP III, and that may not be \nthe end of the road there.\n  There is also an Omnibus bill that I understand has already been put \ntogether that spends $1 trillion of taxpayers' money. One of my \nconstituents said to me the other day, ``We used to talk in terms of a \nmillion. Then we got to where we talk in terms of a billion. Now you \nfolks are talking in terms of a trillion. What comes after a \ntrillion?''\n  That is a pretty tough question to answer, but we are fast getting \nthere. We as policymakers in the Senate have to be responsible with the \ntaxpayers' money. Sure, we want to do everything we can from a policy \nstandpoint to stimulate America out of this economic crisis. But \nspending our way out of this situation is not the answer. That is why I \nhope we can review where we are with this current proposal, and instead \nof having a top-down review of it, look at it in more positive terms \nand have a bottom-up review. Let's start over again with the basics. We \nshould start with the housing sector and figure out how to fix it. If \nthere are other ideas out there than what has already been talked \nabout, let's put them on the table and figure it out.\n  Secondly, let's look at how we are going to create jobs. We simply \nknow by spending money that we are not going to create or maintain \njobs. There are a lot of smart people in this body. Let's figure out \nthe best solution.\n  Lastly, let's be compassionate. We need to make sure Americans are \ntaken care of when they have lost their jobs through no fault of their \nown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Rhode Island \nis here. I assume going back and forth he would be next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a feature of \nthe economic recovery legislation that will both create jobs in the \nshort term and help us confront the long-term economic challenges that \nare facing us.\n  Clearly, creating jobs is a paramount goal of this legislation. In \nthis time of deepening recession, one in ten Rhode Islanders is looking \nfor a job. At 10 percent, our unemployment rate is second in New \nEngland and the second highest across this entire Nation. As I have \ntraveled around my State, I have heard from countless Rhode Islanders \nstruggling to hold on to their retirement savings, their homes, and \ntheir livelihoods.\n  Against this dark background, jobs mean security. Steady employment \nhelps families pay the bills and plan for the future. Jobs mean \nconfidence in an unsettled time. In this weakening economy, job \ncreation should be our highest economic priority.\n  But at the end of the day, the best jobs this legislation can create \nare jobs that produce lasting infrastructure, assets that will help our \neconomy function smoothly for years to come, such as highways, bridges, \nweatherized homes and schools, and water treatment plants. These are \nwin-wins for the American people.\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n  Fortunately, this bill goes beyond a definition of infrastructure as \njust the things the Romans could build. The last few decades have seen \nenormous innovation in this country--new communications platforms, the \nInternet and mobile phones, new sources of energy. This technological \nrevolution is transforming the way we live and work, as the rail system \ndid and the highway system did in decades and centuries past. And as \nthe Federal Government helped build the railways and highways, the \nbricks and mortar infrastructure of the 20th century, today this \nrecovery bill will support the digital infrastructure of the 21st \ncentury. It is a dual benefit: jobs today and a platform for growth \ntomorrow.\n  To me, one of the most vital parts of our Nation's infrastructure in \nthis 21st century will be the development of a national health \ninformation network to improve the quality and efficiency of health \ncare, to save money, and to save lives. But today this network is \ngrowing at the speed of mud. Health care is frighteningly behind the \nrest of American industry in its development and implementation of \ninformation technology. Why? Because of economics, the strange, \nbizarre, twisted economics of our health care system that fails to \nreward doctors and hospitals when they invest in health information \ninfrastructure.\n  If we can solve the health information network problem, private \nindustry will develop technology to allow doctors to prescribe drugs \nelectronically and help remind you to take them. Technology will help \ndoctors update your vital information in real time and cross-reference \nyour health issues with the best illness prevention and treatment \nstrategies. And technology promises decision support programs \nimplementing best medical practices which will help health care \nproviders avoid costly, life-threatening, and completely unnecessary \nmedical errors that now bedevil our health care system.\n  Look at what private technology and innovation have already done with \nthe Internet--Google, e-Bay, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook. Whose life has \nnot been changed?\n  Imagine what can happen in health care. Wonderful opportunities \nbeckon, both in the near term, because funding this infrastructure will \ncreate jobs in the information technology sector, and in the long term \nto help us bring down the spiraling health care costs that threaten to \nengulf our economy.\n  But the broken economics of the health care system mean that those \nopportunities will not arise without help. Unless the Federal \nGovernment gets involved to set standards for this technology on which \neveryone can agree, the resolution of a digital x-ray image, for \ninstance, or requirements protecting a patient's privacy or leveling \neconomic obstacles, we will never get to a national system.\n  The Romans could not build an electronic health information \ninfrastructure, but we can and we must, and this legislation will.\n  There are rumors that an amendment will shortly be adopted that \nwould, among other things, strip out this investment in health \ninformation technology. Of all the dumb mistakes we could make in this \nbill, that would be the very dumbest of all. It would harm the \nimmediate element of job creation that is important to this \ninfrastructure. It would slow down the development of a national health \ninformation infrastructure, and it would compromise our ability to deal \nwith the health care crisis that is looming behind the economic crisis \nwe are dealing with now.\n  As I see it, we have three waves stacked up. We have an economic \ncrisis that is upon us that we need to address. Immediately behind that \nis a bigger and worse health care crisis, bigger and worse than the \ncrisis we are facing now. And behind that is an environmental, global \nwarming, and climate change crisis that is bigger still.\n  Now is the time to prepare for that next health care crisis, the one \nwe will have to address as soon as we begin to get our arms around the \neconomic crisis.\n  I have been a champion of health information technology since I was \nattorney general of Rhode Island years ago, and the snail's pace of \nadoption has both perplexed and disappointed me. I frequently ask \ndoctors from all across the country why they insist on using paper, and \nI always get the same three answers. One: I can't afford in my practice \nto put all this machinery in. Two: I tried using health information \ntechnology, but it was too complicated. Or three: I don't want to \ninvest in this and then get it wrong. I don't want to invest until I \nknow what the standards are. I don't want to take what I call the \nBetamax risk of investing in the wrong technology.\n  There is an additional problem, at least for electronic prescribing. \nThe Federal Government insists on doctors maintaining a paper system \nfor controlled prescriptions. If you tried to move to an electronic \nsystem, you have to maintain two. It does not make any sense.\n  The doctors' concerns about health information technology are \nanswered in this recovery package.\n  First, the bill addresses the cost issue in a number of ways. If you \nare a doctor who cannot afford to purchase a health information system \nso that your patients can have an electronic health record of their own \nthat is private and securely theirs, this bill has grant money to help \nyou. If you are a doctor doing well enough not to need a grant but \ncould certainly use a loan to make this happen, the bill has loan money \nfor you. Or maybe you are a doctor who can afford the upfront \ninvestment but have not been able to make the business case for the \nongoing use of the technology and the change it will require in the \nday-to-day administration of your practice. This bill reverses the \nbackwards incentives that discouraged the use of health information \ntechnology and that discouraged quality improvement efforts.\n  For the first time, Medicare and Medicaid are going to pay for \nmeaningful use of health information technology in doctors' offices. \nStarting with this recovery bill, keeping people healthy will keep the \nbusiness of medicine healthy.\n  Second is the challenge of technology. Health information technology \nis about much more than digitizing data, more than going from illegible \nhandwriting to clear electronic type. Health IT is about coordinating \ncare between multiple providers. Anybody who has a serious illness is \naware of the confusion that surrounds having to deal with multiple \ndoctors. Health IT is about helping patients and their loved ones \nmanage those complex, chronic conditions. Health IT is about using best \npractice protocols so the wide variation--the wide and unexplained \nvariation--in American medicine can be narrowed down to the best \npractices we know of and Americans can be assured they are getting the \nbest quality of care. Health IT is about better care for patients who \nare ill, and it is also about preventive care for patients so they do \nnot become ill.\n  The recovery bill recognizes that the goal is not health IT in every \npot, but higher quality, more efficient care for every single American \nwho interacts with our health care system. The economic recovery bill \nalso recognizes that for some doctors, this is a lofty goal and that \nthey will need more than money to get there.\n  Everyone knows that new technologies are hard to learn, hard to adapt \nto, and hard to incorporate into an existing system. You can be a \nbrilliant doctor, a master at the healing arts, and still have trouble \ncoping with the demands of a new information technology. It often seems \neasier to keep doing things as they have always been done. So this bill \ndoes not just hand out grants to buy big fancy new boxes of equipment \nto sit in office closets. This bill includes implementation assistance \nso the doctors have a little help opening that box, installing that \ntechnology, and putting it to work on behalf of their patients.\n  That assistance will be offered through regional extension centers, \nnot unlike our agricultural extension service that has been helping \nfarmers all over this great Nation for decades. Every Senator in this \nbody from a rural State knows how helpful and effective the \nagricultural extension model is. And for those of us from urban areas, \nthink of it as a ``geek squad'' for American doctors.\n  Third, the standards issue. Our esteemed colleague Dr. Coburn has \noften noted that the greatest challenge he sees in building up our \nnational health information infrastructure is the lack of national \nstandards. Doctors are\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\noften afraid to adopt new technology before they are sure their health \ninformation system will be able to talk to other doctors' health \ninformation systems. Fortunately, significant progress has been made in \ncreating a broad set of standards for health information technology \nproducts, thanks in large part to the leadership of outgoing HHS \nSecretary Mike Leavitt. The recovery bill acknowledges that progress \nand builds upon it, establishing a new health information technology \nstandards committee and establishing a process for the adoption of \nfuture standards, implementation specifications, and certification \ncriteria so you know what you are buying meets the standards.\n  All that said, we all know that health information technology is \nultimately about patients. Patients must trust and participate in the \nhealth information technology revolution if it is going to reach its \nfull potential. Therefore, the recovery bill includes a number of vital \nprivacy protections to ensure the security and the confidentiality of \nelectronic patient records. These protections include changes in \nnotification policy if there is an unauthorized acquisition or \ndisclosure of health information. It includes the establishment of \nprivacy officers in HHS regional offices, new restrictions on the sale \nof health information, improved enforcement of violations to privacy \nlaw, and other strong provisions.\n  I am well aware that privacy is a controversial and highly charged \narea of debate. I think it is important we all view the privacy \nprovisions in this bill as the beginning and not the end of our \nnational discussion about health care privacy.\n  These provisions will require oversight and, perhaps over time, \nadjustment. I look forward to this ongoing challenge and remain \ncommitted to being engaged in it. But for now, this is a good, strong \nprivacy package. It has, I think, solid agreement in this building.\n  Last, but certainly not least, I wish to acknowledge the \nextraordinary work of the man who has been committed to health care in \nthe Senate longer than anyone else--the incomparable Senator from \nMassachusetts, Edward Kennedy. He has been a tremendous supporter of \nadvancing health information technology for years, and was the primary \narchitect of this language in the Senate. As always, we are in his debt \nfor the expertise and the leadership, the passion and the compassion he \nprovides, and we look forward to his speedy return to the floor.\n\n  I will conclude, Mr. President, by saying I know there is an enormous \namount of politics now surrounding this economic recovery plan. But in \norder to try to make the politics look good, let us not hit what is \nprobably the smartest and the best investment in this whole plan, one \nthat not only works to provide jobs in a key American industry today \nbut that lays the foundation for addressing what is probably the next \nbiggest, most dangerous problem that is facing Americans behind this \nimmediate economic crisis. Let us not be fools here in the service of \npolitical expedience. Let us stick with these health information \ntechnology elements of the bill, support them energetically, and I hope \nevery colleague will see the wisdom of them and support their inclusion \nin this bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer very much for his courtesy, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 140\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am bringing to the attention of the \nSenate my opposition to an amendment that has been offered on this \nbill. Earlier today, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, offered \namendment No. 140 to create a so-called ``earmark point of order'' that \nwould lie against appropriations provisions before the Senate. This \namendment, if it should be adopted, serves no desirable purpose. In my \nopinion, on the contrary, it would only serve to weaken the Congress as \nan institution, and in relationship in particular to the \nadministration, and would yield more authority to the unelected \nbureaucracy of the Federal Government to make decisions that all of our \nconstituents in all of our States sent us here to make. It is, in \neffect, a restriction of the power of Congress and the direct \nrepresentatives of the people and the States.\n  Individual appropriations bills should be brought to the floor \nsubject to amendment by any Senator, whether a member of the \nAppropriations Committee or not, without any restrictions. This makes \nthe Senate different from the House of Representatives, as all Senators \nknow. The House has a Rules Committee. When legislation is brought to \nthe floor of the House of Representatives, the originating committee \nhas to go before the Rules Committee and basically get permission to \ncall up the bill and present it to the body. The Rules Committee \ndecides whether amendments will be in order and, if so, which \namendments, and how much time for debate on the amendments. Here, we \ndon't have a rules committee; it is not necessary. Each Senator is, in \neffect, the member of the rules committee. The Senate decides under its \nrules as a body, with each individual Senator having equal power and \nequal say as to what amendments can be offered. Any Senator should have \nthe right to offer an amendment to any bill, and it doesn't have to be \ngermane, unless cloture has been invoked.\n  So what this amendment seeks to do, intentionally or not, is to limit \nthe power of this body to be involved in the process of deciding how \ntaxpayer funds are going to be spent by the Federal Government and for \nwhat purposes. So this is an unnecessary abrogation of a \nconstitutionally vested responsibility in the Senate. It subrogates the \nSenate to the power of the executive, and this amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  The bill that contains the legislation offered by the Senator would \nnot do anything about $100 billion in new programs that are being \nfunded in this stimulus bill to which the amendment is being offered. \nThere are 128 pages of legislation in the bill before the Senate \ndealing with health information technology, and $23 billion of funding \nis associated with that language--$23 billion. It is a new program that \nhas not been authorized by the relevant committee. Is that subject to a \npoint of order, I ask the Senate? I don't think so. But under the \nlanguage of this amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin, I suppose it \nwould be subject to a point of order, but nobody is demanding a point \nof order against the bill containing that provision.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have served on authorizing \ncommittees and the Appropriations Committee. The authorization process \nis an important function of our Senate. The Appropriations Committee \nworks closely with authorizing committees. If any Senator opposes \nauthorizing language that is contained in an appropriations bill, the \nSenator can offer an amendment to strike it. The Senate can strike the \nlanguage if it determines that is the appropriate thing to do.\n  Now, all the committees produce earmarks, not just the Appropriations \nCommittee. When I served on the Agriculture Committee, the farm bill \ncustomarily contained specific authorizations for expenditures of \nfunds--entitlement to Federal dollars by certain classes of producers \nof agriculture products. If any Senator had an objection to any portion \nof that authorizing bill, he or she could offer an amendment to strike \nit or amend it. Individual Senators are free and have the power to \nmodify any bill before the Senate, and appropriations bills are no \ndifferent. But to give a Senator a point of order to raise over some \nprovision with which they disagree is not an appropriate change in the \nrules of the Senate and should not be tolerated in this legislation. It \nshould be stricken. My experience has shown that because a program is \nauthorized doesn't necessarily mean it is a good idea or that it will \nbe funded. And that is another point.\n  Supporters of the amendment have made it clear their goal is to get \nrid of all earmarks--however earmarks may be defined by them--\nregardless of what committee may produce them, regardless of whether \nthey have been specifically authorized. This amendment is a step toward \nthat goal, in my opinion. So I suggest that the Senate should look \ncarefully and consider seriously the impact that this amendment may \nhave, and when it is called up, if it is, I hope the Senate will vote \nit down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one specific area of this cobbled-\ntogether bill is spending. The bill provides significant increases in \nMedicaid spending. There is $87 billion in Medicaid funds in this bill. \nThere is a fundamental change to Medicaid that is in the House bill \nwaiting to be put into the Senate bill when it comes to conference.\n  There are numerous amendments to try to fix some of the problems with \nthe Medicaid provisions of this bill, and I wish to discuss some of \nthose at this point. I start with this $87 billion of FMAP money they \nhave referred to. This is a huge payment to States. Now, some will say \nthat $87 billion in Medicaid payments in this spending party bill is \nmeant to help States pay for people already enrolled, but the facts \ntell a different story.\n  In January, the Urban Institute produced a report for the Kaiser \nCommission on Medicaid and uninsured titled ``Rising Unemployment, \nMedicaid and the Uninsured.'' The Urban Institute's research asserts \nthat for every 1 percent increase in nationwide unemployment, Medicaid \nand Children's Health Insurance Programs will see an increase of 1 \nmillion additional beneficiaries nationwide.\n  I want to make clear that for the unemployed who qualify, we ought to \nprovide enough money in Medicaid to take care of it, but we are raising \nquestions about money beyond that. So we have this formula that is kind \nof a benchmark--this Urban Institute research. Using that formula and \nthe unemployment baseline that is in the bill, I had the Congressional \nBudget Office prepare a cost estimate for an amendment giving States \nadditional funding based on the Urban Institute's published research. \nThis amendment would provide for an additional per capita Federal \npayment to States for every new enrollee--every new enrollee--that the \nUrban Institute research assumes will go on Medicaid or SCHIP during \nthe 27 months contemplated in this bill.\n  Everyone watching probably knows that the Urban Institute is not \nexactly a conservative think tank, so their research should be credible \nto my friends on the other side of the aisle. Now, remember, the cost \nof the additional Medicaid funds for States in this bill is a whopping \n$87 billion. The cost of my amendment to take care of the unemployed \ngoing on SCHIP or on Medicaid--$10.8 billion. That is $10.8 billion for \nwhat the Urban Institute suggests are enrollment-driven increases in \nMedicaid spending due to the recession.\n  So the question is: Why does this bill provide almost eight times \nwhat the States actually need for new enrollments resulting from this \neconomic downturn? The Senate is considering $87 billion in funding \nbecause States are facing deficits of as much as $312 billion in the \naggregate over the next 2 years. So let us not kid ourselves. What this \nis all about is a bill giving States money to help them fill their \ndeficits. This outlandish sum of money is not needed for Medicaid. It \nmight be needed for something else--and we ought to discuss it in terms \nof the something else--but not for Medicaid.\n  So you may want to ask: What commitment is Congress getting from the \nStates in exchange for $87 billion, of which only $10.8 billion might \nbe used for the need for which is supposedly in this legislation? \nCongress is giving States $87 billion and hoping that States don't take \nactions contrary to Medicaid actually providing the care that people \nneed. I use the word ``hope'' because the underlying bill doesn't do \nenough to make sure the States do what is best for Medicaid. Does the \nbill prevent States from cutting their Medicaid Programs? It does not. \nThe bill only prevents States from cutting Medicaid income eligibility. \nBut if Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling them not to \ncut Medicaid eligibility, I think it is very important we in Congress \nalso tell the States that they can't cut benefits. But this bill \ndoesn't do that. If Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling \nthem not to cut Medicaid eligibility, shouldn't Congress also tell \nStates they can't cut payments to providers? So you have eligibility, \nyou have providers, you have benefits--and we are only dealing with \neligibility in this bill--and, yet, giving out $87 billion of which \nalmost $11 billion is needed for the purpose of unemployed going on \nMedicaid.\n\n  States cannot change income eligibility, but under this bill as \nwritten they can cut provider payments to doctors, pharmacists, \ndentists, and benefits to providers.\n  Will there be Medicaid beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled, \nable to receive home- and community-based services? If we want to keep \nseniors and the disabled in their homes rather than in institutions, \npaying direct care workers to provide home- and community-based \nservices is very critical to that goal.\n  Will there be enough pharmacists taking Medicaid? Will there be \nenough rural hospitals and public hospitals taking Medicaid?\n  I had one member of the Senate Finance Committee on my side of the \naisle tell me in that State, their State legislature owes $400 million \nto hospitals. Shouldn't we be taking care of problems like that?\n  Will there be enough community health centers taking Medicaid? Will \nMedicaid beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled get into nursing \nhomes if they need to do that?\n  Will States cut mental health services because Congress didn't \nprevent them from doing so in this bill, even at the same time giving \nthem $87 billion, which is about $76 billion more than the demands of \nMedicaid because of unemployment?\n  Will there be pediatricians or children's hospitals there for \nchildren on Medicaid?\n  If the Senate does nothing to protect access to these vital \nproviders, nobody will be able to assure the people who count on \nMedicaid that the care they need will be there for them. I have filed \nan amendment that prevents States from generally cutting eligibility \nand benefits and provider payment rates while they are receiving the \n$87 billion in additional aid. In other words, I go beyond just a \nrequirement in the underlying bill that eligibility can't be changed. \nWe go to benefits and we go to protecting providers.\n  If we want to protect Medicaid, then we ought to really protect \nMedicaid. I hope we will do that by adopting this amendment.\n  As written, the bill gives States $87 billion, also in the hopes that \nStates do not take action that is contrary to economic growth. Here \nagain, I use the word ``hope'' because the bill doesn't do enough to \nmake sure States do what is best for the economy either. We should ask \nfor more guarantees that States will spend the money appropriately and \nnot make decisions that work against economic recovery. If Congress \ngives States $87 billion and tells them not to cut Medicaid, should \nCongress also tell States not to raise taxes because, if States react \nto their deficit by increasing taxes--even in view of getting this $87 \nbillion--they will defeat the goal of economic recovery that we in \nCongress are trying to make happen through this legislation. For sure \nyou do not increase taxes at a time of economic distress because it is \ngoing to make that distress worse. It makes no sense for us to leave \nthe door wide open then for States to raise taxes while getting a $87 \nbillion windfall from the Federal Government.\n  I have an amendment that prevents States from raising income, \npersonal property, or sales taxes as a condition of the receipt of $87 \nbillion in Federal assistance. If Congress gives States $87 billion and \ntells them not to cut Medicaid, should Congress also tell States not to \nraise tuition at State universities? There is a report out just today \nthat I heard about on the news about how unaffordable college is \nbecoming, particularly to middle-income Americans. People are not going \nto go to college even though a college degree is very essential for \nsuccess in our society, and we are here giving $87 billion to States \nwithout any direction to the States whether or not they increase \ntuition once again, as they tend to do every year.\n  If States can price young people out of an education, that does \nnothing for preparing our workforce for the 21st century. So I also \nhave an amendment that prevents States from raising tuition rates at \nState colleges and universities as a condition of the receipt of the \n$87 billion of Federal assistance.\n  For $87 billion--we are talking about $87 billion, just to give to \nthe States--shouldn't Congress expect States to modernize their \nMedicaid Program? We have heard my friend and colleague, Dr. Coburn, \nhaving an amendment requiring States to improve chronic care\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nin Medicaid and develop medical homes as a condition of the receipt of \n$87 billion in Federal assistance--because these things are some of the \nbest advancements you can make in the practice of medicine that are \ngoing to improve the quality of life, but more important they save \ntaxpayer dollars or even private dollars. For $87 billion, what does \nthis bill do to ensure that all those Federal taxpayers' dollars are \nbeing spent appropriately? Almost nothing.\n  During the markup we were able to get funding for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services Office of Inspector General increased by \n$3.25 million. For those of you doing the math back home, $3,250,000 is \njust under four one hundredths of 1 percent of the $87 billion Medicaid \nspending on the bill. Senator Cornyn and I have an amendment that \nrequires States to do something to improve their waste, fraud, and \nabuse rates in exchange for the $87 billion in Federal taxpayers' \nmoney. That is what that money for the inspector general is all about. \nIt provides a list of eight options to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, \nand the Secretary can provide more options at his or her discretion as \nwell.\n  States are given time to plan and implement options. States can \nchoose to make their payments transparent. States can choose to \nimplement recovery audit contractors--as is used very successfully in \nMedicare. States can choose the Medicare/Medicaid data matching \nprogram. States can implement third party liability programs that find \nother insurers who should pay before Medicaid pays out of the public \nfisc. States can implement electronic verification systems to limit \nfraud and abuse. States can implement the recently passed Paris system \nto protect the integrity of the program. States can comply with the \nrecently implemented disproportionate share hospital audit requirement. \nStates can choose to increase their budget for Medicare fraud control \nunits. These are all very reasonable steps that States could and should \ntake, if Congress is going to send them $87 billion in additional \nMedicaid dollars, when only $10.8 billion of that is necessary to take \ncare of the people who will go on Medicaid because they are unemployed.\n  They do not have to do all these options I just gave. They only have \nto do four of these many options; just show the American people that \nStates can take four simple steps to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. \nShouldn't Congress at least ask that much of the State, for $87 \nbillion? If Congress is going to give States $87 billion in Medicaid \nfunds, shouldn't the formula be fair?\n  While I admire the hard work devoted to the exceedingly complex \nformula in this bill, it simply is not fair to certain States. States \nwith low unemployment rates, States that have not seen the recession \nhit in full yet--those States will see less of the $87 billion than \nother States.\n  Senator Bingaman started down this road to correct this in our \nFinance Committee markup. You have an amendment that picks up the baton \nand drives it the rest of the way home. Each State gets a flat 9.5-\npercent increase in their FMAP payment and States can choose which 9 \nconsecutive quarters in an 11-quarter period best fits the economic \nneeds of their specific State. This is a better, this is a fairer way \nto spend $87 billion.\n  If Congress passes all of this Medicaid spending, what guarantee do \nwe have that the fiscal challenges facing Medicaid in the future will \nbe solved? Sooner rather than later, we all must recognize our \nentitlements are unsustainable as currently constructed.\n  President Obama has acknowledged this himself on numerous occasions \nrecently. One of my concerns about the additional Medicaid funding that \nis in this bill is that it places too much emphasis on Medicaid in the \nhere and now, the short term, and ignores future fiscal challenges down \nthe road, the next two or three decades.\n\n  Just last year the Center for Medicare Services Office of Actuary \nreported that Medicaid costs will double over the next decade. That is \nsimply unsustainable, and I think every Senator knows that. It is \ncritical that both the Federal Government and States recognize the \nfiscal challenges we face and the need to take action right now. \nSenators Cornyn and Hatch and I have an amendment that requires States \nto submit a report to the Secretary detailing how they plan to address \nMedicaid sustainability. It is critical that we look at the future of \nMedicaid if Congress is to give States $87 billion in additional \nMedicaid funding when it is only going to take about $10.8 billion to \ntake care of the uninsured because of the economic recession we are in.\n  The House bill has a provision that fundamentally changes Medicaid. \nMedicaid is a program that is generally, as we know, for low-income \npregnant women, children, and low-income seniors. Under the House bill, \nthe Federal taxpayer would step in to pay the full cost to provide \nMedicaid coverage to people who lose their jobs and are not eligible \nfor continuing coverage from their employer. Normally, Medicaid is \nsupposed to be a shared State/Federal responsibility, with the States \nand the Federal Government sharing the costs on a national average--57 \npercent to 43 percent. In my particular State, the Federal Government \npays 62 percent--but not in this new Medicaid Program the House would \ncreate because under the House bill--get this--the Federal Government, \nfor the first time ever, would pick up 100 percent of the costs. The \nHouse bill transforms Medicaid into a coverage for anyone who loses \ntheir job if they do not have access to COBRA coverage from their \nformer employer, and the House bill would offer this taxpayer-paid \nMedicaid coverage regardless of how wealthy they might be.\n  Now Medicaid is for low-income people, but it is being expanded in \nthe House to, no matter how wealthy you might be, but being unemployed, \nyou could qualify for Medicaid. Tell me if that is not a waste of \ntaxpayers' money. It is taxing low-income people to help wealthy \npeople, just the opposite of what we normally do in this country.\n  With all the fiscal challenges this country faces, and with \nentitlement spending already out of control, this ought to be seen by \nevery Member of the Senate as an outrage. Obviously, it was not an \noutrage to the 244 people who voted for it in the other body. I hope \nfolks on the other side of the aisle will come to the floor and defend \na policy that, if you are unemployed--I suppose if you are an \nunemployed CEO who previously made $5 million, you can walk into the \nState office and get Medicaid. I don't understand it.\n  My bigger concern is what happens in 2 years when the money goes \naway. On December 31, 2010, what happens to all the people who have \nbeen covered by this massive expansion of Medicaid entitlement? What \nhappens to all of the people who have been added to the rolls in States \nthat expand coverage with the $87 billion influx in this bill, when \nonly $10.8 billion is needed, according to CBO, based on the Urban \nInstitute program, for those who are going to be unemployed? Mr. \nPresident, $76 billion more is going to be spent someplace.\n  Someone on the other side needs to convince me that this policy we \nare putting in place is truly temporary. I do not buy that it is \ntemporary. Every one of us knows the States will be coming back in the \nmiddle of next year to beg for an extension so they don't have to cut \nMedicaid rolls. There are too many former Governors in this Chamber for \nanyone to argue that it is not going to happen.\n  I know a lot of people have worked very hard putting this bill \ntogether. I respect that they have worked hard. I wish they would have \nworked smarter. Giving States $87 billion even though that is about \neight times what they need to stay ahead of enrollment-driven Medicaid \nincreases is not well thought out. Giving States $87 billion while \nstill allowing them to cut their Medicaid Program is not well thought \nout. Giving States $87 billion while still allowing them to raise taxes \nor tuition is not well thought out. Giving States $87 billion without \nrequiring them to do a better job of addressing fraud, waste, and abuse \nis not well thought out. Giving States $87 billion without making them \naddress the fiscal sustainability of their Medicaid Program is not well \nthought out. A massive expansion of the entitlements under the guise of \nthe word ``temporary'' is not well thought out.\n  This bill is cobbled together--a spending party. It is not well \nthought out. It is out of control. The Senate should support numerous \namendments, as I have discussed this afternoon, to\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\naddress the shortcomings that occur when partisan bills are moved too \nquickly.\n  I filed what is referred to as a Grassley-Schumer amendment to amend \nthe American Opportunity Tax Credit work. In my opinion, the amendment \nmakes the American Opportunity Tax Credit better. Senator Schumer \nagrees with the me, or obviously he would not be cosponsoring this with \nme, because he is joining me.\n  I thank Senator Schumer for his support and look forward to working \nwith him on simplifying the education tax credit Congress has put into \nthe Tax Code. I have long been an advocate for helping Americans afford \ncollege through the Tax Code. So when I was chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I successfully included a number of education measures in \nthat tax bill of 2001. These measures were enacted into law as part of \na bipartisan agreement--I want to emphasize, bipartisan agreement. Now \nAmericans can take an above-the-line deduction for the cost of higher \neducation expenses because of that bill. In addition, people with \nstudent loans have greater flexibility when deducting student loan \ninterest. I have also promoted section 529 qualified tuition programs \nby repealing the sunset provisions Congress imposed back in 2001.\n  The other education tax provisions we included in the 2001 bipartisan \ntax legislation should also be made permanent. Several provisions would \nfall into that category, but that debate will be left to another day. \nWe are not pursuing that on this bill.\n  Today, Senator Schumer and I are here to build on the American \nOpportunity Tax Credit included in the legislation we are debating \ntoday. This is how we do it. The amendment Senator Schumer and I are \noffering would increase the tax credit while maintaining a refundable \nportion of the tax credit, which will help low-income individuals with \ncollege expenses. The amendment would also spread out the way the tax \ncredit is calculated. Under this amendment, more Americans will receive \na more robust and uniform tax credit regardless of income. In addition, \ntaxpayers currently claiming the HOPE scholarship credit will get a \nbigger tax benefit. Again, low-income individuals will continue to \nbenefit from the credit's refundability feature, which I will note has \nnever been done in the area of education tax until now.\n  If my Senate colleagues argue that the Grassley-Schumer amendment \nadds to the cost of the stimulus package--which, in full disclosure, \nthe amendment adds $3 billion to the existing $10 billion price tag on \nthe American Opportunity Tax Credit--I will tell them to cut wasteful \nspending that is included in the bill.\n  The Grassley-Schumer amendment is stimulative. The same cannot be \nsaid for the spending provisions in the bill, including millions upon \nmillions of dollars for parking garages or millions upon millions of \ndollars for swimming pools, water slides. This spending does not pass \nthe stimulative test.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has even said that under the \nGrassley-Schumer amendment, we will ``lower the cost of higher \neducation, which will induce more individuals to enroll in higher \neducation programs.''\n  So I hope everybody agrees that this is a very good thing, \nparticularly considering the fact that there was this report on the \nnews today where there is, particularly because of the recession we are \nin, not enough middle-income people going to college because of the \nproblems we have. So we need to make more help available for people \ngoing to college, especially for displaced workers who would like to go \nback to school for training in another career. That is more essential \nduring an economic downturn like we now have. An education means jobs, \nand that is what a large part of this stimulus package is all about.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Grassley-Schumer amendment.\n  Lastly, and then I will yield the floor, I have a statement I wish to \nread entitled ``CBO Analysis'' that shows stimulus bill jobs to cost as \nmuch as $300,000 each. A preliminary analysis by the Congressional \nBudget Office shows that the jobs created by the economic stimulus \nlegislation being debated in the Senate will cost taxpayers between \n$100,000 and $300,000 apiece. These numbers should be contrasted to \nthose under the January baseline of the Congressional Budget Office in \nwhich there is no stimulus. That shows the gross domestic product per \nworker is about $100,000. The new analysis indicates the cost of each \nstimulus job to be as much as three times more than jobs created \nwithout the stimulus bill.\n  There has been a lot of talk about bang for the buck, but there is no \ntalk about actually making sure it happens so that Americans get the \nhelp they need. Before Congress spends another $1 trillion, we ought to \nmake sure we are getting our money's worth. Congressional leaders \nshould postpone a final vote on a stimulus bill until the Senate has \nhad the opportunity to carefully review a full analysis of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the February 4, 2009, \nCBO report printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has conducted an analysis of the macroeconomic \n     impact of the Inouye-Baucus amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute to H.R. 1. CBO estimates that this Senate \n     legislation would raise output and lower unemployment for \n     several years, with effects broadly similar to those of H.R. \n     1 as introduced. In the longer run, the legislation would \n     result in a slight decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) \n     compared with CBO's baseline economic forecast.\n\n\n                    Effects on Output and Employment\n\n       The macroeconomic impacts of any economic stimulus program \n     are very uncertain. Economic theories differ in their \n     predictions about the effectiveness of stimulus. Furthermore, \n     large fiscal stimulus is rarely attempted, so it is difficult \n     to distinguish among alternative estimates of how large the \n     macroeconomic effects would be. For those reasons, some \n     economists remain skeptical that there would be any \n     significant effects, while others expect very large ones.\n       CBO has developed a range of estimates of the effects of \n     the Senate legislation on GDP and employment that encompasses \n     a majority of economists' views. According to these \n     estimates, implementing the Senate legislation would increase \n     GDP relative to the agency's baseline forecast by between 1.2 \n     percent and 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. It \n     would also increase employment at that point in time by 1.3 \n     million to 3.9 million jobs, as shown in Table 1. In that \n     quarter, the unemployment rate would be 0.7 percentage points \n     to 2.1 percentage points lower than the baseline forecast of \n     8.7 percent. The effects of the legislation would diminish \n     rapidly after 2010. By the end of 2011, the Senate \n     legislation would increase GDP by 0.4 percent to 1.2 percent, \n     would raise employment by 0.6 million to 1.9 million jobs, \n     and would lower the unemployment rate by 0.3 percentage \n     points to 1.0 percentage point.\n       Those estimated effects differ modestly from CBO's \n     estimates for H.R. 1 as introduced. In particular, the \n     effects on output and employment are slightly higher in 2009 \n     and 2010, but slightly lower in 2011. The differences stem \n     from three main sources. First, the Senate legislation's \n     provisions regarding the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which \n     do not appear in the House bill, would add stimulus to the \n     economy, especially in 2010. Second, the Senate legislation \n     would allow faster spending from the State Fiscal \n     Stabilization Fund, increasing such spending by about $20 \n     billion over the 2009-2010 period compared with that under \n     the House bill (and decreasing spending correspondingly in \n     the following years). And last, the estimated decrease in \n     withholding (and thus the reduction in revenues) associated \n     with the Making Work Pay Credit would be greater in 2009 \n     under the Senate legislation than under H.R. 1.\n\n\n      effects of various types of legislative provisions on output\n\n       Although the Senate legislation has numerous detailed \n     provisions, the macroeconomic effects can be illustrated by \n     considering the provisions in seven categories. Table 2 shows \n     the range of estimated effects on the economy--the multiplier \n     effects--of a one-time increase of a dollar of additional \n     spending or a dollar reduction in taxes. For all of the \n     categories that would be affected by the Senate legislation, \n     the resulting budgetary changes are estimated to raise output \n     in the short run, albeit by different amounts.\n       The numbers in Table 2 indicate the cumulative impact on \n     GDP over several quarters. For example, a one-time increase \n     in federal purchases of goods and services of $1.00 in the \n     second quarter of this year would raise GDP by $1.00 to $2.50 \n     in total over several quarters, with most of that effect in \n     the first two quarters and little effect beyond a year.\n       As shown in the first two categories in the table, direct \n     purchases of goods and services by governments, including \n     investment in infrastructure, tend to have relatively large \n     effects on GDP. Because infrastructure spending takes time to \n     occur, increased funding\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\n     for that purpose would not boost outlays or GDP much this \n     year, but it would probably provide significant stimulus from \n     2010 through 2012.\n       Grants to state and local governments (such as increased \n     assistance for education) might not increase state spending \n     for the programs designated in the grants but, instead, might \n     free up funds that the states would otherwise spend on those \n     programs. States could use those extra funds in a variety of \n     ways: direct purchases of goods and services (or smaller cuts \n     in such purchases), tax cuts (or smaller tax increases), \n     transfer payments, or reduced borrowing. The impact of grants \n     therefore would depend on how states used them.\n       Transfers to persons (for example, unemployment insurance \n     and nutrition assistance) would also have a significant \n     impact on GDP. Transfers have a relatively strong effect on \n     consumption because they tend to go to people, such as the \n     poor or unemployed, who are likely to spend much of any \n     additional income. For that reason and because transfers can \n     be increased quickly, they are estimated to have a \n     significant impact on GDP by early 2010. Transfers also \n     include refundable tax credits, which have an impact similar \n     to that of a temporary tax cut.\n       A dollar's worth of a temporary tax cut would have a \n     smaller effect on GDP than a dollar's worth of direct \n     purchases or transfers, because a significant share of the \n     tax cut would probably be saved. The amount saved, and \n     therefore the size of the effect on GDP, would depend on who \n     received the tax cut and how temporary it would be. Most \n     households probably save most of a temporary tax cut, to keep \n     their purchases relatively smooth over time. However, the \n     predominantly lower-income households that spend all of their \n     income and would like to borrow funds to spend more if they \n     could (that is, households that are ``liquidity \n     constrained'') probably spend a large share of temporary \n     boosts to income. In addition, the longer a tax cut is \n     expected to last, the greater the impact on total after-tax \n     income, and the larger the likely effect on consumption.\n       CBO's analysis divides the temporary tax cuts in the Senate \n     legislation into those that would go primarily to higher-\n     income households and last for only one year (mostly the \n     provisions affecting the AMT) and those that would go \n     primarily to lower- and middle-income households and last for \n     two years (predominantly the Making Work Pay Credit), with \n     the former having a considerably lower range of multipliers \n     than the latter. Taken together, the temporary nonbusiness \n     tax cuts in the Senate legislation would reduce revenues much \n     more in 2010 than in 2009 because much of the reduction in \n     taxes would be realized by households when they filed their \n     returns in 2010.\n       The provision for greater tax-loss carrybacks would result \n     in a large up-front cost to the government, but the effect of \n     that provision on business spending would probably be small \n     because it primarily would affect firms' after-tax income \n     rather than their marginal incentives for new investment. \n     Therefore, the effect of the provision on revenues would be \n     significantly greater than its effect on the economy.\n\n\n             the relationship between output and employment\n\n       CBO derived its estimates of the effect of the Senate \n     legislation on employment from the estimated effect on GDP. \n     Historical evidence suggests that GDP growth that is 1 \n     percentage point faster over a year (relative to a baseline \n     forecast) will cause the unemployment rate to decline by a \n     little more than half a percentage point (relative to a \n     corresponding baseline forecast). The fall in the \n     unemployment rate leads more people to enter the labor force \n     and seek jobs and fewer to drop out. Therefore, employment \n     rises both from a decline in the number of unemployed \n     workers and a decline in the number of people out of the \n     labor force. In addition, some workers otherwise working \n     part time move to full-time status.\n       The change in employment relative to the change in GDP in \n     CBO's estimates is small compared with that in most industry-\n     based studies of stimulus. By the end of 2010, CBO estimates, \n     about $140,000 of additional GDP would lead to one additional \n     person employed. That relationship is similar to those \n     indicated by other macroeconomic studies of stimulus \n     proposals. However, a number of other sorts of studies imply \n     more employment per dollar of additional GDP. Because the \n     macroeconomic studies use the historical relationship between \n     changes in economic growth and changes in jobs, they \n     incorporate a number of broad economic effects. For example, \n     output per employee tends to fall in a recession because \n     employers try not to fire their best workers even as they cut \n     production in response to decreased demand. Therefore, as \n     fiscal stimulus increases demand, firms can ramp up \n     production without increasing employment proportionally. \n     Historical evidence thus suggests that fiscal stimulus boosts \n     both productivity and hours of work as well as employment. \n     Studies that ignore those effects are likely to overstate the \n     impact of fiscal stimulus on employment.\n\n\n                       Long-Run Effects on Output\n\n       Most of the budgetary effects of the Senate legislation \n     occur over the next few years. Even if the fiscal stimulus \n     persisted, however, the short-run effects on output that \n     operate by increasing demand for goods and services would \n     eventually fade away. In the long run, the economy produces \n     close to its potential output on average, and that potential \n     level is determined by the stock of productive capital, the \n     supply of labor, and productivity. Short-run stimulative \n     policies can affect long-run output by influencing those \n     three factors, although such effects would generally be \n     smaller than the short-run impact of those policies on \n     demand.\n       In contrast to its positive near-term macroeconomic \n     effects, the Senate legislation would reduce output slightly \n     in the long run, CBO estimates, as would other similar \n     proposals. The principal channel for this effect is that the \n     legislation would result in an increase in government debt. \n     To the extent that people hold their wealth as government \n     bonds rather than in a form that can be used to finance \n     private investment, the increased debt would tend to reduce \n     the stock of productive capital. In economic parlance, the \n     debt would ``crowd out'' private investment. (Crowding out is \n     unlikely to occur in the short run under current conditions, \n     because most firms are lowering investment in response to \n     reduced demand, which stimulus can offset in part.) CBO's \n     basic assumption is that, in the long run, each dollar of \n     additional debt crowds out about a third of a dollar's worth \n     of private domestic capital (with the remainder of the \n     rise in debt offset by increases in private saving and \n     inflows of foreign capital). Because of uncertainty about \n     the degree of crowding out, however, CBO has incorporated \n     both more and less crowding out into its range of \n     estimates of the long-run effects of the Senate \n     legislation.\n       The crowding-out effect would be offset somewhat by other \n     factors. Some of the Senate legislation's provisions, such as \n     funding for improvements to roads and highways, might add to \n     the economy's potential output in much the same way that \n     private capital investment does. Other provisions, such as \n     funding for grants to increase access to college education, \n     could raise long-term productivity by enhancing people's \n     skills. And some provisions would create incentives for \n     increased private investment. According to CBO's estimates, \n     provisions that could add to long-term output account for \n     roughly one-quarter of the legislation's budgetary cost.\n       The effect of individual provisions could vary greatly. For \n     example, increased spending for basic research and education \n     might affect output only after a number of years, but once \n     those investments began to boost GDP, they might pay off over \n     more years than would the average investment in physical \n     capital (in economic terms, they have a low rate of \n     depreciation). Therefore, in any one year, their contribution \n     to output might be less than that of the average private \n     investment, even if their overall contribution to \n     productivity over their lifetime was just as high. Moreover, \n     while some carefully chosen government investments might be \n     as productive as private investment, other government \n     projects would probably fall well short of that benchmark, \n     particularly in an environment in which rapid spending is a \n     significant goal. The response of state and local governments \n     that received federal stimulus grants would also affect their \n     long-run impact; those governments might apply some of that \n     money to investments they would have carried out anyway, thus \n     freeing funds for noninvestment purposes and lowering the \n     long-run economic return to those grants. In order to \n     encompass a wide range of potential effects, CBO used two \n     assumptions in developing its estimates: first, that all of \n     the relevant investments together would, on average, add as \n     much to output as would a comparable amount of private \n     investment, and, second, that they would, on average, not add \n     to output at all.\n       In principle, the legislation's long-run impact on output \n     also would depend on whether it permanently changed \n     incentives to work or save. However, according to CBO's \n     estimates, the legislation would not have any significant \n     permanent effects on those incentives.\n       Including the effects of both crowding out of private \n     investment (which would reduce output in the long run) and \n     possibly productive government investment (which could \n     increase output), CBO estimates that by 2019 the Senate \n     legislation would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on \n     net. H.R. 1, as passed by the House, would have similar long-\n     run effects. CBO has not estimated the macroeconomic \n     effects of the stimulus proposals year by year beyond \n     2011.\n\n\n                  other effects of stimulus proposals\n\n       It is important to note that effects on GDP, the aggregate \n     domestic output of the economy, do not necessarily translate \n     into effects on people's well-being. First, the part of GDP \n     that contributes directly to people's welfare is consumption. \n     However, changes in GDP do not necessarily imply \n     corresponding changes in consumption. For example, if GDP \n     rises because foreigners finance greater investment, much of \n     the additional income generated by the investment will flow \n     overseas as payments to foreigners and will not be available \n     to support higher consumption.\n       More fundamentally, many things that make people better off \n     do not appear in GDP at all. For example, healthier children \n     or shorter commute times can improve people's welfare without \n     necessarily increasing the nation's measured output in the \n     long run (though spending in those areas would still provide \n     short-run stimulus). Even legislation explicitly intended to \n     affect output may also seek to accomplish other goals and can \n     be evaluated accordingly.\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

Mr. President, I rise to address comments made by my \ncolleagues regarding several measures for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act: the $248 \nmillion provided for the construction of a consolidated headquarters, \nand the $500 million provided to fund construction and renovation of \nfire stations. These are both projects that will save lives, save \nmoney, and most importantly for this bill, create jobs.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has included funding for the DHS \nheadquarters project among a list of what he refers to as ``cats and \ndogs'' which he is intent on stripping from the bill. But the DHS \nconsolidation project is far more important to our Nation than those \ncomments might suggest.\n  DHS is responsible for leading a unified, national effort to secure \nthe United States, yet the Department does not have all the necessary \ntools to do so, including an adequate headquarters. DHS is currently \nspread throughout more than 70 buildings located on 40 sites across the \nnational capital region making communication, coordination, and \ncooperation among DHS components a significant challenge. Moreover, the \nexisting space housing the Office of the Secretary, Intelligence, and \nother key functions is grossly inadequate, contributes to recruitment \nand morale problems, and is simply not befitting a cabinet agency \ncritical to Americans' security.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that funding this important \nhomeland security project is not appropriate in the stimulus bill. I \nrespectfully disagree.\n  The DHS headquarters project will create jobs. The final \nenvironmental impact statement for the headquarters plan found that the \noverall project would create direct employment opportunities for over \n32,000 people in the national capital region. Put another way, the \neconomy would gain payroll earnings of approximately $1.2 billion \nduring construction and renovation of the St. Elizabeths West Campus \nplus approximately $3.8 billion in additional expenditures during the \nconstruction phases.\n  Funding this project through the stimulus will also expedite the \ncreation of these jobs. DHS estimates that the funding included in this \nbill will allow the headquarters project to be completed 12 months \nearlier than previously planned. This means funding will be spent into \nthe local economy earlier creating real jobs and stimulating economic \ngrowth in DC, Maryland, and Virginia when it is most needed.\n  This bill will also save money. Accelerating the project will reduce \nthe cost of the overall headquarters project by $18 million. Moreover, \nthe Federal Government will be able to negotiate better prices with \ncontractors because they can sign larger contracts up front which will \nresult in additional cost savings.\n  In short, this project creates a win-win situation by creating jobs \ntoday and saving money for the taxpayer in the long run. And, most \nimportantly, by fostering a more efficient and effective Department of \nHomeland Security, it will make our country safer.\n  I would also like to take a moment to address the mischaracterization \nby some of my colleagues and members of the media that this money will \nonly be spent on furniture. The $248 million allocated to DHS will fund \nconstruction, IT infrastructure, security, and a host of other \nactivities associated with constructing a building. Furniture is one \nallowable use of the funding, however less than 7 percent of the total \nfunding proposed for the headquarters in this bill would be allocated \ntowards furniture.\n  And I would also like to address the comments of my colleague from \nOklahoma regarding the value and the appropriateness of providing funds \nfor the construction of fire stations. I would argue that as an issue \nof security, safety, and of job creation, there is nothing more \nvaluable or appropriate.\n  The Nation's fire houses are in dire need of attention. In cities and \ntowns across America, they are too few in number, aging, and crumbling, \nand as a result, they are inadequate to provide the necessary \nprotection to families and communities. The U.S. Fire Administration--a \npart of the Department of Homeland Security--has provided a grim \npicture in its second needs assessment of the U.S. Fire Services. \nConsider the following: 60 to 75 percent of fire departments have too \nfew stations to provide an optimal response; 36 percent of fire \nstations in the United States are over 40 years old; 54 percent of fire \nstations lack backup power; and 72 percent of fire stations are not \nequipped for exhaust emission control.\n  These figures show that our country's fire stations are just not able \nto ensure that firefighters can serve the needs of their communities \nwith the adequate safety and effectiveness.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\nThese infrastructure problems are spread across the country, in \ncommunities large and small. Permit me to address the need for building \nmore fire stations, from the ground up, to ensure that there are enough \nto protect the public.\n  Without an adequate number of fire stations, the response time of \nfirefighters may increase significantly in incidents where every moment \ncounts. A fire doubles in size every 60 seconds. A heart attack victim \nsuffers irreversible brain damage after four minutes. So imagine the \nimpact on a neighborhood where the fire houses are spread too far \napart--imagine the increase in risk of death, injury, and property \ndamage. This is a risk we cannot afford to take.\n  This funding, which would be distributed by the Department of \nHomeland Security to the communities with the greatest need, could be \napplied immediately to projects in need of attention right now. The \nU.S. Conference of Mayors has identified over 100 fire station \nconstruction or renovation projects that are ``Ready to Go,'' so \nthousands of jobs would be created immediately with this $500 million. \nThis is funding that we cannot afford to trim from this bill--both for \nthe jobs it creates, and the safety and security it will provide for \nour communities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at the facts. These projects, which \nare essential to the security of our Nation and our communities, will \nalso create jobs and stimulate the economy. It is not wasteful spending \nand belongs in the stimulus bill we are considering today.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, earlier today Senator McConnell singled \nout for criticism funding in this bill for upgrades of outdated \ninformation technology at the State Department and U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development.\n  He said: ``$524 million for a program at the State Department that \npromises to create 388 jobs . . . that comes to $1.35 million per \njob.'' He went on to say: ``$100 million for 300 jobs at the U.S. \nAgency for International Development, $333,333 per job.''\n  With all due respect to my friend, the minority leader and former \nchairman of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee who was a \nstrong supporter of these programs in the past, that is a simplistic \nstatement which does not tell the whole story.\n  First, it undercounts the number of jobs these funds will generate, \nas I will explain. And second, it implies that the only value of a \nstimulus project is the jobs created, as if the resulting product is of \nno value. If we adopt that standard, I hate to think what the minority \nleader would say about other Federal projects, whether the cost of \nbuilding the Washington Monument or a project in his State.\n  Computer systems are inherently not personnel intensive, but they do \nhave a significant impact on the supply chain economy.\n  The State Department's and USAID's estimate of the number of jobs \nrelated to information technology upgrades is approximately 688 jobs. I \ndoubt the unemployed citizens of Kentucky, any more than the citizens \nof Hawaii, would scoff at that number.\n  But this does not take into account the jobs created across the \ncountry when a Federal agency has a major investment in computer \ntechnology and systems. Much of the hardware would be manufactured by \nworkers here in the U.S. Other components are made overseas and shipped \nto our ports, like Long Beach, CA.\n  U.S. workers unload the container ships and load the computer parts \nonto trucks or rail cars. Those trucks or trains travel across the \ncountry, and their drivers purchase fuel and food. The components are \nthen unloaded and delivered to their final destination.\n  The 688 jobs cited by the Senate Appropriations Committee were merely \nthose jobs directly identified with installing these computer systems \nand providing services to these Federal agencies. It does not take into \naccount the impact of manufacturing, purchasing, and transporting new \nequipment.\n  But this funding will do more than create jobs.\n  The information technology upgrades proposed in this bill would \nimprove the worldwide technology capabilities of two Federal agencies \nwhich are out of warranty and not up to current user demands. These \ntechnology systems form the core of communications between Washington \nand posts overseas.\n  Some of these funds would be used to upgrade secure phones as the \ncurrent secret level phones are no longer supported by the available \ntechnology.\n  The Department has identified serious weaknesses in cybersecurity \nwhich these funds will address. Recent legislation mandating the \nComprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative requires all Federal \nagencies to become compliant with new standards to prevent cybercrime.\n  Federal agencies working overseas are particularly vulnerable to \nattack from foreign agents attempting to hack into the State \nDepartment's computer system. Sometimes this is to gain intelligence, \nbut recently entire government computer systems have been taken down by \nmalicious actors.\n  We cannot take this risk, which is why the Congress supported \nlegislation last year to improve cybersecurity measures. Funds in this \nbill would address that need. Without these funds the State Department \nwould not likely be able to make these critical investments for some \nyears.\n  Funds will also be used to construct a back-up site for the worldwide \ninformation technology system, to prevent a single-point failure in \ncommunications. This need was identified after the 9/11 attacks by many \nindependent reviews, but there have not been sufficient funds in the \nbudget.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I would like to talk about a few of the amendments I \nwill be offering to this very important piece of legislation. Let me \nsay this again: This is a very important piece of legislation. I think \neveryone needs to take a moment, take a deep breath, and consider what \nthe alternatives are. Either we come together in the Senate over the \nnext few days and pass this bill or we do nothing--or we do nothing. I \nwill tell you, where I live in Missouri, ``nothing'' is not an option. \nIf people think we can do nothing and this problem will begin to take \ncare of itself, they do not understand the economic situation we are \nfacing. So I have no problem with a full debate. I have no problem with \nus looking at every line and figuring out whether there is money we can \ntake out that is wasteful or not stimulative. But at the end of the \nday, this notion that we are going to put this on the shelf--are you \nkidding me? Put it on a shelf.\n  We have a crisis in this country. We are in a dramatic recession. The \nGovernment must act to stimulate job creation. If we do not, then we \nare going to have some explaining to do. Being brave and bold enough to \ndo something is always harder than finding something wrong with \nsomething. And we will always be able to find something wrong in \neverything we do around here. So buck up. Be strong. Move forward for \nthe American people because that is what they said to us last November. \nThat is what they want. They wanted it to be a new day.\n  I am glad we are talking with each other. I am glad we are debating \namendments. I am glad we are working in a bipartisan fashion to try to \npull some of the things out of this bill that have distracted the \nconversation about the Economic Recovery Act. They have distracted us. \nThey put us on defense. Excuse me, we are on offense. We are trying to \nhelp our economy. Sitting back and shooting that thing is not going to \nget us there.\n  There are some things I think we can do to make it better, and \nseveral of the amendments I have offered have to do with our ability to \nmake this process transparent and to make sure we are accountable for \nthe money.\n  First, I have submitted an amendment to strengthen the whistleblower \nprotection. We have to make sure our whistleblowers are well taken care \nof. Some of the best information we get in cleaning up Government comes \nfrom inside the companies that work for the Federal Government. We gave \nthese protections to defense contractors in last year's Defense \nAuthorization Act. We need to give it to every Federal contractor so \nthat we can get the best information possible about what is going on \ninternally in these companies as they spend public money.\n  Another amendment improves the transparency requirements for the \npublic database Web site.\n  We need this public database to work, because it is a new tool to \nallow us to track all the money to make sure the money is going where \nit was intended to go, to make sure we don't have fraud, waste, and \nabuse in these contracts and programs, as we fund the various \ninfrastructure needs of the country, whether it is building a school, a \nbridge, or an electric grid.\n  Another amendment I have will boost the resources for the inspectors \ngeneral. Those are our cops in terms of accountability. We cannot do \nthis kind of government spending without giving the same kind of \nincrease to the inspector general community for them to do their jobs.\n  Also additional funding for acquisition personnel is included. \nAcquisition personnel are going to be called to this cause in a \ndramatic fashion. As we spend this money, we have to make sure we have \nenough folks that we can monitor the contracts, make sure the contracts \nare drafted in a way that protects taxpayer money. So we need to \nincrease both acquisition personnel and inspector general resources.\n  There is also another technical amendment I will be offering that has \nto do with a vagary in Missouri law and another State's laws as it \nrelates to the ability of my State and another State to use water and \nsewer funding.\n  Let me say this before yielding the floor. I compliment the President \ntoday on the dramatic steps he took on curbing executive pay in the \nvarious companies that have received Federal money. The proposal he \nlaid out today is aggressive. It is broad in scope. It is just what the \ndoctor ordered. I am so pleased that not only the President but Senator \nWyden and Senator Snowe offered another amendment in the area of taxing \nsome of the excessive bonuses that have occurred. We are watching Wall \nStreet. We are paying attention. Please behave as you should, if you \nhave taken this kind of public money. Please understand it is not \nbusiness as usual. It is not luxury retreats and fancy parties and big-\ntime bonuses. It is a new day. Please start behaving as if you get it. \nBecause if we cannot convince the American people that we are looking \nafter them, we will never get the recovery we must have so that \neveryone has the opportunity to succeed. That is all it is about, that \nopportunity that is unique to America--that everyone can have a chance \nto succeed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 179\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Before we start voting in a little less than an hour, I \nencourage all colleagues to look seriously at and to support the Vitter \namendment which will be voted on tonight. The Vitter amendment is an \nattempt to start the important work of cutting out some of the clearly \nnonstimulative parts of this bill. Fundamentally, it does two things. \nFirst, it cuts out $35 billion of spending, which is not stimulative, \nwhich is not focused on quick job creation and economic stimulus. It \ntakes that out of the bill. Secondly, it takes out the Davis-Bacon \nlanguage, which is not part of any reasonable stimulus program and \nwhich will, in fact, cost the Government more money by significantly \nincreasing labor costs on many projects. That has been estimated to \ncost about $17 billion. The American people get it. This is a big \ndebate, an important matter they have been watching carefully. Every \nday that goes by, they understand ever more clearly that this is a big \nspending bill with the whole spectrum of traditional big government \nWashington spending items, a laundry list, and that is not the same \nanimal at all as real focused job creation, economic stimulus.\n  There is now a plurality of all Americans who think this is a bad \nbill, not stimulative, and it should be either dramatically changed--\nnot at the margin but at the core--or defeated. Quite frankly, that \nplurality is growing every hour of every day. They are staggered, the \nLouisianians I have talked to, by two things. First, the enormous size \nand cost of the bill. This is a direct cost. There is no argument that \nwe can recoup this as possibly we can recoup some of the TARP money. \nThis is a direct cost. It adds on to the debt and the deficit penny by \npenny. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. As one of my colleagues \nsaid: A trillion dollars or nearly that surely is a terrible thing to \nwaste. This current stimulus bill of almost a trillion dollars is the \nlargest spending bill ever enacted by Congress. It makes the entire New \nDeal, even adjusted for inflation, look small. If it would be divvied \nup equally, the $825 billion, it would be like every family in America \nborrowing $10,520. That is not an analogy drawn from the air. In fact, \nwe are collectively borrowing every cent of this money. Every dollar is \nanother dollar of deficit and debt. We are borrowing that, $10,520 for \nevery American family. If all of our families were asked to equally \nshoulder that burden, this would be the equivalent of what each average \nfamily roughly spends on food, clothing, and health care in a year.\n  The bill, if it were a country with a GDP, would be the fifteenth \nlargest GDP in the world, right between Australia and Mexico, greater \nthan the gross domestic products of Saudi Arabia and Iran put together. \nIt does cost well over $1 billion for every page it is\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nprinted on, $400,000 for every job it hopes or even claims to save or \ncreate.\n  This is about job creation. A lot of us have questions, if any of \nthese goals are going to be met. But let's assume the stated goals are \nmet of saving and creating jobs, $400,000 per job. Of course, I don't \nthink it will ever meet those goals. Altogether, by the analysis of \nmany expert analysis, only 11 percent of this bill has anything to do \nwith recovery or reinvestment. Fact one is the enormous size and cost \nof this bill which is staggering and frightening to so many Americans. \nPart two is that Americans get it. It is common sense, and they can \ntell the difference between a laundry list of spending items, \ntraditional Washington, big government items. Virtually every major \nitem we find in the Federal Government's budget every year, they can \ntell the difference between that, which this bill is, which the House \nbill is, and true focused job creation, economic stimulus. They know \nthe difference. They know this is a laundry list of spending.\n  The Vitter amendment would begin to try to change that. It would not \nbe enough, but it would begin to make a dent in that by cutting $35 \nbillion of spending that is line item spending, nothing particularly \nfocused on job creation, economic development. That spending is in a \nnumber of different categories. I invite Members to look at all details \nof the amendment. It starts with the truly inane. For instance, $20 \nmillion for the removal of fish barriers. Let me clarify, small and \nmedium-size fish barriers, in case one was wondering. What the heck is \nthat, to begin with? I would venture to say 95 percent of the Senate \nhas no idea, but we are going to throw $20 million at that issue. How \nmany jobs will that save or create?\n  That is similar to some of the items in the bill as originally \nintroduced: An enormous amount of money for honeybee insurance; $400 \nmillion for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases; $70 \nmillion still in the bill for supercomputing related to global climate \nchange models. I am starting with what is the truly ridiculous and \ninane. From there we go to a lot of other items we can debate, which we \nmay have to do, we may have to consider, but it is not stimulus. It is \ntraditional Washington spending. How about $1 billion for the 2010 \ncensus. We just threw $210 million at the new census a few months ago. \nWe are going to throw a billion dollars more. I don't know if that is \nneeded. I don't know if that is a good idea. But I know with absolute \ncertainty, as does everyone in this body, that that is normal spending. \nThat is a normal appropriations matter, not job creation, economic \nrecovery, economic stimulus.\n  There are so many examples like that. FBI construction. I am a big \nsupporter of the FBI. They may have capital needs. It is not economic \nstimulus. NIST construction. Most Americans don't know what NIST is, \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology. Maybe they have \ncapital needs. It is not significant job creation and economic \nstimulus. The Commerce headquarters, we are going to spend $34 million \nthere under this bill. DHS, Department of Homeland Security, \nconsolidation, reorganization, streamlining, saving. That is going to \nsave money; right? Not exactly, $248 million to streamline and \nconsolidate. USDA modernization, let's modernize that Department for \n$300 million.\n  Some of these may be good ideas. Some of this spending may be worthy. \nI don't know, as I stand here today. But I absolutely know--and I \ndaresay everybody in this body knows--it is not job creation. It is not \neconomic stimulus. It is pent-up Washington demand for government \nspending. Most of what I am talking about right here in our Nation's \ncapital, in the heart of the megabureaucracies. State Department \ntraining facility, that is another $75 million; State Department \ncapital investment fund, $524 million. That is almost a billion \ndollars. How many jobs in the heartland of America will that create? \nHow much impact in terms of real people in the real world in mainstream \nAmerica will that have in stimulating the economy? My answer is zero. \nThat is the obvious answer on the minds of Americans. The District of \nColumbia sewer system, $125 million. Are communities around the country \ngetting the same treatment? No. The Economic Development Assistance \nProgram, and another biggie, Amtrak, almost a billion dollars. Again, \nwe deal with Amtrak in the normal appropriations process every year. We \nhave an important debate about whether to continue to subsidize Amtrak. \nWe need to have that debate. We need to get it right. I don't know what \nthe precisely right answer is, but I know it is a normal spending item. \nIt is not job creation. It is not economic stimulus. It is just turning \nthis bill into a whole other year of appropriations inserted somehow \nmagically between 2009 and 2010.\n  NASA climate change studies, a cool half a billion dollars. It is \nnice to use round figures like half a billion-- neighborhood \nstabilization, historic preservation, fish and wildlife resource \nconstruction, comparative research, the pandemic flu, the smart grid.\n\n  People might say: You are not worried about a pandemic flu and the \nthreat that causes to our Nation? I am. That is a serious subject. We \nneed to address it. We have debated it and begun to address it in the \nnormal appropriations process. Maybe we need to do more; I do not know. \nBut I do know one thing. That is average spending and typical spending \nthat is nothing to do with job creation and economic stimulus. Yet this \nbill is littered line after line after line with all of those items. \nMany are ridiculous. Some are obscene. Others are debatable as spending \nitems, but they are clearly not job creation and economic stimulus.\n  So I hope this vote tonight on the Vitter amendment will be the \nbeginning of fundamentally changing this bill so it is no longer simply \na laundry list of traditional Washington, big government spending \nitems.\n  Again, the American people get it. No. 1, they know a trillion \ndollars is a terrible thing to waste. And, No. 2, they know this bill, \nas it stands now, just like the House bill, is simply a laundry list of \nspending items, traditional Washington, big government spending, pent-\nup demand for spending here in the Nation's Capital. It has been pent \nup and building for several years. It is not focused, disciplined, \neconomic stimulus, or job creation.\n  There is a big difference between the two, and the American people, \nwith their common sense, can spot that difference a mile away; and they \nhave because they have been making their voices heard. Scientific \npolls, several polls--not one here, not one there--several across the \nboard say that a plurality of the American people now say this is a bad \nidea. This bill should be changed at its core, not at the margins but \nat its core, or it should be stopped, and we should start over. That is \nwhat we need to do.\n  The speaker immediately before me, the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Missouri, said that not acting, doing nothing, is not an option. \nShe said that with great passion and great focus. I agree. I am a \nlittle puzzled about how animated she was about that because I do not \nknow anyone, at least in this body, who thinks or says that inaction is \nan option. The choice being laid out that it is this bill even after \nthe amendments or nothing is a superficial, false choice. Nobody thinks \nit is this bill even after amendments or nothing.\n  We have to act. But this is not the universe of possibilities. We \nneed to change this bill at its core or, if we cannot, we need to say \nno. We will stay on the subject. We will focus on the economy. We will \nstart over. We will act with real focus and speed. But it is not worth \nsaying yes to a bad bill, particularly at the cost of nearly a trillion \ndollars.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to begin \nthat bipartisan path forward toward making this a fundamentally \ndifferent and worthy bill, and beginning that by adopting the Vitter \namendment tonight.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 179 \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. This would be an important start--not a finish \nbut a start--to trimming down this bill and trimming down pure spending \nitems out of the bill which are not job creation and economic stimulus. \nThe whole savings would be about $35 billion of spending in the bill. \nThat is obviously outlined and delineated in the amendment. In \naddition, it would omit the Davis-Bacon language which would cost the \nGovernment in terms of increased costs of projects another $17 billion.\n  The American people know the difference between a long laundry list \nof traditional Washington big government spending items and true, \nfocused job creation and economic development. They know this bill \nright now is the former, not the latter. Let's begin to change that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if there are no other speakers, I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 179.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 32, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 37 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--32\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Gregg\n     Kennedy\n       \n       \n  The amendment (No. 179) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 106\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No.--the Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are now going to vote on the Isakson-Lieberman \namendment, No. 106, the housing tax credit. I am prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to that of our \ncolleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson, in support of his amendment. \nThis is an idea that is not inexpensive to do, but I think it may be \nthe kind of confidence-building measure that is necessary to free our \ncredit markets and begin to get the housing issue moving again. It is \nnot the only answer. I think it is a critical component and element in \nachieving the results we all desire.\n  I think our colleague from Georgia came up with an idea worth our \nsupport. Therefore, I am going to be a cosponsor as chairman of the \nBanking Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and other Members on both sides of the aisle who worked on \nthis amendment. I am happy to accept his support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 106) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 237\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, next is the Cardin amendment, No. 237. I \nunderstand the chairman and ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee agree to this. I don't see the chairman. I see Senator Cardin \non the Senate floor. I urge him to speak to the amendment. Otherwise, I \nam prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. This amendment will \nmake it easier for small businesses to be able to get surety bonds in \norder to participate in these contracts with Government. It has the \nsupport of the chairman and ranking member of the Small Business \nCommittee. I am prepared to accept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 237) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 168\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the next amendment is \nDeMint amendment No. 168, the tax cut substitute.\n  This amendment is very simple. It strikes the entire bill. Then it \nreplaces the entire bill with a $2.5 trillion increase in the national \ndebt, according to the Joint Committee on Tax. With debt service and \nadded tax provisions, it increases the national debt over 10 years by \n$3 trillion because it is a massive tax cut.\n  Again, it replaces the underlying bill, which means no aid to States, \nno energy provisions, no infrastructure provisions, nothing that is in \nthe bill, replaced by a tax cut which takes effect in 2011. Joint Tax \nscores this, adding interest on the debt, about a $3 trillion increase \nin the national debt over 3 years.\n  I strongly urge this amendment not be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, how long do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, what this bill does is probably one of \nthe most important things we need to do in this economic debate, and it \nis stop the planned tax increases that are going to happen in 2011 for \nevery American.\n  The large score that is being thrown around here assumes we are going \nto let those taxes go up, but we are not. This is a misrepresentation \nof the cost of this bill. This bill stops the current tax increases \nthat are planned in 2011, keeps the current tax rate the same. The only \nchange it makes is it lowers the top marginal rate from 35 to 25 \npercent for businesses, for investors, and for individual Americans.\n  We call it the American option because it leaves money in the hands \nof the American people and businesses, rather than bringing it to \nWashington and distributing it our way.\n  I encourage everyone to stop the planned tax increases with the \nAmerican option.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will vote for DeMint Amendment No. \n168 because it provides long-term tax relief. However, I do not agree \nthat\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\nState and local tax deductions and other itemized deductions should be \neliminated. If the amendment passes, I would work in conference to \nrestore the State and local tax deductions, as well as other itemized \ndeductions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable portion \nof the budget.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays on that motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided on the Thune amendment. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, what my amendment very simply says is \nthat any of the funding in this bill that was not authorized as of \nFebruary 1 of this year could not be funded under the bill. The point \nvery simply is that, in order for a stimulus to be effective, it has to \nbe timely, it has to be targeted, it has to be temporary. Funding in \nthis or programs in this that are created that are new programs are \ngoing to be none of the above. It is going to take a long time, as we \nall know, to get regulations in place and create the bureaucracies. All \nthese programs that are new programs included in this legislation are \ngoing to take a very long time to implement and, therefore, I do not \nbelieve ought to be considered stimulus and they ought not be funded as \na part of this stimulus bill.\n  My amendment simply says any program that was not authorized as of \nFebruary 1 of this year will not be funded under the stimulus bill. It \nis a way of trimming the cost of this bill back and doing something \nthat actually I think eliminates a lot of the extraneous spending that \nis included in the bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nThis amendment says any item, unless the project was authorized prior \nto February 1 of this year, would be thrown out. No authorization bills \nhave passed this Senate so far this year, so many worthwhile items \nmight not meet the terms. In addition, there are new programs which \nwere authorized but not before February 1, such as the $9.5 billion for \nenergy loan guarantees, $3.2 billion for western area power, $5.5 \nbillion for competitive grants. These are dead.\n  I urge all of you, keep in mind that this is not an easy amendment. \nThis is a tricky one. I vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on amendment No. \n159 offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Martinez.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, the housing crisis got us into this \nproblem we are in today which necessitates the need for a stimulus \nbill. Until we deal with housing problems, we are not going to be out \nof this problem.\n  My proposal creates a situation where, for 3 years, it compensates \nprivate servicers of mortgages so they can be incentivized to work out \nmortgages for families who are in trouble, so that they might be able \nto stay in their homes and not be foreclosed.\n  This is a way to utilize the private sector, with some incentives \nfrom government money, to make sure we do not foreclose on more \nfamilies. Two things will be accomplished. It also provides a safe \nharbor for the servicers, so that they are beyond legal liability for \nanything they might do in those workouts.\n  At the end of the day, what we will do is stabilize home prices by \nfreezing foreclosures. Not only will we be helping families, but we \nwill also be trying to put a floor on the housing economy, on housing \nprices, which continue to decline. This will stabilize housing prices, \nit will avoid future foreclosures, and it will begin to turn us around \nand create the kind of housing economy we need in order for the \nAmerican economy to come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first, I want to commend my colleague from \nFlorida. This is a well-intended proposal. Here is the one problem with \nit that I tell my colleague: It breaks contracts. There is a \nconstitutional issue here, where servicers could sue.\n  What we are doing with this amendment, if I understand it correctly, \nis that the compensation due to a servicer would now fall on the \ntaxpayer. So we would have to set up a bureaucracy to pay the servicer \nwhere the legal liability was determined. That poses some real \nproblems.\n  The other part of the amendment I totally agree with. In fact, we try \nto cover it. In fact, we established a safe harbor, my colleague will \nrecall, in the bill we did together, and also trying to figure out a \nway to deal with this.\n  But I am nervous. There is $1.7 billion dollars in the amendment. No \none can say with any certainty whether that would be an adequate amount \nto cover the government costs were these determined to be liabilities \nof the government. So I am uneasy about establishing a new bureaucracy \nhere, and also the constitutional question of breaking these contracts \nwhich raises some very serious issues.\n  But what I recommend to my colleague is, we have got an amendment \ncoming up in a little while, maybe tomorrow, where we can work together \nto try to accommodate this to deal with exactly what he is talking \nabout. But I have a very difficult time accepting this for the reasons \nI have described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment there is not a sufficient second.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 159 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 278\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the McCain amendment No. 278.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, every dollar of the $1.2 trillion we are \ncontemplating spending with this legislation would add to the national \ndebt. The national debt has already climbed to more than $10.2 \ntrillion. This amount does not include any of the funding provided in \nthe legislation we are considering. After achieving economic growth for \ntwo quarters, then, according to this legislation, the President shall \nsubmit in his first budget, after the restoration of economic growth, \nfixed deficit targets that would achieve a balanced budget not later \nthan 5 years from that date.\n  The discretionary spending caps are restored in the first fiscal year \nafter the restoration of economic growth for 5 fiscal years at a level \nequal to the budget baseline, excluding any and all portions of the \nEconomic Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  Basically, this legislation calls for, as soon as there are two \nquarters of GDP growth after inflation, that we embark on an effort to \nbalance the budget. We are mortgaging our children's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I strongly share the desire of the \nSenator from Arizona to put the budget back on track, and put it on a \npath to balance. But I do not think this proposal has received the \nconsideration it deserves. It has not had a hearing before the Budget \nCommittee, yet includes a proposal to create deficit targets that were \nbadly gamed during the Gramm-Rudman era, and turned out to actually \ncover for additional deficits. So I think that would be a profound \nmistake. We need a process that works. It deserves the consideration of \nthe President and the Budget Committee.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment at this time.\n  I raise a point of order that this amendment violates section 306 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable portions \nof the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

I understand it is also acceptable by \nthe other side, but I will let Senator Bond speak to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have to do a couple things, and I just \nwant to tell you, thanks so much for agreeing to support this \nbipartisan amendment cosponsored by my partner on the Transportation \nand Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, Senator Murray, and \nSenator Dodd, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and Senator Kohl.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Voinovich and \nBrownback be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Some people are a little confused. In 30 seconds--50 \nseconds maybe--let me tell you, this is $2 billion in direct equity \nthat goes to State housing finance programs to produce affordable \nhousing. The funds come from the home moneys in the bill. The funds go \nto shovel-ready projects that have already been approved by State \ncredit agencies. Why can't they go forward? Because of the credit \ncrisis and the crunch, the tax credits are no longer worth what they \nused to be worth. This amendment allows to fill in the hole. It makes \nthe projects viable. There will be tens of thousands of new units and \ntens of thousands of new jobs.\n  I appreciate very much my colleagues on the other side.\n  I yield to my colleague from Washington.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Bond \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 161) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 262\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion and \ncomplaints about there not being enough funds in terms of \ninfrastructure--roads and buildings and all that. Actually, it is under \n4 percent in this bill. We have talked about that. What we have not \ntalked about is the need for military procurement.\n  In a Washington Post article, Martin Feldstein talked about the fact \nthat infrastructure spending on domestic military bases and procurement \nis one of the things we could do that would be very helpful, citing \nthere are 655,000 employees in the aerospace industry alone.\n  Now, what I am trying to do with this amendment is to increase \nprocurement by $5.3 billion. It is offset. So you have a decision: Do \nyou want to spend $20 million for fish passage barrier removal, $34 \nmillion to renovate the Department of Commerce, or have a strong \nnational defense? Do you want to spend $13 million to research \nvolunteer activities or have a strong national defense?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment adds $5.2 billion for \ndefense. It pays for it by cutting a long list of programs out of the \nbill: energy-efficient motor vehicle fleet--that is one I see right \nhere--grants for the National Passenger Rail Corporation, among others.\n  On behalf of Senator Inouye, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

On this vote, the yeas are 38, the nays are \n59. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have four more votes tonight, and then we \nwill have no more votes tonight after those four.\n  What I wanted to talk about a little bit is tomorrow. We started on \nthis bill Monday evening. Everyone who has stood to give a speech on \nthis--Democrat or Republican--has talked about the financial crisis our \ncountry is in. There are different ways of addressing it, and we \nunderstand that. I wanted to do everything I could to make sure there \nis an open process, and there has been. There have been no restrictions \non amendments. There have been no complaints from us as to subject \nmatter of amendments. However, the stark reality is we need to complete \nthis bill. We have stated and the Speaker has stated that we need to \nfinish this bill before the Presidents Day recess. To do that, to jump \nthrough all the hurdles, is very difficult.\n  In my last conversation with the Republican leader, he indicated that \nhe would like to go to conference. I am not holding him to that. \nSomething could go wrong the next couple of days or today or tomorrow, \nbut that is our intention. If we don't go to conference, then we will \ndo what we have done in the past: send something back over here. I \nwould rather we did a conference. I think it would set a good tone. But \nconferences are sometimes slow and a little bit tedious. We have to get \ntwo different committees and maybe as many as three different \ncommittees represented in that conference. We have to get everybody \ntogether and have a series of meetings.\n  To solve the financial crisis we have in our country is going to take \na lot of cooperation. We know this bill is imperfect. Democrats and \nRepublicans acknowledge it is an imperfect piece of legislation.\n  Without belaboring the point, we are going to have votes again \ntomorrow. Now, my colleagues will note that the vast majority of the \nvotes we have had have been Republican amendments. That is fine. We are \nhappy with that. We want to make sure that people with concerns about \nthis bill offer those amendments, but we are now arriving at a point \nwhere we are offering amendments upon amendments.\n  I understand there are two big amendments I know the Republicans have \ntomorrow. One of them is the Ensign-McConnell amendment dealing with \nhousing. I understand my friend--the man I have been with now going on \n27 years; we came to Washington together--John McCain has an important \namendment. There are probably other amendments everybody thinks are \nimportant. I would at least note those two.\n  I hope we can look to finishing this legislation tomorrow. That \ndoesn't mean at 5 o'clock. It may be later in the evening--and that is \nan understatement--but I think we should work to see if we can complete \nthis legislation.\n  I know we are getting toward the end of amendments being offered \nbecause I have been told by my staff that now we are getting into \namendments dealing with religious liberty and other things that don't \nhave a lot to do, in my opinion, with this legislation, but we are \nsetting no restriction or parameters on what amendments can be offered.\n  We all do acknowledge we have a crisis facing the American people. If \nsomeone isn't absolutely happy about this legislation, let's vote and \nmove it on to the next program. If we do something in conference that \nis revolting to the minority, they can stop the conference report. So \nlet's move on. Let's finish this. For us to finish this bill tomorrow \nor Friday is going to still take a lot of our work so that the \nPresident has a piece of legislation on his desk and so we can leave \nand do our Presidents Day recess.\n  Now, we don't have to take our recess, but we have responsibilities \nthat are more than in Washington, DC. We have a constituency at home to \nwhom we also have responsibilities. I doubt there is one of us who \ndoesn't have a lot to do during the Presidents Day recess at home. We \naren't often able to go home during the week, so there are things I \nknow that I schedule during the breaks that I can't do any other time. \nWeekends don't do the trick.\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\n  So in light of the crisis facing the American people, there is no \nreason the American people shouldn't expect us to complete action on \nthis bill tomorrow. If people need more time, I am a patient man. Now, \nwe understand--we will take a 60-vote margin. We are happy to have this \nlegislation require 60 votes. I hope we don't have to go through filing \ncloture and a cloture vote on Saturday or Sunday and 30 hours and all \nthat stuff.\n  I just think the picture the people have here of the Senate is one \nwhere we have really tried these first few weeks, including the time \nduring this legislation, to have the Senate work as it used to. I hope \neveryone feels--as we start getting the extraneous amendments dealing \nwith matters I don't think conform with what the intention of this bill \nis, which is economic recovery--that we should be worried about people \nnot having the opportunity to offer amendments. I think we have offered \na number of amendments on housing. You name the subject, we have done \nmultiple amendments. I am a patient person, as I have indicated, \nwilling to work with everyone, but my goal is to get this legislation \nover to the House as soon as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say I think the amendment \nprocess has been well handled. We had a lot of amendments to offer \ntoday, and they are in the process of being voted on. We have a lot \nmore amendments to offer tomorrow, and then I think we can discuss \nsometime during the day tomorrow exactly what the endgame might be on \nthis legislation.\n  I am pleased and my Members are pleased, I would say to the majority \nleader, with the way it has been handled to this point, and sometime \ntomorrow we will discuss how we might move toward a conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 277\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 277 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment reduces the 10-percent \nmarginal income tax bracket to 5 percent--10 percent to 5 percent--in \n2009 and 2010. Currently, the 10-percent tax bracket that was created \nin 2001 by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act \napplies to the first roughly $8,000 that a single taxpayer earns and \n$16,000 for a joint tax return. My amendment provides broad-based \nrelief to more than 105 million taxpayers, including every hard-working \nAmerican with an income tax liability.\n  My amendment does not add to the bill's total. Instead, my amendment \nis paid for by striking the refundable making work pay credit which \npicks winners and losers by providing relief to only a select group of \ntaxpayers. It also, I might say, repeats a mistake we made last year, \nor earlier--I guess last year, last January--when we spent $150 billion \nof our children's and grandchildren's money to try to stimulate the \neconomy, and everybody agrees it did not work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. Let me \nexplain the consequence of the amendment.\n  Those who pay income taxes will get a tax reduction. Those who work \nbut do not pay income taxes--they pay payroll taxes--will not get any \nbenefit from this amendment. That is the portion that is cut out. That \nis about 50 million Americans. So this amendment would give a tax cut \nto those who pay income taxes--a modest amount--and to pay for it, it \ndisenfranchises those 49 million, 50 million Americans who will get a \ntax break under this bill because they work; that is, they pay payroll \ntax. Those who work but who are not wealthy will spend the money more \nthan people who are wealthier and get a tax cut. So I suggest very \nstrongly that we do not support this amendment.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n201 of S. Con. Res. 21.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable portion of \nthe Budget Act and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 242\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 242 \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It suspends for \nthe year 2009 the tax increase on Social Security benefits that \nCongress passed in 1993. This increase taxes seniors above certain \nincome levels on 85 percent of their Social Security taxable income. We \nshould not be in the business of taxing Social Security benefits. It is \nunfair, and it is punitive.\n  CRS estimates that at least 12 million seniors pay this tax. This \namendment holds the Medicare trust funds harmless. Joint Tax says the \namendment scores at $14.4 billion, so I reduce discretionary spending \nin the bill, except spending for veterans, by the necessary amount.\n  Now is the time to fix this problem at least for 1 year. I urge \nsupport of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment effectively undoes part of \nthe budget agreement that was agreed to in 1993. We effectively \nbalanced the budget and ended up with a $10 billion, $11 trillion \nsurplus. The fact is, the amendment reduces taxes only on the top 24 \npercent, the highest income-earning seniors. Twenty-four percent of the \nmost wealthy seniors--that is highest income--will get a break in \ntaxes. Other seniors will not. The other 76 percent will get no break.\n  The Senator from Kentucky pays for it by reducing parts of the bill \nwhich create jobs. This is highways, this is roads, this is energy, and \nso forth. Frankly, I don't think that is a wise course of action to \ntake.\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\n  Accordingly, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 201 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The next amendment is the Dorgan amendment, No. 300, \nwhich we are prepared to take.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask we consider amendment No. 300.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Mr. \n     Baucus and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 300 to \n     amendment No. 98.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify that the Buy American provisions shall be applied \n      in a manner consistent with United States obligations under \n                       international agreements)\n\n         On page 430, strike lines 7 through 12 and insert the \n     following:\n         (d) This section shall be applied in a manner consistent \n     with United States obligations under international \n     agreements.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Baucus, \nMr. Inouye, and Mr. Brown. It simply says the ``Buy American'' section \nshall be ``applied in a manner consistent with United States \nobligations under international agreements.''\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and thank Senators \nBaucus and Inouye for their support.\n  Americans are willing to reach into their pockets and spend billions \nof dollars for infrastructure to build bridges and highways and water \nand sewer and put people back to work. All that Americans want is that \nwe provide jobs in this country--jobs, construction jobs--and that what \nthey use for this construction, the materials, are made in America. \nThis is WTO compliant. It follows U.S. and international global trade \nrules. It is a commonsense amendment.\n  Some people say ``protectionism,'' but how can you have an $800 \nbillion trade deficit and call us protectionist? How can you have a \n$200-billion-a-day net outflow and say we are closing our borders? It \nmakes sense to vote for the Dorgan amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute to speak in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what this amendment does is basically \nstand in direct contradiction to the amendment itself. It is impossible \nto say the section would be applied in a manner consistent with the \nU.S. obligations under international agreements and then say that \nanything that is manufactured in the United States, whether iron, \nsteel, or manufactured goods will have to be subject to ``Buy \nAmerican.''\n  The reaction to this amendment has been strong and widespread, \nincluding the President of the United States, who said, ``I think this \nwould be a mistake right now.'' The President said, ``It is a potential \nsource of trade wars that we cannot afford at a time when trade is \nsinking all over the globe.''\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my support for \nthe Dorgan amendment that would clarify that the Buy American \nprovisions of this bill shall be applied in a manner that is consistent \nwith our international trade obligations.\n  The original Buy American language in the bill doesn't specifically \nprovide an exemption for countries that provide reciprocal access for \nthe United States in the area of government procurement. But we are \nobligated under international agreements to provide such a carveout. \nThis amendment will fix this problem.\n  The United States has obligations to its trading partners. If we \ndon't live up to our commitments to other countries under trade \nagreements, we can't expect them to live up to their commitments to us. \nThe last thing that we should do in this time of economic uncertainty \nis fail to comply with our international obligations.\n  I would like to thank Senator Dorgan and Senator Baucus for working \ntogether to craft this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor on the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 300) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 279\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, nearly 80 years ago, two men--Mr. Smoot \nand Mr. Hawley--led an effort to enact protectionist legislation in \nhopes of curing the woes of the American worker. Despite the strong \nobjection of over a thousand leading economists of the time, the Smoot-\nHawley legislation was enacted. This bill helped spark an international \ntrade war that turned a severe recession into the greatest economic \ndepression in modern history.\n  The Buy American provision in the current bill has echoes of the \ndisastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff act. It prohibits the use of funds in \nthis bill for projects unless all of the iron, steel, and manufactured \ngoods used in the project are produced in the United States. These \nanti-trade measures may sound welcome to Americans who are hurting in \nthe midst of our economic troubles and faced with the specter of \nlayoffs. Yet shortsighted protectionist measures like Buy American risk \ngreatly exacerbating our current economic woes. Already, one economist \nat the Peterson Institute for International Economics has calculated \nthat the Buy American provisions in this bill will actually cost the \nUnited States more jobs than it will generate.\n  Some of our largest trading partners, including Canada and the \nEuropean Union--who account for hundreds of billions of dollars in \nannual trade--have warned that such a move could invite protectionist \nretaliation, further harming our ability to generate jobs and economic \ngrowth. And it seems\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nclear that this provision violates our obligations under more than one \ninternational agreement, including the WTO Agreement on Government \nProcurement and the procurement chapter of the North American Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Just last November in Washington, the U.S. signed a joint declaration \nwith members of the G-20 pledging that ``within the next 12 months, we \nwill refrain from raising new barriers to investment or to trade in \ngoods and services.'' Yet barely 2 months later, we are contemplating \nwhether or not to go back on a commitment to some of our closest allies \nand trading partners, potentially damaging our credibility to uphold \nfuture agreements.\n  Even President Obama himself spoke out against the Buy American \nprovision. ``I think that would be a mistake right now,'' he said \nyesterday. ``That is a potential source of trade wars that we can't \nafford at a time when trade is sinking all across the globe.''\n  We know the lessons of history, and we cannot fall prey to the failed \npolicies of the past. We should not sit idly by while some seek to \npursue a path of economic isolation, a course that could lead to \ndisaster. It didn't work in the 1930s, and it certainly won't work \ntoday. I hope all senators will support this amendment, which would \nstrike the existing Buy American provision and replace it with a \nlimitation on Buy American clauses in this bill.\n  As I said, the President of the United States said it would be a \nmistake right now. It sends a message to the world that the United \nStates is going back to protectionism.\n  I ask unanimous consent the comments of literally every leader in the \nworld, including the Canadian leader, the European leader, and over 100 \nmajor industries in the United States of America in opposition to this \namendment and an op-ed article by Douglas Irwin be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Letters From World Leaders\n\n\n                                 CANADA\n\n       Ambassador Michael Wilson: ``We are concerned about \n     contagion, that is, other countries also following \n     protectionist policies. If Buy America becomes part of the \n     stimulus legislation, the United States will lose the moral \n     authority to pressure others not to introduce protectionist \n     policies. A rush of protectionist actions could create a \n     downward spiral like the world experienced in the 1930s.''\n\n\n                             EUROPEAN UNION\n\n       Ambassador John Bruton: ``The United States and the \n     European Union should take the lead in keeping the \n     commitments not to introduce protectionist measures taken by \n     the G20 in November 2008. Failing this risks entering into a \n     spiral of protectionist measures around the globe that can \n     only hurt our economies further.''\n\n\n                             U.S. INDUSTRY\n\n       Over 100 signatories: ``Enacting expansive new Buy American \n     restrictions would invite our international partners to \n     exclude American goods and services from hundreds of billions \n     of dollars of opportunities in their stimulus packages and \n     perhaps to adopt Buy-Local rules or raise other barriers to \n     American goods more broadly across their economies. The \n     resulting damage to our export markets and the millions of \n     high-paying American jobs they support would be enormous.''\n\n                       Quotes From World Leaders\n\n\n                                  U.K.\n\n       Prime Minister Gordon Brown: ``The biggest danger the world \n     faces is a retreat into protectionism''.\n\n\n                                  U.S.\n\n       President Barack Obama: It would be a mistake when \n     worldwide trade is declining for the United States ``to start \n     sending a message that somehow we're just looking after \n     ourselves and not concerned with world trade.''\n\n                  Quotes From Reports and News Sources\n\n\n             Peterson Institute for International Economics\n\n       Report on `Buy American': EU spokesman Peter Power stated \n     that ``if a bill is passed which prohibits the sale or \n     purchase of European goods on American territory, [the \n     European Union] will not stand idly by and ignore.''

Irwin)\n\n       Hanover, NH.--World trade is collapsing. The United States \n     trade deficit dropped sharply in November as imports from the \n     rest of the world plummeted in response to the financial \n     crisis and global recession. United States imports from \n     China, Japan and elsewhere declined at double digit rates. \n     The last thing the world economy needs is for governments to \n     give a further downward shove to trade. Unfortunately, we may \n     be doing just that.\n       Steel industry lobbyists seem to have persuaded the House \n     to insert a ``Buy American'' provision in the stimulus bill \n     it passed last week. This provision requires that preference \n     be given to domestic steel producers in building contracts \n     and other spending. The House bill also requires that the \n     uniforms and other textiles used by the Transportation \n     Security Administration be produced in the United States, and \n     the Senate may broaden such provisions to include many other \n     products.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n       That might sound reasonable, but history has shown that Buy \n     American provisions can raise the cost and diminish the \n     effect of a spending package. In rebuilding the San \n     Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the 1990s, the California \n     transit authority complied with state rules mandating the use \n     of domestic steel unless it was at least 25 percent more \n     expensive than imported steel. A domestic bid came in at 23 \n     percent above the foreign bid, and so the more expensive \n     American steel had to be used. Because of the large amount of \n     steel used in the project, California taxpayers had to pay a \n     whopping $400 million more for the bridge. While this is a \n     windfall for a lucky steel company, steel production is \n     capital intensive, and the rule makes less money available \n     for other construction projects that can employ many more \n     workers.\n       American manufacturers have ample capacity to fill the new \n     orders that will come as a result of the fiscal stimulus. In \n     addition, other countries are watching closely to see if the \n     crisis becomes a general excuse for the United States to \n     block imports and favor domestic firms. General Electric and \n     Caterpillar have opposed the Buy American provision because \n     they fear it will hurt their ability to win contracts abroad.\n       They're right to be concerned. Once we get through the \n     current economic mess, China, India and other countries are \n     likely to continue their large investments in building \n     projects. If such countries also adopt our preferences for \n     domestic producers, then America will be at a competitive \n     disadvantage in bidding for those contracts.\n       Remember the golden rule, or the consequences could be \n     severe. When the United States imposed the Smoot-Hawley \n     Tariff in 1930, it helped set off a worldwide movement toward \n     higher tariffs. When everyone tried to restrict imports, the \n     combined effect was a deeper global economic slump. It took \n     decades to undo the accumulated trade restrictions of that \n     period. Let's not make the same mistake again.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment may lose. We are making a \nvery dangerous move tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, both Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are dead, \nbut this amendment is a part of a very significant debate that is on \nthe floor of the Senate and across the country. Mr. President, 20,000 \npeople a day are losing their jobs--20,000 people a day. We are going \nto shove a lot of money out the door of this Congress in support of \neconomic recovery. The question is, Are we going to try to put people \nback to work? Will we put people back to work on America's factory \nfloors making iron and steel and manufactured products?\n  We already have a ``Buy American'' provision under current law. That \nis not violative of our trade agreements. We just added an amendment \nthat says this section, the ``Buy American'' section, ``shall be \napplied in a manner consistent with United States obligations under \ninternational agreements.''\n  I don't think anyone can credibly argue that somehow this undermines \nour international agreements. But we do have a $700-billion-a-year \ntrade deficit, and my hope would be that as we push this money out the \ndoor, we do it in support of American jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know others want to \nbe heard. I appreciate the consideration of the manager of this part of \nthe bill, Senator Baucus.\n  This amendment would apply to recipients of TARP assistance, stronger \nrestrictions on executive compensation. I will make some comments this \nevening and invite my colleagues to look at the language of the \namendment.\n  It is the one that I hope all Members will be able to support. It \ndoes not directly apply to the stimulus package, but it is an \nopportunity for us to speak on the executive compensation issues which \nare critically important.\n  The amendment bans bonuses for most highly paid executives of TARP-\nrecipient firms: Prohibits TARP recipients from paying a bonus, \nretention award, or other similar incentive compensation to the 25 most \nhighly-paid employees ``or such higher number as the Secretary of the \nTreasury may determine is in the public interest with respect to any \nTARP recipient.''\n  It requires a retroactive review: The Secretary of the Treasury must \nreview bonus awards paid to executives of TARP recipients to determine \nwhether any payments were excessive, inconsistent with the purposes of \nthe act or the TARP or otherwise contrary to public interest and, if \nso, seek to negotiate with the recipient and the subject employee for \nappropriate reimbursement to the Government.\n  It requires each TARP recipient to include on annual proxy statement \na ``say on pay'' proposal or advisory shareholder vote on the company's \nexecutive cash compensation program.\n  It allows for the Government to clawback any bonus or incentive \ncompensation paid to an executive based on reported earnings or other \ncriteria later found to be materially inaccurate.\n  It prohibits compensation plans that would encourage manipulation of \nreported earnings.\n  The Board Compensation Committee of each TARP recipient must be \ncomposed entirely of independent directors; and requires the committee \nto evaluate compensation plans and their potential risk to the \nfinancial health of the company.\n  It prohibits golden parachutes to top senior executives.\n  It prohibits a compensation plan that has incentives for employees to \ntake unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the \ncompany.\n  This will encourage the companies to use the TARP funds for the \npurposes they were intended and assure the American taxpayers that \ntheir funds are being used properly. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and I be allowed to call up amendment No. 326.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the bill we are looking at today \nrepresents a massive Federal investment. It will provide Federal funds \nfor a host of activities at State and local levels. This would be a new \nexperience for many of our States.\n  The requirements set forth for Federal involvement have caused some \nState and local officials to take pause. But in the West, we have \nalready learned the lessons of Federal involvement. In my State of \nWyoming, we deal with the Federal Government in the day-to-day \noperations of our land, of our businesses and of our communities. More \nthan 45 percent of the land in Wyoming is federally owned. The Federal \nGovernment has introduced major predators into our landscape. The \nFederal Government controls most of our dams, lakes, and reservoirs. \nThe Federal Government manages the irrigation and grazing for \nagriculture production. We depend on Federal managers to access Federal \nlands for hunting and fishing. Living with this heavy Federal \ninvolvement in Wyoming, we struggle every day to cut red tape and to \nget work done. I urge the Members of the Senate to seriously consider \nthe experience of the people of Wyoming.\n  We in Congress need to face the realities of our Federal system. \nBureaucratic delays impact everyday life in Wyoming. Unless we \nseriously consider legislative alternatives, delays will affect many of \nthe projects proposed for funding through this piece of legislation we \nare considering. The vast majority of the projects proposed for this \nfunding are subject to environmental laws. These laws provide for \nmeasured, thoughtful decisionmaking. They allow public involvement in \nour Government, but they are not built for speed. Virtually every \nschool to be built, every road, and every bridge in this legislation \nwould require documentation under the National Environmental Policy \nAct, called NEPA. From my Wyoming experience, NEPA reviews can take \nyears--not weeks, not months but years. Even after NEPA documentation \nis finalized, activist groups can file appeals and litigation and hold \nup projects for many years to come.\n  To address this pressing need, I am proposing an amendment today \nnumbered 326, along with several colleagues, to provide for a \nstreamlined process of approval. The amendment would require that NEPA \nbe completed in 9 months. We require that administrative appeals be \ncombined for expedient consideration. Once the administrative remedies \nare exhausted, judicial review is available in the Federal Court of \nAppeals right here in Washington, DC. This provides a single, clear \nsystem to review decisions and provide a fair ruling.\n  A host of experts have called for Congress to face the reality of \nNEPA during this stimulus package debate. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, in their January 28 letter to the Senate, gave \nrecommendations for ``actions that could accelerate spending.'' NEPA is \nthe very first point they offered. CBO wrote that Congress should \nconsider ``waiving requirements for environmental and judicial \nreviews.'' CBO is not alone. Governor Schwarzenegger of California, a \nvery moderate Governor, listed waiving NEPA as a priority for his State \nto succeed with stimulus funding. He wrote that Congress should ``waive \nor greatly streamline NEPA requirements,'' in order to speed delivery \nof the projects. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest group of \nbusinesses in the Nation, called for NEPA reform. These are exactly the \npeople we expect to lift us out of the recession. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce feels that this amendment is necessary for the stimulus \npackage to succeed. The knowledgeable, moderate, hard working people of \nAmerica are calling on Congress to make this improvement to the \nstimulus legislation. In fact, some of them are calling for us to go \nfurther than this amendment would go.\n  This amendment is not a waiver of NEPA responsibility. Rather, it \nrequires that NEPA documentation be timely and effective. If \nbureaucratic delays stand in the way of project completion, it provides \nfor the project to go forward. This amendment is a practical middle \nground. I urge Members of the Senate to support it.\n  This amendment will make the aims of this legislation possible. The \nFederal Government should not stand in the way of people trying to help \nout and to help us out of the recession. Community projects should be \nreviewed quickly and allowed to go forward after a reasonable time. \nThis amendment would prevent bureaucratic delays. Approval of the \namendment will allow our transportation, our public land management, \nand construction goals to be met on time. If the aim of H.R. 1 is to \nprovide quick, efficient funding for projects that will stimulate our \neconomy, we must approve this amendment. If projects are truly shovel \nready, if our partners in the agencies, States and local governments \nhave done their homework, they won't depend on this amendment. But by \napproving this amendment, we will guarantee that no Federal bureaucrat \nsitting in Washington can waste time and money on endless paperwork. \nFrankly, I believe this kind of requirement should be available to all \nof us who struggle with bureaucratic delays in the Federal Government.\n  I will explain a few of the difficulties we face in Wyoming with \nFederal delays and bureaucratic red tape. I am sure my fellow \ncosponsors of the amendment have similar stories. I hope my colleagues \nwill heed our cautionary tales.\n  In the Medicine Bow National Forest, we have watched millions of \nacres of forest die year after year. Bark beetles have infested our \npine trees. They spread quickly and leave behind stands of dense, dry \ntimber waiting to burn. We see entire mountain ranges of standing dead \ntimber. This is a health problem, a safety problem for our communities \nin and around the forest. The Forest Service recognizes the importance \nof moving quickly to reduce wildfire risk and remove the hazardous \nfuels. Yet it takes nearly 2 years to plan and review a single project, \n2 years before we can even begin work on the projects. Most of that \ntime is consumed by analysis and review in order to reach NEPA \ncompliance. This is a clear example where red tape and bureaucratic \nrequirements are failing the people of Wyoming. These same policies \nwill fail the people of America if we do not include a process of \nexpedited NEPA regulations in this legislation.\n  The Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes also face delays due \nto red tape that the Federal Government imposes on transactions \ninvolving Indian lands. Almost every proposal to lease or develop the \nsurface minerals, timber, water, and other resources located on Indian \nland is subject to approval by a Federal official. However, that \nofficial's decision cannot be made until the NEPA review and \ndocumentation requirements have been fulfilled. The lengthy paperwork \nmust be completed regardless of what the Indian tribe or the landowner \nwants and regardless of the tribe or the landowner's participation in \nnegotiating the transaction. Those review and documentation \nrequirements take time, even when the process goes smoothly. If there \nis a court challenge to the NEPA review, the process can be dragged on \nfor many months or even years. The challenge of complying with NEPA has \nits own impacts on the human environment in the case of Indian lands. \nIt makes Indian lands less attractive to prospective investors and \ndevelopers, and it can lead to substantial delays and considerable \nuncertainty.\n\n  I am not saying that NEPA has no benefits and that it is all bad. But \nas we consider this stimulus bill, we in Congress must be honest with \nourselves. We must face the fact that NEPA compliance may create \nsignificant delays in the spending contemplated by this bill. That \nshould not happen. We should make it clear that NEPA will not be \navailable as a mechanism to block or substantially delay a project \nauthorized by this legislation.\n  With that in mind, I hope Members of the Senate will support this \namendment. We know in Wyoming that delay and red tape are part of every \nFederal project. If Washington is serious about implementing massive \nFederal investment in local communities, we must\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nask ourselves the same questions being asked by our constituents: How \ndo we make the process effective? How do we harness the most resources \nin the least amount of time? How can we best serve the people?\n  If you consider the on-the-ground realities of Federal projects, you \nsee the necessity of this amendment. We need to put an end to \nbureaucratic delays. We must allow our communities to move forward with \nprojects in a reasonable timeframe. We should allow the public to \ndispute Federal decisions, but we should limit unending lawsuits and \ndelays. These are improvements that will vastly improve the \neffectiveness of Federal funding and allow truly shovel-ready projects \nto proceed without delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, at this point, I appreciate that the \nSenator from Wyoming has an amendment. I wondered if perhaps he could \nhold off and offer his amendment tomorrow and work out with Senator \nBoxer the appropriate accommodations for both Senators. That would be \nmy hope. In the meantime, Senator Harkin has an amendment he would like \nto offer.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I will work on that with Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for his accommodation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Barrasso. I didn't know \nabout the Senator. As he knows, he is waiving the National Environment \nAct as it pertains to these projects. I will be glad to work with him \nto figure out a way to do a side-by-side, however he wants to deal with \nit, a second degree.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 338 and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the amendment I will \nbe calling up at some point. There is no doubt that the automobile \nindustry is the heart and soul of America's manufacturing sector. It is \nabsolutely critical to a healthy and diversified, vibrant U.S. economy. \nRight now this essential industry is on life support, hemorrhaging \njobs, slashing production, closing dealerships, and, in the case of GM \nand Chrysler, dependent on Federal loans to avoid bankruptcy. Chrysler \nannounced a 50-percent decline in January sales compared to a year ago. \nGM had a 49-percent decline in sales. Ford had a 39-percent decline. \nToyota, with major plants in America, suffered a 32-percent decline in \nU.S. sales. These numbers are shocking, and people who think this is \nonly an automakers' problem just don't get it.\n  The auto industry is not just a few assembly plants in Detroit. The \nBig Three and foreign automakers have plants in Alabama, Delaware, \nGeorgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New York, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and \nWisconsin.\n  There are car dealerships and auto parts manufacturers in thousands \nof communities all across America. Directly or indirectly, the auto \nindustry supports one 1 of every 10 jobs in this country.\n  So let's be very clear, we are not going to have a strong economic \nrecovery in the United States without a strong recovery in the \nautomobile industry. That is why it is important this economic stimulus \nbill provide a major boost to automakers. The real question is, What is \nthe best way to give a boost to the automakers? Is it giving them money \nat the top and letting them deal with it as they will? Well, that is \nlike old trickle-down economics; all we have to do is give it to the \ntop and somehow it will all trickle down.\n  Some of us have a better idea, and I think a better approach. It is \nto put it in at the bottom and let it percolate up. Here is what I mean \nby that.\n  The auto workers want nothing more than to be back on the job \nproducing full time, producing high-quality cars, providing for their \nfamilies, paying their taxes.\n  Now, I am offering this amendment which will give low- and modest-\nincome consumers a $10,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car that \nis assembled in America--a car or pickup truck assembled in America.\n  Now, here are the conditions that apply to this. First of all, the \ncar you are bringing in has to be at least 10 years old. You have to \nhave title for the car in your own possession prior to the date of the \nenactment of this bill. The new car you are purchasing has to get at \nleast 5 miles per gallon more than the car you are bringing in. The new \ncar must have a fuel economy rating of 25 miles per gallon or better \nor, in the case of a pickup, 20 miles per gallon or better. And the old \ncar you are bringing in must be relinquished to the Government and be \ndestroyed. This offer, this $10,000 subsidy, would be available only to \nindividuals with incomes of $50,000 a year or less or couples with an \nincome of $75,000 or less.\n  So let me run through that again. Here is the way it would work. If \nyou have an income of less than $50,000--or for a couple less than \n$75,000--if you have a car that is at least 10 years old, and you have \nhad title to that car since before the enactment of this bill--actually \nbefore January of this year--you could take your W-2 form to show your \nincome, take the title of the old car to show you have owned it, show \nhow old the car is, and you can go to any auto dealer anywhere you want \nand buy a new car and the subsidy will be $10,000. You will get \n$10,000. All you have to do is relinquish your old car, and that car \nhas to be destroyed.\n  Well, what would this amendment accomplish? First of all, it will \nbring a lot of customers back into the auto showrooms, and they will \nnot just be looking, they will be buying. This will be a shot of \nadrenaline right into the bloodstream of the domestic auto industry. \nSecondly, it will accelerate the shift from older gas-guzzling vehicles \nto new high mileage cars. Third, and very important in these tough \neconomic times, it will make it affordable for ordinary working \nAmericans to buy a new car.\n  Think about it. Think about people who make less than $50,000 or a \ncouple who makes less than $75,000 a year. Chances are, they are the \nones who have the old clunkers. They need it to go back and forth to \nwork. If you live in a rural area, it is absolutely essential. These \nare the people who have these old cars, and they put repairs in them--a \ncouple hundred here, a couple hundred there--because they can afford to \ndo that, but they cannot afford to buy a new car. But it is a much \ndifferent story if the Federal Government is going to give you $10,000 \nto buy that new car.\n  For example, let's take this example: A basic 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt \ngets 34 miles per gallon on the highway. It has a manufacturer's \nsuggested retail price starting at $16,330. After the Federal subsidy--\nassuming you are under the income limits, and you have this 10-year-old \ncar--you will be able to buy that car for $6,330.\n  Now, what is also important is that you will be able to get financing \nunder this program. Because the lender, with a $10,000 reduction in \nprice, will be offering a car loan for far less than the car's worth \nafter it leaves the lot.\n  We had a session today, and we heard Mr. Larry Summers. We all know \nwho he is down at the White House. He said there are a lot of willing \nlenders out there, but they do not have worthy borrowers.\n  Well, now, if you are a person--a low-income, moderate-income \nperson--and you are making $50,000 a year, and you need a new car--you \nhave an old clunker, and you keep paying for repairs on it, but you \nwish to buy a new car--let's say it costs you $20,000 to buy a new \ncar--you can go to your local bank and try to get a loan for $15,000 or \n$18,000 for a $20,000 car, and you will not get it. You will not get \nit. But if you go to that bank to try to get a loan for a $20,000 car \nand $10,000 of it is a subsidy from the Government, and you are only \nborrowing $10,000 for that car, you will get the financing.\n  So that is another important thing this amendment will do. It will \nstart opening channels of credit. Money will start to begin to flow \nthrough banks\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nand other lending organizations--savings and loans, credit unions, \ninstitutions such as that--for people to buy a car.\n  This amendment will make it affordable for a modest-income American \nto buy a new car. Make no mistake about it, it would stimulate a surge \nin auto sales--not just the automakers, but a broad swath of the \neconomy impacted by the auto industry. Think about all of the other \nthings that go into these cars in almost every community in America.\n  The Federal Government has given General Motors and Chrysler a few \nmonths to come up with a plan to ensure their long-term viability as \nbusinesses while producing a greener mix of vehicles. But we have \nfailed to address two big questions.\n  In the midst of a severe recession, how do you boost demand for cars \nassembled in America? How do we get rid of that surplus we have out \nthere? Go to any auto lot in your State. There are new cars all over \nthe place, and there is no one buying them. So we failed to address \nthat. How do we boost demand? Secondly, how do we give consumers \ncompelling incentives to purchase fuel-efficient cars, especially at a \ntime when gas prices have fallen dramatically? I was in my home State \nof Iowa this week, and gas is $1.77 a gallon. I have not seen it that \nlow for a long time.\n  So this amendment provides a realistic answer to both questions. It \nwould boost demand incredibly. We estimate that for the $16 billion \nthis amendment would provide, it would cover more than 1.5 million \npurchases of new fuel-efficient, domestically assembled cars. It would \naccelerate the transition of our U.S. vehicle fleet toward more fuel-\nefficient cars, and this would be a gain for our whole country, \nreducing the demand for gasoline, reducing the dependence on foreign \noil, lowering the operating costs of these new cars.\n  It will do little good to extend loans to GM and Chrysler if consumer \ndemand for new cars remains dead. Now, we had the Mikulski amendment \nearlier today--today or yesterday--and that will help a little bit. But \nit is a tax deduction for modest-income Americans. It probably will not \nmean that much, maybe $1,000, $1,500. It is better than nothing. But if \nyou want to sell those cars, give them $10,000, give $10,000 to modest-\nincome Americans. Say: Go buy a car with these conditions.\n  We are very good around here at passing billions of dollars. What are \nwe up to, $900 billion now on this bill? There is a lot of good stuff \nin this stimulus bill, and I support it. We are good at giving a lot of \nmoney to Wall Street and banks and GM and Chrysler at the top. We seem \nto be very good at giving a lot of money at the top. How about giving \nsome money down at the bottom?\n  You want to talk about rebuilding confidence in America? Think what \nwould happen to all these modest-income Americans who could now go out \nand get a new car. Think of all the old clunkers we would take off the \nroad and destroy. That would rebuild confidence. As I mentioned, we \nwould get our lending channels going. There would be a lot of loans \nmade out there for these cars. With lending institutions, my gosh, \nloaning $6,000 on a $16,000 car, that is not everyone breaking a sweat.\n  So it is going to do little good for us to demand that automakers \nshift production to fuel-efficient cars if consumers are unwilling to \nbuy them or they cannot buy them because of the recession.\n  This amendment is designed to address these challenges, to stimulate \ndemand for new fuel-efficient cars, accelerate the shift toward a more \nfuel-efficient fleet, and help working-class Americans. As I said, you \nonly qualify as an individual if you make $50,000 a year or less, or \nfor a couple making $75,000 or less. Let's help working-class \nAmericans. Now, people might say: Gee, that is a lot of money, $16 \nbillion. But aren't we trying to stimulate the economy?\n  Again, in closing, I say, you are not going to get economic recovery \nuntil we address the automobile sector. That is the big driver in this \ncountry, no pun intended, of course. But that is what we have to \naddress. We are not doing it. We keep punting the ball down the field: \nloans to GM, loans to Chrysler; they come up with a plan. But with all \nthose new automobiles sitting out there, no one is buying them. Well, \nlet's give them a subsidy. Let's give a subsidy to working-class \nAmericans for a change, and give them a little hand up--not a handout, \nbut a hand up. I will tell you, it will reverberate all through our \neconomy if we are to do something like this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand there has been an objection. I \nam not going to offer an amendment at this point until after this is \nresolved.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes, if I may, on an amendment I will \ncall up either this evening or tomorrow once this has been resolved, \nthis process matter has been resolved. I intend to offer an amendment \nthat would statutorily require a dedication of $50 billion from the \nsecond tranche of the so-called TARP funding to be dedicated to \nforeclosure mitigation.\n  As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee--and I am pleased to \nrecognize that the distinguished Presiding Officer is a new member of \nthat committee--for the last 2 years--in fact, 2 years ago this very \nweek, we had our very first hearing, and I became chairman of the \ncommittee on the foreclosure problems in this country and the problems \nwith the residential mortgage market generally. We had witnesses at \nthat time who warned that we might face as many as 2 million \nforeclosures in the country. I recall when the witness testified to \nthat effect, there were those who scoffed at that prediction, that \nnothing such as that could possibly happen in the United States. Now it \nseems like a modest prediction in light of what has occurred over the \nlast 2 years regarding our economy, in this country, all of which began \nwith the residential mortgage market in this Nation.\n  More so than anything else, it was the predatory lending that drew \npeople into mortgages they were ill-prepared to meet, did not require \ndocumentation; they were actually called liar loans, in a sense. Of \ncourse, the brokers and the servicers and lenders were all passing on \nthe responsibility with little or no accountability, were being \ncompensated for their efforts, and no longer had any underwriting \nstandards or requirements that would have required that the borrowers \nmeet certain requirements in order to protect that mortgage and that \nhomeowner.\n  I won't dwell on that this evening except to say that now we have 8 \nmillion homes underwater in effect, where the mortgages exceed the \nvalue of the homes. It is predicted that several millions more could \nlose their homes. Mr. President, 10,000 people a day in this country \nare losing their homes, along with the 20,000 losing their jobs, and \nthere is an increase in the likelihood of further deterioration in the \nhousing market.\n  I had hoped earlier on, with the first tranche of $350 billion, that \nmore would be done in foreclosure mitigation. Regretfully, despite \npromises to the contrary, that never occurred. I am hopeful--in fact, \nbeyond hopeful--because this amendment would require that $50 billion \nof that remaining $350 billion be dedicated to this purpose. I am \nconfident that the new administration is committed to that. They \ncertainly indicated as much in their comments. While not specifically \nidentifying a number, they certainly indicated they intend to dedicate \nserious resources toward foreclosure mitigation. This amendment would \nsecure, beyond any doubt--that those resources I have identified would \nbe allocated for foreclosure mitigation. There are some other points in \nthe amendment, but that is the major thrust.\n  Most economists, regardless of ideology or political perspective, \nhave agreed that until we deal with the foreclosure crisis, the \neconomic situation will continue to deteriorate until we get to the \nbottom of that. There are a variety of different proposals that have \nbeen suggested on how we might\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nachieve that. This amendment I am offering does not insist upon any \nparticular formulation. There are a number of ideas out there. I think \nSheila Bair, who is the chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, has one of the more creative ideas, an idea that has been \nwarmly embraced by the Obama administration. That is not to say they \nagree with every dotted ``I'' and crossed ``t,'' but they certainly \nindicated they think it is more than just a reasonable idea but may \nvery well contribute to putting a tourniquet on this hemorrhaging that \nis occurring in the residential mortgage market. That is one idea. \nThere are others as well. Several of my colleagues on both sides of \nthis political divide have offered ideas that I think would contribute \nto the reduction of foreclosures in the country, many of which are very \nsolid ideas. Some may need further work than others, but I think all of \nus are now aiming in the right direction.\n  It has been a journey of some length. It was only in the spring of \nlast year that we faced some six filibusters in this Chamber when we \ntried to fashion a housing program that would reduce some of the \nproblems we saw a year ago. Obviously, the mood has changed \ndramatically. We now have virtually everyone talking about how to deal \nwith the foreclosure problem. I only regret that same consensus had not \ndeveloped earlier. Had it done so, in my view, we would not be where we \nare today. This is not a natural disaster that has occurred; this was \nan avoidable problem. That is the great tragedy of it. This was an \navoidable economic problem that has at its roots the mortgage crisis. \nUnfortunately, it went unattended for so long despite repeated warnings \nby many of us.\n  But here we are at the outset of 2009 with the worst economic crisis \nsince the Great Depression and a problem that has now spread throughout \nthe globe. So it is incumbent upon us to take various steps to try to \naddress this issue. I think the money that was allocated back last fall \nminimized the problem in a sense that it would have been far worse than \nit is today without those resources. Unfortunately, the management of \nthose resources has not been as well executed as it could have been. My \nhope is that this next tranche will be far better managed with far \ngreater accountability, far greater transparency, and far greater \ncontrols on such things as executive compensation.\n  Obviously, the stimulus package is also important. I wish to commend \nPresident Obama because he has said this well; that is, these steps we \nare taking are not in and of themselves going to resolve the economic \ncrisis. What I think they do is minimize further deterioration of our \neconomy. The President said the other day that he wishes these actions \nwould turn the corner for us. What he hopes it will achieve is to stop \nthe deterioration or the flow of this economy moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  So I think it is important as we talk about the stimulus package that \nwe talk about these TARP funds. These are all steps that are needed to \nget us moving in the right direction, to create jobs in the country and \nstop the tremendous increase in unemployment--as I mentioned, 20,000 \njobs a day--and begin to repair our credit market and the financial \nsystem in this country.\n  Far more will need to be done. Anyone who stands on this floor or \nelsewhere and predicts that because of the steps we are taking we are \ngoing to miraculously or immediately cure our economic ills is \nmisspeaking. It will not. But it will get us pointed in the right \ndirection. That is what is important about these steps we are about to \ntake. It will move us in a direction of improving our economy.\n  I see my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, through the Presiding Officer, I wish \nto ask my colleague from Connecticut whether, when we were trying to \ndeal with the foreclosure crisis last year, there were many people in \nthe Chamber who said: Well, let's just shelve that for awhile. Let's \nforget about that problem right now. We don't need to do anything right \nnow.\n  My recollection is that is what a lot of the response was from some \nof our friends.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from Missouri \nthat she has an excellent memory. I had 82 hearings in the Banking \nCommittee, over a third of them on this subject matter alone. We came \nto the floor of the Senate at the behest of the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, who was a champion of these issues. We had these hearings \nprior to the Passover, Easter break in committee, over a third of them \non this subject matter alone. We faced six filibusters--almost a record \nnumber--on a single piece of legislation. It was after that break that \nthings began to open up and move.\n  My colleague from Missouri has this exactly right. There were those \nwho were vehemently opposed. There were all sorts of amendments, all \nsorts of efforts made to obstruct any effort for us to come up with \nideas to allow us to mitigate the rising foreclosures in the country. \nHad we dealt with it then, a year ago, I think it is safe to say to my \ncolleagues that we would not be in the situation we are in today.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I would ask my colleague, it is almost \nlike what a famous baseball player once said: ``It is deja vu all over \nagain.'' Because what I am hearing, if I am correct--and I would \ncertainly ask him this question--I am hearing the same thing now on the \neconomic recovery bill, that we need to shelve it.\n  I heard one of our colleagues, who I believe is the ranking member on \nSenator Dodd's committee, actually today on TV and the last couple of \ndays saying: We need to shelve this thing.\n  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut, through the Presiding \nOfficer, I have this feeling that if we shelve it, we will be back here \nnext year and, as with the housing crisis, the economic crisis in this \ncountry will do nothing but get demonstrably worse and more painful for \nthe American people.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, responding to my colleague and friend from \nMissouri, she is absolutely correct. I think there is a tendency to \nlook at these issues as if they were somehow stovepiped, separate from \neach other, this dealing with the TARP legislation and dealing with the \nfinancial crisis and now dealing with the stimulus package is \nunrelated. It has been pointed out that there is a likelihood we will \nlose as much as $2 trillion out of our economy over the next 2 years. \nMaking up that gap is going to require some effort.\n  This bill will ultimately, I hope, result in an appropriation of \nsomething between $800 billion and $900 billion--no small amount but \nfar short of what will be lost in our economy over the next 2 years. If \nwe defeat this or shelve this, as has been suggested, we exacerbate the \neconomic problems of this Nation to a significant degree, which would \nrequire this body coming back at a later date with something that none \nof us even wants to contemplate at this point.\n  So this is not an unrelated matter. You shelve this, you walk away \nfrom this responsibility, and you burden the American taxpayer to the \nlikes none of us could even begin to calculate.\n  So I thank my colleague from Missouri for pointing that fact out. \nThis is related. If our economy does not begin to improve or at least \nnot get worse, as the President has accurately pointed out, the \nproblems only become more pronounced, more difficult to resolve in the \ncoming weeks and months. So our economic future depends upon each of \nthese pieces in place that will allow us to begin to turn that corner, \nsee credit begin to move, borrowing occur, lenders lending, and \nactivity economically in this country begin to move in the direction we \nneed for recovery. So I thank her immensely for her comments. She \nidentified exactly what needs to be done and explained it to our \ncitizens.\n\n  This is not an idle effort just to secure some spending. It is \nabsolutely essential if we are going to produce the kinds of jobs that \nare necessary, contribute to economic growth, and make a difference for \nour country. That is the reason I thought on this bill--it is a \nstimulus bill--of requiring to be set aside $50 billion of the TARP \nmoney in the next tranche to be dedicated to the rising number of \nforeclosures of residential properties in our Nation. If you are losing \n20,000 jobs a day, you don't need to be a degreed economist to know \nthat with every one of those people who loses a job, the greater the \nlikelihood they will lose their home.\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\n  We need to do everything we can to try to stop that erosion in the \njob market and simultaneously do what we can to make it possible for \npeople to stay in their homes. There is a direct correlation between \nthe stimulus effort and TARP regarding mitigation of foreclosures. That \nis why I will ask my colleagues to be supportive of that effort \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But I did want to say there was a little bit of a surprise \nthat happened tonight when one of my colleagues offered an amendment to \nessentially repeal environmental laws as they relate to this bill. All \nactivities of this bill, if this Barrasso amendment were to pass, all \nthe activities would no longer be covered by the National Environmental \nPolicy Act.\n  That is a very disturbing amendment and I was very surprised by it as \nchair of the Environment and Public Works Committee here. Thanks to the \ndiligent staff--and I do appreciate them letting me know--I was able to \ncraft another amendment that I hope will precede the amendment of \nSenator Barrasso and allow the Senate to express itself, saying that we \ndo not intend to waive environmental laws that will protect the public \nhealth of our communities and, if there are projects that are such a \nharm to our community, they should be replaced by the many shovel-ready \nprojects that our mayors are telling us are out there, that our \nGovernors are telling us are out there.\n  We will have that debate tomorrow but I wanted to mention why I was \nstill here at 10 after 10, here protecting our communities across \nAmerica.\n  I have sent an amendment to the desk. I hope that amendment will be \nqueued up as per the suggested list of Senator Baucus.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending among \nthe amendments that have been sent up.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that any action taken under this act or any funds \n    made available under this act that are subject to the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) protect the public health of \n                    communities across the country)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n                                Findings\n\n       The Senate finds that:\n       According to leading national and state organizations, \n     there are many more NEPA compliant, ready-to-go activities, \n     than are funded in this bill, and\n       If there is an action or funds made available for an action \n     that triggers NEPA, and that activity could cause harm to \n     public health, and that harm has not been evaluated under \n     NEPA, the project would not meet the requirements of NEPA and \n     should not be funded.\n\n\n                               Section 1\n\n       Any action or funds made available for an action that \n     triggers NEPA, that have not complied with NEPA, and \n     therefore pose a potential danger to our communities across \n     the country, must either come into compliance with NEPA or be \n     replaced by other eligible activities.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 102 To Amendment No. 98\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair notes for the record that \namendment No. 102, sponsored by Senator Landrieu, is considered offered \nand adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 102) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that assistance for the redevelopment of foreclosed \nand abandoned homes to States or units of local government impacted by \ncatastrophic natural disasters may be used to support the redevelopment \n of homes damaged or destroyed as a result of the 2005 hurricanes, the \n  severe flooding in the Midwest in 2008, and other natural disasters)\n\n       On page 251, lines 13 and 14, strike ``housing:'' and \n     insert the following: ``housing: Provided further, That \n     funding used for section 2301(c)(3)(E) of the Act shall also \n     be available to redevelop demolished, blighted, or vacant \n     properties, including those damaged or destroyed in areas \n     subject to a disaster declaration by the President under \n     title IV of the Robert T.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We consider ourselves very fortunate that we can still do \n     the things we want. However, we certainly feel the bite at \n     the pump. We are retired (but still working) and were hoping \n     to travel, but the cost is going to get in the way of that. \n     We have cut out unnecessary trips, have a small, efficient \n     car that we use now more often than our pickups and look for \n     ways to conserve. We live in a rural area and no matter how \n     we try to stay close to home, we still have to travel some \n     distance to get supplies and groceries. We still need to \n     drive our pickups and cannot always take the car. Our \n     tractors and other machinery need fuel. Rural Americans are \n     going to feel this more than others. We have longer distances \n     to drive, we have more need for fuel and we do not have \n     public transportation, etc. There is only so much cutting \n     back we can do and still earn a living or make ends meet.\n       High gas prices cannot help but have a negative effect on \n     other businesses. In an area that used to have a thriving \n     economy based on natural resources (timber), we were told to \n     become dependent on tourism to replace that. This is what \n     happens when tourism is the basis of your economy--people \n     stay home, businesses go belly up, the local economy suffers.\n       The solution is to begin stepping up the pace to develop \n     our own energy and accompanying infrastructure so that we do \n     not need to be so dependent on countries who certainly do not \n     have our best interests at heart. We cannot afford to place \n     our natural resources off limits and expect the world to meet \n     our needs. It is morally wrong to exploit other countries' \n     resources while our own are locked away.\n       Thanks for the opportunity to comment.\n                       Wayne and Julie Burkhardt,\n     Indian Valley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I most likely will never meet anyone of you. I believe that \n     you must be great, because you were voted to your place where \n     you are seated today, by others just like me, barely keeping \n     my head above water. I believe in this great nation, I \n     believe that your jobs are to be the voice of the great \n     people of this nation. We believed that you could that why we \n     voted for you. So fight for us, our voices are lifted and we \n     are screaming for help. There is no reason we should be here; \n     as a young set of thirteen colonies we broke away for taxes \n     and tyranny. Please tell me why we are at the mercy of \n     tyranny again, and paying those very high taxes.\n       If we can create a nuclear bomb that kills people, we can \n     spend a trillion dollars a year on a war that kills people \n     and brings this country to its knees. By god we can do \n     something other than this dependence on oil.\n       Let us be leaders again. Let us be a great people again.\n     Anna Reed, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       First of all I thank God that I live in Idaho and for the \n     most part my representatives represent me. Secondly, I feel \n     that the rest of the U.S. Congress is absolutely out of touch \n     with average American citizens. I feel that MY beautiful \n     state of Idaho where I live with like-minded people will not \n     be able to make its voice heard in the U.S. Congress. I could \n     tell you how my family is being hit hard by sky-high \n     gasoline, and energy prices, and how I have cut back on \n     driving. I could tell that if gas prices and the cost of \n     energy continues to rise I will be forced to take drastic \n     measures just to keep food on the table and get to work. \n     However, I am truly worried that the elitists in the U.S. \n     Congress will just rub their hands together and say, our plan \n     is working we are saving the globe from warming. Somewhere \n     along the way the majority of our representatives in Congress \n     have forgotten they are just that--representatives. They have \n     taken it upon themselves to be gods thinking they have the \n     moral high ground and who cares how the everyday average \n     American is effected by their decisions. Yes, the United \n     States is too dependent on petroleum for our energy and we \n     are far too dependent on foreign sources of that petroleum. \n     But are we willing to let the economy continue to be crushed \n     because our Congress has bought into the fallacy of Climate \n     Alarmism? Yes! We should be passing legislation to fully \n     utilize proven American oil and natural gas reserves in a way \n     that preserves the environment for future generations. That \n     is why I strongly support policies that will take further and \n     full advantage of nuclear energy technologies, wind and solar \n     power, and effective renewable and alternative fuels. The \n     Congress must take serious action that will result in reduced \n     energy dependence of fossil fuels or provide financial relief \n     for those hit by the recently-skyrocketing prices. If the \n     moral elitists in Congress don't act quickly there will not \n     be any tax payers left to save the world. The oil companies \n     make four cents a gallon; the government collects 18 cents a \n     gallon--I think we should be investigating Congress.\n     Toby Anderson.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family has very much felt the painful effects of high \n     oil prices as I have seven children (four of them teenagers). \n     Even with planning our trips into town we spend an average of \n     $570 just on fuel, not mention the increased burden of \n     escalated costs of all other commodities that we purchase! I \n     am a believer in taking care of our environment and being \n     responsible caretakers of the earth, but our government and \n     our economy being held hostage by ``save the planet'' extreme \n     leftist special interest groups has got to end!!! We need to \n     wean off of oil as a major source of energy but that will \n     take time as I understand it. Therefore, as a temporary \n     measure we need to tap into our resources. That will buy us \n     enough time to establish new technologies such as hydrogen \n     (which I believe is a great method of powering vehicles). The \n     best and one of the safest methods of producing electricity \n     is nuclear, utilizing the ability to reuse the fuel. Drilling \n     for oil, harvesting coal, nuclear, and production of hydrogen \n     can all be done in an environmentally sound way, freeing us \n     from bonds of other countries that would like to kill us and \n     the environmental wackos that believe that the world would be \n     a perfect place without humans and they would like to see us \n     revert back to the 1700s or go away completely! To me, energy \n     is a national security issue that must be dealt with \n     immediately. Please help us out of this mess that we have \n     allowed ourselves to get in through bad government policies.\n       Thanks for letting me vent.\n     Paul Petersen.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sen Crapo, let us see, I can't drive my diesel truck and I \n     do not use my boat, I go to work and back. I think you need \n     to take the oil off the stock market and start drilling. What \n     the hell is wrong with everyone in D.C.? You are making so \n     much money off of oil you cannot take care of this.\n       Thanks.\n     Don.\n                                  ____\n\n       In response to the story we saw on KTVB 10 p.m. last night, \n     and again this morning, I would like to submit the following:\n       It is amazing how God knows what is coming and has a way of \n     preparing us for it.\n       Seven years ago, before gas prices started their initial \n     climb, I stumbled upon a deal on a '79 Honda CB650. I had not \n     ridden a motorcycle for eleven years (same length of time it \n     had been sitting in a warehouse). Initially, I did not think \n     I should spend the $800. But a few weeks later decided I \n     could not pass up the deal. Right after I bought it, gas \n     prices started inching upward.\n       Last year, my wife, who has never even expressed interest \n     in motorcycles and even asked me what I needed one for when I \n     bought the CB650, began asking questions about riding. And \n     about a month later (May), she decided to go ahead and do it. \n     We got her a little 150 scooter and signed her up for Idaho \n     STARS, but the first opening was not until Sept 7th. So we \n     did a lot of practice in parking lots before the course \n     began.\n       My elder daughter (31 at the time) had been asking me to \n     teach her to ride for a couple years. But I had to tell her I \n     did not have a bike that was suitable for beginners. It was a \n     high-revving machine that was easy to stall, besides being a \n     rather heavy machine for her to pick up if she dropped it. So \n     when she heard about her mom and found out they provide the \n     bikes for the STARS course, she signed up for the same class, \n     and so did her husband. All three were trained the same \n     weekend.\n       In short, our solution for high gas prices (at least until \n     Congress acts to provide more permanent relief) is to ride \n     two wheels as much as the weather will allow. We prefer not \n     to ride in the rain, and fortunately for us, summertime is \n     very dry here in the Treasure Valley. However, we do have to \n     face the fact that such tactics will not do us much good when \n     fall and winter come along.\n       For the moment, we marvel how God prepared us well in \n     advance, and now gas prices are $1.00/gallon higher than last \n     year.\n       Here is a sample of our present savings. Nancy's present, \n     freeway-capable 400 scooter gets 52 mpg. She can go 135 miles \n     on 2.6 gallons. We are presently paying $4.289/gal for \n     premium at Shell. Those 135 miles cost us $11.15, or little \n     over 8 cents a mile.\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\n       If she drives the same 135 miles in our '02 Pontiac \n     Bonneville that gets 22 mpg, she will burn 6.1 gallons of \n     regular unleaded at 4.099/gallon for $25.01 (18.5 cents a \n     mile.) So every time she fills the scooter, she saves $14.14 \n     in fuel cost at present prices. Savings numbers on my \n     ``bike'' are slightly less, but comparable since it gets 46 \n     mpg. My fill up for 135 miles is 2.9 gallons (same grade) for \n     $12.59, about half of what it costs to drive. And a little \n     publicized fact is that motorcycles contribute a lot less to \n     air pollution, besides being fun to ride, and easier to park.\n       Like a lot of other comments I have seen on the subject, I \n     also think we should be drilling oil in ANWR as well as our \n     own oil fields in Texas (where production numbers are managed \n     by the Texas Railroad Commission), Oklahoma, California and \n     off-shore to reduce our dependence on foreign oil from \n     countries that do not have our best interests at heart.\n       We definitely need to build more nuclear power plants, more \n     refineries to balance supply with demand, and proceed with \n     coal conversion, wind energy, and solar power. I know that \n     hydrogen powered cars only emit water, but hydrogen is so \n     highly explosive, I think it will be a tough sell and will \n     take decades to develop an infrastructure for those daring \n     souls willing to participate. A scary thought is what effect \n     the presence of such cars will have on the safety of other \n     travelers.\n       Respectfully,\n                                          Gene Heikkola, Meridian.\n       Today's energy prices and the rate of incline are far \n     exceeding the rate of pay for many jobs in our area (Idaho \n     Falls). As young adults just starting a family, it is \n     depressing to think about the future and not know if I am \n     going to able to provide for my family.\n       If we are waiting for a rainy day to tap into our domestic \n     oil sources, that time is now! With all of the advancement in \n     technology hopefully our reliance on fossil fuel is going to \n     diminish so why not use them now. Our economy needs it; if \n     less money is spent on filling vehicles people could travel \n     and spend money to boost the economy.\n       Thanks.\n     Jared.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your concern and for taking action on our \n     behalf on the high costs of energy and its effects on the \n     average Idaho family. In your email you mention that the \n     average Idaho family spends $200 per month on gasoline. I \n     feel that that is way too conservative of an estimate. My \n     wife and I spend are now spending $600 per month on just \n     gasoline. I drive a Honda Accord and my wife drives a \n     minivan, neither of which are horrible gas guzzling SUVs. \n     This is putting a real strain on our budget and we are having \n     to cut back in other areas to compensate for the high cost of \n     fuel. We believe that as a nation we should become energy \n     independent. We both support offshore drilling, drilling in \n     the ANWR, processing oil shale in the Rocky Mountain states, \n     nuclear energy, along with all other forms of energy \n     production. We need to clear the way of lawsuits by declaring \n     a national emergency, of which this is. We cannot continue to \n     be the light of freedom to the world if we are dependent upon \n     the countries that are trying to stomp that light out for our \n     very existence. Thank you for concern in this matter.\n     Fred and Kamala Free, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The inability of our government to work together has \n     reached a point it is killing our country. When one party \n     tries to advance an idea the other kills it because it does \n     not fit just right with their program. I have never seen the \n     likes of it. I am a registered and a dyed-in-the-wool \n     Republican but have been having these crazy thoughts that I \n     should vote for a Democrat for President so at least there \n     would be a majority in Congress with a President to go along \n     with it. Crazy thoughts but I am sick of the gridlock.\n       We are retired and have spent a lifetime getting ready so \n     we could travel and see the country and enjoy these last \n     years of our life. All of the sudden we cannot even hardly \n     drive any longer and we find ourselves not being able to make \n     ends meet at the end of the month. As prices keep going up we \n     will find ourselves in trouble as our income is fixed.\n       We should be drilling for oil everywhere it is. Why we have \n     blocked drilling all over the country and allowed ourselves \n     to become hostages to OPEC, I will never be able to \n     understand. We are a free society but oil is so critical to \n     our well being there needs to be some oversight on this \n     business to make sure they are refining to capacity and \n     drilling everywhere. We should not be importing one barrel of \n     oil. The way it is now, the oil companies hold down refining \n     to keep the prices up.\n       Also we should be building nuclear power plants now for the \n     future. Why we stopped building them I do not know.....\n       Good luck. Please get with your Democrat partners and work \n     something out....anything is better than nothing.\n     Val Meikle.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking enough interest in the issue of high \n     gas prices to ask Idahoans. Personally, though it is a hit on \n     the budget and will change the amount of time our fifth wheel \n     spends in storage rather than on the road, the high prices \n     are more of a nuisance than a threat. For that my wife and I \n     are blessed. The bigger issue for me and for the many other \n     Idahoans that I talk to is that we, the little people, \n     understand how to fix the problem and apparently our \n     government does not or will not. We need to immediately start \n     drilling where we know there are oil reserves (Alaska, North \n     Dakota/Montana, off shore) and begin construction of new \n     refineries as the drilling progresses. Also, begin the \n     immediate construction of nuclear power plants to eliminate \n     natural gas fired plants so that those resources can be \n     diverted to other uses. We should begin work on oil shale \n     research and development. Lastly, continue to encourage the \n     development of economically feasible alternatives for our \n     next generation of automobiles but let's not abandon what we \n     already have. I had two ten-year-olds staying at our house \n     last night and as we watched the 10:00 p.m. news they made \n     comments that made it clear to me that they understood that \n     government was the biggest obstacle to solving our current \n     'energy crisis' (so called). Congress needs to shed the bonds \n     they voluntarily accepted from the environmental crowd and do \n     what is right for our country.\n     Don and Gae Burton, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I own a small landscape design and build firm in Boise. The \n     skyrocketing fuel costs are a big hit to my little company. \n     At the prices today, I am spending nearly $3,000 a month on \n     fuel for four trucks and some small equipment. That is a cost \n     to my company of $150 per day. It is hard to pass on all the \n     higher expenses and still be competitive in the marketplace \n     so the net effect is a hardship to my bottom line. This year \n     my fuel costs will be more than 50 percent of my salary.\n       What is our energy policy? Why do we allow other nations to \n     drill off our coast lines only to ship the oil away from our \n     shores and sell it back to us at high prices? When are we \n     going to free ourselves from the Middle East and other \n     nations such as Venezuela whom have such a hatred of America? \n     Showing the rest of the world that we are serious about our \n     own energy independence will have an immediate impact on the \n     current price we pay at the pump.\n       We need to develop a dual approach. We need to open up \n     drilling in ANWR and other areas around our country. We need \n     to work towards weaning ourselves off of foreign oil and gain \n     American oil independence.\n       At the same time we need to work on alternative forms of \n     energy and collectively, government and private industry will \n     be able to solve this crisis.\n       How about a little focus on our own energy independence and \n     let's start taking care of ourselves, stop all the back \n     biting political posturing and come together as Americans for \n     the good of the nation and our long term survival as the \n     greatest nation on God's Green Earth.\n       Thanks for listening.\n     Dave, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/04/senate-section/article/S1540-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Chief Warrant Officer Joshua M.

Chief \nWarrant Officer Tillery was serving his second tour of duty in Iraq at \nthe time of his death.\n  Joshua Tillery was a recipient of the Bronze Star, the Air Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal for Combat \nService, the Global War on Terror Service Medal, two Army Commendation \nMedals, six Army Achievement Medals, the Noncommissioned Officers \nProfessional Development Ribbon, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army \nOverseas Service Ribbon, the Army Air Assault Badge, the Army Aviator \nBadge, the Combat Action Badge, and the Parachutist Badge for his \ncourageous service to our country.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Tillery represents the most selfless and most \nhonorable of men in our country. His friends and family recall how he \nwas to serve his country and how he always wanted to do whatever he \ncould to help people. Joshua loved to fly and was on his way to \nbecoming a flight safety officer. Like so many Oregonians, he enjoyed \noudoor activities, and particularly loved snowboarding and riding dirt \nbikes. He was 31 years old when he passed, a devoted husband, and \nfather of three young boys with another baby on the way.\n  I offer my prayers and condolences to his family and friends. Oregon \nhas lost one of its bravest and brightest young men, and I know I join \nall Oregonians in honoring the legacy of Joshua Tillery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/04/senate-section/article/S1540-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1540-S1541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SYBIL MOSES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Sybil \nMoses, a\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\njudge and pioneer who for 21 years brought to New Jersey her commitment \nto the rule of law and passion for the administration of justice. Sybil \npassed away on January 23, 2009, and is survived by her husband of 48 \nyears, her son, her daughter, and her five beautiful grandchildren. She \nwill be sorely missed by her family and by my home State of New Jersey.\n  Sybil opened up new opportunities for women by virtue of her hard \nwork, and she created a path that many will follow in the future. After \nproving herself as a prosecutor and a judge, Sybil was appointed the \nState's first female assignment judge in 1997. Sybil understood not \nonly the law, but also the needs of residents who came in contact with \nthe court. While serving at the courthouse, for example, she created a \nfree day care center, so that anyone attending a court matter could \nbring their child with them, rather than having to make other \narrangements. Sybil served as an assignment judge until her retirement \nin October. Even retirement, however, could not stop Sybil, who \naccepted two Supreme Court committee assignments so that she could \ncontinue her work improving New Jersey's judiciary system.\n  Sybil attended Rutgers Law School in the early 1970s after the birth \nof her two children. Women were a rarity on campus, and she became part \nof a group of women who called themselves ``The Band of Mothers.'' \nThroughout her life, Sybil exhibited an unwavering strength and \ncommitment to succeed, no matter the circumstances.\n  New Jersey was blessed to have such an enthusiastic, dedicated civil \nservant administering the rule of law for the past 21 years. Sybil \nblazed a path that made it easier for women everywhere to accomplish \ntheir goals. For that, she will be missed and will serve as a role \nmodel for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/04/senate-section/article/S1541-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING GENEST CONCRETE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, our Nation witnessed \nhistory when Barack Obama was sworn in as President of the United \nStates. I am proud to say that the Sanford High School marching band, \nfrom my home State of Maine, was able to participate in the remarkable \nparade following the inauguration. This would not have been possible \nwithout the generosity of many individuals and businesses across \nsouthern Maine. I rise today to recognize one of the companies that \nmade a significant donation toward the band's trip, Genest Concrete.\n  A family-owned small business manufacturing architectural, \nlandscaping and masonry products, Genest Concrete was founded over 70 \nyears ago by Hermangilde Genest. The company started simple, producing \nhand-pressed concrete blocks with materials mined from Mr. Genest's \ngravel pit. Over the years, four generations of the Genest family have \ncontinually strived to make their company more innovative and cutting \nedge, eventually becoming one of the largest manufacturers and \ndistributors of masonry products in New England. Headquartered in \nSanford, Genest also has locations in Biddeford and Windham, with \nauthorized dealers throughout northern New England and Massachusetts.\n  Genest Concrete provides landscape contractors, homeowners, masons, \narchitects and engineers with dozens of durable and superior concrete \nand masonry products. From stormwater brick to a variety of paving and \nwall stones, Genest has all the essential tools for producing unique \ndriveways, patios, paths, and freestanding and retaining walls.\n  More than just a company, Genest is like a family. In fact, it \nrecently launched an inventive effort designed to keep its staff and \ntheir families healthy. Performed in coordination with the Worksite \nStars of York County program at Goodall Hospital, Genest brings nurses \nto the company to perform staff health risk assessments. These \nassessments allow the company to target physical activity and \nnutritional assistance to their employees. So far, an astounding 90 \npercent of employees have participated. And as part of the next phase, \nGenest plans to hold an on-site physical activity program this spring. \nAll employees that complete the 12-week course will be given an \nadditional vacation day. This is on top of the partial reimbursement \nthe firm already offers toward gym memberships. Genest also hopes to \nmake financial wellness and other classes available to its employees \nlater this year.\n  In addition to helping sponsor the Sanford marching band's trip, \nGenest has made many other generous contributions to the community \nthroughout the years. In 2001, Genest provided materials for David \nHopkins to build a skate park in South Berwick as his Eagle Scout \nproject. In 2006, the company donated concrete to Habitat for Humanity \nin York County for its Blitz Build, when the group constructed a new \nhouse in Shapleigh. Genest Concrete also actively sponsors the Sanford \nMainers, part of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, as well as \nteams in the Sanford-Springvale Youth Athletic Association basketball \nleague. And among many other efforts, Genest serves as part of the \nMaine Children's Alliance Business Advisory Group, as well as supports \nDay One, an initiative aimed at reducing substance abuse by Maine \nyouth.\n  While rising to the top of its field, Genest has never forgotten the \ncommunity that helped it get there. Its consistent and dedicated \nendeavors to serve the community have not gone unnoticed. Thank you to \neveryone at Genest Concrete for all of your philanthropic efforts, and \nbest wishes for your continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/04/senate-section/article/S1541-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 549.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 376. A bill to provide rules for the modification or disposition \nof certain assets by real estate mortgage investment conduits pursuant \nto division A of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senators Dodd, \nKerry, Schumer, and Stabenow, the Real Estate Mortgage Investment \nConduit, REMIC, Improvement Act. This legislation could provide one of \nthe keys to solving our national foreclosure crisis by unlocking \nmortgage securitization trusts so that more homeowners can stay in \ntheir homes.\n  In my own state of Rhode Island, 7.30 percent of all outstanding home \nloans are delinquent and 5.33 percent of all home loans are in the \nforeclosure process. This is the 10th highest foreclosure rate in the \nNation, and the highest in New England. I have heard story after story \nof how difficult it is to get a loan modified or restructured if it is \npart of a mortgage securitization pool. As we have learned, part of the \nreason we are in the worst housing crisis since the Depression is that \nWall Street firms packaged mortgages into pools and then sold different \ntranches of these pools to investors from all over the world. This \ndiverse and convoluted ownership structure has made it difficult to get \ninvestor approval to modify or restructure them. Unlike in the movie \n``It's a Wonderful Life,'' most families can no longer walk into their \nlocal bank to talk to George Bailey about modifying or restructuring \ntheir loan.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 required the \nTreasury Department to use its new authorities to incentivize servicers \ntoward more loan restructurings. However, it has become clear that \nadditional legislation is needed to free servicers of these loan pools \nfrom conflicting requirements regarding modifications and provide them \nwith the ability to sell mortgages to Treasury for foreclosure \navoidance.\n  Many servicers, managing pools of loans for investors, are \nconstrained by the trust agreements from modifying loans to a level \nthat families can afford to pay or from selling the underlying\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\nmortgage loans. In other cases, servicers must obtain the approval of a \nsignificant number of the trust's beneficiaries or third parties in \norder to make changes to how loans within the pool are handled. \nHowever, the trust agreements also provide that servicers must amend \nthe agreements if doing so would be helpful or necessary to stay in \ncompliance with tax rules under the REMIC statute; REMIC status frees \nthese securitization trusts from taxation at the entity level and \ntherefore provides important benefits to its investors.\n  Under the REMIC Improvement Act, in order to keep their preferred tax \nstatus under the REMIC provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, \nservicers would need to modify their trust agreements to remove \nartificial restrictions that keep them from modifying loans that \nprovide a greater return to investors as a whole than foreclosing \nwould, and keep families in their homes to prevent entirely unnecessary \nforeclosures at the same time. This is a practical way for servicers to \nmodify loans without undue fear of legal sanctions. This also would \nallow servicers to sell loans to Treasury for restructuring without \nhaving to obtain an affirmative response by a significant number of the \nbeneficiaries of the trust if it was for the good of the overall trust. \nParticipation in any Treasury program would be voluntary, but some of \nthe key legal impediments to participation would be removed.\n  Additionally, the Treasury Department has not put in place a loan \nmodification program, even after Congress gave it the authority to do \nso in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Many experts believe \nsuch a program would be helpful in helping resolve the current housing \ncrisis. The REMIC Improvement Act will ensure that Treasury uses its \nauthority to set up a program to achieve broad-scale modifications and, \nwhere necessary, dispositions of foreclosed property.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide fair compensation to artists for use of \ntheir sound recordings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, Senator Hatch and I renew our \nbipartisan effort to improve and modernize our intellectual property \nlaws. We are reintroducing the Performance Rights Act to ensure artists \nare compensated fairly when their works are used. I am pleased that \nperformance rights legislation will be introduced in the House today, \nas well.\n  When radio stations broadcast music, listeners are enjoying the \nintellectual property of two creative artists--the songwriter and the \nperformer. The success, and the artistic quality, of any recorded song \ndepends on both. Radio stations pay songwriters for a license to \nbroadcast the music they have composed. The songwriters' work is \npromoted by the air play, but no one seriously questions that the \nsongwriter\n\n[[Page S1545]]\n\nshould be paid for the use of his or her work. The performing artist, \nhowever, is not paid by the radio station.\n  The time has come to end this inequity. Its historical justification \nhas been overtaken by technological change. In the digital world, we \nenjoy music transmitted over a variety of platforms. When webcasters, \nsatellite radio companies, or cable companies play music, and profit \nfrom its use, they compensate the performing artists. Terrestrial \nbroadcast radio is the only platform that still does not pay for the \nuse of sound recordings.\n  Radio play surely has promotional value to the artists, but there is \na property right in the sound recording, and those that create the \ncontent should be compensated for their work. The United States is \nbehind the times in this regard. Ours is the only Nation that is a \nmember of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development but \nstill does not compensate artists. An unfortunate result of the lack of \na performance rights in the United States is that American artists are \nnot compensated when their recordings are played abroad.\n  Artists should have the same rights regardless of the platform over \nwhich their work is used. All platforms promote artists and all \nplatforms profit off the artists' work. Today, different rate standards \nand restrictions are applied to different music delivery platforms, \nwith broadcast radio stations being uniquely and completely exempt. In \nthe last Congress, Senator Feinstein chaired a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee that addressed whether the time has come to achieve platform \nparity by harmonizing the terms and conditions for use of the statutory \ncopyright license. Senator Feinstein has been a leader on this issue, \nand I am pleased to accept her offer to lead negotiations this year to \ndevelop a new standard that can be applied across platforms.\n  We also need to make certain that songwriters are protected in this \nprocess. Songwriters currently do receive compensation from radio \nstations. The changes made by this legislation, which will ensure \nperforming artists are compensated, should not have any negative effect \non songwriters. I will work closely with the songwriters and we will \nmake sure that is the case.\n  In introducing the Performance Rights Act today, we are sensitive to \nthe needs of broadcast radio stations; we are sensitive to the \nregulatory regime under which they operate; and we are particularly \nsensitive to the fact that it is not just artists, but also \nbroadcasters that are facing a difficult economic climate. Rather than \nrequire all radio stations to pay fair market value to artists for the \nsongs they play, the legislation includes special provisions for \nnoncommercial and all but the largest commercial stations. In addition, \nevery radio station can use a statutory copyright license to transmit \nsound recordings, instead of negotiating licenses separately in the \nmarketplace.\n  Noncommercial stations have a different mission than do commercial \nstations and they require a different status. Our legislation, \nappropriately, permits noncommercial stations to take advantage of the \nstatutory copyright license subject only to a nominal annual payment to \nthe artists.\n  Similarly, we intend to nurture, not threaten, small commercial \nbroadcasters. Smaller music stations are working hard to serve their \nlocal communities while finding the right formula to increase their \naudience size. We intend to foster the growth of these stations--nearly \n85 percent of the radio stations in Vermont--and the legislation does \nthat by also providing a flat fee option for use of the statutory \nlicense to the more than 75 percent of commercial music stations \nearning less than $1.25 million a year. This payment may only provide \nminimal compensation to the artists whose music is used by the vast \nmajority of commercial music stations, particularly when viewed against \nthe fair market value of the music, but by helping radio stations grow, \nartists, the stations, and the public will all benefit.\n  I am an avid music fan and much of the music I enjoy I first heard on \nthe radio. There is no question that radio play promotes artists and \ntheir sound recordings; there is also no doubt that radio stations \nprofit directly from playing the artists' recordings.\n  Traditional, over-the-air radio remains vital to the vibrancy of our \nmusic culture, and I want to continue to see it prosper as it \ntransitions to digital. But I also want to ensure that the performing \nartist, the one whose sound recordings drive the success of broadcast \nradio, is compensated fairly. I will continue to work with the \nbroadcasters--large and small, commercial and noncommercial--to strike \nthe right balance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bil was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nPerformance Rights Act, S. 379, introduced today by Senate Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, Patrick Leahy, and myself. It is time to amend \ncopyright law to establish performance rights on sound recordings. I \nbelieve that artists should be compensated for their work. This is an \nissue of fairness and equity.\n  I agree with the position of the Department of Commerce Working Group \non Intellectual Property Rights: the lack of a performance right in \nsound recordings is ``an historical anomaly that does not have a strong \npolicy justification--and certainly not a legal one.''\n  This legislation would ensure that musical performers and songwriters \nreceive fair compensation from all companies across the broadcast \nspectrum, not just from Web casters, satellite radio providers, and \ncable companies. The proposed legislation attempts to strike a \nharmonious balance between fair compensation for artists and a vibrant \nradio industry in the U.S.\n  By amending sections 106 and 114 of the Copyright Act, the \nPerformance Rights Act would apply the performance right in a sound \nrecording to all audio transmissions thereby removing the exemption on \npaying performance royalties currently in place for over-the-air \nbroadcasters.\n  The legislation also provides for a blanket license of $5,000 for \nsmall commercial broadcasters whose gross revenues do not exceed $1.25 \nmillion a year. In addition, noncommercial broadcasters as defined by \nsection 118 of the Copyright Act, such as public, educational and \nreligious stations, would have a blanket license of $1,000 per year. No \npayment would be due until the Copyright Royalty Board determines the \nrates for large commercial broadcasters. The proposed language provides \nthat sound recordings used only incidentally by a broadcaster and sound \nrecordings used in the transmission of a religious service are exempt.\n  Finally, the legislation strengthens the provision in section 114 \nthat preserves the rights of songwriters and clarifies that nothing in \nthe Performance Rights Act shall adversely affect the public \nperformance rights of songwriters or copyright owners of musical works.\n  Let me repeat, this provision is to ensure that songwriters are not \nadversely affected by enactment of this bill. I understand the concerns \nof the songwriting community and the difficultly some have in recouping \nroyalties on infringed works. We must ensure that our songwriters are \nnot placed in situations where their property rights are ignored by \ninfringers. Chairman Leahy agrees that additional work to address the \nissue of willful infringement is necessary before enactment, and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  I want the broadcasting community to know that I am committed to \nworking with them throughout the legislative process. I continue to \nhave an open-door policy and welcome a productive dialogue on this \nissue. There is no question that radio play promotes artists and their \nsound recordings. There is also no question that radio stations profit \ndirectly from playing the artists' recordings. Indeed, we must strike a \nfair balance, one that fosters a vibrant broadcast radio community and \ncompensates artists for their work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 381. A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians, to provide a \nprocess for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government and the \nrecognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian government, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I introduce the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act of 2009. While this legislation is \nespecially significant to Native Hawaiians, I introduce this measure \nfor all the people of Hawaii. This bill authorizes a process to extend \nfederal recognition to Hawaii's indigenous people for the purposes of a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States. This \nbenefits all the people of Hawaii, as they will now have a structured, \nformal process to come together to address many unresolved issues \nconfronting our state and our residents.\n  Unlike our Nation's other indigenous people, the Federal policy of \nself-governance and self-determination has not been extended to Native \nHawaiians. The bill addresses this need and establishes parity. It \nprovides Native Hawaiians a formal opportunity to participate in making \npolicy decisions and empowers them to interact at the State and Federal \nlevels through a government-to-government relationship. The legislation \nis consistent with federal and state law and allows Native Hawaiians to \nbe treated the same way as our country's other indigenous people.\n  The United States has recognized and upheld a responsibility for the \nwellbeing of indigenous, native people, including Native Hawaiians. \nCongress has enacted more than 160 statutes to address the needs of \nNative Hawaiians. In 1993, I sponsored a measure commonly known as the \nApology Resolution that was enacted into law. The Resolution outlined \nthe history prior to- and-following the overthrow of the Kingdom of \nHawaii, including involvement in the overthrow by agents of the United \nStates. Further, in the Resolution the United States apologized for its \ninvolvement in the overthrow and committed itself to acknowledge the \nramifications of the overthrow and support reconciliation efforts \nbetween the United States and the Native Hawaiian people. This was a \nhistoric declaration that has initiated a healing process. However, \nadditional Congressional action is needed to continue this process.\n  The legislation allows us to take the necessary next step in the \nreconciliation process. The bill does three things. First, it \nauthorizes an office in the Department of the Interior to serve as a \nliaison between Native Hawaiians and the United States. Second, it \nforms an interagency task force chaired by the Departments of Justice \nand Interior, as well as composed of officials from federal agencies \nwho currently administer programs and services impacting Native \nHawaiians. Third, it authorizes a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian government for the purposes of a federally recognized \ngovernment-to-government relationship. Once the Native Hawaiian \ngovernment is recognized, the bill establishes an inclusive democratic \nnegotiations process representing both Native Hawaiians and non-Native \nHawaiians. There are many checks and balances in this process and any \nagreements reached will require implementing legislation at the State \nand Federal levels.\n  This legislation is needed to address issues present in my home \nstate. It is a reality that there are longstanding and unresolved \nissues resulting from the overthrow. Despite good faith efforts to \naddress these issues, the lack of a government-to-government \nrelationship has limited progress. Building on the constitutionally \nsound and deliberate efforts of Congress and the State of Hawaii, it is \nnecessary that Native Hawaiians be able to reorganize a government and \nenter into discussions with the Federal and State governments. My bill \nwould ensure there is a structured process by which Native Hawaiians \nand the people of Hawaii can come together, resolve such complicated \nissues, and move forward together as a State.\n  The legislation I introduce today is identical to language passed by \nthe House of Representatives in the 106th Congress. This bill is the \nproduct of five working groups the Hawaii Congressional Delegation \ncreated to assist with the drafting of this legislation. The working \ngroups were composed of individuals from the Native Hawaiian community, \nelected officials from the State of Hawaii, representatives from \nfederal agencies, Members of Congress, as well as leaders from Indian \nCountry and experts in constitutional law. This ensured that all \nparties that had expertise and would work to implement the legislation \nhad an opportunity to collectively and collaboratively participate in \nthe drafting process.\n  The Hawaii Congressional delegation has carefully considered the \nsignificant public input and Congressional oversight on this bill over \nthe last 9 years.\n\n[[Page S1547]]\n\nTo date, there have been a total of 9 Congressional hearings, including \n6 joint hearings held by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and House \nNatural Resources Committee, 5 of which were held in Hawaii. From the \nbeginning, the National Congress of American Indians and Alaska \nFederation of Natives have joined Native Hawaiians in their pursuit for \nfederal recognition. In the 110th Congress, the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs explored the legal aspects of the bill where Hawaii's \nState Attorney General expressed his support and spoke to the \nconstitutionality of this measure. In addition to the bipartisan \nsupport at the Federal and State level for the bill, national \norganizations such as the American Bar Association, Japanese American \nCitizens League, and National Indian Education Association have also \nurged Congress to pass legislation establishing a process to provide \nfederal recognition to Native Hawaiians.\n  It is clear this legislation is constitutional and provides a \nframework respectful of the needs of Native Hawaiians and non-Native \nHawaiians. Their combined efforts will be needed as each will play an \nactive role in reaching agreements and enacting implementing \nlegislation at the state and federal levels. I ask my colleagues to \njoin Senator Inouye and I, in enacting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago which is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States.\n       (3) The United States has a special trust relationship to \n     promote the welfare of the native people of the United \n     States, including Native Hawaiians.\n       (4) Under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a \n     treaty between the United States and the government that \n     represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, \n     the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the \n     Hawaiian government, and entered into treaties and \n     conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       (5) Pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United \n     States set aside 203,500 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii to address \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       (6) By setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Act assists the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinct native settlements \n     throughout the State of Hawaii.\n       (7) Approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian lessees and their \n     family members reside on Hawaiian Home Lands and \n     approximately 18,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Home Lands are on a waiting list to receive \n     assignments of land.\n       (8) In 1959, as part of the compact admitting Hawaii into \n     the United States, Congress established the Ceded Lands Trust \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians. Such trust consists of \n     approximately 1,800,000 acres of land, submerged lands, and \n     the revenues derived from such lands, the assets of which \n     have never been completely inventoried or segregated.\n       (9) Throughout the years, Native Hawaiians have repeatedly \n     sought access to the Ceded Lands Trust and its resources and \n     revenues in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State.\n       (10) The Hawaiian Home Lands and the Ceded Lands provide an \n     important foundation for the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian \n     culture, language, and traditions, and for the survival of \n     the Native Hawaiian people.\n       (11) Native Hawaiians have maintained other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii.\n       (12) On November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the Apology Resolution) was enacted \n     into law, extending an apology on behalf of the United States \n     to the Native people of Hawaii for the United States role in \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n       (13) The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and \n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished their claims to their inherent \n     sovereignty as a people over their national lands to the \n     United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum.\n       (14) The Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications \n     of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support \n     reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native \n     Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through \n     the President's designated officials, consult with Native \n     Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under \n     the Apology Resolution.\n       (15) Despite the overthrow of the Hawaiian government, \n     Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate \n     identity as a distinct native community through the formation \n     of cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination and self-governance as evidenced through their \n     participation in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n       (16) Native Hawaiians also maintain a distinct Native \n     Hawaiian community through the provision of governmental \n     services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of \n     health care services, educational programs, employment and \n     training programs, children's services, conservation \n     programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural \n     programs, native language immersion programs and native \n     language immersion schools from kindergarten through high \n     school, as well as college and master's degree programs in \n     native language immersion instruction, and traditional \n     justice programs, and by continuing their efforts to enhance \n     Native Hawaiian self-determination and local control.\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources.\n       (18) The Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future Native Hawaiian generations their \n     ancestral lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural \n     identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, \n     customs and practices, language, and social and political \n     institutions, and to achieve greater self-determination over \n     their own affairs.\n       (19) This Act provides for a process within the framework \n     of Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise \n     their inherent rights as a distinct aboriginal, indigenous, \n     native community to reorganize a Native Hawaiian government \n     for the purpose of giving expression to their rights as \n     native people to self-determination and self-governance.\n       (20) The United States has declared that--\n       (A) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct \n     indigenous group within the scope of its Indian affairs \n     power, and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf \n     pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility; and\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii.\n       (21) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     through--\n       (A) the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4) by--\n       (i) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held in public trust for 5 purposes, one of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians;

TERMINATION.\n\n       The program developed under section 1001, and the authority \n     of the Secretary under this subtitle, shall terminate on \n     December 31, 2010, or such earlier date, if the Secretary \n     determines that no further economic benefit can be achieved \n     or can't be achieved by the private market.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

STUDY ON INTEREST RATES.\n\n       In carrying out this subtitle, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) conduct an economic study of reducing mortgage interest \n     rates, estimating the impact on the mortgage delinquencies \n     and foreclosures, housing prices, and credit markets; and\n       (2) develop clear metrics for the homeowner security \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 1005.
