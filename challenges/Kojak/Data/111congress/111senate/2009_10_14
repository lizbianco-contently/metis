Mr. President, I was a police officer during the time I was \ngoing to law school. I worked at night time. I have some knowledge of \nlaw enforcement. My brother Larry was a longtime officer for the \nsheriff's department in Las Vegas. That has now been\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\ncombined with the Las Vegas police department and is called the Clark \nCounty Metropolitan Police Department. The reason I mention that is \nanytime we see someone killed in the line of duty as a police officer, \nit is scary and sad. The men and women who protect us live with danger \nevery day.\n  In Las Vegas, we had a police officer by the name of Milburn Beitel \nwho is going to be buried today. His friends called him Millie. He was \n30 years old. He died early last Thursday morning after his patrol car \ncrashed at the intersection of Washington Avenue and Nellis Boulevard \nin Las Vegas. The officer with him is in very serious but stable \ncondition. They expect him to live, thank goodness.\n  My thoughts and those of anyone within the sound of my voice and \nanyone who cares about law enforcement, which is everybody in America \nwith rare exception, are with Officer Beitel's family, his friends and \nfellow officers. Our thoughts are also with the second officer, whom we \nwish a full and speedy recovery.\n  We also share the grief of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police \nDepartment. This is the second time in 5 months that the department has \nlost one of its own. This past May, Las Vegas police officer James \nManor, a husband and a brandnew father, was responding to a call in the \nsame Las Vegas community where he grew up. He was struck by a drunk \ndriver and killed. He was 28 years old.\n  Terrible events such as this one make us appreciate the selfless \npolice officers who have fallen in the line of duty--far too many. We \nthink of their loved ones, people whose father or mother went to work \nin the morning and never came home, those who know the terrible \nexperience of mourning a son or daughter, those whose husband, wife, or \nbest friend was taken from them too soon.\n  This morning, we are reminded of the bravery of those who go to work \nevery day and put their lives at risk to protect people they don't \nknow. We remember and honor Officer Beitel. We thank him and his fellow \nofficers and their families for their service and sacrifice, not only \nthe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department but police departments all \nover the country, for the valiant work they do, including the men and \nwomen who take care of this beautiful Capitol and protect us and the \nmillions of visitors who come here every year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10386-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, most Americans recognize that our \ncontinued success in preventing another terrorist attack on U.S. soil \ndepends on our ability as a nation to remain vigilant and clear-eyed \nabout the nature of the threats we face at home and abroad. Some \nthreats come in the form of terror cells in distant countries, others \ncome from people plotting attacks within our own borders, and still \nothers can come from a failure to recognize that distinction between \neveryday crimes--everyday crimes--and war crimes.\n  This last category of threat is extremely serious but sometimes \noverlooked, and that is why Senators Graham, Lieberman, and McCain have \noffered an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nappropriations bill that would reassure the American people the Senate \nhas not taken its eye off the ball.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. It explicitly prohibits \nany of the terrorists who were involved in the September 11, 2001, \nattacks from appearing for trial in a conventional U.S. courtroom. \nInstead, it would require the government to use military commissions; \nthat is, the courts proper to war for trying these men.\n  By requiring the government to use military commissions, the \nsupporters of this amendment are reaffirming two things: first, that \nthese men should have a fair trial; and, second, we are reaffirming \nwhat American history has always shown; namely, that war crimes and \ncommon crimes are to be tried differently and that military courts are \nthe proper forum for prosecuting terrorists who violate the laws of \nwar.\n  Some might argue that terrorists such as Zacarias Moussaoui, one of \nthe 9/11 coconspirators, are not enemy combatants, that they are \nsomehow on the same level as a convenience store stickup man. But \nlisten to the words of Moussaoui himself. He disagrees.\n  Asked if he regretted his part in the 9/11 attacks, Moussaoui said:\n\n       I just wish it will happen on the 12th, the 13th, the 14th, \n     the 15th, the 16th, the 17th, and [on and on].\n\n  He went on to explain how happy he was to learn of the death of \nAmerican servicemen in the Pentagon on 9/11. Then he mocked an officer \nfor weeping about the loss of men under her command, saying:\n\n       I think it was disgusting for a military person to pretend \n     that they should not be killed as an act of war. She is \n     military. She should expect that people who are at war with \n     her will try to kill her. I will never cry because an \n     American bombed my camp.\n\n  There is no question Moussaoui believes he is an enemy combatant \nengaged in a war against us.\n  The Senate has also made itself clear on this question. Congress \ncreated the military commissions system 3 years ago, on a bipartisan \nbasis, precisely to deal with prosecutions of al-Qaida terrorists \nconsistent with U.S. national security, with the expectation that they \nwould be used for that purpose. The Senate reaffirmed this view 2 years \nago when it voted 94 to 3 against transferring detainees from \nGuantanamo stateside, including 9/11 coconspirators.\n  We reaffirmed it, again, earlier this year when we voted 90 to 6 \nagainst using any funds--any funds--from the war supplemental to \ntransfer any of the Guantanamo detainees to the United States. Just \nthis summer, the Senate reaffirmed the view that military commissions \nare the proper forum for bringing enemy combatants to justice when we \napproved, without objection, an amendment to that effect as part of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Sometimes it seems like the only people who do not believe that men \nsuch as 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed should be treated as \nenemy combatants are working in the administration. How else can we \nexplain the fact that over the summer the administration flew \nGuantanamo detainee Ahmed Ghailani to New York to face trial for \nbombing Embassies of the United States in Kenya and Tanzania, an attack \nthat killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans? This was an \nact of war. Ghailani does not belong in civilian court alongside con \nmen and stickup artists.\n  Our past experiences with terror trials in civilian courts have \nclearly been shown to undermine our national security. During the trial \nof the mastermind of the first Trade Center bombing, we saw how a small \nbit of testimony about a cell phone battery was enough to tip off \nterrorists that one of their key communication links had been \ncompromised.\n  We saw how the public prosecution of the Blind Sheik, Abdel Rahman, \ninadvertently provided a rich source of intelligence to Osama bin Laden \nahead of the 9/11 attacks. We remember that Rahman's lawyer was \nconvicted of smuggling orders to his terrorist disciples. These are \njust some of the concerns that arise from bringing terror suspects to \nthe United States.\n  Trying terror suspects in civilian courts is also a giant headache \nfor local communities, as evidenced by the experience over here in \nAlexandria, VA, during the Moussaoui trial. As I have pointed out in \nprevious floor statements, parts of Alexandria became a virtual \nencampment every time Moussaoui was moved to the courthouse. Those were \nthe problems we saw in Northern Virginia, when just one terrorist was \ntried in civilian court. What will happen to Alexandria or other cities \nif several men who describe themselves as ``terrorists to the bone'' \nare tried in civilian courts there?\n  It is because of dangers and difficulties such as these that we \nestablished the military commissions in the first place. If we cannot \nexpect the very people who masterminded the 9/11 attacks to fall within \nthe jurisdiction of these military courts, then whom can we?\n  Democratic leaders, including the President, assure us they would \nnever release terror suspects into the United States. But lawyers have \nrepeatedly\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nwarned about our inability to control the process once the suspects are \ngiven civilian trials. Once you bring them here, you cannot control the \nprocess.\n  To illustrate the point, last year a Federal judge ordered the \nUighurs, a group of men detained at Guantanamo, including some who \nreceived combat training in Afghanistan, to be released into the United \nStates. Fortunately, the DC Circuit reversed this order. Why? Because \nthe Uighurs had not been brought to the United States and, therefore, \ndid not have a right to be released here. We do not know what would \nhave happened if they had been transferred here already. But we do know \nthat because they were not, they remain outside our borders, safely \naway from our communities.\n  The American people have made themselves clear on this issue. They do \nnot want Gitmo terrorists brought into the United States, and they \ncertainly do not want the men who conspired to commit the 9/11 attack \non America tried in civilian courts--risking national security, their \npotential release, and civic disruption in the process.\n  Congress created military commissions for a reason. But if the \nadministration fails to use military commissions for self-avowed \ncombatants such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, then it is wasting this \ntime-honored and essential tool in the war on terror.\n  The amendment by Senators Graham, Lieberman, and McCain gives us all \nan opportunity to express ourselves, once again, on this vital issue. \nThe question is not whether terror suspects should be brought to \njustice. The question is where and how. The answer is perfectly clear: \nThe right forum is military commissions at the secure facility we \nalready have at Guantanamo, not in civilian courts in the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10387-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEALTH CARE WEEK XIII, DAY II\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, sometime in the coming days, the \nTreasury Department will make an announcement that should startle all \nof us. It will announce that in the fiscal year that ended just 2 weeks \nago, the Federal Government spent $1.4 trillion more than it actually \nhad. What this announcement means is that lawmakers in Washington ran \nup a Federal deficit in 2009 greater than the deficits of the last 4 \nyears combined.\n  This is a staggering statistic. It is impossible for most of us to \nimagine sums of money this large, let alone the unprecedented amount of \nmoney we have borrowed this year alone. But one way to think of it is \nto realize that since January 20 of this year, the Federal Government \nhas borrowed $1.2 trillion or more than $10,500 for every household in \nthe United States--this year alone: $10,500 for every household in our \ncountry. Just since last January, the Federal Government, as I \nindicated, has borrowed more than $10,500 for every single household in \nAmerica.\n  As you can imagine, there is a limit to how much we can borrow \nwithout facing serious consequences, such as dramatically higher \ninterest rates that will further hamper job creation and massive \nspending cuts and taxes down the road. That is precisely why Congress \nsets a limit on how much debt the government can carry at any one time. \nBut the administration has decided to worry about all these things at a \nlater date. For now, it wants to continue to borrow and spend, borrow \nand spend, as it has done all year.\n  But we are in dangerous territory. As a result of all this borrowing, \nCongress is about to reach the limit on the amount of debt it can \nlegally carry. The administration expected this would happen, and that \nis why it recently asked Congress to raise the debt ceiling. Rather \nthan cut spending or implement reforms that would reduce costs, the \nadministration is proposing we borrow even more to finance its industry \nbailouts and now its health care proposal. What this amounts to is a \npublic admission it cannot live within its means.\n  Think about the message that sends to American people. At a time when \nmillions of Americans are experiencing a financial hangover from \noverusing their own credit cards, the government is still at it. Rather \nthan pay down some of the principal, the government is asking the \ncredit card company to increase its limit. What does it plan to buy \nwith the room it gets on its credit card? More government spending \nprograms.\n  This is fiscal madness. The primary reason we are in so much trouble \nfinancially is the fact that we cannot afford our current spending \npatterns. The projected deficit for 2009 is nearly twice as large as \nthe previous postwar record from 1983. Yet instead of reforming \nexisting programs such as Medicare and Social Security in order to make \nthem financially sound and stable, the administration does not want to \nmake any hard choices.\n  This is one of the reasons the administration has a problem on its \nhands with the American people when it comes to health care. Most of \nthe health care bills the administration supports would raise our debt \nby hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet the administration knows \nAmericans are concerned about all this spending and debt; otherwise, it \nwould not have touted a report last week saying that a conceptual \nversion of one of several health care bills being discussed in Congress \ncould cut the deficit by $80 billion over 10 years.\n  Leaving aside the fact that this particular bill will never see the \nlight of day, an important question arises: How can an administration \nthat is asking Congress for a $1 trillion increase on its credit card \nlimit claim with a straight face to be excited about $80 billion in \ndeficit savings? That is like putting a new Mercedes on the government \ncredit card and then calling a press conference on frugality because \nthe dealer threw in a complimentary cup holder.\n  Americans do not buy any of it, and that is why they are \noverwhelmingly opposed to the administration's health care proposals. \nAt the outset of this debate, there was one criterion for success: \nReform would lower the cost of health care. Yet no one--no one--outside \nWashington believes that creating a new $1 trillion entitlement will do \nanything but increase costs and increase debt.\n  We are headed down a dangerous road. It is long past time for the \nadministration and its allies in Congress to face the hard choices \nAmericans have had to face over the past several months: No more \nspending money we do not have on things we do not need; no more debt. \nReal reform will lower costs and debt, not raise both when we can least \nafford it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10387-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to address several points \nraised by the Republican minority leader in his opening statement this \nmorning. He stood in support and defense of an amendment that has been \nproposed by the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham. What it \nbasically would say is, we cannot try terrorists in the courts of \nAmerica; in the criminal courts of America we cannot bring a terrorist \nto trial; they have to be tried, according to the Graham amendment and \nthe position of the Republican leader, in military tribunals or \ncommissions only. That is a dramatic\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\nchange from the law as we know it, and very bad policy.\n\n  Since 9/11, we have successfully prosecuted 195 terrorists in \nAmerica's criminal courts. During that same period of time, we \nsuccessfully prosecuted in our military commissions and tribunals \nthree--three--terrorists. So if one wants to know where we are more \nlikely to end up putting a terrorist behind bars, I would suggest going \nto the Department of Justice and letting them decide whether the case \nbest be tried in a criminal court in America or in a military tribunal. \nThat is the current policy. But the position of the Republican side is \nto take away this discretion of the Attorney General and to tell them \nunder no circumstances can you try a terrorist for violating American \nlaw in an American court.\n  It makes no sense.\n  Recently we had a case where a man named Ahmed Ghailani was brought \nto the United States for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of our \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania which killed 224 people, including 12 \nAmericans. President Obama said this man is going to be tried for \nkilling Americans, for his terrorist acts in Africa. I have seen the \ndevastation it caused; almost unimaginable. The President said he will \nbe brought to New York City and he will be tried in our courts. That is \nunderway. It is the right thing to do. The surviving loved ones of \nthose who died in that embassy have praised the administration for \ntheir leadership in bringing this man to justice.\n  Under the amendment which the Republicans are supporting, we would \nnot be able to bring this man to trial in an American courtroom. Why? \nIf the laws are on the books and can be successfully used to prosecute \nterrorists, why would we throw away this important opportunity and tool \nto stop terrorism? I will let the Republican side of the aisle explain \nwhy. But in the meantime, perhaps they can explain why we should ignore \nthe reality that there are 355 convicted terrorists currently serving \ntime in American prisons and 350 or more of them were convicted in our \ncourts. We know we can do it. We know we can successfully prosecute \nthem under American law. Why would the Republicans want to shield them \nfrom prosecution under American law and instead use military \ncommissions and tribunals which have been very controversial and have \nonly successfully prosecuted three terrorists over the last 7 or 8 \nyears since 9/11? It is the Republican position and it makes no sense. \nWe should use every tool in our arsenal to stop terrorism, and give the \nAttorney General every authority he needs to decide where is the best \nplace to prosecute these individuals.\n  This notion that somehow we can't bring a terrorist to justice in \nAmerica for fear they will be held in a jail in America--how do you \nexplain 350 terrorists currently serving time in American prisons? They \nare being treated as every other criminal should be treated: \nincarcerated, isolated, away from the population. That is the way it \nshould be. There are places other than Guantanamo to hold these \nprisoners safely, and I think the record speaks for itself.\n\n\n                             National Debt\n\n  The second issue that was raised by the Republican leader was about \nour national debt. He is arguing that the debt is too high, and he is \nright. But he also ought to be very candid and open about how we \nreached this point in history. President Obama has been in office now \nfor 9 months, and what did he inherit? The biggest debt in the history \nof the United States. What did his predecessor, George W. Bush, \ninherit? A surplus in the Federal Treasury. When President Clinton left \noffice, he left behind a surplus. It is the first time in 30 years we \nhad a surplus. President Bush took that surplus and turned it into the \nbiggest debt in history, and took that and left the weakest economy in \n70 years to the Obama administration. Now comes the Republican side \nsaying this is a shame that the Obama people have gotten us into this \nmess with this debt.\n  How did we reach this point? Decisions under President George W. Bush \nto wage two wars without paying for them, simply to add to the national \ndebt; to do what had never been done before by any President, to give \ntax cuts to the wealthiest people in America in the midst of a war; and \nto create a Medicare prescription drug program that wasn't paid for. \nThe cumulative impact of those decisions increased the debt of America \nto record-breaking levels, and that is what was handed to President \nObama when he took office. Now come the Republicans who supported those \npolicies under President Bush and blame President Obama for the debt \nleft behind by the previous President. That is unfair and it is not \naccurate.\n  I am sorry we have this debt. Once this economy turns--and I hope it \ndoes soon--and jobs are created and businesses are back generating the \nprofits they need, our economy will be strong again and revenues will \nbe created, but we are going to have to claw our way out of this \nrecession and create jobs to make that happen. Twisting and distorting \nthe history of our American debt does not help that conversation.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Incidentally, the minority leader said one thing which I hope he will \ncome back to correct. He said the health care reform now underway is \ngoing to add to that national debt. If there is one thing President \nObama made clear when he spoke to us about this health care reform \nissue it is that we cannot add to the debt. This bill reported by the \nFinance Committee yesterday does not add to the national debt. In fact, \nit reduces the deficit over the next 10 years. That is the standard the \nPresident has held us to when it comes to dealing with the deficit and \nhealth care reform.\n  Make no mistake. The opponents to health care reform are being led \nand inspired by many people but primarily by one group: the health \ninsurance industry. The health insurance industry, one of the most \nprofitable in America, has made its money by saying no and denying care \nto people when they need it the most. When we try to bring about real \nhealth insurance reform so they can't turn you down because of a \npreexisting condition discovered in some old document filed years \nbefore and they can't put limits on the coverage you need when you do \nget sick, the health insurance industry is fighting us tooth and nail, \nand many on the other side of the aisle are arguing their case. I think \nit is a tough case to argue to most Americans.\n  Most Americans understand we need to bring the costs of health care \nunder control so that Americans have security and stability and don't \nsee health insurance premiums going through the roof, businesses \ncancelling coverage, and individuals unable to protect themselves. They \nunderstand we need real health insurance reform. I have yet to hear the \nfirst Republican Senator stand on this floor and call for real health \ninsurance reform, because the health insurance industry doesn't want it \nand many on the other side of the aisle are not going to cross them \nwhen it comes to this debate.\n  Finally, it is imperative that America move to the point where more \nAmericans have the peace of mind of health insurance protection. To \nthink that 40 million-plus Americans are going to go to bed tonight \nuncertain about whether a diagnosis tomorrow or an accident tomorrow \nwill plunge them deeply into debt for medical bills they can't pay is \nunacceptable in this country. Today 14,000 Americans will lose their \nhealth insurance coverage by losing a job or reaching a point where \nthey can no longer pay for it. That is the sad reality of the current \nsystem. The Republican side of the aisle has no alternative, no \nproposal for health insurance reform, or health care reform.\n  I wish to salute Senator Snowe of Maine for her extraordinary courage \nyesterday, stepping up and voting--the only Republican so far who has \nvoted for health care reform in the U.S. Congress. I am sure she took a \nlot of grief for it, a lot of pressure, but she showed real courage, \nextraordinary courage in voting to join us in this effort for real \nhealth care reform.\n  We have heard from former Republican leader Frist; we have heard as \nwell from Republican Governor Schwarzenegger; the mayor of New York, \nMr. Bloomberg; the mayor of Minnesota, and others who have talked about \nthe need for health insurance reform. It tells me that many of the \ncongressional Republicans should listen to the leaders in their party \nacross the country who understand what America needs and wants.\n  Now is our chance. In the next few weeks we are going to do something\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nwhich we have been trying to do for 40 or 50 years: Bring real health \ncare reform debate to the floor of the U.S. Senate. It won't be easy. \nThere are a lot of differences of opinion about the goals we want to \nreach. But I want to tell my colleagues that we are finally taking that \nimportant step under the leadership of President Obama to do what \nAmerica wants done: to make sure we have health care reform that will \nserve our Nation and serve families and businesses in the 21st century.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa is on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, all five congressional committees involved \nin the health care reform debate have completed their work now and the \ncore elements of this landmark legislation are now clear.\n  The media has done a good job of reporting that the emerging bill \nwill crack down on abuses by health insurance companies and extend \nquality health coverage to the vast majority of Americans. In addition, \nmuch attention has been paid to the public option which I am confident \nwill be in the bill we send to the President later this year. So there \nhas been a lot in the press about the public option; about coverage; \nhow much this costs; will there be an excise tax; what will the \npenalties be. Almost all of the debate we see--I should say \ndiscussion--surrounding the health care reform is about how we pay the \nbills, when we think about it. It is about how are we going to pay all \nof these bills.\n  There is one huge part of the health reform bill that is not being \ndiscussed very much that I believe will have a transformative effect on \nthe system we have in America today, which I have often referred to as \nnot a health care system but a sick care system. When we think about \nit, that is what we have in America: a sick care system. If you get \nsick, you get care one way or the other, but we do precious little to \nkeep you healthy in the first place. As one of the comedians on one of \nthese late night talk shows I happened to tune in to one night said, \nyou know, they are talking about everything except health care.\n  What do we need to do to keep people healthy in the first place? \nWell, quite frankly, that is in our bill. That is what I wanted to \ndiscuss this morning, which is some of the aspects of the bill that I \nbelieve will bend the cost curve in the future and make us a genuine \nwellness society. The bill we reported out of our HELP Committee \ncreates a sharp new emphasis on fitness, physical activity, good \nnutrition, disease prevention; in short, keeping people out of the \nhospital in the first place. This will give Americans access to a 21st \ncentury true health care system focused on preventing disease and \nhelping us live healthy, active, productive lives, and it will reduce \nwasteful, avoidable costs that are built into our current system. \nAgain, this sort of disease management approach we have in our country \nnow is about patching things up after people develop a serious illness \nor a chronic condition. It is a system that overspends, which we know, \nand underperforms. It has been a colossally expensive failure.\n  We can and must do better. As President Obama said in his speech to \nCongress back in February:\n\n       [It is time] to make the largest investment ever in \n     preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep \n     our people healthy and keep our costs under control.\n\n  To most of us, it is self-evident that cost-effective preventive \nservices will save money in the long term. This first chart is of a \npoll taken which shows that 76 percent of the American people said we \nshould invest more in preventive care--76 percent. They get it. The \nAmerican people get it. This support comes from across the political \nspectrum. Eighty-six percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans, \nand 70 percent of Independents say we should be spending more on \nprevention.\n  This next chart shows that 77 percent of Americans support a new \nemphasis on prevention in a health care reform bill because they know \nit is the right thing to do. It is common sense. If we can use cost-\neffective screenings and other upfront intervention programs to prevent \ntens of millions of occurrences of chronic diseases such as cancer, \ndiabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it is self-evident that we are \ngoing to slash health care costs very significantly.\n  Some critics have claimed that a new emphasis on wellness and \nprevention will cost more money and it will drive up health care costs. \nTo support this claim, they have created a straw man, assuming that we \nare going to do all of these preventive services for everybody all the \ntime, but that is not what is in our bill. I wish to emphasize that our \ncommittee's bill takes a very rigorous approach to prevention. We \ntarget appropriate preventive services and screenings only to those \nsegments of the population that are at risk of a disease or a \ncondition.\n  For example, under our bill, mammogram screenings would be free--no \ncopays, no deductibles--but to those most at risk of breast cancer--\nwomen over the age of 40.\n  At every step, what we have relied on are the latest recommendations \nof the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. This task force has been in \nexistence since the early 1980s. It evaluates clinical preventive \nservices on the basis of scientific evidence related to effectiveness, \nappropriateness, and cost-effectiveness. So what we have said is that \nif the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives a certain preventive \nmeasure or screening an A or a B score, then the insurance companies \nand providers must provide that without any copays or deductibles. So \nit is targeted. It is not everything, but we are targeting the most \ncost-effective.\n  We also say that this task force has to meet at least once every 5 \nyears and take in the latest scientific evidence and make \nrecommendations for revising the mix of clinical preventive services.\n  Let me review some of the ways the Senate HELP Committee bill, in a \nvery careful way, will put prevention and wellness at the very heart of \nhealth reform.\n  First, we create a Federal level prevention and public health council \nto improve coordination among Federal agencies in incorporating \nwellness into a national policy, and will develop a national prevention \nand a public health strategy. All of the departments should be doing \nthis, not just the Department of Health and Human Services but the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, the Department of Transportation, and on and on. All \nof them ought to have as an integral part of their deliberations and \nproposals for future legislation that they might propose in the \nCongress an element of prevention and wellness. Take the Department of \nTransportation, for example. When they are thinking about highways, \nbridges, roads, and things such as that, are they thinking about bike \npaths and walking paths and sidewalks in cities that could be \nincorporated into the planning if they want Federal money? Well, they \nhave not so far. This is what I mean. We need this kind of an overall \ncoordinating council at the White House level, at the department level.\n  We also start a prevention and public health investment fund to \nprovide for expanded and sustained national investments in prevention \nand public health programs in communities all across America.\n  A 2007 study by the Trust for America's Health found major savings \nfrom community-based prevention programs. There is clinic-based \nprevention where you get a screening, but then there are community-\nbased programs to improve physical activities, nutrition, reduce \nsmoking rates, and things such as that. They found that a national \ninvestment of just $10 per person per year--think about that, $10 per \nperson per year--in certain community-based wellness programs would \nyield these kinds of savings: in 1 to 2 years, $2.8 billion; 5 years, \n$16 billion; and 10 to 20 years, $18.5 billion.\n  Again, on both the community level and the clinical level, we provide \nfor funding and a structure to make wellness and prevention an integral \npart of our health care system. For example, our bill would target \nnutrition counseling to prediabetic patients. Right now, under \nMedicare, for example, and most insurance companies, they will \nreimburse thousands of dollars to take care of your diabetic conditions \nonce you get diabetes. They\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\nwill pay for amputating a foot or a leg. They will pay for all these \nexpensive things after you get diabetes. They will pay for a lifetime \nof treatment. But now they will not reimburse for the cost of nutrition \ncounseling--a few hundred dollars for someone who is prediabetic and \nwho could prevent the disease through changes in diet. That doesn't \nmake sense. Our bill would change this by requiring insurance plans to \nreimburse for nutrition counseling for prediabetic individuals--another \nexample of a cost-effective approach.\n  For essential screenings and annual physicals, our bill would get rid \nof copays and deductibles for things such as your annual physical \ncheckups, vaccinations, mammogram screenings, and colonoscopies for the \nright population group, things like that--no copays, no deductibles.\n  We are going to make major new investments in the public health and \nprimary care workforce. Senator Murray, of Washington, did a great job \nof incorporating workforce development in our committee bill. A lot of \nthat workforce development is in the area of primary care and \npreventive care and wellness.\n  Finally, we give a powerful boost to employer-sponsored wellness \nprograms. Our bill would allow employers to reward employees for \nparticipating in wellness programs by giving them a health insurance \npremium discount of up to 30 percent. In other words, if you \nparticipate in a wellness program that is provided by your employer, \nyou can get a discount of up to 30 percent on your health insurance \npremium. I believe this is something that has been done by Safeway and \nothers, and they have shown that they have had great results. People \ncan see the benefit of wellness and prevention by getting a reduction \nin their health care premiums.\n  Workplace wellness programs--everything from nutrition counseling to \nsmoking cessation--typically cost about $20 to $200 per employee per \nyear. Again, they have a proven rate of return, ranging from $2 to $10 \nwithin 18 months, for every dollar spent. If you don't believe me, ask \nPitney-Bowes what they did or Safeway. I single those two out, but many \ncompanies have gone way ahead of us in providing wellness programs for \ntheir employees. Are they doing it just out of sheer generosity? No. \nThey know the bottom line. They know that when they provide wellness \nand prevention programs for their employees, their rate of return per \ndollar spent on an employee is 2 to 10 times as much within just a year \nor two. They have healthier employees. They don't go to the hospital as \noften. They don't have chronic diseases and they are more productive. \nThey show up for work and they are more productive. What we have done \nin our bill is expanded this nationwide to give more companies the \nincentive to do that.\n  Our bill also directs the CDC to study and evaluate the best \nemployer-based wellness programs and to create an educational campaign \nto promote these workplace wellness programs throughout America.\n  We think about the United States and our sick care system this way: \nWe spend twice as much per capita on health care as European \ncountries--twice as much--but we are twice as sick with chronic \ndiseases. How is this possible? The reason is clear: We have neglected \nwellness prevention and disease prevention. In the United States, 95 \ncents of every health care dollar is spent on treating illnesses and \nconditions after they occur. Two-thirds of the increase in health care \nspending is due to increased prevalence of treated chronic disease. \nThis chart illustrates that. In the late 1980s, we were spending about \n$313 billion a year on chronic disease. We have now doubled that. It is \nup to $627 billion, and it is going up at an ever-increasing rate. \nThese are diseases that are mostly preventable. Yet we just continue to \nspend the money dealing with these chronic diseases.\n\n  The good news is that by reforming our system and keeping people \nhealthy and preventing chronic illnesses, we have a great opportunity \nto not only save hundreds of billions of dollars but to improve the \nhealth of the American people.\n  Right now, 75 percent of health care costs are accounted for by heart \ndisease, diabetes, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and obesity--five of \nthem. These five diseases account for 75 percent of our health care \ncosts. What do they have in common? They all have this in common: They \nare largely preventable, and even reversible, by changes in nutrition, \nphysical activity, and lifestyle.\n  Again, for every dollar spent, 75 cents went toward treating patients \nwith chronic disease. The CDC said this:\n\n       The United States cannot effectively address escalating \n     health care costs without addressing the problem of chronic \n     diseases.\n\n  Ninety-six cents of every Medicare dollar--we always hear that we are \nnot going to have enough money for Medicare in the next 10 or 12 years, \nhowever long it is. Well, 96 cents goes for chronic disease. If you \nwant to cut down on how much money we spend on Medicare, let's focus on \nprevention and wellness, especially for that group of individuals who \nare between 55 and 65, about ready to go on Medicare. Eighty-three \ncents of every dollar spent on Medicaid is spent on chronic diseases. \nWhy don't we understand this and get it right? Yet, just like blind \ndodos, we say we will just keep spending the money and we won't address \nwellness and prevention. And we wonder why we can't get health care \ncosts under control. Well, that is why. We are not addressing the \nunderlying issues of wellness and prevention.\n  Again, it makes no sense to me that we spend all this time and all \nthis effort to figure out a better way to pay the bills in a system \nthat is dysfunctional, ineffective, and broken. We have to change the \nhealth care system itself. We have to change from a sick care system to \na health care system, beginning with a sharp new emphasis on prevention \nand public health and wellness. That is in this bill, and that is not \nbeing talked about by the media. It is one of the fundamental parts of \nthe health care reform we are going to be putting through here on the \nSenate floor and, hopefully, in Congress and to the President by the \nend of the year.\n  It also has to be comprehensive. Not everything that deals with \nwellness and prevention can be done in this bill. For example, very \nsoon we have to reauthorize the child nutrition bill, which deals with \nthe School Lunch Program and the Breakfast Program. We have to get \nbetter food, more nutritional food for our kids in school and get the \njunk food out. Why do we have vending machines in schools? Do we have \nvending machines in schools to provide more healthy food for kids in \nschool? You know the answer to that. Of course not. Why do you have the \nvending machines in schools? Is it so that the school can make money so \nit can buy band uniforms or maybe football uniforms and things like \nthat? Is it so we can get our kids on junk food and high-sugar sodas, \nwhich leads to obesity and leads to diabetes and other kinds of chronic \nillnesses? Do we really want that for our kids in school? We have to \nhave more nutritional foods. That is the child nutrition \nreauthorization.\n  Next year, under our committee, I say to the occupant of the chair, \nwho is now a distinguished member of our committee, we are going to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is also \ncalled No Child Left Behind. What about making sure we leave no child \nbehind also in terms of their health? Right now, we are cutting down on \nphysical activity with kids in school. We are cutting down on recess \nand time for them to exercise. That is just nonsense. We have to do \nmore to provide for exercise and healthy foods for our kids in school. \nThat is where it all begins.\n  To close, Winston Churchill once said something I always thought was \npretty much right on point:\n\n       Americans always do the right thing--after they have tried \n     everything else.\n\n  We have tried everything else in health care, and it has failed. It \nhas led us to bad health and to the brink of bankruptcy. Let's try \nsomething new--wellness and prevention. Times change the paradigm of \nhealth care. Let's recreate America as a genuine wellness society. \nLet's change the focus and make it easier to be healthy and harder to \nbe unhealthy. Right now, it is easier to be unhealthy and hard to be \nhealthy. Let's change that around, and in doing so we will build a \nhealth care system and bend that cost curve. That is the only way to \nget the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I plan on taking about 10 minutes of our \ntime.\n  I serve on the HELP Committee with the distinguished chairman. There \nis no question we have not emphasized prevention in this country, but \nthere is a reason we have not. We do not pay for it. Medicare does not \npay for it. The insurance companies follow what Medicare does.\n  We have heard some pretty good claims this morning in terms of the \nHELP bill. I sat through almost 3 weeks of markup on that bill. I don't \nbelieve there is anybody in Congress who does not want us to change the \nway we look at prevention because there is no way we can control health \ncare costs unless we both try to prevent chronic disease and also \nmanage the chronic disease we have.\n  One of the reasons we have more chronic disease than other countries \nis because we keep people with chronic disease alive a lot longer. They \nlet them die. They ration the care out, and they determine what the \nvalue of their life is. With a chronic disease, eventually they quit \ntreating them. The numbers get skewed because we do a pretty good job. \nEven though we did not prevent it, we do a wonderful job, and we can \nactually do far better in managing chronic disease.\n  What the Senator and the HELP committee put out is a government-\ncentered bill. Let me give an example. Duke University set up a clinic \nfor heart failure patients. They were having phenomenal results. These \nare all Medicare patients, class III, class IV, class V heart patients. \nThey dropped hospital admissions 27 percent. They shut it down. Why did \nthey shut it down? Medicare would rather pay--because they are not \nflexible, they will not recognize prevention--they shut down a clinic \nthat was saving them $100 million a year, even though it cost about a \nsignificant portion of that, 10 percent or so, to run the clinic. They \nwould rather spend the $90 million than to pay for prevention. So what \nwas a great clinic--keeping people out of the hospital, maintaining \ntheir chronic disease. Medicare did that.\n  That is the reason I am very opposed to the bill--not the principles \nof the bill but the bill that came out of committee. The bill that came \nout of our committee creates 88 new government programs--88. Think \nabout it. What do we want in health care? What we want in health care \nis to be able to determine our own future, to determine our own doctor, \nand to be able to afford to buy the health care our families need. That \nis what we want. We create 88 new Federal Government programs managing \nour health care, and that freedom to choose, that freedom to make a \njudgment is going to go out the window.\n  The other points the Senator mentioned, he talked about increasing to \n30 percent the ability of performance bonuses for people to get into \nreduction plans, wellness plans. He mentioned Safeway. They can spend \n21 percent under HIPAA now. Safeway's testimony was, give us the \nflexibility everybody else in the country has and let's go up to 50 \npercent. We don't trust them to do that, even though Safeway has had no \nincrease in health care costs in the last almost now 5 years because \nthey have truly incentivized prevention.\n  He mentioned workforce development, and he mentioned all these \nincentives to help people become primary care doctors. They are not \ngoing to become primary care doctors. Do you know why? I am a primary \ncare doctor. They are not going to pay them. The reason we have a \ndisproportionate number of specialists versus primary care doctors in \nthis country is because there is a 350-percent payment differential. \nHow do you think that came about? Medicare created that differential.\n  If we want more primary care doctors, then what we have to do is pay \npeople to go into primary care, and they will come running because it \nis the best place in the world to practice medicine. They get to care \nfor entire families. They get to manage every type of conceptual \ndisease one can think of, and the rewards are out of this world. But \nwhen the average medical student comes out of medical school owing \n$170,000, and their pay is one-fourth of somebody who spends 1 or 2 \nmore years in training, there is no reason to think why they don't all \ngo into additional training so they can be compensated at a level that \nmatches the debt and the sacrifice they put in. They average 8 years of \nmedical school and residency. We don't have many other people who have \nthat kind of training. Yet Medicare created the shortage we have today \nby limiting the payment to primary care physicians.\n  The reason I make that point is the plans that are coming to the \nSenate floor are totally government centered. They are totally \ngovernment managed. They are totally government created. He talked \nabout sidewalks and bike paths. In that bill, we set up $10 billion a \nyear for concrete, supposedly for wellness. I can think of a whole lot \nbetter things. We can put $10 billion in NIH and do a whole lot more in \nterms of savings for this country in terms of our health care.\n  Where do I agree with the chairman? We will never control our costs \nin health care and we will never make health care affordable for us as \na nation or individually until we manage the chronic disease we have \nout there officially and until we incentivize the prevention of it. He \nis right on that. But there are two approaches to doing that. One says \nthe government is going to do all of it, and the other says maybe we \ncould incentivize individuals in the public to make good decisions for \nthemselves. One costs a whole lot of money; the other does not cost \nany.\n  Let me tell you how well the government does. Go to any School Lunch \nProgram you want to today. Go look at it. Look at what we feed our kids \nat breakfast and lunch, and then ask yourself: No wonder our kids are \nunhealthy. We are feeding them a high-fat, high-carbohydrate, simple-\nsugar, simple-starch meal. We are creating, through the government \nSchool Lunch Program and breakfast program, the very obesity the \nSenator says he wants to stop.\n  Then look at the food stamp purchases we incentivize. There are no \nlimits on them--a government program. Then look at the people on the \nFood Stamp Program--and this is no discrimination toward them at all; \nthey need the help--but look at the choices they make. There is no \neffort to limit to only buy what are good foods with food stamp money \nrather than junk food that, in fact, enhances chronic disease.\n  There are a lot of ways to approach it, but if we look at what the \ngovernment is doing now--what does it do? In health care, what does the \ngovernment do right now that is effective and efficient? Nothing.\n  The chairman talked about the fact that Medicare is going to go \nbroke. It is. In 5\\1/2\\ years, the Medicare trust fund will be belly \nup. Nobody disputes that point. The Medicare trustees are saying that. \nWe have all these problems in Medicare. Why don't we fix those? We have \na full 15 percent, at a minimum, of fraud in Medicare. Where is the \nfix? Why don't we fix it? Instead, we are going to bring to the floor \n88 new government programs, a government-centric run health care system \nthat is going to defeat and destroy the best health care system in the \nworld.\n  It is not the most efficient, but there is no question if you are \nsick, this is the best place in the world to get sick. If you have \ncancer, your cure rate is 40 to 50 percent better than anywhere else\n\n[[Page S10392]]\n\nin the world. If you have heart disease, your outcome is better than \nany other place in the world. Prevention is key, but as we try to fix \nthe problems in health care, our first goal ought to be ``do no harm'' \nto what is good about American health care.\n  I yield for my colleague from Tennessee and note I have consumed over \n10 minutes. I apologize to him for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma, a practicing \nphysician who has delivered hundreds or thousands of babies----\n  Mr. COBURN. Thousands.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thousands of babies is one of the most eloquent \nspokesmen for what needs to be done in health care in the Senate. I am \ndelighted he took time to come to the Senate floor today. It helps to \nhave someone here who has such a passion for patients and who can talk \nto the American people on this complicated subject in terms of what \nthis health care plan means for us. That is why so many of us on the \nRepublican side agree with what eight Democratic Senators wrote to the \nmajority leader the other day.\n  They said: We would like to read the bill and know what it costs \nbefore we start voting on it. That seems so sensible that maybe the \nAmerican people would laugh out loud if that would be a request, but it \nis. It is important to us and them and many more of the Senators--I \nbelieve virtually all of the American people--that we honor that \nrequest.\n  What that means is that the legislative text being put together by \nMajority Leader Reid somewhere--the merging of the Finance bill and the \nHELP bill--that full text, and as the Democratic Senator said, the \ncomplete budget scores should be made available for 72 hours on the \nInternet before we begin to vote.\n  The Director of the Budget Office has said it might take 2 weeks, 3 \nweeks, to have complete budget scores so we can know what the bill \ncosts. But if it takes 2 weeks, if it takes 3 weeks, if it takes 4 \nweeks, we need to know. The President has said we cannot add a dime to \nthe deficit. How are we going to know if we are adding a dime to the \ndeficit if we do not read the bill and do not know what it costs? We \ncannot guess what is in the bill. We cannot guess at what it costs when \nwe are talking about huge numbers--hundreds of billions, trillions of \ndollars.\n  We have our work cut out for us. We can stay here and do this. We are \nprepared to do this. We Republicans agree with the Democratic Senators \nthat we need to read the bill and know what it costs. We need to see \nthe complete legislative text and the complete budget numbers.\n  Why is that so important? Among other reasons, what we are hearing is \nthat what the bill coming out of the Finance Committee does is, among \nother things, three big things. Instead of reducing costs, it has \nhigher premiums, it has higher taxes, and it has Medicare cuts. That is \nnot health care reform if it has higher premiums, higher taxes, and \nMedicare cuts for more government.\n  What is the goal of this exercise? The first goal is reducing costs \nfor each person who buys insurance. How many of us go home and hear \nthat every weekend? I cannot afford my insurance; do something about \nit. Reducing costs.\n  What else do we hear? People are saying: I cannot afford my \ngovernment. You guys are running up the debt trillions of dollars, \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  What we need to do is to reduce the cost of health care for \nindividuals across America and for the government of individuals. But \nthis bill raises premiums, raises taxes, and cuts Medicare to create \nmore government.\n  How does it drive up premiums? The Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid the obvious, which is that when we impose taxes on medical devices \nand on the insurance companies, what do they do with it? It is $900 \nbillion-plus worth of taxes. They pass it on to us. So our premiums go \nup.\n  Or there are new ``government approved'' policies that we will need \nto buy. If you are one of those Americans who likes to buy a \ncatastrophic policy--that is, pay a lower premium so that you pay your \nown medical expenses unless something really terrible happens to you or \nyour family--that is a pretty wise choice for many Americans. You may \nnot be able to do that quite so easily under this bill because you will \nhave to buy a government-approved plan or pay a fine. And then younger \nAmericans may be surprised by the amount of money they have to pay. So \nit is very likely that for millions of Americans this bill will raise \ntheir premiums instead of reducing their cost, and 250 million \nAmericans either pay premiums or have premiums paid for them.\n\n  Then raising taxes. Here we are in the middle of a recession, 10 \npercent unemployment, and we are talking about nearly $1 trillion of \ntax increases that will be passed on to us in one way or the other. \nThere is a $1,500 penalty per family if you don't buy insurance. There \nis an employer mandate. So if you are a small business, you will have \nto either provide insurance or pay that penalty.\n  Then the governors of both parties--Democrats and Republicans--are in \na near cardiac arrest over the prospect of the Medicaid expansion. I \nmean 14 million new people--low-income Americans--dumped into State \nMedicaid Programs. I say ``dumped'' because doctors and hospitals are \nreimbursed so poorly that only 40 percent of doctors will see Medicaid \npatients. So we are going to say: Congratulations, Mr. and Ms. Low-\nIncome American, into the Medicaid you go in your State.\n  Not only is it not health care reform for those individuals, but the \ngovernors can't manage it, the legislators can't manage it, and the \ntaxpayers can't manage it. I have read, on the floor, comments from \nmost Democratic Governors and most Republican Governors. They are in a \nsituation where their States' budgets are in the worst shape since the \n1960s. Medicaid is going up at 6 and 7 percent. They are taking money \nfrom higher education and K-12 grades and spending it on Medicaid, and \nnow we are about to dump not only more low-income Americans into \nMedicaid, but we are going to send a part of the bill to the State \ngovernments which can't afford it. So that is State taxes, and it cuts \nyour Medicare.\n  The question I would like to raise is, what about those Medicare cuts \nand are doctors themselves going to be paying for this bill? There is \nan article today, or October 13, the former head of the Congressional \nBudget Office, Douglas Holtz-Eakin. These Congressional Budget Office \nheads are known to be pretty straight. This one was appointed by the \nRepublican Congress; Mr. Elmendorf, whom we all respect, was appointed \nby a Democratic Congress, but they are all nonpartisan. Mr. Holtz-Eakin \nsays:\n\n       . . . the plan proposed by the Democrats and the Obama \n     administration would not only fail to reduce the cost burden \n     on middle-class families, it would make that burden \n     significantly worse. The bill creates a new health \n     entitlement program that the Congressional Budget Office \n     estimates will grow over the longer term at a rate of 8 \n     percent annually. To avoid the fate of the House bill . . . \n     the Senate did three things: It promised that future \n     Congresses would make tough choices to slow entitlement \n     spending, and it dropped the hammer on the middle class.\n\n  Mr. President, could you let me know when I have consumed 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will let the Senator know.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Here is what Mr. Holtz-Eakin said:\n\n       One inconvenient truth is the fact that Congress will not \n     allow doctors to suffer a 24 percent cut in their Medicare \n     reimbursements.\n\n  Doctors today are paid about 80 percent of what private insurers will \npay if they see Medicare patients and, under the law, that gets cut \nevery year and every year we come in and fix that. Continuing to read \nfrom his article:\n\n       Senate Democrats chose to ignore this reality and rely on \n     the promise of a cut to make their bill add up. Taking note \n     of this fact pushes the cost of the bill well over $1 \n     trillion and destroys any pretense of budget balance.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Holtz-Eakin is saying he doesn't believe we in \nCongress are going to cut doctors' pay when they serve Medicare \npatients by roughly $250 billion over the next 10 years. That is about \nthe amount of money it would take just to pay doctors 10 years from now \nwhat they are being paid today, and most wouldn't be happy with that. \nSo either the doctors are going to pay for this bill--$250 billion of \nit--or you are, because it is going to add to your debt, or your \nchildren or your grandchildren are. It is\n\n[[Page S10393]]\n\none way or the other. It is either doctors pay or your kids pay because \nit is not deficit neutral.\n  He says:\n\n       It is beyond fantastic to promise that future Congresses, \n     for 10 straight years, will allow planned cuts in \n     reimbursements to hospitals, other providers, and Medicare \n     Advantage--thereby reducing the benefits of 25 percent of \n     seniors in Medicare.\n\n  His point is these are not only cuts in Medicare--$\\1/2\\ trillion \nworth of cuts--the cuts are being used to start a new government \nprogram. And here, as both Senator Harkin and Senator Coburn reminded \nus, Medicare in 5 or 6 years is going bankrupt--belly up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair very much. I will conclude my \nremarks.\n  What we are proposing to do is cut Medicare--take money from \ngrandma--and instead of spending it on grandma by making Medicare more \nsolvent, we are going to take that money, while the program is about to \ngo insolvent, and create a new program. So these are the kinds of \nquestions the American people have a right to ask and have answered.\n  That is why we want to read the bill. Because we see, as we look at \nthis bill, higher premiums, higher taxes, Medicare cuts for more \ngovernment, and we don't believe that is health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire article from which I quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 13, 2009]\n\n                     The Baucus Bill Is a Tax Bill\n\n                        (By Douglas Holtz-Eakin)\n\n       Remember when health-care reform was supposed to make life \n     better for the middle class? That dream began to unravel this \n     past summer when Congress proposed a bill that failed to \n     include any competition-based reforms that would actually \n     bend the curve of health-care costs. It fell apart completely \n     when Democrats began papering over the gaping holes their \n     plan would rip in the federal budget.\n       As it now stands, the plan proposed by Democrats and the \n     Obama administration would not only fail to reduce the cost \n     burden on middle-class families, it would make that burden \n     significantly worse.\n       Consider the bill put forward by the Senate Finance \n     Committee. From a budgetary perspective, it is \n     straightforward. The bill creates a new health entitlement \n     program that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates \n     will grow over the longer term at a rate of 8% annually, \n     which is much faster than the growth rate of the economy or \n     tax revenues. This is the same growth rate as the House bill \n     that Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) deep-sixed by asking the CBO \n     to tell the truth about its impact on health-care costs.\n       To avoid the fate of the House bill and achieve a veneer of \n     fiscal sensibility, the Senate did three things: It omitted \n     inconvenient truths, it promised that future Congresses will \n     make tough choices to slow entitlement spending, and it \n     dropped the hammer on the middle class.\n       One inconvenient truth is the fact that Congress will not \n     allow doctors to suffer a 24% cut in their Medicare \n     reimbursements. Senate Democrats chose to ignore this reality \n     and rely on the promise of a cut to make their bill add up. \n     Taking note of this fact pushes the total cost of the bill \n     well over $1 trillion and destroys any pretense of budget \n     balance.\n       It is beyond fantastic to promise that future Congresses, \n     for 10 straight years, will allow planned cuts in \n     reimbursements to hospitals, other providers, and Medicare \n     Advantage (thereby reducing the benefits of 25% of seniors in \n     Medicare). The 1997 Balanced Budget Act pursued this strategy \n     and successive Congresses steadily unwound its provisions. \n     The very fact that this Congress is pursuing an expensive new \n     entitlement belies the notion that members would be willing \n     to cut existing ones.\n       Most astounding of all is what this Congress is willing to \n     do to struggling middle-class families. The bill would impose \n     nearly $400 billion in new taxes and fees. Nearly 90% of that \n     burden will be shouldered by those making $200,000 or less.\n       It might not appear that way at first, because the dollars \n     are collected via a 40% tax on sales by insurers of \n     ``Cadillac'' policies, fees on health insurers, drug \n     companies and device manufacturers, and an assortment of odds \n     and ends.\n       But the economics are clear. These costs will be passed on \n     to consumers by either directly raising insurance premiums, \n     or by fueling higher health-care costs that inevitably lead \n     to higher premiums. Consumers will pay the excise tax on \n     high-cost plans. The Joint Committee on Taxation indicates \n     that 87% of the burden would fall on Americans making less \n     than $200,000, and more than half on those earning under \n     $100,000.\n       Industry fees are even worse because Democrats chose to \n     make these fees nondeductible. This means that insurance \n     companies will have to raise premiums significantly just to \n     break even. American families will bear a burden even greater \n     than the $130 billion in fees that the bill intends to \n     collect. According to my analysis, premiums will rise by as \n     much as $200 billion over the next 10 years--and 90% will \n     again fall on the middle class.\n       Senate Democrats are also erecting new barriers to middle-\n     class ascent. A family of four making $54,000 would pay \n     $4,800 for health insurance, with the remainder coming from \n     subsidies. If they work harder and raise their income to \n     $66,000, their cost of insurance rises by $2,800. In other \n     words, earning another $12,000 raises their bill by $2,800--\n     marginal tax rate of 23%. Double-digit increases in effective \n     tax rates will have detrimental effects on the incentives of \n     millions of Americans.\n       Why does it make sense to double down on the kinds of \n     entitlements already in crisis, instead of passing medical \n     malpractice reform and allowing greater competition among \n     insurers? Why should middle-class families pay more than \n     $2,000 on average, by my estimate, in taxes in the process?\n       Middle-class families have it tough enough. There is little \n     reason to believe that the pain of the current recession, \n     housing downturn, and financial crisis will quickly fade \n     away--especially with the administration planning to triple \n     the national debt over the next decade.\n       The promise of real reform remains. But the reality of the \n     Democrats' current effort is starkly less benign. It will \n     create a dangerous new entitlement that will be paid for by \n     the middle class and their children.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10393-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10393-S10397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AFGHANISTAN TROOP SURGE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was critical of the President's decisions \nwhen he canceled the so-called missile shield that would have been \nlocated in Poland and in the Czech Republic, among others things, \nbecause I was concerned about the message it sends to our allies in the \nregion. After working with them to develop the political and public \nconsensus for this missile shield, the United States essentially pulled \nthe rug out from under these allies and left the consensus in Central \nand Eastern Europe that the United States, once again, proved to be an \nunreliable ally.\n  Throughout the Baltic States, Central Europe and other people in the \nworld couldn't fail to notice the same. I am thinking of countries in \nthe Persian Gulf that have relied upon the presence of the United \nStates but have, I think, wondered from time to time whether we are the \nally they want to stick with because of the fact that sometimes we have \nproven to be unreliable.\n  I am concerned about that same issue with respect to Pakistan and \nAfghanistan. Will our continued public debate over the recommendations \nthat General McChrystal has made to the President result in both allies \nin the region as well as the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan \nconcluding that they better make book with others in the area, \nincluding potentially the Taliban? Because after all, those people are \ngoing to continue to be in the area; the United States may not.\n  This is where I think the debate about General McChrystal's \nrecommendations about troop levels and other resources in Afghanistan \nbecome so very important. I think we need to listen to the advice of \nthe commander in the field, General McChrystal, who produced a very \nstraightforward assessment of the situation in Afghanistan.\n  Obviously, the President is the Commander in Chief, and the decisions \nare his to make. It is appropriate for him to rely upon others for \nadvice as well as on the commander in the field. But there is a point \nat which the President's own strategy, which he announced in March, \nneeds to be adequately resourced and we need to move forward. Here is \nwhat the President said:\n\n       The American people must understand that this is a \n     downpayment on our own future.\n\n  He was talking about the resources that would be needed in \nAfghanistan. So he selected General McChrystal to implement his \nstrategy. We unanimously confirmed General McChrystal, and then the \nPresident asked him to give an assessment of what it was going to take. \nThat assessment was provided in August. It has now been about 50 days \nsince that assessment\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\nhas been made public--since the President received it. Yet we still \ndon't have a decision.\n  My concern is that this continuing public debate is going to raise \ndoubts around the world about the staying power of the United States; \nabout our willingness to continue commitments we make. Remember, the \nPresident himself called this a war of necessity, both during the \ncampaign and after his inauguration. He stressed the fact that we had \nto do what it took to win in Afghanistan. There are those around the \nworld who are wondering whether we mean to resource this effort to the \nextent that General McChrystal has said is necessary.\n  What did General McChrystal's assessment say? First, he speaks of \nwhat ISAF--that is the international force, including NATO forces--will \nrequire.\n\n       ISAF requires an increase in the total coalition force \n     capability and end strength.\n\n  In other words, more troops. He warned of the risk of not providing \nadequate resources, and here is what he said:\n\n       Failure to provide quality resources risks a longer \n     conflict, greater casualties, higher overall costs, and \n     ultimately, a critical loss of political support. Any of \n     these risks, in turn, are likely to result in mission \n     failure.\n\n  Is that what we want--mission failure? If we don't quickly make a \ndecision, support the President--if he makes the decision to adequately \nresource our effort there, then we are not only going to be losing, we \nare not only going to have mission failure, but we will send a message \nto everybody around the world that, once again, the United States can't \nbe trusted. Here is what the General said about why it matters:\n\n       Time matters; we must act now to reverse the negative \n     trends and demonstrate progress. I believe the short-term \n     fight will be decisive. Failure to gain the initiative and \n     reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term--next 12 months--\n     while Afghan security capacity matures--risks an outcome \n     where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible.\n\n  Do we want to take the risk that we take so long in getting the \nadditional troops there that success is no longer possible? I hope not. \nFinally, General McChrystal underscored the reason for his conclusions \nduring a recent speech he gave in London, where he said:\n\n       I believe that the loss of stability in Afghanistan brings \n     a huge risk that transnational terrorists such as al-Qaida \n     will operate from within Afghanistan again.\n\n  Now we are having this big public debate. Some prominent Democrats \nhave said we shouldn't resource this the way General McChrystal has \nannounced, and this is why I think we are sending the wrong message. I \nunderstand there is some declining support for the war, but this is \nwhere Presidential and congressional leadership comes in.\n  I remember, during the debate over the Iraq war, we had a lot of \narmchair generals and even a lot of pundits who thought they knew \nbetter. Well, General Petraeus, it turned out, was right. Thankfully, \nPresident Bush at the time followed his recommendations. As a result, \nthe surge in Iraq was successful. General McChrystal and General \nPetraeus are essentially saying the same thing again.\n  Remember, General McChrystal is an expert in both counterterrorism \nand counterinsurgency policy. He understands the difference and he \nunderstands it takes resources to fight a counterinsurgency campaign \nbecause you not only have to defeat an enemy but you have to continue \nto hold the area you have taken until the indigenous forces--in this \ncase the Afghan police and army--are trained in sufficient numbers to \nhold the territory. You have to protect the populace. In a \ncounterinsurgency strategy, the key is not killing the enemy, the key \nis protecting the populace. That is why it takes more troops.\n  Let me read a couple other things the general said:\n\n       My conclusions were informed through a rigorous multi-\n     disciplinary assessment by a team of accomplished military \n     personnel and civilians, and my personal experience and core \n     beliefs. Central to my analysis is a belief that we must \n     respect the complexities of the operational environment and \n     design our strategic approach accordingly.\n\n  This is a carefully thought-out strategic assessment with a lot of \nsupport.\n  There is a recent article in the Weekly Standard magazine by Fred and \nKim Kagan that does an excellent job of explaining why this advice is \nso wise. It focuses on the nature of the al-Qaida threat that emanates \nfrom Afghanistan and the network of support that is established there. \nPart of this is what has informed General McChrystal's assessment. The \narticle says, and I quote:\n\n       We should fight [the Taliban and Haqqani groups]--\n\n  Another terrorist-led group--\n\n       because in practice they are integrally connected with al \n     Qaeda. Allowing the Taliban and the Haqqani networks to \n     expand their areas of control and influence would offer new \n     opportunities to al Qaeda that its leaders appear determined \n     to seize. It would relieve the pressure on al Qaeda, giving \n     its operative more scope to protect themselves while working \n     to project power and influence around the world.\n\n  In other words, against the United States. The Haqqani group he is \nreferring to is another terrorist-led group.\n  Secretary of State Clinton said it quite succinctly when she stated:\n\n       If Afghanistan were taken over by the Taliban, I can't tell \n     you how fast al-Qaida would be back in Afghanistan.\n\n  That is the point. That is why I think we need to get on with our \ndecision.\n  I noted, with interest, a column by E.J. Dionne in the Washington \nPost entitled ``No Rush to Escalate.'' He quotes in his column \nhistorian Robert Dallek, who recently advised President Obama:\n\n       ``In my judgment,'' he recalls saying, ``war kills off \n     great reform movements.''\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about how World War I brought the Progressive \nEra to a close; that Franklin Roosevelt would have done better if not \nfor World War II; that Vietnam hurt Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. He \nsays:\n\n       It may just be that some of the President's senior advisers \n     and supporters may be urging him not to devote the necessary \n     resources to Afghanistan because they don't want him to \n     become a war president.\n\n  That would be most unfortunate. President Obama is the Commander in \nChief. He campaigned to become the war President. He said he wanted to \nend the war in Iraq, which he called a war of choice, and he wanted to \nwin the war in Afghanistan--a war of necessity.\n  He won the election and he, now, as Commander in Chief, has to make \nthese critical decisions. Whether he likes it or not, he is a war \nPresident and he will be judged by history not only by his domestic \nagenda but by how well he leaves the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe key with Afghanistan is not to leave the country in the hands of \ndangerous Taliban or other terrorists who would work with al-Qaida and \ngive them the kind of place they had before from which to train and \nplan attacks on the rest of the world.\n  Also at stake in this debate is the message we are sending to the \nrest of the world, to our allies in the Middle East, in the Persian \nGulf, to Pakistan. Is it safe to throw in with the United States and to \nhelp us in our war against these terrorists or, because the United \nStates may bug out when the going gets tough, do we decide to make book \nwith the other side, as Pakistan had done in the past with various \ngroups including the Taliban? That is part of what is at stake. It is \nnot just Afghanistan but our reputation around the rest of the world as \nto how we deal with our allies and how we resolve conflicts we get \ninvolved in.\n  General McChrystal said it best when he said:\n\n       We must show resolve. Uncertainty disheartens our allies, \n     emboldens our foes.\n\n  That is the key message today. I urge the President, in continuing \nthis debate, to bring it to a close as quickly as he can to make the \ndecision. I know Republicans will support a decision that follows the \nrecommendations of General Petraeus and General McChrystal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles \nfrom the Weekly Standard magazine: One, ``How Not to Defeat al-Qaeda, \nTo Win in Afghanistan Requires Troops on the Ground'' and ``Don't Go \nWobbly on Afghanistan; President Obama Was Right in March,'' both by \nFred and Kimberly Kagan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, Oct. 5, 2009]\n\n                       How Not To Defeat al Qaeda\n\n               (By Frederick W. Kagan and Kimberly Kagan)\n\n       President Obama has announced his intention to conduct a \n     review of U.S. strategy in\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\n     Afghanistan from first principles before deciding whether or \n     not to accept General Stanley McChrystal's proposed strategy \n     and request for more forces. This review is delaying the \n     decision. If the delay goes on much longer, it will force \n     military leaders either to rush the deployment in a way that \n     increases the strain on soldiers and their families or to \n     lose the opportunity to affect the spring campaign. The \n     president's determination to make sure of his policy before \n     committing the additional 40,000 or so forces required by \n     General McChrystal's campaign plan is, nevertheless, \n     understandable. The conflict in Afghanistan is complex, and \n     it is important that we understand what we are trying to do.\n       At the center of the complexity is a deceptively simple \n     question: If the United States is fighting a terrorist \n     organization--al Qaeda--why must we conduct a \n     counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan against two other \n     groups--the Quetta Shura Taliban and the Haqqani Network--\n     that have neither the objective nor the capability to attack \n     the United States outside Afghanistan? Shouldn't we fight a \n     terrorist organization with a counterterrorist strategy, \n     customarily defined as relying on long-range precision \n     weapons and Special Forces raids to eliminate key terrorist \n     leaders? Why must we become embroiled in the politics and \n     social dysfunctionality of the fifth-poorest country in the \n     world? Surely, some surrounding President Obama appear to be \n     arguing, it makes more sense to confine our operations \n     narrowly to the aim we care most about: defeating the \n     terrorists and so preventing them from killing Americans.\n       This argument rests on two essential assumptions: that al \n     Qaeda is primarily a terrorist group and that it is separable \n     from the insurgent groups among whom it lives and through \n     whom it operates. Let us examine these assumptions.\n       Al Qaeda is a highly ideological organization that openly \n     states its aims and general methods. It seeks to replace \n     existing governments in the Muslim world, which it regards as \n     apostate, with a regime based on its own interpretation of \n     the Koran and Muslim tradition. It relies on a reading of \n     some of the earliest Muslim traditions to justify its right \n     to declare Muslims apostates if they do not behave according \n     to its own interpretation of Islam and to kill them if \n     necessary. This reading is actually nearly identical to a \n     belief that developed in the earliest years of Islam after \n     Muhammad's death, which mainstream Muslims quickly rejected \n     as a heresy (the Kharijite movement), and it remains \n     heretical to the overwhelming majority of Muslims today. The \n     question of the religious legality of killing Muslims causes \n     tensions within al Qaeda and between al Qaeda and other \n     Muslims, leading to debates over the wisdom of fighting the \n     ``near enemy,'' i.e., the ``apostate'' Muslim governments in \n     the region, or the ``far enemy,'' i.e., the West and \n     especially the United States, which al Qaeda believes \n     provides indispensable support to these ``apostate'' \n     governments. The 9/11 attack resulted from the temporary \n     triumph of the ``far enemy'' school.\n       Above all, al Qaeda does not see itself as a terrorist \n     organization. It defines itself as the vanguard in the \n     Leninist sense: a revolutionary movement whose aim is to take \n     power throughout the Muslim world. It is an insurgent \n     organization with global aims. Its use of terrorism (for \n     which it has developed lengthy and abstruse religious \n     justifications) is simply a reflection of its current \n     situation. If al Qaeda had the ability to conduct guerrilla \n     warfare with success, it would do so. If it could wage \n     conventional war, it would probably prefer to do so. It has \n     already made clear that it desires to wage chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear war when possible.\n       In this respect, al Qaeda is very different from terrorist \n     groups like the IRA, ETA, and even Hamas. Those groups used \n     or use terrorism in pursuit of political objectives confined \n     to a specific region--expelling the British from Northern \n     Ireland, creating an independent or autonomous Basque land, \n     expelling Israel from Palestine. The Ulstermen did not seek \n     to destroy Britain or march on London; the Basques are not in \n     mortal combat with Spaniards; and even Hamas seeks only to \n     drive the Jews out of Israel, not to exterminate them \n     throughout the world. Al Qaeda, by contrast, seeks to rule \n     all the world's 1.5 billion Muslims and to reduce the non-\n     Muslim peoples to subservience. For al Qaeda, terrorism is a \n     start, not an end nor even the preferred means. It goes \n     without saying that the United States and the West would face \n     catastrophic consequences if al Qaeda ever managed to obtain \n     the ability to wage war by different means. Defeating al \n     Qaeda requires more than disrupting its leadership cells so \n     that they cannot plan and conduct attacks in the United \n     States. It also requires preventing al Qaeda from obtaining \n     the capabilities it seeks to wage real war beyond terrorist \n     strikes.\n       Al Qaeda does not exist in a vacuum like the SPECTRE of \n     James Bond movies. It has always operated in close \n     coordination with allies. The anti-Soviet jihad of the 1980s \n     was the crucible in which al Qaeda leaders first bonded with \n     the partners who would shelter them in Afghanistan. Osama bin \n     Laden met Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose network is now fighting \n     U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan, as both were raising \n     support in Saudi Arabia for the mujahedeen in the 1980s. They \n     then fought the Soviets together. When the Soviet Army \n     withdrew in 1989 (for which bin Laden subsequently took \n     unearned credit), Haqqani seized the Afghan city of Khost and \n     established his control of the surrounding provinces of \n     Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. Haqqani also retained the base in \n     Pakistan--near Miranshah in North Waziristan--from which he \n     had fought the Soviets. He established a madrassa there that \n     has become infamous for its indoctrination of young men in \n     the tenets of militant Islamism.\n       Haqqani held onto Greater Paktia, as the three provinces \n     are often called, and invited bin Laden to establish bases \n     there in the 1990s in which to train his own cadres. When the \n     Taliban took shape under Mullah Mohammad Omar in the mid-\n     1990s (with a large amount of Pakistani assistance), Haqqani \n     made common cause with that group, which shared his \n     ideological and religious outlook and seemed likely to take \n     control of Afghanistan. He became a minister in the Taliban \n     government, which welcomed and facilitated the continued \n     presence of bin Laden and his training camps.\n       Bin Laden and al Qaeda could not have functioned as they \n     did in the 1990s without the active support of Mullah Omar \n     and Haqqani. The Taliban and Haqqani fighters protected bin \n     Laden, fed him and his troops, facilitated the movement of al \n     Qaeda leaders and fighters, and generated recruits. They also \n     provided a socio-religious human network that strengthened \n     the personal resilience and organizational reach of bin Laden \n     and his team. Islamist revolution has always been an activity \n     of groups nested within communities, not an undertaking of \n     isolated individuals. As American interrogators in Iraq \n     discovered quickly, the fastest way to get a captured al \n     Qaeda fighter talking was to isolate him from his peers. Bin \n     Laden's Taliban allies provided the intellectual and social \n     support network al Qaeda needed to keep fighting. In return, \n     bin Laden shared his wealth with the Taliban and later sent \n     his fighters into battle to defend the Taliban regime against \n     the U.S.-aided Northern Alliance attack after 9/11.\n       The relationship that developed between bin Laden and \n     Mullah Omar was deep and strong. It helps explain why Mullah \n     Omar refused categorically to expel bin Laden after 9/11 even \n     though he knew that failing to do so could lead to the \n     destruction of the Taliban state--as it did. In return, bin \n     Laden recognizes Mullah Omar as amir al-momineen--the \n     ``Commander of the Faithful''--a religious title the Taliban \n     uses to legitimize its activities and shadow state. The \n     alliance between al Qaeda and the Haqqanis (now led by \n     Sirajuddin, successor to his aging and ailing father, \n     Jalaluddin) also remains strong. The Haqqani network still \n     claims the terrain of Greater Paktia, can project attacks \n     into Kabul, and seems to facilitate the kinds of spectacular \n     attacks in Afghanistan that are the hallmark of al Qaeda \n     training and technical expertise. There is no reason whatever \n     to believe that Mullah Omar or the Haqqanis--whose religious \n     and political views remain closely aligned with al Qaeda's--\n     would fail to offer renewed hospitality to their friend and \n     ally of 20 years, bin Laden.\n       Mullah Omar and the Haqqanis are not the ones hosting al \n     Qaeda today, however, since the presence of U.S. and NATO \n     forces in Afghanistan has made that country too dangerous for \n     bin Laden and his lieutenants. They now reside for the most \n     part on the other side of the Durand Line, among the melange \n     of anti-government insurgent and terrorist groups that live \n     in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the Northwest \n     Frontier Province of Pakistan. These groups--they include the \n     Tehrik-e Taliban-e Pakistan, led until his recent death-by-\n     Predator by Baitullah Mehsud; the Tehrik-e Nafaz-e Shariat-e \n     Mohammadi; and the Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the \n     Mumbai attack--now provide some of the same services to al \n     Qaeda that the Taliban provided when they ruled Afghanistan. \n     Mullah Omar continues to help, moreover, by intervening in \n     disputes among the more fractious Pakistani groups to try to \n     maintain cohesion within the movement. All of these groups \n     coordinate their activities, moreover, and all have voices \n     within the Peshawar Shura (council). They are not isolated \n     groups, but rather a network-of-networks, both a social and a \n     political grouping run, in the manner of Pashtuns, by a \n     number of shuras, of which that in Peshawar is theoretically \n     preeminent.\n       All of which is to say that the common image of al Qaeda \n     leaders flitting like bats from cave to cave in the badlands \n     of Pakistan is inaccurate. Al Qaeda leaders do flit (and no \n     doubt sometimes sleep in caves)--but they flit like guests \n     from friend to friend in areas controlled by their allies. \n     Their allies provide them with shelter and food, with warning \n     of impending attacks, with the means to move rapidly. Their \n     allies provide communications services--runners and the use \n     of their own more modern systems to help al Qaeda's senior \n     leaders avoid creating electronic footprints that our forces \n     could use to track and target them. Their allies provide \n     means of moving money and other strategic resources around, \n     as well as the means of imparting critical knowledge (like \n     expertise in explosives) to cadres. Their allies provide \n     media support, helping to get the al Qaeda message out and \n     then serving as an echo chamber to magnify it via their own \n     media resources.\n       Could al Qaeda perform all of these functions itself, \n     without the help of local allies? It probably could. In Iraq, \n     certainly, the al Qaeda organization established its own \n     administrative, logistical, training, recruiting,\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\n     and support structures under the rubric of its own state--the \n     Islamic State of Iraq. For a while, this system worked well \n     for the terrorists; it supported a concerted terror campaign \n     in and around Baghdad virtually unprecedented in its scale \n     and viciousness. It also created serious vulnerabilities for \n     Al Qaeda in Iraq, however. The establishment of this \n     autonomous, foreign-run structure left a seam between Al \n     Qaeda in Iraq and the local population and their leaders. As \n     long as the population continued to be in open revolt against \n     the United States and the Iraqi government, this seam was not \n     terribly damaging to al Qaeda. But as local leaders began to \n     abandon their insurgent operations, Al Qaeda in Iraq became \n     dangerously exposed and, ultimately, came to be seen as an \n     enemy by the very populations that had previously supported \n     it.\n       There was no such seam in Afghanistan before 9/11. Al Qaeda \n     did not attempt to control territory or administer \n     populations there. It left all such activities in the hands \n     of Mullah Omar and Jalaluddin Haqqani. It still does--relying \n     on those groups as well as on the Islamist groups in \n     Waziristan and the Northwest Frontier Province to do the \n     governing and administering while it focuses on the global \n     war. Afghans had very little interaction with al Qaeda, and \n     so had no reason to turn against the group. The same is true \n     in Pakistan today. The persistence of allies who aim at \n     governing and administering, as well as simply controlling, \n     territory frees al Qaeda from those onerous day-to-day \n     responsibilities and helps shield the organization from the \n     blowback it suffered in Iraq. It reduces the vulnerability of \n     the organization and enormously complicates efforts to defeat \n     or destroy it.\n       The theory proposed by some in the White House and the \n     press that an out-of-country, high-tech counterterrorist \n     campaign could destroy a terrorist network such as al Qaeda \n     is fraught with erroneous assumptions. Killing skilled \n     terrorists is very hard to do. The best--and most dangerous--\n     of them avoid using cellphones, computers, and other \n     devices that leave obvious electronic footprints. Tracking \n     them requires either capitalizing on their mistakes in \n     using such devices or generating human intelligence about \n     their whereabouts from sources on the ground. When the \n     terrorists operate among relatively friendly populations, \n     gaining useful human intelligence can be extremely \n     difficult if not impossible. The friendlier the population \n     to the terrorists, the more safe houses in which they can \n     hide, the fewer people who even desire to inform the \n     United States or its proxies about the location of \n     terrorist leaders, the more people likely to tell the \n     terrorists about any such informants (and to punish those \n     informants), the more people who can help to conceal the \n     movement of the terrorist leaders and their runners, and \n     so on.\n       Counterterrorist forces do best when the terrorists must \n     operate among neutral or hostile populations while under \n     severe military pressure, including from troops on the \n     ground. Such pressure forces terrorist leaders to rely more \n     on communications equipment for self-defense and for \n     coordination of larger efforts. It greatly restricts the \n     terrorists' ability to move around, making them easier \n     targets, and to receive and distribute money, weapons, and \n     recruits. This is the scenario that developed in Iraq during \n     and after the surge, and it dramatically increased the \n     vulnerability of terrorist groups to U.S. (and Iraqi) \n     strikes.\n       Not only did the combination of isolation and pressure make \n     senior leaders more vulnerable, but it exposed mid-level \n     managers as well. Attacking such individuals is important for \n     two reasons: It disrupts the ability of the organization to \n     operate at all, and it eliminates some of the people most \n     likely to replace senior leaders who are killed. Attacking \n     middle management dramatically reduces the resilience of a \n     terrorist organization, as well as its effectiveness. The \n     intelligence requirement for such attacks is daunting, \n     however. Identifying and locating the senior leadership of a \n     group is one thing. Finding the people who collect taxes, \n     distribute funds and weapons, recruit, run IEDcells, and so \n     on, is something else entirely--unless the counterterrorist \n     force actually has a meaningful presence on the ground among \n     the people.\n       The most serious operational challenge of the pure \n     counterterrorist approach, however, is to eliminate bad guys \n     faster than they can be replaced. Isolated killings of senior \n     leaders, spread out over months or years, rarely do serious \n     systemic harm to their organizations. The best-known example \n     is the death of Abu Musab al Zarqawi, founder and head of Al \n     Qaeda in Iraq, in June 2006, following which the \n     effectiveness and lethality of that group only grew. It \n     remains to be seen what the effect of Baitullah Mehsud's \n     death will be--although it is evident that the presence of \n     the Pakistani military on the ground assisted the high-tech \n     targeting that killed him. Such is the vigor of the groups he \n     controlled that his death occasioned a power struggle among \n     his deputies.\n       One essential question that advocates of a pure \n     counterterrorism approach must answer, therefore, is: Can the \n     United States significantly accelerate the rate at which our \n     forces identify, target, and kill senior and mid-level \n     leaders? Our efforts to do so have failed to date, despite \n     the commitment of enormous resources to that problem over \n     eight years at the expense of other challenges. Could we do \n     better? The limiting factor on the rate of attrition we can \n     impose on the enemy's senior leadership is our ability to \n     generate the necessary intelligence, not our ability to put \n     metal on target. Perhaps there is a way to increase the \n     attrition rate. If so, advocates of this approach have an \n     obligation to explain what it is. They must also explain why \n     removing U.S. and NATO forces from the theater will not make \n     collecting timely intelligence even harder--effectively \n     slowing the attrition rate. Their argument is \n     counterintuitive at best.\n       Pursuing a counterinsurgency strategy against the Taliban \n     and Haqqani groups--that is, using American forces to protect \n     the population from them while building the capability of the \n     Afghan Army--appears at first an indirect approach to \n     defeating al Qaeda. In principle, neither the Taliban nor the \n     Haqqani network poses an immediate danger to the United \n     States. Why then should we fight them?\n       We should fight them because in practice they are \n     integrally connected with al Qaeda. Allowing the Taliban and \n     the Haqqani network to expand their areas of control and \n     influence would offer new opportunities to al Qaeda that its \n     leaders appear determined to seize. It would relieve the \n     pressure on al Qaeda, giving its operatives more scope to \n     protect themselves while working to project power and \n     influence around the world. It would reduce the amount of \n     usable intelligence we could expect to receive, thus reducing \n     the rate at which we could target key leaders. Allowing al \n     Qaeda's allies to succeed would seriously undermine the \n     counterterrorism mission and would make the success of that \n     mission extremely unlikely.\n                                  ____\n\n       [From the Weekly Standard, Oct. 12, 2009]\n\n                     Don't Go Wobbly on Afghanistan\n\n               (By Frederick W. Kagan and Kimberly Kagan)\n\n       ``To defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, \n     we must recognize the fundamental connection between the \n     future of Afghanistan and Pakistan--which is why I've \n     appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke . . . to serve as \n     Special Representative for both countries.'' That \n     ``fundamental connection'' between Afghanistan and Pakistan \n     was one of the important principles President Obama laid out \n     in his March 27, 2009, speech announcing his policy in South \n     Asia. It reflected a common criticism of the Bush policy in \n     Afghanistan, which was often castigated as insufficiently \n     ``regional.'' It also reflected reality: The war against al \n     Qaeda and its affiliates is a two-front conflict that must be \n     fought on both sides of the Durand Line.\n       Now, however, some of the most vocal supporters of the \n     regional approach are considering--or even advocating--a \n     return to its antithesis, a purely counterterrorism (CT) \n     strategy in Afghanistan. Such a reversion, based on the \n     erroneous assumption that a collapsing Afghanistan would not \n     derail efforts to dismantle terrorist groups in Pakistan, is \n     bound to fail.\n       Recent discussions of the ``CT option'' have tended to be \n     sterile, clinical, and removed from the complexity of the \n     region--the opposite of the coherence with which the \n     administration had previously sought to address the problem. \n     In reality, any ``CT option'' will likely have to be executed \n     against the backdrop of state collapse and civil war in \n     Afghanistan, spiraling extremism and loss of will in \n     Pakistan, and floods of refugees. These conditions would \n     benefit al Qaeda greatly by creating an expanding area of \n     chaos, an environment in which al Qaeda thrives. They would \n     also make the collection of intelligence and the accurate \n     targeting of terrorists extremely difficult.\n       If the United States should adopt a small-footprint \n     counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan would descend again \n     into civil war. The Taliban group headed by Mullah Omar and \n     operating in southern Afghanistan (including especially \n     Helmand, Kandahar, and Oruzgan Provinces) is well positioned \n     to take control of that area upon the withdrawal of American \n     and allied combat forces. The remaining Afghan security \n     forces would be unable to resist a Taliban offensive. They \n     would be defeated and would disintegrate. The fear of renewed \n     Taliban assaults would mobilize the Tajiks, Uzbeks, and \n     Hazaras in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban \n     itself would certainly drive on Herat and Kabul, leading to \n     war with northern militias. This conflict would collapse the \n     Afghan state, mobilize the Afghan population, and cause many \n     Afghans to flee into Pakistan and Iran.\n       Within Pakistan, the U.S. reversion to a counterterrorism \n     strategy (from the counterinsurgency strategy for which Obama \n     reaffirmed his support as recently as August) would disrupt \n     the delicate balance that has made possible recent Pakistani \n     progress against internal foes and al Qaeda.\n       Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari, army chief of staff \n     General Ashfaq Kayani, and others who have supported \n     Pakistani operations against the Taliban are facing an \n     entrenched resistance within the military and among retired \n     officers. This resistance stems from the decades-long \n     relationships nurtured between the Taliban and Pakistan, \n     which started during the war to expel the Soviet Army. \n     Advocates within Pakistan of continuing to support the \n     Taliban argue that the United States will abandon Afghanistan \n     as it did in 1989, creating chaos that only the Taliban will \n     be able to fill in a manner that suits Pakistan.\n       Zardari and Kayani have been able to overcome this internal \n     resistance sufficiently to mount major operations against \n     Pakistani Taliban groups, in part because the rhetoric\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\n     and actions of the Obama administration to date have seemed \n     to prove the Taliban advocates wrong. The announcement of the \n     withdrawal of U.S. combat forces would prove them right. \n     Pakistani operations against their own insurgents--as well as \n     against al Qaeda, which lives among those insurgents--would \n     probably grind to a halt as Pakistan worked to reposition \n     itself in support of a revived Taliban government in \n     Afghanistan. And a renewed stream of Afghan refugees would \n     likely overwhelm the Pakistani government and military, \n     rendering coherent operations against insurgents and \n     terrorists difficult or impossible.\n       The collapse of Pakistan, or even the revival of an \n     aggressive and successful Islamist movement there, would be a \n     calamity for the region and for the United States. It would \n     significantly increase the risk that al Qaeda might obtain \n     nuclear weapons from Pakistan's stockpile, as well as the \n     risk that an Indo-Pakistani war might break out involving the \n     use of nuclear weapons.\n       Not long ago, such a collapse seemed almost imminent. \n     Islamist groups operating under the umbrella of the Tehrik-e \n     Taliban-e Pakistan (TTP), led by Baitullah Mehsud until his \n     recent death, had occupied areas in the Swat River Valley and \n     elsewhere not far from Islamabad itself. Punjabi terrorists \n     affiliated with the same group were launching attacks in the \n     heart of metropolitan Pakistan.\n       Since then, Pakistani offensives in Swat, Waziristan, and \n     elsewhere have rocked many of these groups back on their \n     heels while rallying political support within Pakistan \n     against the Taliban to an unprecedented degree. But these \n     successes remain as fragile as the Pakistani state itself. \n     The TTP and its allies are damaged but not defeated. Al Qaeda \n     retains safe-havens along the Afghan border.\n       What if the United States did not withdraw the forces now \n     in Afghanistan, but simply kept them at current levels while \n     emphasizing both counterterrorism and the rapid expansion of \n     the Afghan security forces? Within Afghanistan, the situation \n     would continue to deteriorate. Neither the United States and \n     NATO nor Afghan forces are now capable of defeating the \n     Taliban in the south or east. At best, the recently arrived \n     U.S. reinforcements in the south might be able to turn steady \n     defeat into stalemate, but even that is unlikely.\n       The accelerated expansion of Afghan security forces, \n     moreover, will be seriously hindered if we fail to deploy \n     additional combat forces. As we discovered in Iraq, the \n     fastest way to help indigenous forces grow in numbers and \n     competence is to partner U.S. and allied units with them side \n     by side in combat. Trainers and mentors are helpful--but \n     their utility is multiplied many times when indigenous \n     soldiers and officers have the opportunity to see what right \n     looks like rather than simply being told about it. At the \n     current troop levels, commanders have had to disperse Afghan \n     and allied forces widely in an effort simply to cover \n     important ground, without regard for partnering.\n       As a result, it is very likely that the insurgency will \n     grow in size and strength in 2010 faster than Afghan security \n     forces can be developed without the addition of significant \n     numbers of American combat troops--which will likely lead to \n     Afghan state failure and the consequences described above in \n     Afghanistan and the region.\n       The Obama administration is not making this decision in a \n     vacuum. Obama ran on a platform that made giving Afghanistan \n     the resources it needed an overriding American priority. \n     President Obama has repeated that commitment many times. He \n     appointed a new commander to execute the policy he enunciated \n     in his March 27 speech, in which he noted: ``To focus on the \n     greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny \n     resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq.'' If he \n     now rejects the request of his new commander for forces, his \n     decision will be seen as the abandonment of the president's \n     own commitment to the conflict.\n       In that case, no amount of rhetorical flourish is likely to \n     persuade Afghans, Pakistanis, or anyone else otherwise. A \n     president who overrules the apparently unanimous \n     recommendation of his senior generals and admirals that he \n     make good the resource shortfalls he himself called \n     unacceptable can hardly convince others he is determined to \n     succeed in Afghanistan. And if the United States is not \n     determined to succeed, then, in the language of the region, \n     it is getting ready to cut and run, whatever the president \n     and his advisers may think or say.\n       That is a policy that will indeed have regional effects--\n     extremely dangerous ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10397-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10397-S10402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        2010--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3183, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 3183, making \n     appropriations for energy and water development and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 10 minutes \nof debate with the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and 10 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is there an order in the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only order is that the Senator from North \nDakota is to control the final 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has been allotted 10 \nminutes. I saw him just walk through the Chamber a moment ago. The \nranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from Utah, is allotted \n5 minutes. Let me reserve my time and perhaps ask the Senator from Utah \nto begin, and then we hope the Senator from Oklahoma would return and \nuse his 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor and \nrecommend passage of the energy and water conference report for the \nfiscal year 2010. Despite the President sending up his budget in May, \nnearly 4 months after the budget had been traditionally sent to \nCongress, this subcommittee worked hard to produce a conference report \nthat is ready earlier than any that I can remember. I compliment my \nchairman, Senator Dorgan, for his hard work in developing a balanced \nbill in a legitimate time period.\n  The subcommittee produced a bill that is under the President's budget \nrequest by nearly $1 billion. That is quite extraordinary in this world \nwhere we are trying to shovel more money out the door, to come in with \na number that is less than the request of the President.\n  The House and Senate bills differed significantly in their \npriorities, but I believe the conference report before us balances the \nfunding interests of both bodies and those of the administration as \nwell. The Corps of Engineers remains an area of great interest. The \nbudget request for the corps is down $277 million from fiscal year \n2009. The conference report has restored $320 million to meet the large \nnumber of member requests, and the conferees allocated $313 million to \nwork off significant construction backlogs.\n  The Senate bill did not include new starts in the mark. Both the \nHouse and the administration proposed new starts, so we had to resolve \nthat issue in the conference. The conference provides $100,000 per \nproject in new starts in this bill.\n  Turning to the Bureau of Reclamation, the budget request was $55 \nmillion below fiscal year 2009 levels. The conferees provided an \nadditional $67 million for the Bureau of Reclamation, which is 6.3 \npercent over the request and 1 percent over fiscal year 2009. Once \nagain, as the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation has a \ntremendous backlog of underfunded and meritorious projects, and we did \nour best to try to work into that backlog.\n  Finally, as to the Department of Energy, the conference report \nrecommends $27.1 billion for the Department of Energy, which is $1.3 \nbillion below the President's request and $318 million above the \ncurrent year.\n  We cannot ignore the fact that $44 billion was provided in stimulus \nfunding for the Department this year, including $16 billion provided \nfor renewable energy accounts. That is why we have been able to make \nthe changes we did.\n  In restoring balance to the energy programs, the committee recommends \nan additional $25 million for nuclear energy R, including an $85 \nmillion increase for the Nuclear Power 2010 Program.\n  With respect to the concerns raised by the Senator from Oklahoma, I \npoint out the Senate adopted his amendments by unanimous consent. I was \nin support of those amendments and would be happy to support them again \nas they come in other appropriations bills. The reaction on the part of \nthe House was that there were two amendments proposed by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma: one they were willing to accept and one they were not. \nWe had to make a decision as to which of the two we would support and, \nwith Senator\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nDorgan, I supported one of the amendments of the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat made it into the conference report. I am sorry we were unable to \nget the other one in, but we did our best and we would be happy, as I \nsay--at least I would be happy; I will not speak for the chairman--I \nwould be happy to support this at some point in the future.\n  I yield the floor and whatever remainder of the time I may not have \nused I ask accrue to Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are at this point not because an \namendment was not accepted. We are at this point because of the nature \nof the amendment that was not accepted. I recognize my colleagues for \nthe good work they did on this bill. It is the lowest increase of any \nappropriations bill that has come to the Senate floor. But the problem \nis very straightforward and very simple: Why would the House not accept \nan amendment that said transparency for the American public is what we \nare after? We have to question that. And why would our conferees sign \non to a conference report that did not have transparency? That is the \nquestion.\n  There was an amendment that said the reports asked for out of this \nappropriations bill, unless they contain information related to the \nsecurity and defense of this country, should be made public to all 70 \nSenators who are not on the Appropriations Committee but, more \nimportant, to the people of this country. I cannot understand; nobody \ncan offer an argument on why you would not want to do that. Yet somehow \nit is not in the bill. How do we explain that? Is it because it is a \nCoburn amendment that it is not in the bill? Is it because there is \nsomething in the reports we do not want the American people to see? If \nthat is the case, what is the problem? Where is the problem?\n  The reason I did not give unanimous consent on this bill coming to \nthe floor is that I believe we ought to have a discussion about \ntransparency. One of the things my friend, President Obama, was good at \nwhen he was here, and has said he is for as our President, is \ntransparency. We teamed up and passed, along with Senator Carper and \nSenator McCain, the Transparency and Accountability Act. By the spring \nor summer of this year we will be able to see where every penny of our \ntax dollar goes, all the way down to subgrantee and subcontracting. \nThat is real transparency.\n  The question before us is why would this body accept this conference \nreport cloaked in secrecy?\n  I know Senators wanted this amendment. I am not accusing them of not \nwanting it. What I do not understand is why they would ever agree to a \nconference that did not have it in any bill we did? Why would we not \nlet the American people see what we are doing? Why would we not want \nthe people to see an annual report by the Department of Energy on their \nfinancial balances? That is one of the reports that is in here. Can \nsomebody tell me why we would not want that? Who in the House would not \nwant that? What is it we do not want the American people to see? A \nreport by the Chief of Engineers on water resources? Why can't the \nAmerican people see that? A report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nidentifying barriers to and its recommendations for streamlining for \nconstruction of new nuclear reactors? Why should not the American \npeople see what the problems are and see what that report says? Why \nshould that be cloaked, out of light, out of view, and away from the \nknowledge of the American people?\n  To me, there is either one of two explanations. One is they do not \ncare about what the American people think about knowing what is going \non in our government or there is something else going on inside one of \nthese reports they do not want the American people to see. It is one of \nthose two things. I don't know which it is. But what I believe is, it \nis unacceptable for us to pass a bill, a conference report, that has \ninformation in it that is not a risk for any of our national security \nissues to which the American people should not be privy.\n  I believe, if we vote for this conference report, what we are saying \nis we endorse it; we know it better. There are certain things that even \nthough they don't relate to security, you are not smart enough, you \ndon't have the insight, you don't have the wisdom, you don't have the \nknowledge to make a judgment.\n  I reject that, our Founders rejected that, and we as a body ought to \nreject it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the unanimous consent agreement provides I \nwill have the final 5 minutes of debate. If the Senator from Oklahoma \nwishes to consume the remainder of his time, I will use the final 5 \nminutes and then we will proceed.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is true the Senator does have the last time, but is \nthe unanimous consent agreement that the last 5 minutes is his?\n  I understand. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think I speak for myself and Senator \nBennett, we very much appreciate the work the Senator from Oklahoma \ndoes. He does it diligently. He is on the floor a great deal pushing \nhis views on these issues. On the specific issue that he just \ndescribed, it is an issue in which he came to the floor and offered it. \nWe included it in the bill during the Senate floor consideration \nbecause we believed in it. We agreed with him, as did others in the \nSenate, and that is what we took to conference.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma weaves a bit of a larger cloud than exists \nby suggesting there was some sort of deep secrets or conspiratorial \napproach to try to prevent the public from seeing something. That is \nfar from the case. The Senator makes a point that we agreed with by \naccepting his amendment. That is, reports required of the Department of \nEnergy to be sent to the Congress should be available not only to \nCongress but to the American people. We agreed with that point. That is \nwhy we put it in the Senate bill. We went to conference with the House. \nThere was objection. The fact is, this is a very big piece of \nlegislation. If we decided that if we can't resolve an objection or if \nwe can't reach agreement on everything, then there won't be a \nconference report. If that were the case, there would be very few \nconference reports on the floor of the Senate.\n  As my colleagues from Oklahoma and Utah know, there is a lot of give \nand take in the conference process. This is a piece of legislation that \nhas some $30 billion-plus on a wide range of issues such as nuclear \nweapons. This bill also funds nuclear weapons programs, water programs \nfor both the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, \nenergy programs, nuclear waste cleanup sites and many more complicated \nand important issues. In order to get a conference report, we had to \ngive and take here and there, and there was an objection to the \nprovision the Senator from Oklahoma had put in the Senate bill. I \nregret that, but that was the case. As my colleague from Utah described \npreviously, I will continue to support the Senator from Oklahoma's \nefforts to make sure all of these reports are made available to the \nAmerican people, providing that there is no national security issue or \nsecret clearance to them.\n  I emphasize something my colleague from Oklahoma described about \nthis. This conference report on energy and water is an important \nconference report. We need to get our bills done on time. Aside from \nthe fact that it does not include his amendment, which we had \npreviously supported and still do, we need to do our work. There is a \nlot of criticism about not passing appropriations bills. We will pass \nappropriations bills this year in great contrast to years previous when \nthere have been big omnibus bills. That is a good thing, that we are \nmaking progress to pass individual appropriations bills. We brought \nthis bill to the floor for debate. Amendments were offered, and the \nbill was passed. That is exactly the way the process should work.\n  Senator Bennett and I brought a bill to the floor that is slightly \nless than 1 percent above last year's expenditures for water and energy \nand so on. The Senator from Oklahoma acknowledged at the beginning of \nhis remarks that\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\nthis bill, with respect to the fiscal year 2010, is not a bill that \nunnecessarily throws a lot of money at programs and projects. We are \nless than 1 percent above last year's expenditures. That is important \nto note.\n  With respect to the many programs in the bill, there are many that \nare flat funded. Some are even slightly below fiscal year 2009. The \nexception is in three areas where there were increases. The first area \nof increase was for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs \nbecause we are trying to make sure we move down the road more \naggressively to attain a lower carbon future and promote greater \nefficiency. Second, the DOE's Science program represents an investment \nthat will provide significant dividends in the future. Our great \nscience laboratories and other investments in science represent a \nprofoundly important investment in our nation. Finally, naval reactors \nhad an increase. We put some additional money there because of the \nimportance of this program. The rest of the programs are very near \ntheir fiscal year 2009 levels with no increase at all.\n  This is a good conference report. I don't believe it is inappropriate \nfor my colleague from Oklahoma to be upset that his amendment is not a \npart of the report. I understand his position. He has served in the \nHouse and Senate. He understands there are many things in conference \nthat get dropped. Yet, for everything that is dropped, there was \nsomeone in the House or Senate who believed it was important enough to \ncome to the floor, offer it, fight for it, and passionately believe in \nit. I understand that is true with everything. It is certainly true for \nour colleague from Oklahoma who spends a lot of time pushing for \nincreased transparency. We appreciate that. That is why we agreed to \nthe amendment during the Senate debate.\n  This Energy and Water Appropriations bill is an important piece of \nlegislation. It does not contain the one amendment the Senator from \nOklahoma got put in the Senate side. We wish it did, but it does not. \nBut the conference report is nonetheless something that merits the \nsupport of the broad membership in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues who voted for \ncloture for the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report. It \nis important that we do the appropriations bills and get them done \nindividually. We are now past October 1, but in the last 2 years, we \nactually had to do omnibus appropriations bills. Thanks to Senator Reid \nand his determination and thanks to Senator Inouye, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, we are doing the bills one by one by one, and \nwe are going to get them finished. We just voted on the bill that funds \nall of the energy and water programs in the country, and it is a very \nimportant investment in this country.\n  I wanted to comment more generally about a few issues. The \nlegislation we are moving, the conference report, just got cloture. We \ngot it through the House and the Senate and now we are in a period of \n30 hours post-cloture. Hopefully, we will then get it to the President \nfor his signature for it to become law. The concerns I have about the \nissues here include not just the water infrastructure and nuclear \nweapons programs in our Energy and Water bill but also very much \ninclude energy.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about the energy challenges we face. \nThis chart describes a very serious dilemma for our country. Two-thirds \nof the crude oil used in the United States today is imported. Two-\nthirds of the crude oil we use comes from other countries, some of whom \ndon't like us very much. Our economy runs on energy. If, God forbid, \ntomorrow the supply of oil to this country were interrupted by \nterrorists or for some other reason, our economy would be in desperate \ntrouble. Every single day the American people get up and use energy but \ntake it for granted. We get out of bed, and we turn a switch on. We \nassume the lights will be on. We perhaps plug in an electric razor or \ntoothbrush and expect there to be electricity to run that razor or \ntoothbrush. We take a shower and expect the water heater to have been \nheated with electricity or natural gas to provide the hot water for a \nshower. Then we make coffee and breakfast, and there is electricity \nassumed to be available. Further, we put a key in the ignition of a \nvehicle and drive off to work, using energy once again.\n  Every part of our daily life is filled with the use of energy. The \nquestion is, How can we address this issue of our unbelievable reliance \non foreign oil? It threatens our national security and our energy \nsecurity to be so reliant on foreign oil. The reliance we have has to \nbe reduced. So how do we do that? Even as we do that, we must also find \na way to reduce the carbon footprint and reduce the amount of \nCO2 that goes into the atmosphere to protect the planet. So \ntwo things are working at the same time.\n  I wish to talk for a bit more about the legislation we have finished \nin the Senate Energy Committee, rather than the Energy and Water \nAppropriations panel which I chair. Senator Bingaman chairs the Energy \nCommittee, and I am the second ranking Democrat on that authorizing \ncommittee. I wish to talk about what we have written in the energy \nauthorizing bill in the context with efforts that some have described\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\nto merge that energy bill with a cap-and-trade climate change bill and \nbring both to the floor for a debate. I prefer we not do that approach. \nNot because I don't think we should address climate change; I believe \nwe should have that debate too. I believe we are going to have to have \na lower carbon future. What I believe we should do is a two-step \nprocess that focuses on energy legislation. From a policy standpoint, \nit would give us a real opportunity to reduce carbon in the atmosphere \nby changing our energy mix. First by using more renewable energy, and \nsecond by finding ways, through greater investments in research and \ntechnology, to reduce the carbon emitted when we burn fossil fuels to \nproduce energy. So I have a couple of comments about this two-step \napproach.\n  The Energy bill we have enacted provides a lot of things. It provides \na substantial increase in renewable energy, and it does that through \nwind turbines which create electricity from the wind. There is no \ncarbon output with wind energy. The problem is that we have a lot of \nwind in remote areas, and we need to move it to the load centers that \nneed the electricity. It's well known that there is wind from Texas to \nNorth Dakota. By the way, North Dakota ranks No. 1 in wind; we are the \nSaudi Arabia in wind. We also have a substantial opportunity to develop \nsolar from Texas across the Southwest to California where the sun \nshines all the time, or virtually all the time. We can maximize the \nproduction of energy where it is available from wind, solar, biomass \nand so on, and then we can build the transmission capability to move it \nto the load centers that need it. By doing this, you will dramatically \nchange our energy capability in this country.\n  The legislation we have done in the Energy Committee accomplishes \nthat goal. We have a significant transmission piece in that legislation \nthat allows us, at long last, to build the transmission capacity we \nneed to support our renewable potential.\n  We built an Interstate Highway System around this country so you can \nget in a vehicle and drive almost anywhere, but we have not built an \ninterstate highway of transmission to move energy from where it exists \nto where it is needed. We have a patchwork of transmission that was \nbuilt up over a period of time when there was a local utility that \nproduced energy for a certain market and then in that area distributed \nenergy to its market. That is the kind of transmission system we have. \nWe need to dramatically modernize the transmission so we can maximize \nthe amount of renewable energy.\n  There are a lot of things happening that I think are exciting in \nenergy that can change our future. Do you know right now there are a \ncouple hundred people working on a process to find innovative ways to \nuse coal. Dr. Craig Venter is involved. He is one of the great \nscientists in our country and one of the two people who led the human \ngenome project. They are working on finding ways to create synthetic \nmicrobes that would actually consume a coal in deep seams and turn the \ncoal into methane. Think of that. It creates synthetic microbes that \nwill essentially eat the coal--that is not a scientific term--they will \nconsume the coal and leave in its wake methane, turning coal into \nmethane.\n  We have others who are working on the development of algae and \nenergy, and Dr. Venter is involved in this as well. By the way, after \n15 years of it being discontinued, I restarted the algae research at \nthe DOE energy laboratories through my Energy and Water Subcommittee. \nDr. Venter is working on developing strains of algae that will excrete \nlipids that become a fuel. We know we can grow algae in water and \nsunlight and CO2 and then get rid of CO2 by \ngrowing algae and then destroy the algae by harvesting it and creating \ndiesel fuel. Dr. Venter is looking at ways to produce algae that simply \nexcrete the lipids and, with little transformation, becomes a fuel. We \nhave so many things going on that are so interesting. I think 10 years \nfrom now we will look in the rearview mirror and see dramatic changes \nin how we produce energy and how we significantly reduce carbon.\n  I wish to show a map of my State in which we have some projects that \nare extraordinary. The western half of North Dakota has substantial oil \ndevelopment. The USGS determined that it was the largest discovery of \ntechnically recoverable oil that has yet been assessed in the lower 48 \nStates. They estimated that there was as much as 4.3 billion barrels of \noil in this region known as the Bakken formation. We also have a \nsubstantial amount of coal, lignite coal. We have one of the largest \ncommercial working example of CO2 sequestration by capturing \nthe CO2 from a synthetic gas plant, putting it in a \npipeline, and sending it up to Saskatchewan where they inject it \nunderground for enhanced oil recovery. By doing this, it improves the \nproductivity of marginal oil wells in Saskatchewan. So we actually \ncapture the CO2 from the North Dakota plant that is \ngasifying coal and gas, ship it up to Canada, and then inject it \nunderground in an enhanced oil recovery process. In my judgment, that \nis a very exciting thing.\n  Here are the fuels we use for the production of electricity. About \nforty-eight percent of our electricity comes from coal. Nuclear \nprovides a smaller piece than that need. We have natural gas, \nhydroelectric, and other renewables too. So my point is we are not \ngoing to have a future without using coal for some period of time. The \nquestion is how do we use it in a different way. I believe a \nsubstantial investment in technology that will allow us to build near-\nzero emission coal-fired plants. I believe we can do that by capturing \ncarbon and protecting our environment. We must maximize the use of \nrenewables from wind, solar, biomass, and other sources. We must also \nmove toward an electric drive transportation system, and then continue \nto invest in a longer term hydrogen fuel cell system. We need to do all \nof these things are what we can and should do.\n  The Energy bill we passed out of the Energy Committee is a giant step \nforward to maximize renewables and increase energy efficiency as a way \nto reduce carbon. I think what we ought to do is bring that energy bill \nto the floor, have a debate, get it to the President for his signature. \nThis would be a giant step in the direction of climate change. \nFollowing that, we should bring the climate change bill to the floor \nand then address the issue of targets and timetables and other \nmechanisms to find out what is achievable for protecting this country. \nSome have heard me speak about this and have said, Well, he doesn't \nsupport any sort of climate change legislation. What I have said is I \ndon't support cap and ``trade.'' At this point, I have said I don't \nsupport providing a $1 trillion carbon securities market for Wall \nStreet so that speculators and the investment banks can trade carbon \nsecurities tomorrow and tell us what our price of energy is going to be \nfor us the next day. I have precious little faith in those same people \nwho ran up the price of oil last year to $147 a barrel in day trading \nwhen the market fundamentals showed that demand was down and supply was \nup. So, no, I don't support the trade side using that mechanism, but I \ndo support creating climate change legislation that has appropriate \ntargets and timetables that reduce our nation's carbon footprint. We \ncan do that. We will do that. I think there is general consensus we \nshould do that.\n  All I am saying is this: What we ought to do is bring to the floor \nenergy legislation that will adopt the policies on maximizing \nrenewables, building the transmission capability, creating the building \nefficiencies and much more that is and important step forward and the \nlowest hanging fruit in energy. Among these positive benefits, energy \nefficiency is the lowest hanging fruit by far that costs the least to \nretrofit America's buildings and homes. We should do all of that in the \nEnergy bill that has now been waiting for some months. I have spoken to \nthe majority leader who has been a terrific advocate for sound and \nthoughtful energy policies. I have also talked to the President \ndirectly about this. It is not that I don't want to do climate change \nbecause I know my colleagues are working hard on it. It is the fact \nthat I want to make progress in energy policy first that can change our \nfuel mix and develop a lower carbon future. Because we have done that \nwork in the Energy Committee, we have taken an important step. We can \nthen bring a climate change bill to the floor after that which I know \nis controversial, but that\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\nwe can work on developing targets and timetables for that lower carbon \nfuture. I think this is something we should do and I think we can do. I \nthink it would, in my judgment, be the best fit for this country's \nfuture energy policy and for the policy that is necessary to lower the \nfuture CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and protect the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nany recess adjournment or morning business period count past cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota that the one example he gave about algae--it is so \nexciting that we know now that you can take algae and put it in some \nkind of plastic cylinder, expose it to sunlight, and with the right \ningredients in there, pump in CO2, and it consumes the \ncarbon dioxide and in the process it makes ethanol. So as the Senator \nhas hinted, if this process ends up working, and working efficiently, \nwhat about putting an algae ethanol-producing plant right next to a \ncoal-fired electricity plant to take the CO2 out of the \ncoal, and instead of trying to inject it into the ground, put it right \ninto the ethanol-producing algae plant? There are limitless \npossibilities, as the Senator from North Dakota pointed out. I find it \nquite exciting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I held a \nhearing on the beneficial use of carbon. A scientist at Sandia National \nLaboratory said: Think of carbon not just as a problem but an \nopportunity.\n  In this case, when you talk of algae, it is single-cell pond scum, a \ngreen slime you find on top of wastewater, right? The fact is, you can \nfeed CO2 to algae and produce something from it that extends \nour fuel supply. It is exactly the kind of thing that makes sense.\n  There are other beneficial uses of carbon as well. If we change our \nway of thinking a bit, we all have the same goal, which is to protect \nour planet. We can find other ways of maximizing the use of renewables \nand to reduce carbon by using it for enhanced oil recovery and \nproducing additional fuel by growing algae.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill. It certainly is going to continue \nto help us provide for the Nation's energy needs and water \ninfrastructure, but it also restores funding to our efforts at \nrestoring America's Everglades.\n  For many years, the Everglades have simply languished. Over half a \ncentury ago, or three-quarters of a century ago, the idea was to get \nrid of the floodwaters, and mankind went in there and completely \nreversed what Mother Nature intended, diked and drained and sent \nfreshwater out to tidewater and did it exactly the opposite.\n  In this massive project, we are trying to restore the natural \necosystem that once dominated the entire south half of the peninsula of \nFlorida. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 was a major step \ntoward restoring parts of the Everglades. This effort was also helped \nby this year's omnibus and stimulus spending bills which put a \nsignificant amount of funding toward restoration--about $360 million. \nBuilding on that momentum, the President's budget for fiscal year 2010 \nincluded $214 million in funding for the Everglades from the Army Corps \nof Engineers.\n  Despite the best bipartisan efforts of the Florida delegation, the \nfinal bill contains $180 million in funding for the Everglades instead \nof what we had hoped for, but we do have exciting things happening this \nyear. In a few months, there will be two groundbreaking projects that \nare critical to restoring the Everglades--the construction of the \nTamiami Trail bridge and the Picayune Strand.\n  While this particular appropriations bill falls short of the \nPresident's request, I have been assured by the administration that \nSite One, which is one of the projects that is funded minimally in this \nappropriations bill, and the Indian River Lagoon, also funded \nminimally, are going to have the funds needed to go forward from \nanother source, perhaps the stimulus bill. I wish to express my \nappreciation to the administration. We have overcome great obstacles to \nget us this far. This bill settles the question of whether the Indian \nRiver Lagoon and Site One are new starts or not. In 2010 we will begin \nconstruction on those new projects.\n  It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who said that ``the great thing in the \nworld is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are \nmoving.'' When it comes to the Everglades restoration, we are going in \nthe right direction. We have great science, we know what needs to be \ndone, and we are doing it. In 12 months, we have allocated $600 million \nfor the Everglades. In the next year, we are going to break ground on \nfour projects.\n  I wish to conclude by saying that restoration not only means doing \nthese projects, which often are Army Corps of Engineers projects, but \nit also means protecting the 68 threatened and endangered species that \ncall the Everglades home.\n  Just yesterday, a long-awaited Federal report was released that found \nthat the Burmese python, a giant constrictor snake, and four other \nlarge constrictor snakes pose a high risk to these kinds of \nenvironments in the United States. We have been saying this for the \nlast 3 years, but we now have the official report issued by the Federal \nGovernment. The report says, in particular, that Florida, Texas, and \nHawaii provide prime habitat for these giant predators. Remember, these \npredators have no natural enemies. It doesn't make any difference if \nthe critter has scales, feathers, or fur--these giant constrictor \nsnakes consume them all. We have 68 threatened and endangered species \nin the Everglades that call the Everglades home. According to the \nsuperintendent of the Everglades Park, there are estimates of up to \n140,000 of these snakes because they proliferate so greatly. They got \none female, and they found 56 eggs inside her ready to hatch. That is \nhow much they proliferate. So the report finally backs up what the \nNational Park Service staff, the scientists, and the citizens of south \nFlorida have been concerned about for the past years--the enormous \ndamage caused by importing invasive species like the Burmese python.\n  We are going to continue to work with the Florida delegation and the \nDepartment of the Interior, with Secretary Ken Salazar, who has taken a \npersonal interest in this, with the Army Corps of Engineers, with the \nState of Florida, the local communities, and the citizens who are \ncommitted to the Everglades, toward restoring this national treasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 3183, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The conference report provides $33.5 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2010, which will result in new outlays of \n$19.6 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, discretionary outlays for the conference report will \ntotal $43 billion.\n  The conference report matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and for outlays.\n  The conference report includes several provisions that make changes \nin mandatory programs that result in an increase in direct spending in \nthe 9 years following the 2010 budget year. Each of these provisions is \nsubject to a point of order established by section 314 of S. Con. Res. \n70, the 2009 budget resolution. The conference report is not subject to \nany other budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the conference report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\n\n\n      H.R. 3183, ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES\n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n   [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    Purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,629     16,836     33,465\n    Outlays............................     18,391     24,563     42,954\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     33,465\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........     42,954\nSenate-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,886     16,864     33,750\n    Outlays............................     18,571     24,630     43,201\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,367     16,931     33,298\n    Outlays............................     18,219     24,508     42,727\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................     16,548     17,845     34,393\n    Outlays............................     18,345     24,269     42,614\nConference Report Compared To:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget Authority...............  .........  .........          0\n        Outlays........................  .........  .........          0\n    Senate-Passed Bill:\n        Budget Authority...............       -257        -28       -285\n        Outlays........................       -180        -67       -247\n    House-Passed Bill:\n        Budget Authority...............        262        -95        167\n        Outlays........................        172         55        227\n    President's Request:\n        Budget Authority...............         81     -1,009       -928\n        Outlays........................         46        294       340\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: The table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency\n  budget authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act\n  (P.L. 111-32).\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Afghanistan Reset\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, few subjects weigh more heavily upon a \nPresident of the United States than the decision to send America's sons \nand daughters into war. Such a commitment demands the clearest of clear \nthinking, including a thoroughly dispassionate assessment of goals--\nobjectives, in other words--risks and strategies. This is difficult, \nvery difficult terrain for any American President, especially when \nfaced with conflicting views from advisers, from Congress, and from the \nAmerican public.\n  I have become deeply concerned that in the 8 years since the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the reason for the military mission of the United \nStates in Afghanistan has become lost, consumed in some broader scheme \nof nation building, which has clouded our purpose and obscured our \nreasoning.\n  General McChrystal, our current military commander in Afghanistan, \nhas requested 30,000 to 40,000 additional American troops to bolster \nthe more than 65,000 American troops already there. I am not clear as \nto his reasons and I have many questions.\n  What does General McChrystal actually aim to achieve? So I am \ncompelled to ask: Does it take 100,000 U.S. troops to find Osama bin \nLaden? If al-Qaida has moved to Pakistan, what will these troops in \nAfghanistan add to the effort to defeat al-Qaida? What is meant by the \nterm ``defeat'' in the parlance of conventional military aims when \nfacing a shadowy, global terrorist network? And what of this number \n100,000? Does the number 100,000 troops include support personnel? Does \nit include government civilians? Does it include defense and security \ncontractors? How many contractors are already there in Afghanistan? How \nmuch more will this cost? How much in terms of dollars? How much in \nterms of American blood? Will the international community step up to \nthe plate and bear a greater share of the burden?\n  There are some in Congress who talk about limiting the number of \nadditional troops until we surge--where have I heard that word before--\nuntil we ``surge to train'' more Afghan defense forces. That sounds a \nlot like fence straddling to me. I suggest we might better refocus our \nefforts on al-Qaida and reduce U.S. participation in nation building in \nAfghanistan.\n  Let me say that again. I suggest we might better refocus--in other \nwords, take another look--our efforts on al-Qaida and reduce U.S. \nparticipation in nation building in Afghanistan. Given the lack of \npopularity and integrity of the current Afghan Government, what \nguarantee is there that additional Afghan troops and equipment will not \nproduce an even larger and better armed hostile force?\n  Let me ask that question again. Given the lack of popularity and \nintegrity of the current Afghan Government, what guarantee is there \nthat additional Afghan troops and equipment will not produce an even \nlarger and better armed hostile force? There is no guarantee. The \nlengthy presence of foreign troops in a sovereign country almost always \ncreates resentment and resistance among the native population.\n  I am relieved to hear President Obama acknowledge that there has been \nmission creep in Afghanistan, and I am pleased to hear the President \nexpress skepticism about sending more troops into Afghanistan unless \nneeded to achieve our primary goal of disrupting al-Qaida. I remain \nconcerned that Congress may yet succumb to military and international \nagendas. General Petraeus and General McChrystal both seem to have \nbought into the nation-building mission. By supporting a nationwide \ncounterinsurgency and nation-building strategy, I believe they have \ncertainly lost sight of America's primary strategic objective; namely, \nto disrupt and defang--in other words, pull the teeth right out of the \nbone. I believe they certainly have lost sight of America's primary \nstrategic objective to disrupt and defang al-Qaida and protect the \nAmerican people--protect the American people--from future attack.\n  President Obama and the Congress must--I do not say ``should,'' I say \n``must''--reassess and refocus on our original and most important \nobjective; namely, emasculating--I mean tearing it out by the roots--\nemasculating a terrorist network that has proved its ability to inflict \nharm, where? On the United States.\n  If more troops are required to support the international mission in \nAfghanistan, then the international community should step up and \nprovide the additional forces and funding. The United States is already \nsupplying a disproportionate number of combat assets for that purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2644\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about my pending amendment \nto the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, amendment No. 2644. \nApparently, this has created some interest and some opposition. It \napparently is one of the major, if not the major, reason the majority \nleader felt the need to file cloture on the Commerce-Justice-State bill \nrather than simply come to an agreement regarding pending amendments \nand votes. It saddens me that--although that agreement was all worked \nout, basically--it was out the window, and he just decided to file \ncloture and bar votes on all of those amendments, including my \namendment No. 2644. I think we should have a reasonable debate on my \namendment and\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nthen a straightforward vote on the amendment because it is an important \ntopic, directly related to that bill.\n  What does the amendment do? My amendment is about the next census. It \nsimply says no funds in that appropriations bill can be spent on the \nnext census unless we ask about citizenship. I believe that is a basic \nrequirement for the next census, to give us adequate tools to deal with \na whole host of issues, including illegal immigration, including \nproperly handling congressional reapportionment. Again, I find it very \nsad and, frankly, telling that the majority leader is going to such \nlengths to avoid having a vote on that simple concept, that simple \nidea.\n  Why should we ask a question about citizenship? A couple of reasons. \nFirst of all, the census is supposed to give us in Congress important \ninformation, detailed information, the tools we need regarding how to \nhandle a host of Federal programs and Federal issues. Certainly a major \nissue we need to deal with in this country and in this Congress is \nimmigration, including illegal immigration. It seems like basic \ninformation we would want to collect. How many folks covered in the \ncensus are citizens and how many are noncitizens? That is basic \ninformation that would help us in a whole host of ways with regard to \nFederal programs and with regard to dealing with the immigration issue.\n  There is another even more important reason, in my opinion, we should \ncollect this information, and that is because one of the most important \nthings any census is used for is reapportioning the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives; determining how many House seats each State in the \nUnion gets in terms of representation. As it stands now, the plan is to \ndo the census, to not distinguish in any way between citizens and \nnoncitizens, and therefore to have noncitizens counted in congressional \nreapportionment. I think this is crazy and goes against the very idea \nof a representative democracy, people being elected by voters to \nrepresent citizens in the Congress. I don't think the Founding Fathers \nset up our democracy to have noncitizens represented in the Congress.\n  As it stands now, without asking that simple, basic, fundamental \nquestion, noncitizens will be counted in congressional reapportionment. \nThat means States with a particularly large number of noncitizens, \nincluding illegal aliens, will be rewarded for that, will get more \nrepresentation, more say, more clout in the House of Representatives. \nStates that do not have that issue will be hurt. They will get less \nsay, less clout, less Members of the House of Representatives. I think \nthat is fundamentally wrong.\n  I also have a very specific interest in finding against that because \nLouisiana is one of nine States that would specifically be hurt. There \nare at least nine States that will have less representation in the \nHouse of Representatives if we count all people in congressional \nreapportionment, including noncitizens, versus if we just count \ncitizens. It is important to say what those nine States are, and I \nspecifically reached out to the Senators representing those nine \nspecific States to make it clear to them that their States lose out in \nterms of that equation.\n  Those States are Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon, and Louisiana. Those nine \nStates would have less representation, less say, less clout in the \nHouse of Representatives if all people, including noncitizens, are \ncounted in congressional reapportionment versus if only citizens are \ncounted. Once again: Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon, and Louisiana.\n  I particularly implore my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, from \nthose States to be aware of that, to support the Vitter amendment, and \nso we get to a vote on the Vitter amendment, No. 2644, to vote against \ncloture on the entire bill.\n  Unfortunately, there are several Senators from those States who voted \nfor cloture yesterday. I hope they will reconsider. I hope they would \nsee, if they vote for cloture again, that they would be preventing us \ngetting to this issue. They would be preventing us getting to a \nreasonable and full debate and vote on this issue. I implore all \nSenators from Indiana, including Senator Bayh, who voted for cloture \npreviously; from Iowa, including the Senators there who voted for \ncloture previously; the two Senators from Michigan; the two Senators \nfrom Pennsylvania; the Democratic Senator from North Carolina; the \nDemocratic Senator from Louisiana--please don't vote for cloture again \nuntil we can get a reasonable vote on this amendment.\n  Let me specifically address some of the arguments that have been made \nagainst this amendment because I think they are completely erroneous. \nOne argument is this will intimidate folks and discourage noncitizens \nfrom filling out the census form. I think it is important to note, No. \n1, this citizenship question is asked on the long form. The long form \ngets millions of responses, and the census has never noted any \ndifficulty in getting folks to fill out the long form.\n  This question is also asked in the American Community Survey which \nthe Census Bureau does. Again, the same citizenship question is asked \nhere, and we get plenty of responses. The Census Bureau has never noted \na big problem in terms of getting those responses.\n  To make this perfectly clear, I am perfectly willing to revise my \namendment so that we only focus on citizenship, not immigration status. \nI will be happy to revise my amendment so it only mentions and only \nfocuses on citizenship versus immigration status.\n  The other argument, that the Census Bureau itself has apparently \nmade, is that this would be cumbersome and cost money at this stage in \nthe census. Frankly, I find this pretty ironic coming from a \nbureaucracy which is spending $13 billion on this new census, up from \n$4.5 billion from the last census. Here is a bureaucracy where the cost \nof the new census versus the last census has tripled. The last score \nthey are getting $13 billion, but asking this one question, which they \nalready ask in the long form, which they already ask in the American \nCommunity Survey, is a huge problem and will cost too much money. That \nsimply is silly on its face. It is important to do this right. \nCertainly asking a basic question about citizenship is central to doing \nit right.\n  In summary, I urge all my colleagues to demand a vote on this \nimportant issue and to vote against cloture on the bill until we get \nthat vote. Then, when we get that vote, I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the Vitter amendment, No. 2644. It is very simple and \nstraightforward. It will say: Ask the citizenship question. Let us know \nhow many folks in the overall count are citizens and how many are \nnoncitizens. That is absolutely essential, No. 1, so we can use the \ncensus information as a full tool in many of the programs and policies \nwe debate and implement in Congress. No. 2, it is particularly \nimportant for congressional reapportionment.\n  I do not believe noncitizens should be counted in congressional \nreapportionment. I don't believe States which have particularly large \nnoncitizen populations should have more say and more clout in Congress \nbecause of that than States that do not, and that States such as \nLouisiana should be penalized. I don't believe those nine States in \nparticular--Louisiana, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon--should be \npenalized by including noncitizens in congressional reapportionment. I \ncertainly do not believe Senators representing those nine States should \nvote either for cloture, cutting off a vote on my amendment, or should \nvote against my amendment.\n  Again, I particularly urge all Senators from those nine States to \nstand up for their States, to vote for the interests of their States, \nto vote for their States getting full and proper representation, to \nvote against their States being penalized in terms of the census and in \nterms of congressional reapportionment.\n  It is a simple issue but a very basic, fundamental issue. The census \nis an important tool. It only happens once every 10 years. We need to \nget it right for a whole host of reasons, particularly with \ncongressional reapportionment in mind.\n  I daresay if any Members of this body go back home to their States \nand have a discussion in a diner, have a townhall meeting, just ask a \nrepresentative group of citizens: Did you know that noncitizens, \nincluding illegal aliens, are not only counted in the census--\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nbut we do not discriminate--we do not know the numbers of noncitizens \nversus citizens? And, because of that, did you know all of those \nnoncitizens are factored into determining how many House seats each \nState gets so that States with very large noncitizen populations, \nincluding large numbers of illegal aliens, are rewarded for that; they \nget more clout and say and vote in the House of Representatives, and \nother States, particularly the nine States I mentioned, are penalized \nbecause of that?\n  I daresay the average citizen would be stunned about that and would \nsay, hardly with any exception: That is not right. We should know those \nnumbers, and we should not count noncitizens in terms of House \nrepresentation. I certainly think citizens and voters in Indiana, in \nIowa, in Oregon, in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana would certainly say: Wait a \nminute, we are being penalized because noncitizens are being counted or \nbeing worked into the formula for representation in Congress? That is \ncrazy.\n  It is crazy. It doesn't meet the smell test, it doesn't meet the \ncommonsense test of the American people, and we should act to make sure \nthe next census is done right, starting by having a vote on the Vitter \namendment, No. 2644, and by passing that amendment to the bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that we are now in \nwhat is called a 30-hour postcloture period. We had a cloture vote this \nmorning on the energy and water conference report. I chair the \ncommittee that brought that to the floor, the subcommittee on \nappropriations which funds the water projects, the energy projects, the \nnuclear weapons, among other things. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation. We could not just bring it to the floor from conference. \nWe actually had to file cloture, wait for the cloture petition to \nripen--2 days--then we have a vote. I think we had 79 votes in favor of \nit. And now we are in a period where we can't yet adopt it because some \nare insisting we have the 30 hours postcloture expire. My hope is that \nwhoever feels that way might relent so that later this afternoon we can \npass this piece of legislation.\n  But this legislation is very much like almost everything else we are \ntrying to do in appropriations. We have tried very hard to do the \nappropriations bills as we are supposed to do them--one at a time, \nbring them to the floor, have votes, debate the amendments, and so on. \nIn the last couple of years, in my judgment, the appropriations process \nhas been a failure because we have had to do omnibus bills, which is \nnot the right way to do it. We were forced to do that, in many \nrespects. But now we are trying to do one bill at a time, and we have \ndone many of them. Credit goes to the majority leader, who has said we \nwant to finish the individual appropriations bills. But the fact is, we \nare getting almost no cooperation--almost none.\n  I think we have had a relatively noncontroversial Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, which is generally pretty noncontroversial. As I \nrecall, I believe we had to file a cloture petition to shut off debate \non the motion to proceed--not the bill, just the motion to proceed to \nthe bill. That takes 2 days to ripen, then you have 30 hours \npostcloture.\n  Virtually every step of the way, we have had this problem, with no \ncooperation at all. It is like trying to ride a bicycle built for two \nuphill and the person on the backseat has their foot on the brakes. \nThat is what is happening around here all the time. All we would like \nis just a little cooperation so we can get these bills completed.\n  When we bring a conference bill to the floor, it shouldn't take us 2 \nto 3 days. The bill I brought to the floor myself, the Energy and Water \nbill, took us a fair amount of time. We sat on the floor waiting for \npeople to come and offer amendments. They didn't. That is why I \nsometimes refer to the Senate as 100 bad habits. It is not very easy to \nget people to come over, even when they have amendments to offer. And \nthen from time to time somebody comes over and has an amendment that \nhas nothing to do with the subject, which is fine--the rules allow \nthat--but then they insist they have a vote on their specific two or \nthree or four amendments or they will hold everything up forever.\n  So we are getting no cooperation, and it would be nice to get just \nsome so we can get the appropriations bills done. It is the right way \nto do it--bring the bills to the floor, do them, debate them, and have \nvotes on them. That is the way the Senate should work. Lord knows we \nhave tried this year to do that, but we have had almost no cooperation. \nAt every turn, we have had people stand up and say: Well, I have my \nfour amendments, but, no, I am not going to come over and offer them. I \nam going to tell you I have four amendments to offer, and if you try to \nshut this down and shut off amendments, then we will filibuster and we \nwon't give you the 60 votes you need to shut it off. So there you are, \nstuck in the middle, unable to get things done.\n  Again, the cloture vote yesterday failed on Commerce-State-Justice. \nNormally speaking, Senator Mikulski would bring a bill like that to the \nfloor of the Senate and it would be on the floor maybe 1 day, maybe 2 \ndays. Instead, I watched last week as she was out here waiting for \npeople to offer amendments--sitting here waiting, and no one was coming \nto offer amendments, by and large. Then the majority leader sat here \nuntil I think 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night one evening trying to reach \nan agreement, and no agreement was forthcoming.\n  My only point is that it would be nice if we could get some \ncooperation and some understanding. It is not Republican or Democrat or \nconservative or liberal to do the work on time and finish our \nappropriations bills with some amount of cooperation; it is just common \nsense. If we could just get a bit of that cooperation, we could get the \nwork done around here.\n  I did want to mention as well, with respect to the agenda, that while \nwe are trying to get these appropriations bills done, we will also \nbegin the process of debating health care on the floor of the Senate--a \nhealth care bill that will be brought to the floor reasonably soon. I \nwant to mention that certainly one of the efforts I will make when the \nhealth care bill comes to the floor--and I have mentioned this before--\nis to try to address the issue of the expanding cost of prescription \ndrugs. That is not dealt with in the legislation which is coming to the \nfloor, I assume, and if not, then there are 30 of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who have legislation that will give the American people the \nfreedom to import FDA-approved drugs sold at a fraction of the price \nelsewhere. That will be one of the amendments I and many others will \ncome to the floor to offer.\n  Another amendment I intend to offer is a piece of legislation called \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We passed that through the \nSenate last year. We have modified it just a bit this year, and I \nbelieve we will reintroduce it later this afternoon.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has not been reauthorized for \na long time. I believe it has been 17 years since the Senate last dealt \nwith Indian health care--an authorization bill--except for last year \nwhen we failed because one of our colleagues, who previously spoke, \noffered an abortion amendment that had the effect of stopping the bill \nwhen it got to the House of Representatives.\n  Having said all that, I intend to offer the Indian health care \nlegislation as an amendment to the broader health care bill because I \ndon't think we should go on to pass a health care reform bill if we \ndon't address the health care obligations we have made to the first \nAmericans, the American Indians. The fact is, American Indians were \npromised by treaty--were promised time and time again and in treaties \nthe Federal Government signed--that we would provide for their health \ncare, and we have not met those promises. We have both a trust \nresponsibility and a treaty responsibility to fix the health care \nsystem for American Indians. It has not been fixed, and it would be a \ntragedy if we moved forward with health care and didn't include the \nimportant part that is required by us to reauthorize the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act. So I intend to offer that as well.\n\n  I also want to say that when we get health care completed--and I \nspoke\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nearlier today about the need to bring up the Energy bill, but there is \nanother bill that is very important that I have spent a lot of time on \nthat has to be considered by the Senate and the entire Congress. That \nis the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill is \ncritically important. It has a wide range of issues dealing with safety \nin the skies, and it has the important provisions dealing with \nmodernizing our air transportation system--our air traffic control \nsystem, I should say--and that modernization can't wait. We have to \nmove forward, and it requires a lot of things.\n  Senator Rockefeller and I have brought a bill out of the Commerce \nCommittee that is ready for floor action, but we need to get it to the \nfloor of the Senate and get it passed so we can get it into conference \nwith the House of Representatives. If I might, I want to describe for a \nmoment why this is important.\n  We have the skies full of airplanes. I know the carriers have shrunk \ntheir size by 8 or 10 percent in terms of commercial carriers, but \nnonetheless we have the skies full of airplanes flying around \ntransporting people and cargo, and the fact is, we are still flying to \nwhat is called ground-based radar. What happens is, we put an airplane \nin the air someplace with a couple hundred people on board, and it \nflies around being guided by ground-based radar. Of course, that is \nbetter than the old days, when in order to haul the mail at night, in \nthe early days of airplanes, they first used bonfires every so many \nmiles so that you could fly to a bonfire and see where you were headed. \nThat was the only way you could fly at night. The second thing they did \nwas to use flashing lights, and now, of course, ground-based radar for \nmany decades. But ground-based radar is clearly obsolete, and it only \ntells someone where an airplane was just for a nanosecond.\n  The transponder on the airplane being shown on a tube someplace or by \na monitor somewhere in the air traffic control center shows, when the \narc goes around on the radar, where that jet airplane was. Then for the \nnext 6 or 7 seconds, as it is going around again, that jet airplane is \nsomeplace else because it is traveling very fast. It only tells you \nabout where the airplane is and only tells you exactly where it was for \na nanosecond.\n  The fact is, we need to go to a GPS system so we can save money, use \nmore direct routing, make it safer for passengers, and use less energy. \nYou also don't have to space the planes as far apart because you know \nexactly where an airplane is, not where it was.\n  We need to move on this newer technology. Europe is moving to it, and \nmany other countries. But it is complicated, and it requires us to pass \nlegislation that includes the modernization of the air traffic control \nsystem. Again, we brought that out of the Commerce Committee, and it is \nawaiting action on the floor of the full Senate.\n  I hope that following health care and following a number of other \nissues--including, I hope, an energy bill at some point--the FAA \nreauthorization bill will have its day on the floor of the Senate. I \nalso hope we will have substantial cooperation. I know Senator \nHutchison from Texas worked with us, Senator DeMint worked with us to \nbring that out of the Commerce Committee, and I look forward to having \nthat as part of the agenda so that all of those who have worked for a \nlong time on these issues dealing with safety in the skies and dealing \nwith modernizing our air traffic control system will be able to feel as \nif we have made progress and have been able to get this bill to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. President, I know the majority leader has a lot to try to plan \nfor the agenda now as we near the end of the year, and these are big, \ndifficult issues. I want to help him, as do most of my colleagues. We \nare going to need a little cooperation here and there. If we continue \nto have to vote on cloture petitions, on motions to proceed, it means \nevery single thing we bring to the floor of the Senate takes a week \njust to get up. Cloture petitions take a couple of days to ripen, then \nthere is 30 hours postcloture. All we need is a little cooperation. \nThat ought not be too much to ask in order to get the business of the \nSenate done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Indian Health Care\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Indian \nhealth care legislation. This is legislation introduced by the chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Dorgan.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about Native Americans and their health \ncare situation. We have spent the last 6 months talking about health \ncare. We have debated the quality of care, the cost of care, access to \ncare. I am glad to say we are making progress in fixing what is broken \nin our health care system. But there is one group of Americans that has \nnot engaged in this national conversation, Americans who suffer from an \ninadequate health care system and alarming health disparities. I am \ntalking about the first Americans, the American Indians and Alaska \nNatives who are suffering because the Federal Government is not living \nup to its promise to them.\n  Right now Native Americans are being diagnosed with diabetes at \nalmost three times the rate of any other ethnic group. Right now too \nmany Native American families don't have access to preventive health \ncare. Right now Native American teens are attempting and committing \nsuicide at alarming rates. The bottom line is, too many Native \nAmericans are struggling to receive quality health care. For too many \nyears, America has stood aside and let it happen.\n  Today is a new day. It is time for America to make good on its \npromises to Native Americans. I believe Senator Dorgan's bill would \nhelp us do just that. This legislation will bring much needed reforms \nto the Indian health care system and will allow us to connect Indian \nhealth improvements to national reform efforts. By tying these \ninitiatives together, we will increase the likelihood of success not \nonly today but for years to come. This legislation would make \nreauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act permanent so \nIndian country can better predict and plan for its health care needs. \nIt will also build on what works by expanding services for mental \nhealth and prevention. We encourage stronger collaboration with the \nVeterans' Administration. We provide resources so that more Native \nAmericans can train to become health care providers. We promote new \nideas and future progress through funding of demonstration projects.\n  Finally, we begin addressing a tragedy that is tearing apart too many \nNative American families, especially in my home State of New Mexico. \nThat tragedy is the epidemic of teen suicide which I spoke of a moment \nago. New Mexico's suicide rate is almost two times that of the national \naverage, and far too many of these suicides are happening in Indian \ncountry. This summer, over the course of a little more than a month, \nfour people from the Mescalero Apache Reservation committed suicide, \nall of them teenagers or young adults. The latest was a 14-year-old \ngirl just last week. In this bill we will take the first steps in \naddressing this crisis. We will fund new grant programs and telehealth \ninitiatives, and we will expand a program that has proven successful \nfor the Zuni tribe in New Mexico. It is a program that connects schools \nand parents with the community, where students learn to be peer \neducators, and middle and high school students learn life skills to \nprevent suicide.\n  America has an obligation to provide quality, accessible health care \nfor our country's first Americans. That begins with engaging American \nIndians and Alaska Natives in the national conversation about health \nreform.\n  I am honored to cosponsor this bill and look forward to its passage \nby the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, for more than three decades, seniors \nhave relied on a COLA in their Social Security benefits to keep up with \ntheir increased expenses. Tomorrow it is expected that the Social \nSecurity Administration will announce that for the first time in 35 \nyears, seniors will not be receiving a COLA. Based on the formula that \nby law they are obliged to use, they came to the conclusion that there \nis no inflation for seniors and, in fact, the prices for seniors have \ndeclined.\n  In my view, the current formulation for determining Social Security \nCOLAs is wrong in terms of the needs of seniors because it does not \naccurately take into account their purchasing needs. In other words, if \nyou are 19 years of age and you buy a laptop computer or an iPod or a \nnew cell phone, the likelihood is that prices may well have gone down \nover the last year. On the other hand, most seniors are not buying \niPods. What they are buying is prescription drugs and health care \nneeds, and those costs have gone up.\n  I have long argued and when I was a Member of the House I introduced \nlegislation with a whole lot of support to develop a separate index for \nseniors. Be that as it may, where we are right now is that the Social \nSecurity Administration will announce tomorrow a zero COLA.\n  I have some very good news. I have introduced legislation, and I and \na number of us have urged the President to be cognizant of the fact \nthat in the midst of this terrible economic recession, we just cannot \nturn our back on seniors. Many seniors are not only paying increased \ncosts for prescription drugs and for their health care needs, they have \nseen a decline in their pensions. They have seen a significant decline, \nin many cases, in the value of their homes. Some have lost their \npensions. Basically, we cannot say to them right now that we are not \ngoing to reach out and try to help you in whatever way we can.\n  I am very happy to announce that just this afternoon, President Obama \nwill be supporting support for senior citizens. He will be supporting a \n$250 payment to disabled veterans and those people who are on Social \nSecurity, some 50 million Americans in all. I applaud the President for \nnot turning his back on seniors.\n  In his announcement, the President says:\n\n       Even as we seek to bring about recovery, we must act on \n     behalf of those hardest hit by this recession. That is why I \n     am announcing my support for an additional $250 in emergency \n     recovery assistance to seniors, veterans, and people with \n     disabilities to help them make it through these difficult \n     times. These payments will provide aid to more than 50 \n     million people in the coming year, relief that will not only \n     make a difference for them, but for our economy as a whole, \n     complementing the tax cuts we've provided working families \n     and small businesses through the Recovery Act.\n\n  That is the statement President Obama is about to release. I thank \nthe President for his support.\n  Obviously, the ball now comes to our court, and we have to move it \nforward. I think that in these hard times, when so many seniors are \nworried about how they are going to pay for their medicine, how they \nare going to pay for their health care, how they are going to pay to \nheat their homes in the wintertime, how they are going to take care of \nother basic needs, it is absolutely imperative we not forget about \nthem.\n  I applaud the President for his action, and I look forward to working \nwith Members of Congress to pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        In Praise of Zalmai Azmi\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise once again to recognize the \nservice of one of America's great Federal employees.\n  This Monday, Americans across the country marked Columbus Day. It is \na day that holds different meanings for different communities. I had \nsuch a meaningful experience attending the Columbus Day Mass and \nbreakfast at St. Anthony's of Padua in Wilmington. I know in the \nItalian-American community, Columbus Day is a vibrant cultural \ncelebration. But Columbus Day, above all, reminds us all that America \nis a patchwork; that we are--in the words etched on the wall behind \nyou, Madam President--one Nation from many. This has always been a \nsource of great strength for our country.\n  This is as true for our Federal workforce as it is for America as a \nwhole. So many of our outstanding civil servants were not born in the \nUnited States. Some came as students and found in America jobs and a \nnew home. Others came as infants, carried onto airplanes in the arms of \nloving parents seeking a new beginning for their families. Some \ntraveled halfway around the world driven by the dream of a better life. \nOthers braved the short but perilous journey over turbulent waves \nfueled only by the hope of freedom on our shores. The diversity of our \nNation is reflected in the diversity of those who choose to serve it.\n  The Federal employee I am recognizing this week has had a \ndistinguished career in the Department of Justice, both in the \nExecutive Office for U.S. Attorneys and at the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation.\n  Zalmai Azmi was 14 years old when he fled with his family from \nAfghanistan. He arrived in the United States speaking very little \nEnglish, and he became fluent while in high school. Zalmai, wishing to \ngive back to the Nation which gave him refuge, eventually joined the \nMarine Corps. He served in the corps for 7 years as a communications \nand intelligence specialist, and he also trained in special operations. \nWhile in the Marines, Zalmai studied computer science, and he later \nobtained a bachelor's degree in the field from the American University \nand a master's from George Washington University.\n  In the 1990s, Zalmai continued his Federal career by moving from the \nmilitary into the civil service. He was working as chief information \nofficer for the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys when the September \n11 attacks occurred. Zalmai helped implement the Justice Department's \ncontinuity of operations emergency plan, and by September 12, he was at \nGround Zero in New York setting up departmental field offices.\n  Just weeks after the attacks, he volunteered to be dropped into \nAfghanistan as part of a Marines special operations team. In the 2 \nyears that followed, Zalmai, who is fluent in Dari, Farsi, and Pashto, \nserved two tours of duty in Afghanistan. While at home, he was detailed \nto the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.\n  In 2004, FBI Director Robert Mueller appointed him as the Bureau's \nChief Information Officer. In that role, Zalmai led the effort to \nrevamp the FBI's virtual case file system and helped transform its IT \ninfrastructure to meet the needs of a post-9/11 environment.\n  He was honored with the prestigious Arthur S. Fleming Award for \nApplied Science and Technology in 2002, which is presented annually to \nan outstanding public servant. Additionally, he won the Distinguished \nPresidential Rank Award.\n  Zalmai retired from the FBI late last year. His story, while unique, \nis reflective of the commitment to service and patriotism embodied by \nall of the immigrants who work in government and serve in our military. \nJust as America would not be as strong without our great Federal \nemployees, that workforce would not be as vibrant or successful without \nthose who, like Zalmai, came to this country from other lands.\n  I hope all my colleagues will join me in honoring his service, that \nof the men and women in the Department of Justice, and all immigrants \nwho work in the Federal Government.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I wish to speak about the conference \nreport we are currently discussing, but I want to first take a second \nto commend the Senator from Delaware for his fine effort over these \nmany months to continue to call to the attention of America wonderful \npeople who have committed their life to make the lives of other \nAmericans better. He has done a wonderful job, and this is just one \nmore example of both the Senator's job of bringing the news to all of \nAmerica but also the story of a wonderful individual who has committed \nhis life to improving our great Nation.\n  Madam President, I would like to spend a moment thanking the Senators \nfrom North Dakota and from Utah for their hard work on this bill we are \ncurrently considering. It represents a truly bipartisan effort. The \nenergy investments in this bill will foster technological innovations \nand will harness the creativity and hard work of the American people. I \nbelieve it will help us move forward on clean coal technology. It will \nalso promote energy efficiency and accelerate research into renewable \nenergy.\n  I want to highlight one issue in particular, if I could, and it deals \nwith our domestic uranium production. The uranium industry provides \ngood-paying jobs across the country, and certainly good-paying jobs in \nWyoming. A strong uranium workforce is essential to expanding America's \nnuclear energy capacity. Uranium production means American jobs and \nAmerican energy.\n  In August, the Department of Energy proposed transferring--\ntransferring--a significant amount of uranium to the U.S. Enrichment \nCorporation. The uranium transfer was designed and intended to pay for \nan environmental cleanup at a facility in Portsmouth, OH.\n\n  This is a laudable goal. Unfortunately, the proposal of the \nDepartment of Energy would have serious unintended consequences. The \nproposed transfer would flood the uranium market, artificially forcing \ndown spot prices for uranium, and create significant uncertainty in the \nmarketplace. This action would have a devastating impact on domestic \nuranium mining. It would cost plenty of jobs in my home State of \nWyoming but also jobs all across the United States. It would undercut \nan integral part of America's energy portfolio.\n  The Department's plan, in my opinion, is shortsighted and lacks \ncommon sense. Why create jobs in one State by killing jobs in another \nState? The environmental cleanup can be accomplished without hurting \njobs in Wyoming and elsewhere.\n  The conferees recognized the problems with the proposal of the \nDepartment of Energy. The conference report directs the Government \nAccountability Office to evaluate the Department's management of its \nexcess uranium supplies. The bill increases funding for the Portsmouth \nfacility and the cleanup. These steps provide the opportunity to \naddress the necessary environmental cleanup issue without causing the \ncollateral damage in other States.\n  So I thank the Senators from North Dakota and Utah for their work to \naddress this problem. The Department of Energy should rethink its \nuranium transfer proposal. By working within the framework of the \nExcess Uranium Management Plan, the Department can get maximum value \nfor its uranium and fund the cleanup of Portsmouth without hurting \njobs--good jobs--in other States.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative \nclerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we take up the conference report to \naccompany the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water appropriations bill, it \nspends approximately $33.9 billion. Let's not forget Congress has \nalready appropriated over $92 billion to energy and water-related \nprojects between the emergency appropriations provided in the 2009 \nsupplemental, the continuing resolution, and the stimulus bill.\n  Equally as important is what this bill doesn't fund. The bill \nprovides only $197 million for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste \nrepository, putting this project on life support.\n  The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars and decades \nstudying the suitability of Yucca Mountain as the Nation's repository \nfor spent nuclear fuel and defense waste. Consistently, the science has \nborne out that Yucca Mountain is the best site to dispose of nuclear \nwaste. The President has made a point of telling all who would listen \nthat his administration would be guided by science and not politics. At \nthe same time, the President and the Secretary of Energy are saying \nthat Yucca Mountain is no longer an option, even though science has \nproven that Yucca is safe.\n  The fact that this administration has political problems with moving \nforward with the Yucca Mountain storage facility doesn't change the \nfact that the government has a legal obligation to take this spent \nwaste and that the licensing process is already underway. Shelving the \nYucca Mountain facility will slow the deployment of new nuclear \ngenerating facilities, constrain our most abundant clean energy source, \nand hinder efforts to combat climate change.\n  The conference report that accompanies this bill contains 1,116 \ncongressionally directed spending items--a fancy term for earmarks, \nwhich is a fancy term for porkbarrel spending, which is a fancy term \nfor corruption--totalling over $1.05 billion and almost doubling the \nnumber of earmarks that were included in the Senate-approved bill. Get \nthat: 1,116 earmarks in this bill--over a $1 billion.\n  I know that is not much when we consider we have already run up a $9 \ntrillion deficit over the next 9 years, but a lot of Americans would be \nsurprised and think it is a fair amount of money.\n  None of these projects were requested by the administration. Many of \nthem were not authorized or competitively bid in any way. No hearing \nwas held to judge whether or not these were national priorities worthy \nof scarce taxpayer's dollars. They are in this bill for one reason and \none reason only--because of the self serving prerogatives of a select \nfew members of the Senate--almost all of whom serve on the \nAppropriations Committee. Sadly, these Members chose to serve their own \ninterests over those of the American taxpayer.\n  During Senate consideration of this bill I filed 24 amendments to \nstrike these earmarks. The American people are tired of this process, \nand they are tired of watching their hard-earned money go down the \ndrain. Not surprisingly, my amendments were defeated at every turn by \nappropriators and Members on the other side of the aisle.\n  ``Here are some examples of the earmarks contained in this bill: $2 \nmillion for the Algae Biofuels Research, WA; $750,000 for the Algae to \nEthanol Research and Evaluation, NJ; $1.2 million for the Alternative \nEnergy School of the Future, NV; $6 million for the Hawaii Energy \nSustainability Program, HI; $6 million for the Hawaii Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Venture, HI; $2.25 million for the Montana Bio-Energy \nCenter of Excellence, MT; $10 million for the Sustainable Energy \nResearch Center, MS; $450,000 for the Vermont Energy Investment \nCorporation, VT; $1.2 million for the Hydrogen Fuel Dispensing Station, \nWV; $1.25 million for the Long Term Environmental and Economic Impacts \nof the Development of a Coal Liquefaction Sector in China, WV; $1 \nmillion for the Alaska Climate Center, AK; $5 million for the Computing \nCapability, ND--whatever that is; $1 million for the Performance \nAssessment Institute, NV; $1 million for the New School Green Building, \nNY.\n  This bill also includes a $106 million increase in funding over the \nPresident's request for hydrogen fuel cell research. The Secretary of \nEnergy had pushed for the elimination of this funding but has since \nchanged his mind after bullying from Senate appropriators. Before his \nchange of heart, Dr. Chu explained his reasoning for cutting the \nfunding by stating, ``We asked ourselves, `Is it likely in the next 10 \nor 15, 20 years that we will convert to a hydrogen car economy?' The \nanswer, we felt, was no.'' Unfortunately, Dr. Chu caved to demands and \nhas decided to no\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nlonger object to funding research investments that many call a ``dead \nend.''\n  This bill dedicates $5.3 billion to the Army Corps civil works \nprogram, which is $180 million higher than the President's request. As \nmy colleagues know, the Corps is burdened with a $60 billion backlog as \na result of years of abusing the energy and water appropriations bills \nand the Water Resources Development Acts as hot tickets for loading up \nnew pet projects. As one would expect, this year's appropriations \nprocess was no different from previous years as the Senate \nAppropriations Committee received 256 requests to fund new projects. \nImagine our surprise when we learned that the committee rejected every \nsingle one of these requests for funding new projects--a nod, albeit a \nmodest one, to the tenets of fiscal responsibility.\n  While I applaud appropriators for attempting, in a way, to address \nour current backlog, we can't deny that our system for funding existing \nCorps projects is not working. Currently, there is no way to know which \nprojects warrant taxpayer dollars because the Corps refuses to give \nCongress any kind of idea of what it views as national priorities. In \nfact, even when Congress specifically requests a list the Corps' top \npriorities, they are unable to provide them. That leaves it up to \npoliticians on Capitol Hill to blindly throw money at flood control, \nhurricane protection, navigation and environmental restoration \nprojects--in some cases matters of life or death--without knowing which \nprojects may or may not benefit the larger good. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to do better.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now, more than ever, we prioritize our Federal \nspending. But our appropriations bills do not always put our national \npriorities first. It is abundantly clear that the time has come for us \nto eliminate the corrupt, wasteful practice of earmarking. We have made \nsome progress on the issue in the past couple of years, but we have not \ngone far enough. Legislation we passed in 2007 provided for greater \ndisclosure of earmarks. While that was a good step forward, the bottom \nline is that we don't simply need more disclosure of earmarks--we need \nto eliminate them all together.\n  The time has come to get serious about how we are spending \nhardworking American's tax dollars and there is no better way to prove \nwe're serious than by ending the wasteful practice of earmarking funds \nin the appropriations bills. The process is broken and it is long \noverdue to be fixed.''\n  Madam President, we are here in this postcloture motion period, \nconsuming it because of the simple fact that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhad an amendment which required greater transparency. The Senator from \nOklahoma, while wanting a recorded vote, was assured by the managers of \nthe bill that a transparency provision would be added to the final \nconference report which would then be passed by both Houses of Congress \nand for the President's signature. Unaccountably, that provision, which \nwas simple transparency so that all Members of the Senate would know \nwhat information the Senate appropriators received, would be shared by \nall, was dropped in conference. Understandably, the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn, whom I view in many ways as the conscience of \nthis body, is upset and concerned that the American people--much less \nnow their Representatives--are not able to obtain information which is \nobviously very important in the decisionmaking process that goes on \nhere.\n  It is unfortunate and it shows, again, what has happened here in the \nprocess of legislation, that the Appropriations Committee now seems to \noverride not only the wishes of the American people with projects such \nas those I outlined but also even the other Members of the Senate.\n  The good news, probably, for Members of the body and for the citizens \nof this country--but bad news for the appropriators--is that we will be \nback. We will be back again and again and again. The American people \nall over this country are having tea parties, they are having \nuprisings. They know the debt and deficit that we have laid on future \ngenerations of Americans and they are not going to stand for it. They \nare going to find out whether we need to spend $450,000 for the Vermont \nenergy investment corporation; whether we need $1 million for a \nperformance assessment institute in Nevada; and whether we need to \nspend $1 million for the new school green building in New York, not to \nmention all those projects that abound that will send our tax dollars \nto the State of Hawaii as well as Mississippi.\n  I can warn my colleagues again, we will be back. We will be back. We \nwill talk not only here on the floor of the Senate but across this \ncountry about this egregious practice of the waste of their taxpayers' \ndollars, of their hard-earned dollars, and the way this earmark and \npork-barreling process is still completely out of control and a \ndisgrace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr BENNET. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a development \nfolks in the southeastern corner of my State have been waiting on for \nthe better part of 47 years. This week, maybe even today, thanks in \nlarge part to the advocacy of our partners at both the local and \nFederal levels, the vision of the Arkansas Valley Conduit--long a \npriority of rural communities in my State--moves one significant step \ncloser to reality. Today, we will send a bill to the President that \nfinally funds this important water project that represents the best of \nregional government, with multiple communities cooperating for the \ngreater good.\n  Our success today owes to the support of many who took it upon \nthemselves at one time or another to move this project forward. In \nparticular I would like to thank Congressman John Salazar, a good \nfriend and tremendous leader who has championed this project since his \nfirst days in office.\n  The effort to build the conduit has been a journey that has its \norigins in post-World War II America, a time when members of ``the \nGreatest Generation'' were coming home to raise a family, plan their \nlives and build a new America with the same energy that they used to \nsave it on the battlefield.\n  In the Arkansas River Valley, enthusiasm for the future was also \nhigh, but their enthusiasm was soon tempered by one significant \nlimitation: the water needed to build and sustain that future was in \nshort supply.\n  Yet geographic limitations were no match for the resilience and \ndetermination of the valley's residents. They came together and crafted \na plan to satisfy the water needs of the valley's ranchers, farmers and \nrural communities.\n  The project came to be known by proponents and detractors alike as \nthe Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. After a long and sometimes bitter \nbattle, the project was authorized and signed into law by President \nJohn F. Kennedy in August of 1962.\n  The Arkansas Valley Conduit was a key piece of the Fryingpan-Arkansas \nProject. The vision was simple: deliver clean drinking water to 40 \nranching and farming communities of the lower Arkansas Valley.\n  As the years went by, that vision developed. Civic leaders and \ncitizens came together to call for a water delivery system to bring the \nWest's scarcest natural resource to over 40 communities, across a 140-\nmile stretch of southeastern Colorado.\n  Unfortunately, the resources necessary to put that plan into place \ndid not advance with the larger plan. While other parts of the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project moved forward, the Arkansas Valley Conduit \nlanguished and doubts began to grow about whether the Federal \nGovernment would ever live up to its part of the bargain.\n  Earlier this year, my predecessor, Senator Salazar and Colorado's now \nsenior Senator, Mark Udall, gave the conduit the jumpstart it needed by \nintroducing legislation authorizing a Federal cost-share for the \nproject.\n  After visiting southeast Colorado upon my appointment to the Senate, \nI immediately lent my strong support to the project and cosponsor this \nimportant legislation. I believe you would be hard pressed to find many \nbills that have the support of three Senators from the same State \nduring one session of Congress.\n  With that support, as well as the strong support and leadership of \nRepresentatives John Salazar and Betsy\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nMarkey, Congress authorized the Arkansas Valley Conduit in the Omnibus \nPublic Land Management Act, which was signed by the President in March \nof this year.\n  Unfortunately, this authorization did not happen in time for funding \nto be included in the administration's budget request for fiscal year \n2010.\n  Our team advocated as strongly as we knew how for the conduit. And I \ncan tell you, that after communicating how important this project is to \nthe people of my State on many, many occasions, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, soon emerged as a \ncommitted partner in the effort.\n  Let me say that the people of Colorado have a good friend in the \nSenator of North Dakota, and that the people of his State have a \ntremendously capable person representing their needs.\n  I am pleased that Senator Dorgan and his partners on the subcommittee \nconsidered the conduit along with many, many worthy requests nationwide \nand determined that $5 million of Federal resources was what could get \nthis project off to a promising start.\n  This first round of funding will be used for environmental analysis, \nplanning, and design. The final project will enable these communities--\nall of which have average incomes well below the national average--to \ncomply with Federal drinking water standards.\n  I hope that it is just a matter of years--not decades--before the \npeople of the lower Arkansas Valley have a conduit to call their own.\n  When President Kennedy traveled to Pueblo to sign the bill \nauthorizing the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, he proclaimed it ``an \ninvestment in the future of this country, an investment that will repay \nlarge dividends.''\n  ``It is an investment in the growth of the West,'' he continued, ``in \nthe new cities and industries which this project helps make possible.''\n  Today, for the first time in 47 years, we recommit to making that \ninvestment in earnest. Today, we begin the difficult, but long overdue \ntask of building a brighter, stronger future for generations of \nArkansas River Valley residents to come.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The Public Option\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, for almost 100 years, Washington has \nbeen wrestling with the complicated question of health care reform. On \nsome points, we have broad consensus. Costs are up. Health outcomes are \ndown. Our system is broken. Americans deserve better.\n  We are faced with a crisis that breaks businesses, bankrupts \nfamilies, and leaves millions of hard-working Americans out in the \ncold. This is why we must not fail in our efforts to make reform a \nreality. That is why we need to include a public option in our reform \npackage--to foster competition, reduce costs, and extend quality care \nto tens of millions of Americans. I believe a public option is the only \nway we can accomplish these objectives. That is why I will not vote for \nany health care bill that does not include a public option. I believe \nthe American people overwhelmingly support our efforts.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support our efforts, but not \neveryone agrees we need meaningful reform. There are some who seem \nsatisfied with the status quo. For example, between 2000 and 2007, \nprofits for America's top 10 insurance companies grew by an average \nrate of 428 percent. While the rest of us suffer the effects of a \nrecession, these corporations hold American families and businesses in \na vice grip, and they are squeezing them for extraordinary profits. Of \ncourse, they oppose any measure that would make them compete with a \nnot-for-profit public plan. Of course, they want to maintain their \nvirtual monopoly over the health insurance industry. In Illinois, two \ncompanies control 69 percent of the market. People don't have a real \nchoice anymore. This is simply unacceptable. We need the competition \nand accountability a public option would provide.\n  Insurance giants have done everything they can to block such a plan. \nThat is why I was surprised to see the study released this weekend by \nan insurance trade group called America's Health Insurance Plans. On \nthe surface, it looks like the same twisting of facts, the same scare \ntactics and disinformation we have seen since the beginning of the \ndebate. For instance, our opponents contend that the government wants \nto take over health care and create death panels. These claims have \nbeen debunked many times. In much the same way, this new industry study \nclaims health care reform will drive costs up instead of down. They say \nthe Senate Finance Committee bill would cost an average family an \nadditional $4,000 over the next 10 years.\n  But, as the committee has made clear, this analysis is fundamentally \nflawed. The study overlooked key parts of the bill in order to produce \nskewed numbers designed to deceive the American people. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, the company that conducted the study for the \ninsurance agents, freely admitted this data was deceptive and \nincomplete. I quote:\n\n       The reform packages under consideration have other \n     provisions that we have not included in this analysis . . . \n     [and] if other provisions in healthcare reform are successful \n     in lowering costs over the long term, those improvements \n     would offset some of the impacts we have estimated.\n\n  According to the very people who performed the study, it is deeply \nflawed.\n  This is the same tired rhetoric we have seen time and again from \nthose who stand to profit from our broken system. By itself, I would \nsay this new round of disinformation is hardly surprising. But in the \ncontext of our current debate, I believe opponents of reform have \nactually hurt their cause.\n  So let's take another look at the study. It actually lays out a \nstrong case in favor of a public option. By releasing the study, these \ninsurance giants are saying the Finance Committee bill does not do \nenough to contain cost. They are warning us that unless we provide \nAmericans with a public option that can compete with private companies, \nthese companies will raise their rates by 111 percent. That is what \nthis study really means. It was meant to be a hatchet job, but instead \nit has reinforced the need for real competition and cost containment in \nthe insurance industry.\n  The need for a public option is as plain as day. Over the last \ncentury, Presidents from Roosevelt to Truman to Clinton to Obama have \nlaid out a strong case for reform. Legislators on both sides of the \naisle have spoken out on this issue.\n  This weekend, the insurance giants finally tipped their hand. In \ntheir rush to discredit health care reform, these corporations \ninadvertently laid out a strong case for the kinds of reforms I have \nbeen talking about for months. They tried to threaten the American \npeople with higher premiums so they can maintain their out-of-control \nprofits. But we will not fall for their tricks--not this time, not \nanymore. This study proves that the insurance industry will stop at \nnothing to block reform. The only way to keep them in check is by \nrestoring real competition and choice in the insurance market. That is \na strong argument in favor of a public option. It is an argument some \nof us have been trying to make for several months.\n  Last Friday, I was proud to join 29 other Senators to sign a letter \nin support of a public option. My colleagues and I know the American \npeople deserve nothing less than meaningful reform that only a public \noption can provide. I never guessed the insurance industry would \nactually help us make the case.\n  After a century of inaction, the momentum is finally building. Real \nhealth care reform is almost within our reach, and we must not stop \nnow. Yesterday, my colleagues on the Finance Committee voted out their \nversion of a reform bill. I congratulate them on reaching this \nmilestone. This is the farthest any such bill has ever gotten. But \nthere is much work left to do. Before we take up this legislation on \nthe Senate floor, we need to merge the Finance bill with the HELP \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nversion, and we need to make sure the combined bill includes a public \noption.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to shape the final \nlegislation. It is time for us to come together on the side of the \nAmerican people. It is time to deliver on the promise Teddy Roosevelt \nmade almost 100 years ago. It is time for health care reform that \nincludes a public option.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I speak, Madam President, from my text, this \nyear, for the most part, I haven't spoken on the Senate floor much on \nhealth care reform because so much of this period of time I have either \nbeen in consultation with Chairman Baucus or with what has been called \nthe Group of 6, three Republicans and three Democrats, trying to \nnegotiate a bipartisan health care reform package. I didn't speak \nduring that period on the floor because in intense negotiations, you \ncan say things sometimes that might upset the negotiations. I didn't \nwant to do anything to do that. I want people to know that those \nnegotiations, obviously, were not fruitful in the end because the \nleadership and the White House thought they had gone on long enough and \nthat we ought to move ahead. I am not sure that was to Chairman \nBaucus's liking because I think he was comfortable thinking we could \nget to a bipartisan negotiation. Everybody in the Group of 6 wanted to. \nBut, of course, they came to an end. Then, of course, it took a \npartisan approach from that point on.\n  I want everybody to know, though, that during that period of talks we \nhad in the Group of 6 and what Senator Baucus and I were doing \nindividually, it ended in a way that was congenial in the sense that up \nto that point everything was moving along, and during the 2- or 3-month \nperiod of time we were negotiating, there was never a period that \nanybody walked away from the table. There was never a period that there \nwas ever a harsh word. There was a sincere effort during all that time \nto reach a bipartisan agreement. I am sorry that didn't materialize, \nbut I have no regrets that I participated in the process because you \nnever know, you take it a day at a time around here. You never know, it \ncould be very fruitful. And if it had been fruitful, it probably would \nhave been better for this process in the Congress and better for the \ncountry as a whole.\n  For sure, this issue of health care reform is, in a sense, \nredirecting one-sixth of the economy because $1 out of every $6 spent \nin America involves health care. Of course, the issue of health care \nitself is a life-or-death situation with every American. That is what \nhealth care implies. Never before has Congress done stuff so \nencompassing and affecting such a large segment of the economy.\n\n  So in the process of 6 months of negotiation on health care reform, I \nfeel much better informed about health care than I otherwise would have \nbeen, and I want to thank Senator Baucus for his patience in \nnegotiating that and for every courtesy he gave to me and Senator Enzi \nand the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe.\n  (Mr. BURRIS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the bill is now out of the Senate \nFinance Committee. I commend the chairman for bringing the markup to \nwhere it was yesterday. It seems a long time since we started that \nmarkup on September 22. We have been able to air our differences, and \nwe have been able to have votes. I think Senator Baucus tallied up 61 \ndifferent rollcall votes we had during that 7- or 8-day period of time.\n  I would have to say to my colleagues in the Senate, I wish I felt \nbetter about the substance of the bill and would not have had to vote \nno. The chairman's mark underwent many changes during the process since \nthe bipartisan talks ended, and I think the changes that happened since \nthen are not for the good. I want to highlight a few of the changes I \nfind most disturbing. As I highlight these issues, it will be clear \nthat this bill is already sliding rapidly down the slippery slope to \nmore and more government control of health care.\n  It has been the biggest expansion of Medicaid since it was created in \n1965, and I think that is going to add up to 11 million more people \nbeing on Medicare.\n  It imposes an unprecedented Federal mandate for coverage backed by \nthe enforcement authority of the Internal Revenue Service. I could put \nthat another way as well: In the 225-year history of our country, never \nonce, to my knowledge--and I would be glad to be informed if I am wrong \non this, but the Federal Government has never said any citizen in this \ncountry, anytime in that 225-year history of our country, has ever had \nto buy anything. They do not tell you what you have to buy or not buy. \nYou make a consumer choice.\n  So for the first time in the history of our country, enforced by the \npower of the Internal Revenue Service, people are going to have to buy \nhealth insurance. And if they do not buy health insurance, a family is \ngoing to be fined $1,500.\n  Additionally, it increases the size of government by at least $1.8 \ntrillion when it is fully implemented. I want to emphasize ``fully \nimplemented'' because right now we would read the papers as saying it \nis $820-some billion and fully paid for, et cetera, et cetera. But this \nprogram really does not start until 2013. Oh, the taxes and the \nincrease in premiums will start more immediately, but the program does \nnot take off until 2013. If we figure 2013 to 2023 as the 10-year \nwindow, at that particular time--being fully implemented--$1.8 \ntrillion.\n  Additionally, it gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \npower to define benefits for every private plan in America and to \nredefine those benefits annually. That is a lot of power over people's \nhealth insurance and over people's lives.\n  Further, it will cause health care premiums for millions to go up, \nnot down. It tightens further the new Federal rating bands for \ninsurance rates. That means millions who are expecting lower costs as a \nresult of health reform will end up paying more in the form of higher \npremiums. The new rating reforms alone will raise premiums by as much \nas 50 percent on millions, particularly in those States where there is \nnot a lot of regulation of insurance and requirements on insurance.\n  I would say in regard to premiums going up, I will bet most of the 85 \npercent of the people out there who have private health insurance--we \nare talking about health insurance reform--that one of the things they \nwould expect is that we would not have these big increases in premiums, \nas has happened over the last 10 years--terrible increases in premiums. \nRight now, we have the Congressional Budget Office and CBO saying that \npremiums are going to go up.\n  Part of this is because it is going to impose new fees, but it also \nhas increases in taxes. These new fees and taxes will total about a \nhalf trillion dollars over the next few years. On the front end, these \nfees and taxes will cause premium increases as early as 2010, even \nbefore most of the reforms take place.\n  So let me say that a second time but yet another way: By saying that, \na lot of the increases in revenue coming into the Federal Treasury or \nthe money that is going to be saved in certain programs that is going \nto help pay for some of those start next year, but the benefits from \nthe program and the policy does not kick in until the year 2013. So one \nof the reasons we can say it is revenue neutral is from the standpoint \nthat there are 10 years of revenue or savings but only 6 years of \npolicy costs that are there.\n  Then, of course, after making health premiums go up, this bill makes \nit mandatory to buy that insurance. That is what I previously referred \nto as the first time in American history--the first time in American \nhistory--the Federal Government has said we had to buy anything.\n  On several occasions, Republicans tried to take the chairman's mark \nin a different direction. We tried to ensure that the President's \npledge to not tax middle-income families or tax seniors or veterans or \nchange seniors' and veterans' programs was carried out. We were \nrebuffed every step of the way.\n  Republican efforts to provide consumers with lower cost benefit \noptions were consistently defeated. This means that despite these \npromises, a lot of people are not actually going to be able to ``keep \nwhat they have.'' We heard\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\nthe President say that during the campaign, and we heard the President \nsay that in September when he gave an address to a joint session of \nCongress.\n  It imposes higher premiums for prescription drug coverage on seniors \nand the disabled, it creates a new Medicare Commission with broad \nauthority to make further cuts in Medicare, and it makes that \nCommission permanent.\n  In our Group of 6 negotiations--which I said broke up when the White \nHouse decided it was taking too long to do things right because they \nwanted to do it right now--during our Group of 6 negotiations, I \nresisted making the Commission permanent. I certainly was not going to \nagree to target prescription drug premiums. But this bill now requires \nthe Medicare Commission to continue making cuts to Medicare forever. \nThe damage this group of unelected people could do to Medicare is very \nunknown. In fact, we will not know for quite a few years because it \ndoes not even start operation until the year 2014, as I recall.\n  What is more alarming is so many providers got exempted from the cuts \nthis Commission would make that it forces the cuts to fall on those who \nare covered, to fall directly, more so, on seniors and the disabled.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the Commission \nstructure requires it to focus its budget axe on the premiums seniors \npay for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and for Medicare \nAdvantage. Sooner or later, it has to be acknowledged that by making \nthe Commission permanent, those savings are coming from more and more \ncuts to Medicare.\n  Finally, I cannot help but note the incredible cynicism in an \namendment that took benefits away from children. That amendment was \noffered and passed because the chairman's mark had the audacity to let \nchildren get covered through private insurance where, of course, there \nis a great deal of choice. In 41 States, children would have received \naccess to a program that is called the EPSDT benefit--basically \ndiagnostic services. These benefits cover vitally needed services for \nchildren such as rehabilitation services, physical, occupational, and \nspeech therapy, particularly for children with developmental diseases.\n  But those benefits were deleted by Rockefeller amendment No. C21. Now \nchildren in 41 States will not have access to health care, and they \nwill be left in a grossly underfunded public program. They lost these \nimportant benefits.\n  What this mark has shown is that there is a clear and significant \nphilosophical difference between the two sides. Throughout this markup, \nwe have focused on trying to reduce the overall cost of the bill. We \nwere told, flatout, no.\n  We focused on trying to reduce the pervasive role of government in \nthe chairman's mark. We were told, flatout, no.\n  We tried to make it harder for illegal immigrants to get benefits. We \nwere told, flatout, no.\n  We tried to guarantee that Federal funding for abortions would not be \nallowed under this bill. We were told, flatout, no.\n  We tried to allow alternatives to the individual mandate and also to \nthe harsh penalties associated with that part of the bill that requires \neverybody, for the first time in the 225-year history of this country, \nto buy something that maybe they do not want to buy. We were told, \nflatout, no.\n  We tried to reward States with extra Medicaid dollars if they passed \nmedical malpractice reform. We were told not just no, but, shockingly, \nwe were told Medicaid is not even in the committee's jurisdiction.\n  We have watched while the other side has expanded public coverage. We \nsaw Democratic amendments move millions from private coverage to public \ncoverage. We saw Democratic amendments create new government programs \nthat cover families making close to, would you believe it, $90,000 a \nyear.\n  At the end of the day, after raising billions in new taxes and \ncutting hundreds of billions from Medicare and imposing stiff new \npenalties for people who do not buy insurance and increasing costs to \nthose who do, we still have 25 million people who are going to be \nuninsured.\n  I do not think this is what the American people had in mind when we \npromised to fix the health care system. As I said when this process \nstarted, the chairman's mark that was released 27 days ago was an \nincomplete but comprehensive, good-faith attempt to reach a bipartisan \nagreement. But then the modifications pulled that attempt at bipartisan \ncompromise very far toward a partisan approach on several key issues.\n  With this markup being completed yesterday, we can now see clearly \nthat the bill continues its march leftward. The broad bipartisan \ncharacter of the reform proposals have very dramatically changed. This \npartisan change is precisely what Republicans feared would have \noccurred at the later stages in the legislative process. Today, as we \nsaw yesterday, we see that those fears that were expressed when the \nbipartisan process ended were legitimate, and we now see they were \njustified. The product proves that justification.\n\n  Nevertheless, I want people to know I still hope that at some point \nthe doorway to bipartisanship will be opened once again. That might \nhappen because I have read in the newspapers, and I guess I have talked \nto one of the Senators who is involved in promoting a great deal of \ntransparency in this process--making sure things are on the Internet \nfor 72 hours before we take up the bill; making sure it is paid for or \nat least we have a CBO score--maybe there is a chance there are enough \nDemocrats out there who have some questions about the movement of this \nbill leftward that we would be able to have that doorway to \nbipartisanship opened again.\n  I also hope that at some point the White House and leadership will \nwant to correct the mistake they made by ending our collaborative \nbipartisan work. I hope, at some point, they will want to let that \nbipartisan work begin again. Then they need to go back to that effort \nand give it the time needed to get it right instead of getting it done \nright now. I am open to that. I hope to speak to people on the other \nside of the aisle about that process moving forward because, here \nagain, I get back to something I heard Senator Baucus probably say \nfirst, but I totally agree with him. It was said many months ago, and I \nthink Senator Baucus still believes it. We may not be in a process that \ngets him to where he said he wanted to go, but something as serious as \nhealth care reform and something as serious as redirecting one-sixth of \nour economy ought to be done on a fairly consensus basis. During the \nprocess of bipartisan talks of the six of us, and even before that when \nSenator Baucus and I were talking one on one, we were talking in terms \nof getting a bill that 75 to 80 people would support in this body \nbecause of the significance of the issue we are dealing with: \nRedirecting one-sixth of the economy. At the same time, the words \n``health care'' imply life or death. It affects the lives of all 306 \nmillion Americans who are here. It is clear that yesterday was not the \nday when that was going to happen, but you take a day at a time around \nhere.\n  I think, eventually in this city, right wins out. Maybe not always. \nMaybe some people would think Chuck Grassley by saying that is very \nnaive about the process, but there is something about ``I believe,'' \nand I believe in the process of democracy. I think we saw that at work \nin the last several months. I am not referring to the raucous things we \nsaw on television that went on in town meetings. I only saw the ones \nthat went on in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Missouri; maybe they went \non elsewhere. The town meetings we had in my State of Iowa were not \nraucous. Everybody was able to speak their piece. In every instance, I \nwas asked a question, I was given the opportunity to answer it. I saw \nsome of my colleagues not even being able to control their respective \ntown meetings. It wasn't that way in my State. But I say this process, \nwhether it is raucous or whether it is more civilized, is a process of \nrepresentative government. I think the people of this country now have \nabout a month to weigh in on this issue, both from those who want a \nsingle payer yet, those who want public option yet, and for those who \nthink things ought to be done in an incremental way; and people who \nthink we should not have a bill go through here that doesn't take into \nconsideration what to do about the practice of defensive medicine and \ncorrecting that\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\nthrough medical malpractice reform in other words, getting rid of the \nfrivolous lawsuits that get doctors to give patients every test under \nthe Sun because they think that patient may someday sue them.\n  That is just one of many items that people back at the grassroots of \nIowa, and I think the grassroots of America, think we ought to be \ndealing with. Well, there will be a month now to weigh in on these \nthings. There is at least a week or two where we have to have a merging \nof the Senate HELP Committee bill with the Senate Finance Committee \nbill. There is still time, as Speaker Pelosi puts together a bill out \nof three committees in the House. There is an opportunity for democracy \nto work as it has during all the massive amounts of mail we are getting \nthat we have never gotten before on a single subject and the turnouts \nat our town meetings and the telephone calls that come in. I think \npeople made an impact, and I am suggesting they can make the same \nimpact on health care reform as they made on the stimulus bill. It \ndidn't get quite the results constituents wanted, but I can tell my \ncolleagues that during a 10-day period of time, 5,000 Iowans called my \noffice on the stimulus bill, and during that period of time about 83 \npercent were opposed to the stimulus bill. Those calls were coming in \nfrom all over the country into everybody's office.\n  As my colleagues remember, the Thursday before the Presidents Day \nbreak in February, everybody was being told that constituents would \nhave 72 hours to read the stimulus bill, but an agreement was hastily \nreached that Thursday before that break and the constituents didn't \nhave 72 hours to read that product, because I think the leadership of \nthis body and the White House were reading the grassroots objections to \na $787 billion stimulus bill, and if they waited around for the 72 \nhours for constituents to read it and it laid around over the week-long \nbreak, that it would never have been passed a week later, after the \nMonday of the Presidents Day holiday.\n  So people are listened to. This is an opportunity for the grassroots \nof America to speak up. If they speak up in the same way they did on \nTARP legislation, on stimulus, and they do it on this health care bill, \nit may make an impact. It may surprise people that Washington does \nrespond to the grassroots of America. It may prove to the American \npeople that representative government does work. What is representative \ngovernment all about? It is about those of us who were elected being \none-half of the process of representative government, and it is our \nconstituents who are the other one-half of representative government. \nIf there is no dialogue between constituents and those of us who are \nelected, we don't have representative government.\n  This is an opportunity, over the next month, for representative \ngovernment to work for the people of this country, both for this \nlegislation or people who think this legislation ought to be revised \nbecause I don't think we are going to have anybody calling in saying \neverything in America on health care is OK, but we are going to have a \nlot of people calling in and saying how they think it ought to be done. \nThere will probably be a great deal of disagreement with a bill that \nconstitutes the most massive involvement of health care in the United \nStates since Medicare and Medicaid, with all its taxes and with all its \npremiums going up and all the cuts in Medicare that are going to scare \nthe devil out of our senior citizens, et cetera.\n  I hope people will take notice now that all these bills are out of \ncommittee and they are coming to the floor because this is serious \nbusiness. I hope the American population takes it seriously.\n  I yield the floor. I don't see other colleagues ready to speak, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly. I know we are \ngoing to get a lot of debate on this issue as we go down the road \nrelative to the health care package which was reported out of the \nFinance Committee and the health care package which was reported out of \nthe HELP Committee, of which I am a member, and how they are being \npulled together and what the implications are for health care and for \nAmericans, generally, who are all affected by these bills. This is 16 \npercent of our national economy. There isn't an American who isn't \nimpacted by health care. So when the Congress decides to fundamentally \nchange--and that is what is being proposed--fundamentally change the \nway health care is delivered in this country, it will have an impact on \neveryone and a very significant impact on everyone who has to interface \nwith the health care system in the immediate future.\n  The bill that came out of the committee known as the Kennedy-Dodd \nCommittee at the time, which is now the Harkin committee, which I am a \nmember of, was a bill which basically subscribed to the view of a large \nmajority, I think, of the House Democratic membership and a fairly \nsignificant group of Members on the Democratic side in the Senate, \nwhich essentially said the government should start to take very \nsignificant control over the health care delivery system in this \ncountry.\n  In fact, they would propose a public plan, a plan that would \nbasically put the government allegedly in competition with the private \nsector. But we all know the government isn't a fair competitor, because \nthe government doesn't have to play by the same rules as the private \nsector, and that would put us on a slippery slope toward a single-payer \nsystem or a nationalized system, much like you have in Canada and \nEngland. They have some very severe problems in those countries. There \nisn't a lot of innovation in those nations in the area of health care. \nHealth care isn't of the quality that we have here, and they have \nsignificant delays and, in many instances, actual rationing where \ncertain people cannot get certain treatments because of their age or \nthey don't qualify under the rules that are set up. It is not the type \nof system we want in this country.\n  The purpose of health care reform should be to make health care \ninsurance affordable to everyone, while in the outyears reducing the \nrate of growth of health care costs, and to allow people who have an \ninsurance policy today to keep it. Those are the goals we set off when \nwe stepped into the arena of trying to change the health care delivery \nsystem. Neither the Harkin bill--although it wasn't offered by him, but \nwas offered by Senators Dodd and Kennedy--nor the Baucus bill \naccomplishes any of those three goals. In each of those situations--\ntake, for example, that everybody should have access to affordable \nhealth care. The Harkin bill, as scored by CBO, says that of the 47 \nmillion people who don't have health insurance, approximately 34 \nmillion would still not have it after that bill is fully phased in. The \nbill coming out of the Finance Committee varies and looks as if it is \nin the vicinity of about half of the people who don't have health care \ntoday will still not have it after that bill is phased in. As to the \noutyear costs, neither the Harkin bill nor the Kennedy bill controls \noutyear costs. In fact, the costs go up rather dramatically in the area \nof health care.\n  As to letting people keep their insurance if they like it--no, that \ndoesn't happen either. In fact, large numbers--in the millions, \naccording to CBO--would migrate out of their private system into a \npublic plan because basically the employer would drop their plan. That \nis also true, I believe, of the Baucus plan, although we haven't gotten \na final score on that. When you set penalties for an employer at a \nlevel that says to them it is fiscally prudent for them to pay the \npenalty rather than insure people, many will give up the insurance and \npush people into the subsidized program, called the exchange. Thus, a \nlot of people will lose the insurance they have today.\n  None of the three goals is met by these proposals. What do these \nbills do--especially the Baucus bill, which is\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\nthe center of attention? First, they create a massive expansion of the \nsize of the government. We are a government today that is running a \ndeficit of $1.4 trillion this year. That is three times more than we \nhave ever had in the history of this country--$1.4 trillion, which is \nabout 12 percent of our economy. Historically, deficits have been about \n3 percent of the economy. Today, it is $1.4 trillion or 12 percent of \nour economy. That deficit doesn't come down dramatically. We continue \nto run deficits under the President's plan, prior to this health care \nbill being passed, of approximately $1 trillion a year for the next 10 \nyears. Average deficits over that 10-year period are between 5 and 6 \npercent of GDP, and we take the public debt from 40 percent of the GDP \nup to 80 percent. What do all these numbers mean? They are not just \nnumbers thrown up in the air. They are obligations--debt we are running \nup on our children, because we have a government that is so large today \nthat we cannot afford to pay the bills for it.\n  Almost every economist of any note or credibility says that when you \nrun deficits that exceed 3 percent of GDP for an extended period of \ntime or when you take your public debt from 40 percent to 80 percent of \nGDP, you are basically creating an unsustainable situation--a situation \nwhere you cannot pay the debt, and where your children and our \nchildren's children, who will be subject to these deficits and debts, \nwill end up with a government they cannot afford and which will lead \ninevitably to devaluing the dollar. We are already seeing a reaction to \nthat in the international marketplace, and probably a massive increase \nin the tax burden, which reduces productivity and reduces, therefore, \njob creation.\n  Those are not good scenarios for our kids. It means a lower standard \nof living, less opportunity to buy a home, to send their children to \ncollege, and less opportunity to do what our generation has been able \nto do, because they are having to bear such a burden of the Federal \nGovernment--on top of this government that is, today, already projected \nto run deficits as far as the eye can see of $1 trillion a year, to a \npublic debt that will go from 40 percent to 80 percent of GDP. The \nproposal is that we are going to spend another--when it is fully phased \nin--$1.8 trillion over 10 years on this brandnew entitlement program. \nAnd then the almost laughable--were it not being presented in such a \nway that is claimed to be sincere--proposal is: but we are going to \nreduce the cost of government.\n  A brandnew entitlement will be created, which costs us approximately \n$1.8 trillion over a 10-year period. It scores at $823 billion in the \nfirst 10 years because it is phased in. In the first 4 years, they take \nrevenues in from the bill, but they don't start the program. The \nnumbers are all skewed in the first 10 years. If you look at it in the \n10-year tranche, where the program is fully implemented, it is $1.8 \ntrillion. We are going to create this massive expansion of the size of \ngovernment with these brandnew entitlements being put into place and, \nin the process, grow the government at a rate that it hasn't grown in \nrecent history, taking government from about 20 percent of GDP up to \nabout 23, 24 percent--unsustainable levels--and we claim we are going \nto do it while reducing the cost of government, which is absurd on its \nface.\n  Some would argue that we need to do that in order to take care of \nhealth care, and that this is revenue neutral because, as a practical \nmatter, we have put a cut in Medicare of $400 billion and tax increases \nof $500 billion, and those will pay for this over that 10-year period.\n  What they fail to tell you, of course, is when it is fully \nimplemented, neither the cut in Medicare is large enough, nor are the \ntax increases, to make those numbers. To give them the benefit of the \ndoubt, let's say that this Congress is going to cut Medicare by $400 \nbillion and create a new entitlement for uninsured people--take it from \nseniors and give it to the uninsured people. And this Congress is ready \nto raise taxes by $500 billion. Let's give the benefit of the doubt to \nthe Congress, which I know isn't going to happen because, just 5 years \nago, I was chairman of the Budget Committee and I suggested we reduce \nthe rate of growth of Medicare by about $15 billion, and we could not \nget any votes on the other side of the aisle for that, and now they are \nsuggesting they are going to cut it by $400 billion. That is what is \ncalled ``bait and switch.'' It doesn't happen. This proposal won't \noccur.\n  As a practical matter, giving them the benefit of the doubt and \nsaying they are able to raise close to $1 trillion in new taxes, or \nspending cuts in Medicare, over the next 10 years, recognizing in the \nfollowing 10 years it is not nearly enough, why is that incorrect to \nhave a program if it is paid for? I will tell you why. This government \nis running so much debt to the extent that if we are going to use \nresources like that, we ought to reduce the debt of the country, not \nuse them to create a new program on top of a government that is too \nlarge as it is. We know for a fact--an absolute fact--that Medicare has \na $34 trillion unfunded mandate. Try to think of that. That means we \nknow that we have expenditures in Medicare that will exceed income in \nMedicare by $34 trillion.\n  So why on Earth would we cut Medicare spending by $500 billion, or \n$400 billion, and use that money to create a new program? We should use \nthat money, if we are going to take that action--and some of that \naction is responsible--and use it to make Medicare more solvent. If we \nare going to raise taxes by $500 billion--tax the rich, as the House \nclaims, and they always end up taxing middle-class America, or are we \ngoing to add special fees against special industries, such as the \npharmaceutical, hospital, medical device, and other industries? If we \nare going to do that and assess a penalty on people who don't buy \ninsurance, and we are going to assess small businesses that don't buy \ninsurance a penalty, should we not use that money to reduce the burden \nof the debt of this country as it is being driven by the present health \ncare system, not by adding a brandnew entitlement that absorbs all \nthose resources?\n  There are a lot of ways we can do health care reform here that are \nmuch more responsible than what is being proposed. The recent claim by \nthe White House and Members of the other side is that this bill isn't \ngoing to affect people's premiums at all. The premiums will go up, but \nno more than usual. That is so unbelievable on its face. Think about \nthis. This bill suggests that insurance companies are going to have to \npick up a massive increase in the cost of insuring people because--for \na lot of technical reasons, but basically it sets up a system where not \nenough people will be coming into the insurance pool; a lot will be \nopting out to cover the additional costs, which is going to have to \noccur as a result of the very rich benefits package under this bill and \nthe fact that there is no longer any exclusion. Everybody gets covered \nby insurance. So on the face of it, insurance companies aren't going to \nbe able to absorb those costs. They are going to pass them off to the \npeople who pay the premiums.\n  Then the bill suggests they are going to put another 14 million \npeople under Medicaid--take Medicaid coverage from 100 percent up to \n133 percent of poverty. We already know Medicaid only pays 60 percent \nof the cost of health care. We already know that for the people under \nMedicaid, 40 percent of the cost is being borne by people with private \ninsurance, who are paying for not only the cost of their health care \nbut for the 40 percent of health care costs that are not reimbursed \nunder Medicaid. So when you add another 14 million people, that goes \nonto the premiums of the people in the private sector. Thus, the \npremiums have to go up because they cannot absorb all the costs.\n  Then we know that a large number of people will come into the system \nbut not enough to cover the fact that everybody is going to be required \nto be covered. There is going to be something called ``adverse \nselection,'' where some folks basically buy coverage at the last minute \nbecause they are suddenly finding they are sick and haven't been paying \ninto the pool very long. They will be able to do that under this system \nand, thus, drive up the cost of insurance for everybody else.\n  We know the insurance prices will go up there. We know the premiums \nare going to go up significantly. That is just common sense. Whether \nyou accept the study by the insurance companies or look at what--it is \nlike 1 and 1 makes 2. It is an obvious fact. Then we ought to know \nsomething else. The\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\nhospitals, under this proposal, have agreed to chip in--in order to \nbasically be at the table--for something like $20 billion or $40 \nbillion. The drug companies have agreed to chip in $80 billion. When \nyou add that all up--all of which is passed back to consumers--none of \nthem will absorb all of the costs, and you end up raising the cost of \nhealth care.\n  In the end, people's premiums will go up--people who have private \ninsurance. You might say: Why would somebody do that? Why would \nsomebody drive up premiums on people? I will tell you why. Because the \ngoal here is to basically eliminate private insurance. The goal here is \nto create a structure where essentially people who get private health \ncare through private insurance or their employer will be forced out of \nthat health care insurance and into an exchange, where there will be a \npublic plan, when this is all over. The government will essentially \nabsorb all insurance. This is not a good idea. Why isn't it a good \nidea? Because the government basically, in order to control costs, can \nonly do two things: it can limit access or it can control prices.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. It can limit access or control prices. Either way, it \nsignificantly undermines the quality of health care.\n  There are about 180 million people in this country--or more, I \nguess--who already have health care and are fairly comfortable with the \nhealth care they are getting under the private system. There are about \n190 million, actually. But they are going to be at deep risk.\n  There is something else here that is very serious that we have to \nthink about. As you start to put these types of pressures on the system \nand you start to regulate prices and you start to regulate access and \nyou start to regulate reimbursement and you have the government doing \nall of this, you start to stifle innovation. A lot of the drugs that \ncome on the market today come on after a massive period of time of \nresearch--I think it averages 15 years--and a huge amount of \ninvestment. I think it is $800 million to bring a new drug to the \nmarket. That $800 million does not appear from out of the sky. People \nwho are investing money say: I am willing to invest in that drug \nbecause I think it will work and it will do social good, but I also \nthink I am going to get a reasonable return on my investment. But if \nyou set up a system where you have price controls and where the return \non investment is artificially low, you basically don't allow people to \nrecover their costs or their costs plus a reasonable return on their \ninvestment. Then the money will not go into those research activities, \nthe money will go somewhere else. It will go into new software. It will \ngo into new machinery. It will go into real estate ventures where the \nreturn is better. You inevitably chill the investment in the \ninnovation, especially in the area of pharmaceuticals, which is where \nmost of the great research is being done today that is making better \nhealth care outcomes more available.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am honored to respond.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the Senator mentioned a little bit \nearlier about the previous attempt to slow the growth of Medicare. I \nremember during my House days--it has probably been a decade or more \nago--when the Senator from New Hampshire was on the Budget Committee on \nthe Senate side. We were looking at a rapid growth of Medicare, \nsomewhere in the 7 to 8, 9 percent rate. What the Senator from New \nHampshire is talking about is that in order to try to achieve a \nbalanced budget and to make reforms in Medicare, instead of it growing \nat that rate, we were going to reduce the rate of growth, not reduce \nthe amount of money, just reduce the rate of growth to about 5 percent \nper year to help achieve a balanced budget and at the same time \ncontinue to provide the services under Medicare that we did then.\n  I ask the Senator what he thinks is going to happen if we are not \nreducing the rate of growth, but in this plan coming out of the Finance \nCommittee that will be on the floor and the one that came out of the \nHELP Committee that will be melded with that bill, there is going to be \na reduction in Medicare spending by about $500 billion over 10 years. \nWill we be able to provide the same services under Medicare that we do \nnow if we reduce the amount of money spent on Medicare?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Georgia asks a very appropriate question \nbecause the practical effect of the reductions which are being proposed \nis that people who are on Medicare Advantage, which is a program many \nseniors like, will be eliminated. They will no longer have the \nopportunity to use Medicare Advantage or it will be contracted so much \nthat it will be a shell of its former self. This is being done not in \norder to make Medicare solvent--and there are very serious issues about \nMedicare solvency--it is being done in order to move that money over \nand start a new entitlement for a new group of people who are not \nseniors and who have not paid into the health insurance trust fund and \nwho have no relationship at all to Medicare.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The Senator from New Hampshire has been here a lot \nlonger than I have, both in the House and his service in the Senate. \nMr. President, has the Senator from New Hampshire ever seen a mandatory \nspending program that has been created by the Federal Government reduce \nits spending?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator asks another good question. ``No'' is the \nsimple answer. We all know that once you start a mandatory program, it \nalways grows and grows significantly. That, of course, is why we are in \nsuch trouble as a nation, because we have a number of mandatory \nprograms to which so much has been added that we simply cannot afford \nthem any longer under our present structure of a government.\n  Now we are going to take that problem and compound it by $1.8 \ntrillion, which is pretty irresponsible of us and fiscally \nirresponsible, but it is also irresponsible in the sense of stewards of \nour children's future because our children are going to inherit a \ngovernment that cannot be afforded and they are going to get bills or \nget a devalued dollar.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the Chair will allow me, I wish to ask another \nquestion about Medicaid.\n  The proposal coming out of the Finance Committee to the floor of the \nSenate has a huge effect on my State, and I am sure it has a similar \neffect on Senator Gregg's State, and that is this: The eligibility for \nMedicaid will move from 100 percent of poverty level to 133 percent of \npoverty level, which will add a significant number of additional \nindividuals all across America to the Medicaid rolls.\n  In my State, where the Federal Government will pick up the tab for \nthe first 3 years, there is going to be an additional cost of $1.2 \nbillion for those additional Medicaid-eligible individuals in Georgia. \nBeginning in the fourth year, the State of Georgia is going to have to \npick up that $1.2 billion.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is a former Governor, and I assume New \nHampshire probably has a balanced budget requirement, as we do. We are \nfurloughing teachers today. We are furloughing State employees. Schools \nare operating 4 days a week instead of 5 days a week. We are doing \neverything we can to decrease spending at the State level and even \nbelow that to try to make sure we achieve that balanced budget. If we \nas Georgians are asked to come up with another $1.2 billion to fund a \nhealth care program, we simply do not have the money to do it.\n  I ask the Senator if he has a similar situation in New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Georgia is expressing a problem which I \nthink most State Governors are extraordinarily worried about, whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats, which is that this bill, as it \nstarts up, covers the additional people who will be pushed into \nMedicaid, which is about 14 million nationally, but that coverage drops \noff in the outyears, and it will put many States in dire straits.\n  The Senator from Georgia talked about the numbers in Georgia. New \nHampshire will have the exact same problem, only we do not have a \nbalanced budget amendment. We are not that foresighted. I wish we were. \nSo we already have a problem. We are already running major deficits in \nthe State of New Hampshire, and if you throw these new Medicaid costs \non, you are going\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nto make it very difficult to do things such as spend on school systems \nand, especially in New Hampshire, on our college systems and our mental \nhealth care systems which are key to our quality of life in New \nHampshire.\n  This will be a massive unfunded mandate. I saw the number $33 billion \nas being what the States will end up picking up over the 10-year \nperiod. That is a big number for States to pick up. It will put massive \nstrains on State budgets. It is another example of the Federal \nGovernment saying: Here, look at the wonderful things we have done for \neverybody, and then sending the bill to the States, which is totally \ninappropriate.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Lastly, if I may ask one more question through the \nChair, as we reform health care--and 100 percent of the Members of this \nSenate agree that we need to reform health care. We have the best \ndelivery system in the world, but it can get better. We can have a \nbetter delivery system. We have the best insurance system in the world, \nbut it needs reforming. It can be made better.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire, who I know is familiar with the \ndetails of the plan that came out of the Finance Committee, know of any \nprovision in that bill that is designed to reduce the costs of health \ncare delivery in this country, which will help make that system better, \nwhich will help make the insurance system better by making premiums for \ninsurance more affordable for folks who cannot afford it today?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Georgia leads in the way I want to close \nthis discussion. There are ways to do what the Senator from Georgia is \nsuggesting. There are ways to reduce the cost of health care in this \ncountry and to make it better.\n  Let's take, for example, malpractice reform, abusive lawsuit reform. \nNone of that is in the Finance Committee bill. We should have something \nthere. The President says he is for it. We should do something in that \narea. CBO scores this as a $54 billion savings. That is not chicken \nfeed--not in Georgia, not in New Hampshire. That is a big number. So we \nshould have malpractice reform.\n  We should have proposals which basically incentivize employers to \nhave their employees with healthier lifestyles. It is called HIPAA \nreform. That is not in the Finance Committee. It is very easy to do. \nYou give people the incentive and employers the ability to say to \nsomeone: If you stop smoking, if you live a healthier lifestyle by \nreducing your weight, if you take the tests you need to take in the \narea of better health care, such as colonoscopies, we actually will \ngive you a cash reward. We cannot do it under the Finance Committee \nbill and, to a lesser degree, under the Kennedy-Dodd bill or the Harkin \nbill but not as much as we would like.\n  There are specific diseases we should target, such as obesity and \nAlzheimer's. There are a whole series of healthy lifestyles. There are \nthings we can do in a step-by-step manner which will get us much \nfarther down the road toward quality health care for all Americans \nrather than this massive expansion of health care through a massive \nexpansion of an entitlement which will lead inevitably to, in my \nopinion, a huge debt being passed on to our children.\n  Three groups are going to pay for this $1.8 trillion: One is seniors \ncitizens who are going to pay for the cuts through Medicare; two is \nsmall businesses that are going to have to pay through massive \nincreases in premiums for their insurance, and they will probably have \nto give up a lot of coverage of their people; and three is our \nchildren, who are going to have to pay the debt.\n  I appreciate the thoughts and questions of the Senator from Georgia. \nThey are right on point. I thank him for getting involved in this \ndiscussion. In fact, I yield the floor to him right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, who has certainly been in the forefront \ntrying to make sure, No. 1, that the budget of this country is in a \nvery positive situation as we move forward and that we do not leave our \nchildren and grandchildren burdened with a debt they simply cannot pay. \nAs he has said, they are the ones who, at the end of the day, along \nwith senior citizens and the small business community, are going to \nwind up paying for this bill if it comes out crafted the way it is \npresented in the Finance Committee and the way it appears it is going \nto come out of the Finance Committee to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes on \nanother subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been waiting to come here for a bit. \nI have no problem with 5 minutes. I am patient. I want to alert the \nSenate what is going to be happening the rest of the day. I will wait \nfor my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the majority leader wants to go----\n  Mr. REID. No, that is fine. I am happy to do this. I want everyone to \nknow what is happening here tonight. I will do that when the Senator \nfrom Georgia finishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Recognizing Vernie Hubert\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is with great pride and yet much \nregret that I stand here today to recognize a dear friend and longtime \nservant of American agriculture who is retiring from public service.\n  Through nearly 25 years of serving in various capacities on the House \nand Senate Agriculture Committees, Vernie Hubert has exemplified \ntremendous character, an infectious personality, and an astute \nknowledge of the law, for which I admiringly respect and thank him. I \nwould like to issue a special thanks to his wife Kathleen and daughter \nMary Phillips for allowing us to have him in Washington for the past 3 \nyears while they have lived in Texas. I am eternally grateful for his \ndedication to agriculture. His encyclopedic knowledge and valuable \ninput will certainly be missed.\n  What began as an internship in the House Agriculture Committee for \nVernie in 1982 has since blossomed into a distinguished agricultural \nlaw career. Before entering law school, he earned a bachelor's degree \nin biomedical science at Texas A University and even served as a \nfirst lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve Medical Service Corps after \ngraduation.\n  Upon graduation from St. Mary's University School of Law in 1985, \nVernie returned to his beloved South Texas for a brief stint as an \nassistant prosecutor in Brazos County. Though his heart has always \nremained in Texas, Vernie returned to the House Agriculture Committee \nto work with then-chairman Kika de la Garza and ranking member Charlie \nStenholm, where he served for almost 20 years in various roles--as \nassociate counsel, staff director, and legislative director.\n  In 2004, I was fortunate in luring Vernie to the Senate, where he has \nserved as chief counsel on the Senate Agriculture Committee for me \nsince then. We were successful in passing a farm bill last year, and a \nbig reason for that success is due to the tireless, diligent efforts of \nVernie Hubert.\n  Seeing that the 2008 farm bill was the fifth farm bill that saw \npassage during Vernie's tenure, it goes without saying that his \nexperience in negotiating agriculture policy is not going to be easily \nreplaced.\n  In fact, it is impossible to replace a person like Vernie Hubert, not \nonly for his wealth of knowledge but also for the richness of his \ncharacter.\n  In the years I have known and worked with him, he has remained a \nloyal confidant and has always kept American agriculture's best \ninterests at heart. Vernie, you will sincerely be missed by everyone \nwho has had the pleasure of working with you, and I wish you nothing \nbut the best in all your future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the usual courteousness of my \nfriend from Georgia.\n  There will be no more votes today, but I want to say a word about a \nstatement made by my friend, the senior Senator from New Hampshire. He \ntalked about the CBO saying there would be $54 billion saved each year \nif we put caps on medical malpractice and put some restrictions--tort \nreform.\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\nFifty-four billion. Sounds like a lot of money, doesn't it? The answer \nis yes. But remember, we are talking about $2 trillion--$54 billion \ncompared to $2 trillion. You can do the math. We can all do the math. \nIt is a very small percentage.\n  I have said in meetings before that people who practice medicine are \nnegligent. What does that mean? The Presiding Officer is a lawyer, my \nfriend from Illinois who is next to me is a lawyer, my friend in the \naisle from Maryland is a lawyer, and we learned early on in law school \nwhat the definition of negligence is. If someone runs through a stop \nlight or a stop sign and hurts somebody, they have been negligent. And \nour system of justice, carried over from the common law in England, \nallows people to seek redress for the injuries they received as a \nresult of someone's negligence. Doctors are negligent. They are human \nbeings and they make mistakes and they hurt people.\n  I have said before--and I will be very quick with a little story. My \nfriend, Senator Coburn, is on the floor. He is a medical doctor. I used \nto spend hours and hours on the floor, and one day I felt in my left \nfoot that my sock was kind of gobbed up on the bottom of my foot. I \nthought: What is wrong? I don't know what that is. So I went into my \noffice and took my shoe off and the sock was fine. To make a long story \nshort, I had a problem with my foot. As some know, I have run thousands \nof miles on my feet and one of them reacted. It was tired of running \nthose thousands of miles, I guess. I was diagnosed with having a \nMorton's neuroma on my foot, which required surgery. They tried all the \nother things and they didn't work.\n  So I go into the hospital to have this surgery. Remember, it is my \nleft foot. I am on the gurney--the hospital bed, whatever it is--and \nthey are getting ready to do the surgery. I look down and I have a big \nmark from a Magic Marker on my right foot. I say: Why is that big mark \non my foot? And the doctor and the personnel say: That is where we are \ngoing to operate--on that foot. That is why we put that check. I said: \nThe wrong foot.\n  If I hadn't said something, they would have operated on my good foot \nand left my bad one for a surgery later on. That is negligence. I said \nsomething about that. But as I have said before, my wife was born shy \nand she will die shy. She is a very shy person. She would have been on \nthat surgical table ready to have that surgery and she wouldn't have \nsaid a word about that big mark on her foot. I know her. We have been \ntogether these many decades, and I know she wouldn't have said a word. \nThat is medical malpractice. We need to protect people from doctors who \ncommit negligence.\n  In talking about the great report Senator Gregg cited, he failed to \nmention one thing I think is kind of important--important to me. If \nthis went into effect, 4,853 Americans would be killed every year by \nmedical malpractice. Over a 10-year period, I repeat, 48,000 Americans \nwould die because of medical malpractice. So I would suggest people not \nwave that around because I don't think the American people want to be \npart of the 48,000-plus people being killed because of medical \nmalpractice--malpractice by doctors, not other personnel.\n  We haven't done a thing today. Why? Because the Republicans will not \nlet us. We had cloture invoked on an important piece of legislation and \nthey are using the 30 hours postcloture. For what? For nothing. For \nnothing. No one is coming here from the other side saying how important \nit is they have the extra time to talk about this legislation. It is \nwasted time.\n  The Republicans have made the political calculation they would rather \nhave no progress made. No suffering American gets help. They would \nrather do that than work with us to move forward on the most pressing \nissues in this country. It is not just limited to the health care \ndebate we have heard about for months on end. Because they refuse to \nmove forward, to hold up the legislative process for no substantive \nreason, we are wasting America's precious time and money.\n  We could be working on extending unemployment benefits at a time when \nunemployment is high in virtually every State--some States higher than \nothers. Unemployment is running out in some States. We could be \nsupporting the Department of Defense conference report--the \nauthorization bill. It is the bill we do every year for our fighting \nmen and women around the country and around the world. We are not doing \nthat. Why? Because we are wasting time here. We could have a couple of \nhours of debate on it at the very most. But, no, we are wasting our \ntime.\n\n  I came to the floor last night and said: Why are you doing this? They \nsaid: Well, if we could work a little longer, we could come up with a \nlist of amendments. I repeat what I said last night. I was here until I \ndon't know how late on Thursday. Everybody had vacated this building. I \ncould have yelled down the hall and no one but a police officer would \nhave heard me. Why? Because we were waiting for them to come up with \nsome amendments so we could fill the bill. But they were just killing \ntime. There was no intention of completing that bill. They were \nstalling for time. So I had to file cloture on that bill.\n  Department of Homeland Security. We have a conference report we would \nlike to complete on appropriations. Are we doing that? No. Are we \ncompleting our appropriations bills? We got a letter from the \nRepublican leadership saying: Let's do the appropriations bills. We are \ntrying. But, again, they are stalling and will not let us. In the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, we have two \ncritical agencies that need all the support they can get at a time when \nour Nation is fighting two wars--two wars plus homeland security trying \nto protect our borders and protect the homeland.\n  We could be passing appropriations bills to keep our country running, \nincluding Commerce-State-Justice that they held up last night. Instead, \nwe are doing the Republican shuffle. If it sounds familiar, it should. \nLast year, Republicans broke the blindly partisan record of pointless \nfilibusters--nearly 100. Not nearly; 100 is how many it was--more than \nany other session of Congress in the history of our Nation. What does \nthis accomplish? Zero. Nothing.\n  The American people didn't demand paralysis, they demanded change, \nand we are trying our best. It is long past time for the Republicans to \nlisten to what the American people want. Their strategy of stubbornness \nis shortsighted. I am confident that, in the end, these Republican \ntactics will once again prove to be self-defeating, just as they were \nlast November. I am so concerned that we have the same Republican \nshuffle time after time and we spend hours and days on this floor doing \nnothing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the leader would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The leader mentioned the Defense authorization bill is \nawaiting action by this Senate. We have a conference report. We have \nspent months and months and months on this bill. There are critical \nprovisions that everyone knows about. Some of those, it can be argued, \nwell, doesn't that require an appropriation? The answer is: Yes, \ntechnically, some of these provisions do.\n  For instance, the pay increase requires an appropriation. But by \nholding up this bill--the conference report--we are holding up \nlegislative provisions as well that are critically important that do \nnot rely on appropriations. So I want to----\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, the majority of your bill is \nlegislative language that has nothing to do with appropriations.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I want to ask the leader, if he can bear with me for a \nmoment. I wish to spend a couple moments talking about a few of the \nlegislative provisions. One, to remedy the military commissions law. It \nhas been basically thrown out by the Supreme Court. We cannot hold \npeople in front of military commissions and try them before military \ncommissions under the current law. We have to modify this law. We have \nspent months doing it. The modifications are in the Defense \nauthorization bill. Until these modifications are signed into law by \nthe President of the United States, we cannot have detainees tried \nbefore military commissions.\n  We want to get equipment to Afghanistan. Many of us are focusing on \nstrengthening the Afghan Army as a\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\nway that we can succeed in Afghanistan, to get their numbers up, to get \ntheir equipment up. But in order to get nonaccess property from Iraq to \nAfghanistan, we have to authorize it. That is in the bill that is now \nbeing held up because, apparently, there is an unwillingness on the \npart of some of the Republicans to agree to a unanimous consent \nagreement with a time agreement for debate. No one is trying to preempt \nanybody from talking.\n  There is one other example. Unless we act, soldiers who are getting \ncare at TRICARE facilities are going to have to pay $100 a day extra. \nWe have to stop that from happening--to continue the provision in law \nto extend the limitation on charges for patients who are getting \nTRICARE. On and on and on.\n  We have critically important legislative provisions, and my question \nto the leader is this: Am I correct in my understanding that we have \noffered a unanimous consent agreement, given a willingness to enter \ninto a time agreement on how many hours of debate--and I know there are \npeople who oppose the hate crimes provisions, for instance, in our \nbill. We are not trying to preempt debate. It is the opposite. We are \ntrying to get on with the debate. So my question is: Is it true we have \noffered a unanimous consent agreement on the Defense authorization bill \nand that it has so far been rejected?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, yes, yes. I say to my friend, you have only mentioned \na few of the most important things that satisfy and take care of the \nmilitary and our fighting men and women in our country.\n  I say to my friend, I went to the first ever Reid family reunion in \nSearchlight. It was interesting. You should have seen the invitation--\n``sobriety requested.'' That was fine. Not everybody followed that, but \nit was pretty interesting. A child of one of my cousins was there and \nshe said: I want to tell you that my husband is 30 years old and just \njoined the Army.\n  Because of the downturn in the economy, we have had huge numbers of \npeople joining the military, and we need to take care of those people, \nsuch as my relative I learned about in Searchlight.\n  So I thank the chairman very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the leader, and I hope our Republican friends will \nreconsider their objections to letting us proceed to the Defense \nauthorization bill, which is critically important to the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The assistant majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I want to back up \nthe comments recently made by Senator Levin of Michigan, the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, and our majority leader.\n  How can we, in the midst of two wars, stop the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill on the floor when our sons and daughters, husbands \nand wives, Americans across this country are risking their lives? We \nhave this stall tactic on the floor, where they will not even allow us \nto bring this up for a vote for the Department of Defense \nauthorization. A lot of people around here go back home for parades and \nwave the red, white, and blue and salute our troops and tell us how \nmuch they love them and then come to the floor and engage in stall \ntactics and filibusters to stop this.\n  I would say to the other side of the aisle: Don't go home and wave \nthe flag of patriotism if you will not at least give us a chance to \nvote on the bill our men and women in uniform are counting on. Too many \nof them are doing just that. I might also tell you that when it comes \nto unemployment benefits, we know what is going on in America. Hundreds \nof thousands of people have lost their jobs. As of September of this \nyear, the end of September, 400,000 Americans lost their unemployment \nbenefits, another 200,000 will occur within this month and then 1.3 \nmillion total by the end of the year. We have asked the Republicans: \nWill you let us extend unemployment benefits for people who have no way \nto sustain their families? No. They want to filibuster this. They want \nto offer amendments that have nothing to do with this whatsoever. They \nwant to drag it out. They have no sensitivity to these people who have \nlost their jobs and are struggling to keep their families together \nunder the most difficult circumstances. The Homeland Security \nconference report is another one. That is going to pass soon, and we \nare having difficulty from the Republican side getting any kind of \nagreement getting this measure enacted. This is a measure about the \nsafety and security of our country.\n  The Commerce-Justice bill, this is one Senator Mikulski brought to \nthe floor. It includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation and law \nenforcement. We could not get a single Republican yesterday to agree \nwith us to bring this bill to a vote after it sat on the floor for an \nentire week, waiting for amendments that were promised and never \ndelivered.\n  Now we have the Energy and Water conference which could pass, an \nimportant bill to put people to work in America. We had a vote earlier \ntoday, it was 79 to 17--people thought it was a great bill. Now it is \nbeing stalled. It is being stopped.\n  The bottom line is we came here to do some work, not to dream up ways \nto stall and not do the people's work. Too many people are being \ndisadvantaged by this tactic. It is the tactic of the minority. It is \none they will pay for because the American people understand they have \nno proposal when it comes to health care reform--nothing. Now they have \nno agenda when it comes to these important items for our men and women \nin uniform, for the people who are unemployed across America to keep us \nsafe through homeland security and basic bills for law enforcement and \nfor Energy and Water appropriations. They want to stop them all, stall \nthem all.\n  That may be a good tactic that some of their political consultants \nhave given them but don't think the American people are going to accept \nit.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that when Senator Udall is recognized, \nSenator Udall of New Mexico is recognized this evening, he control up \nto 1 hour of that time as in morning business and it be in order for \nhim to engage in colloquies during this time; at the conclusion of that \nhour, Senator Coburn be recognized to speak for up to 1 hour; at the \nend of that hour, it be in order for Senator Udall to be recognized for \nanother hour under the same conditions as identified above; and at the \nconclusion of that hour, Senator Coburn again be recognized for 1 hour \nas identified above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask the unanimous consent be modified that I be given 3 \nminutes to speak prior to the start of that unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wanted to answer a few of the points of the \ndistinguished majority whip. The reason the Energy and Water bill is \nbeing held up is because the conference took out transparency that the \npeople of this country need to see. It could easily be fixed by the \nmajority agreeing that we will send that back, we will send a \nresolution back and ask the House to put the transparency back in. That \nis the purpose for it. It is not a delaying tactic. The fact is, we \ndidn't defend what we actually voted for. That is the answer to the \nfirst question.\n  The unemployment benefit, we all want to extend it. We just want to \npay for it. We don't want to charge it to our children. We want to get \nrid of some of the waste. We want to either take some money from the \nstimulus account and pay for it, but we do not want to charge the \nunemployment extension to our grandkids. We think you ought to make \nthose hard choices.\n  Finally, on the cloture vote yesterday, as far as I could count, \nthere are 60 of you and all you had to do was bring 60 votes to the \nfloor, which you chose not to do. There were only three amendments that \nhave been voted on on the Commerce, Justice, and State. I have three \namendments pending. I agreed to have votes on them yesterday. Instead \nof having votes, we decided to do cloture, which was not achieved.\n  The final point that the Senator from Illinois makes, the very claim \nthat we have no health care proposal--the first health care proposal \nthat was filed and\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\npublished was my health care proposal that is a comprehensive health \ncare proposal that saves the government money, covers more people than \nany of the bills we have today, saves $70 billion, saves the States $1 \ntrillion, and solves most of the problems as far as access and cost, it \ncovers people with any preexisting illness.\n  It is not we do not have a plan, it is that we couldn't get our plan \nagreed to or listened to.\n  I understand the frustration of my friend from Illinois; there is no \nquestion. We do want--we almost had an agreement yesterday to finish \nCommerce-Justice. There is no question. Everybody knew that. Then we \ndecided to vote cloture.\n  I am happy to finish. We can finish it tomorrow if we can come to \nagreement on the amendments. We vote on the amendments and finish that \nbill tomorrow and finish this tomorrow. They can both be finished \ntomorrow easily, so it is not about structure; it is about growing the \nFederal Government, expanding the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment and charging the cost of that to the next two generations. \nThat is the objection. It is not about slowing the process.\n  I understand it is frustrating being in the majority when, in fact, \nthere are minority rights, but when the amendments aren't agreed to, \naren't allowed to have majority votes, then you can understand our \npredicament.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, it is great to be here with \nyou this evening. I see Senator Durbin is still on the floor, and I \nknow he may want to speak to the issue that was just raised. We are \nhere discussing the public option. I hope Senator Durbin has a minute \nor two to talk about that.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator, and under the hour he has been \ngiven, I thank him for yielding a few minutes. Let me say, what \nhappened to you in the conference committee has happened to all of us. \nYou had an amendment adopted in the Senate. As I understand it, we all \nsupported it. It died in conference. It is frustrating, something you \nbelieve in, something we all voted for, and you didn't get your way. \nBut does that mean we are going to stop consideration of this \nconference report; we are not going to pass an Energy and Water \nappropriations bill because your amendment didn't survive in \nconference? If all 100 Members in the Senate took that position, we \nwould never pass anything.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When I finish. The fact is, each of us has to accept the \nreality here. We don't always get what we want. I have been denied \nopportunities in conferences for things I cared for.\n  One of them, for example, was to say the Federal Government was going \nto make up the difference in pay from activated Federal workers who \nserved in our Guard and Reserve. Year after year it would be adopted on \nthe Senate floor and killed in conference by the chairman from Alaska. \nDid I stop the money for the Department of Defense because of that? Of \ncourse not. I said: Tomorrow is another day and I will fight for it \nanother day. But to stop the bill and say we are going to hold on for \n30 hours or more because I didn't get my amendment in conference?\n  When it comes to the unemployment benefit, we are paying for these \nthe same way every President has paid for them, through the FUTA tax. \nIt is paid for. Frankly, it should be. These are people who paid into \nunemployment compensation for the day when they would need it and now \nthe money is coming back out to pay them. But some people here have a \ndifferent theory how they want to pay for it. So hundreds of thousands \nof unemployed Americans are waiting for the latest Republican theory on \nhow to finance unemployment benefits. It is cold comfort to them to \nknow we are having this great academic debate when a question about \nfood on the table and taking care of their family is No. 1 in their \nminds. That is the problem with what has happened here.\n  You can always dream up a reason to vote no. You can always dream up \na better idea. But at some point the business of government has to get \non. People count on us--in this case, hundreds of thousands of \nunemployed people.\n  Let me say a word about public option, and then I will yield the \nfloor back to the Senator from New Mexico. If we didn't get the message \nloudly and clearly Monday night about the public option when the health \ninsurance industry threatened us and said: If you pass health care \nreform, we are going to raise your premiums, if the message didn't come \nthrough loudly and clearly that they not only have the power to do \nthat, we empowered them to do it in ways no other company can because \nthey are exempt from antitrust laws, the only way to keep them honest \nis to make sure health care reform does not disadvantage workers and \nbusinesses and families is to have a not-for-profit option, a public \noption that people can choose for health insurance. I fully support \nthat public option. Those who say I am not sure if I would go that far \nhave to accept the reality. Health insurance, private health insurance \ncompanies will impose premiums, they will fix prices because they can--\nthey are exempt under McCarran-Ferguson--and they can allocate \nmarketplaces so they can own markets. They are in a dominant position. \nThe only thing that can stop them is competition and the only \ncompetition that can work is a public option, one that comes in and is \nnot profit driven but tries to provide quality care for people at \naffordable cost. I fully support the public option. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for yielding.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I think \nhe makes some very strong points.\n  We are being joined here in the majority, Senator Whitehouse is here, \nSenator Cardin is here, Senator Brown from Ohio is going to be here. We \nare going to be carrying on a colloquy about the public option for the \nnext hour, so any of our friends in the majority who want to come down \nto the Senate floor and join us, I urge them to do that.\n  Senator Cardin, I know, has a couple things to say about the public \noption. Please.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank him very much. I thank \nthe Senator from New Mexico for bringing us together. He has been not \nonly a real champion on the public insurance option within the health \ncare debate but a real leader in that we need to do something.\n  I listened to my Republican friends. They take the position the \nstatus quo is acceptable. The status quo is not acceptable. Health \ninsurance reform is vitally important for the American public. I thank \nthe Senator for bringing us all together to talk about it.\n  There is some general consensus among the Democrats. The first is we \nneed to reform our health insurance marketplace. It is important for \nthe Federal Government to take action to deal with preexisting \nconditions so people can get health insurance without discrimination, \nthey get the ability to renew their policies, there is no cap on the \nannual amounts that preventive care covers without copayment or without \ndeductibles. These are all important changes that are included in the \nhealth insurance reform that is making its way through the Senate.\n  Let me tell you, the main reason for all this is cost. I will be \nhonest with my colleagues. We cannot sustain the current health cost \nescalation in this country. Let me give you a few numbers: 6, 12, 23. \nTen years ago in Maryland, a family health insurance policy cost about \n$6,000. Today it is about $12,000. If we don't do anything, in 2016 it \nis going to be $23,000. That is not sustainable.\n  We are currently spending, in America, about $7,400 per person for \nhealth insurance, $2.4 trillion. We have to do better.\n  Let me tell you something. Every family in Maryland who has health \ninsurance is paying an extra $1,100 a year for those who do not have \nhealth insurance. So the status quo is unacceptable to the people in \nMaryland. It is unacceptable to the people of this Nation.\n  Our objective is simple. Our objective is to reduce the cost of \nhealth care to make sure every American has access to affordable, \nquality care, and we are going to do it in a fiscally responsible way \nthat will not add to the Federal deficit. We want to build on the \ncurrent system. Those who have insurance, we want to make sure they can \ncontinue to keep that insurance; that it remains affordable; that they \nhave the right to choose their doctor. We want to make sure Medicare is\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nstrengthened. One of the best ways to strengthen Medicare is to bring \ndown the escalating cost of health care.\n  We understand that. Democrats want to make sure the Medicare system \nremains strong and that is one of the reasons why we think health \ninsurance reform today is so critically important and we want to help \nsmall businesses have more choice.\n  That brings me to the public insurance option. Why do we think the \npublic insurance option is so important?\n  First, I have heard some of my colleagues come down to the floor and \nsay we want to protect you against the Democrats' bill that is a \ngovernment takeover. This is not a government takeover. Was Medicare a \ngovernment takeover? Of course, that is what our Republican friends \nsaid when we were considering Medicare in 1965, and if they had had \ntheir way we would never have passed Medicare.\n  But Medicare allows you to choose private doctors, private hospitals. \nIt is all about providing an affordable way that our seniors and \ndisabled population can get access to affordable care. It maintains the \nprivate network. We want to make sure we continue that.\n  Let me tell you the problem in Maryland today. That is that 71 \npercent of the people in Maryland who have private insurance are in one \nor two plans. That is not competitive. That is not competitive. One out \nof every three Marylanders has no choice on the private insurance plan \nthat their employer offers. They must take that. That is not choice.\n  So the reason I am such a strong proponent of the public option is to \nbring down costs, to add more competition, to make sure we have an \naffordable product there to save taxpayers' dollars. That is why I want \nto see us make sure that we maintain a public insurance option, to be \nable to maintain your ability to choose your own doctor.\n  I will give you one more comparison; that is, take a look at what has \nhappened in Medicare. We have Medicare Advantage. You can go to a \nprivate insurance option within Medicare itself. It would be one thing \nif they competed on a level playing field. They do not. Today we are \npaying 12 to 17 percent more for every senior who chooses private \ninsurance. Let me repeat that. For every senior who goes into private \ninsurance, the taxpayers of this Nation have to spend more money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has indicated to us that that amounts \nto about $150 billion over 10 years. We cannot afford that. I am for \nprivate insurance, but I want to make sure it is affordable and that we \nare not oversubsidizing as we are today. Let them compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  The reason we want the public option is to keep costs down, to keep \nbasically the private insurance marketplace straight and honest in a \nway they make their profit, to make sure that in every part of \nMaryland, indeed every part of this Nation, there is an affordable \ninsurance plan available.\n  Marylanders know what happened with what was called Medicare-Plus \nChoice when we had private insurance plans in Medicare and they left \novernight. They had no insurance available. Fortunately they still had \nthe public insurance option called Medicare. We want to make sure there \nis affordable coverage for all Americans, to keep the cost down.\n  I applaud my colleague from New Mexico for allowing us an opportunity \nto talk about this. I really do applaud the work that is being done by \nall of our committees, by the HELP Committee, by the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Their options give us hope that we are going to move forward \nwith health insurance reform and health care reform this year, to bring \ndown the cost of health care, to make sure that every American has \naccess to quality, affordable care and do it in a way that will be \nfiscally responsible. Democrats are giving us hope that we are going to \nbe able to achieve that in 2009.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator from Maryland. I think \nthe Senator from Maryland has made such a strong case of why we need a \npublic option. You know many of the folks who are out there wondering: \nWell, what is a public option? I think we need to go through a little \nbit of what we are talking about, because this is something that the \nAmerican public understands. They know it in their heart. But let's go \nthrough a few of the details.\n  First, this is not going to be subsidized by the government. It is \ngoing to be fully funded by premiums. So we are going to be out there \nin the private sector. Premiums will be flowing in to this nonprofit \nentity, and it will be able to function and compete with other \nbusinesses. It is not going to make a profit for its shareholders \nbecause it is a nonprofit.\n  It would have low administrative costs since it operates as a \nnonprofit. That would allow it in the marketplace to serve as a \ncompetitor with these big insurance companies that are out there. It \nwould offer savings to its subscribers through lower premiums, greater \nbenefits, or lower out-of-pocket expenses. It will have the same \ninsurance requirements as private plans. So we are talking about \nsomething that will offer low cost and high value.\n  Let's take a look here at why it costs so much. You can see by this \nchart right here that in New Mexico, we have a situation where we have \ntwo companies controlling 65 percent of the market. All of us know the \nway the market system works. It works best when you have a lot of \ncompetitors. When you take a market and drive it down and only have two \ncompetitors, what you end up getting is those two competitors that are \nable to push up the cost. So that is something a public option would \ninject into the market, a competitiveness that we have not seen in a \nlong time.\n  One of the things it would do is it would start lowering those \npremium costs we are seeing in New Mexico. I know Senator Whitehouse is \nhere from Rhode Island. One of the things I want to say about the \nSenator from Rhode Island is he has participated in this process \nalready. Everybody knows he was on the HELP Committee. He had the \nopportunity to help write this bill. He has got a great deal of \nknowledge about what the public option is.\n  I believe it is only about 19 pages of the bill that passed out of \nthe HELP Committee. People can read it. It is out there on the \nInternet. That 19 pages sets up the public option. So all we need to do \nis make sure that is in the bill that comes to the Senate floor, or \nthat we amend it on the Senate floor if it is not in the base bill, or \nthat we have the President of the United States say he wants a public \noption. He can weigh in to the conference and say those 19 pages, the \npublic option, we want them in there.\n\n  I want to ask the Senator from Rhode Island to talk a little bit \nabout the way he sees things from his perspective. What is happening up \nin Rhode Island on the public option?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I am committed \nto that. I am also delighted to follow the Senator from Maryland. \nSenator Cardin and Senator Udall have been, for many years before they \neven came to the Senate, when they were serving with such distinction \nin the House of Representatives, strong advocates for the elderly, \nstrong advocates for the disabled, and strong advocates for consumers.\n  That is what a public option is all about. It is helping out people \nas consumers and providing better health care, the kind that the \nelderly and disabled get when they are on Medicare. They do not have so \nmany worries that regular families have of whether they are going to \nget coverage.\n  The public option makes so much sense that it is very hard to argue \nagainst it as it is. So a great number of my friends on the other side \nof the aisle are arguing against things that actually are not being \nproposed, such as socialized medicine, or the government taking over \nhealth care.\n  None of that is suggested by our bill, anyway. The first words of the \nHELP bill are ``voluntary plan.'' It is a voluntary option. As the \nPresident said when he was running for election: If you like the plan \nyou have, you get to keep it. But if you do not like the plan you have, \nyou have a public option, an alternative, a choice.\n  Why does that matter? Well, it matters to people such as Stephanie, a \n28-year-old from Warwick, who recently learned that her insurance plan \nis refusing to cover the most costly and important medication that she \nhas to take for a chronic rheumatic condition. She thought she had \ninsurance. But\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\nwhen this condition appeared, and she realized the kind of treatment \nshe needed, and her doctor said: This is what you need, Stephanie, the \ninsurance company said: Oh, no, I am sorry. We are not going to cover \nthat.\n  Our friends like to talk about how this will put the government \nbetween you and your doctor. Folks, the private insurance industry is, \nall over this country, getting between Stephanie and her doctor and \nmillions of others just like them and telling them what kind of care \nshe can and cannot have.\n  The public option will actually help free that up by providing \nalternatives where they can provide better service and broader \ncoverage, at lower cost. Why might they be able to do that? Our friends \non the other side of the aisle say: Well, it is because they will \ncompete unfairly. Because they will necessarily take over any insurance \nmarket that they get into.\n  That is, frankly, a bunch of baloney. In my home State of Rhode \nIsland, just two insurance companies dominate the market now. In fact, \none of our health insurers reported $37 million of profits, excess \nprofits, that it wanted to take out of Rhode Island and repatriate to \nits home State outside of Rhode Island; $37 million. Rhode Island has \nonly 1 million people in it. We are a small State. This was a company \nwith 16 percent market share in Rhode Island. So out of 16 percent of \nthe Rhode Island market, in 1 year, they were going to pull $37 million \nand send it out of State.\n  You do not have to do that if you are a not-for-profit company. That \nis $37 million that can serve those 16 percent of folks with better \ncoverage, with better quality service. The profit and huge executive \ncompensation is money that could go instead into health care.\n  I also heard from Charles from Pawtucket. For 20 years he and his \nwife have worked. They are freelance musicians. They have not had \nanybody providing them coverage through the business. But they have \nscrupulously and faithfully paid for health insurance and coverage. \nRecently his wife was in an accident. They are both in their late 50s. \nThe insurance company took a look at them and said: You are out. They \ntossed them out; threw them off the insurance plan.\n  That is not the kind of choice people need. They need a public plan \nthey can go to that will be reliable, and that will be there for them \nonce they get sick. It is said about our private health insurance \nindustry that they give you all the coverage you need until you need \nit. Suddenly it is loophole city. There is a better alternative and a \nbetter way.\n  Another way the public plan can help to fund that and to make up that \ndifference is with less administrative cost. We have heard that on the \nprivate insurance side, 15 to 30 percent of the health care insurance \ndollar gets burned in administrative costs; Medicare, maybe 3 to 5 \npercent. So they are running probably five times as expensive as \nMedicare in their administration.\n  And what do you get for that? Well, you get told that you cannot have \nthe care you need when you actually get sick. You get your doctors \nhassled so badly by the private insurance industry that they have staff \nto fight with the insurance companies. As I travel around Rhode Island, \ndoctors tell me that very often 50 percent of their personnel is \ndevoted to fighting with the insurance industry, fighting about prior \napprovals, fighting about getting paid.\n  So the 15 to 30-percent costs that the private insurance companies \nhave for administration creates what I call a ``cost shadow'' in the \nhealth insurance provider community, because they have got to pay all \nof those people to fight back. You add the two together and it is big \ndollars. A public plan will work more effectively, will try to figure \nout the better way to provide care that does not invest its dollars in \ntrying to fight with providers and figuring out how to deny you care. \nThere is a huge amount of money that can go back into better quality \ncare.\n  Another story is Tim from Warwick. He is a husband and he is a \nfather. Right now his family health insurance has a $3,500 deductible. \nTim and his wife are not high-earning people. The $3,500 deductible is \na real risk. Because of it, they actually avoid care, miss appointments \nand do not take as good care of their health as they should, because \nthey simply cannot afford the out of pocket. They save it for the big \ncatastrophe.\n  They have tried. They looked around to try to find other things. They \ncannot find anything better because the costs are so high. So right now \nTim sees his family as tethered to that job, tethered to that insurance \nplan. If there were a public option and he did not have to get it \nthrough his job, then they could look and they could find an \nalternative and they would not feel as tied down.\n  How many people in America feel trapped in their jobs because they do \nnot have an alternative for health care? And to protect their family's \nhealth care, they continue to slug away at a job, they defer the \ninnovation and entrepreneurship they could do. They do not open their \nown business. They feel they have no choice.\n  The public option could give them a choice. Another way that could \nhelp save money is by providing a new model of service.\n  Over and over again, we find in health care that if you improve the \nquality of care, you can actually lower the cost. The waste in the \nhealth care system is phenomenal. The Lewin Group says there is $1 \ntrillion in excess health care costs--$1 trillion in excess health care \ncosts--every year in America; $1 trillion every year.\n  The New England Health Care Institute has looked at this, and they \nsay there is $850 billion in excess health care costs in America every \nyear.\n  President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers looked at how much \nexcess costs there are in health care. They looked at it by comparing \nour share of gross domestic product to other countries' shares of gross \ndomestic product that gets burned by their health care systems. We are \nthe highest in the world. We are far ahead of everybody else. We are a \ncomplete outlier. We are at 18 percent of GDP. The next worse country \nis Switzerland at 11 percent, and the EU average is half of ours, and \nthey get better health care results. We spend a fortune on health care. \nThey looked at that comparison.\n  They also looked at the comparison of regional outcomes and how in \nsome States you can get very high-quality health care with great \noutcomes and results, and it is a lot cheaper than in other States \nwhere you get very expensive health care and lousy results. They \ncrunched all those numbers, and they looked from both sides, and they \ncame up with the number of $700 billion a year in excess health care \ncosts. It is there.\n  We have a terrible model of service in this country. Anybody who has \never had a sick family member, who has had a chronic condition, who has \nbeen sick themselves--you have seen it. You know the inefficiencies in \nthis system: the electronic health record that is not there, so your \ntests cannot be located and you have to carry your own file around; the \ninsurance companies being just brutal to your doctors and arguing with \nthem about your care, and you cannot get the care while that fight goes \non, while they sort it out; the doctors who cannot talk to each other. \nYou have five specialists, and you are the one in the middle, and you \nare the one who is sick, and nobody is sorting it out for you, and \nnobody knows what the other person is doing. One person prescribes a \nprescription and another person prescribes a prescription, and those \ntwo interact in a way that makes you sick, and nobody saw that coming \nbecause it is disorganized.\n  All that stuff does not need to be there. It is excess cost. When you \nget rid of it, you improve the quality of care. A public option can go \nafter that, and it will because it is not bound to try to make a profit \nevery minute, it is bound to try to do the right thing. So there are \ninnumerable reasons why a public option makes sense.\n  But, finally, I think the strongest one is that by not having to \nextract all this profit out of the system--by not having to pay CEOs \ntens of millions of dollars a year, by not having to maintain that huge \nadministrative war with doctors and hospitals and war with their \ncustomers as soon as they get sick, trying to deny their coverage--by \nactually trying to find that newer, better model of care that provides \nbetter health care cheaper, they can actually drive down costs--and a \nlot.\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\n  I do not know if the right target number is $700 billion a year or \n$850 billion a year or $1 trillion a year, but there is a big target \nnumber to find, and what a difference that would make for Lisa in \nProvidence, who turned 55 this year. Her birthday present from her \ninsurance company was a 30-percent premium increase--a 30-percent \npremium increase. She was at the point where she was just able to \nafford what she had. Madam President, 30 percent more is more than she \ncould afford, so Lisa has now become yet another uninsured American. A \npublic option will help because it will make health care affordable for \npeople who want to have insurance, can be insured, but are not always \ninsured. Lisa is a good example.\n  Our friends on other side often talk about the people who are \nuninsured as if they are some like alien species; that it is actually \nless than we think and we do not really need to worry about it; it is \nonly just a few million here and there. The fact is, in the last year \nand the year before, 87 million Americans like Lisa had a period in \nwhich they were uninsured. They went without health insurance. You know \nhow scary that is. Somebody is not just uninsured; they are a mom, they \nare a worker, they are part of a family, and something goes wrong and \nsuddenly they cannot afford their insurance, and for a while they are \nuninsured, and then maybe they try to come back again. They get lucky; \nsomebody in the family gets a job who gets coverage; they find a way to \nafford it. But there were 87 million Americans who, in those 2 years, \nwent without health insurance.\n  Do you want to know what 87 million Americans is? That is why this \nchart I have in the Chamber is colored yellow and red. If you go west \nof the Mississippi River and take the population of every single State, \nincluding the State of New Mexico, which is Senator Udall's home \nState--and you just take out California--if you take every single one \nof those States and add them all up, that is 87 million people. That is \nthe population of every single one of those red-marked States, from \nMinnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana, and go all the way \nwest--except for California--all of those States, if you add them all \nup, the population of every single one of those States, that is the \nnumber of people who in those 2 years at some point were without \ninsurance. So it is important that we take that burden off these nearly \n90 million American families.\n  Even for those who have insurance, this is a big deal because folks \nwho have insurance find they go bankrupt very often. Right now in \nAmerica, 62 percent of all bankruptcies are health care related. That \nis why American families go to bankruptcy more than any other reason--\nbecause of health care. I tell you, you can make fun of systems like \nCanada's or England's or France's; you do not see families going into \nbankruptcy because of health care in those countries.\n  This is a national tragedy that is happening to those families, which \nis totally unnecessary. Of that 62 percent of bankruptcies--where the \nfamily was doing fine, and a health care emergency put them over the \nedge and forced them to go into bankruptcy, where they lose their home, \nthey lose their credit--78 percent of those bankruptcies--four out of \nevery five of those bankruptcies happened to families who had health \ninsurance.\n  So if you are listening to this and you are wondering why it is \nimportant we get this reform, because you think: I am insured, I am all \nset, I am not part of the problem, well, you are very lucky you have \nnot yet had the experience of finding all those holes in your insurance \ncoverage, because I will tell you what, for these families--four out of \nevery five of the health care bankruptcies in this country--they \nthought they were covered too. It was a rude and sad awakening when \ntheir insurance companies started calling them up and saying: Sorry, we \nare not actually going to be able to cover you. We found an exception. \nWe are rescinding the policy. We are throwing you off. We do not cover \nthat. And they had to pay and pay and pay until everything they set \naside, everything they worked for, everything they tried to build up \nfor a secure future for themselves and their families was down the \nspout, lost in a bankruptcy because their health insurance was not \nthere when they needed it. That is another reason we need a solid \npublic option, so there is an alternative to that kind of behavior, \nbecause it does not just keep people out of the insurance market, it \nclobbers people who think they are safely insured.\n  Madam President, I yield to Senator Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I say to Senator \nWhitehouse, I want to ask you a question and see what evidence there \nwas in the HELP Committee because what I understand in New Mexico is, \nif you look at the uninsured--I showed a chart in the Chamber a little \nbit earlier--one in four New Mexicans is uninsured. The big question \nis, Who are the uninsured? Who are the folks out there who are \nuninsured? As shown on this chart, adults under the age of 65, 31 \npercent; working New Mexicans, 31.4 percent; Hispanic Americans, 49 \npercent. So the uninsured are people we fight for every day, people we \nknow, people we run into.\n  I know in the HELP Committee one of the things really focused on was \nthe fact that we are talking about working people, working families who \ndo not have insurance. They are out there in these smaller businesses. \nI know when you worked on the bill in the committee, you heard that \nkind of evidence. And you know your Rhode Island situation. Could you \ntalk a little bit about that because I think people somehow think, like \nyou said--I think you said earlier that being uninsured is from a \nforeign planet or something. These are people who are in our midst all \nthe time. They are working hard, but they cannot afford insurance, and \nthese small businesses cannot afford insurance to cover them. I was \nwondering if you could talk about that a little bit.\n  I see Senator Burris from Illinois has also joined us.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I will speak briefly so the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois can follow up. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for the question.\n  In 2007, 2008--2 recent years--nearly 90 million Americans went \nwithout health insurance at one point or another. That is close to one \nin every three Americans, which means as you go around your \nneighborhood, the fellow with the truck delivering oil to heat your \nhome; the lady in the corner at the bookstore; the guy who owns the gas \nstation down the road--innumerable people whom you know in your real, \nregular life are in those nearly one in three Americans who are going \nthrough a period being without health insurance coverage. Some of them \nare going to be young people who choose not to do it. Some are between \njobs, and they rely on an employer to provide coverage because good \nluck buying coverage on your own in this country if you do not have an \nemployer to argue the price down for you.\n  But I think it is really important that we press back against the \nnotion that some of our colleagues are pushing forward: that there is \nthis little group of uninsured who just kind of are not regular people \nand are different and are a problem, that they are not part of the \nAmerican fabric. It is one in nearly three Americans who goes in and \nout of health insurance coverage.\n  As a parent, I have to tell you, if I had to go home at night and \ntuck my kids in and then go to bed myself and talk to my wife and be \nthinking about what might happen the next day if they got sick because \nwe did not have health insurance for them--what an agony for a family \nto go through that period, when everything is at risk, when you are one \nillness away from losing everything you have. We put 90 million people \nthrough that in the last 2 years. It is real people, working people, \nreal families, and they feel a lot of pain. That is one of the reasons \nwe have to act. We have to get the reform bill done. It is for them, \nnot for the special interests.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I say to Senator \nWhitehouse, thank you very much.\n  One of the things I have just realized now, one of the things the \nthree of us have in common is we were all attorneys general. I am proud \nof that fact. I am very proud of my service as attorney general. I know \nyou both are. We were out there as attorneys general fighting for these \nworking Americans we are talking about, whether it was consumer \nprotection or doing law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\n  Madam President, I say to Senator Burris, I know those working \nfamilies the Senator worked for back in the 1990s are the same working \nfamilies he is fighting for on the public option. Could you jump in \nhere? I know you have a situation in Illinois where you have traveled \nthroughout the State. You have taken a measure of what is happening in \nIllinois with regard to health insurance. What would you say?\n  Mr. BURRIS. Well, Madam President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico and the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, it is \ncertainly an honor for me to be able to participate in this discussion.\n  I just left my 50th college reunion down in southern Illinois, where \nI had attended Southern Illinois University. I was introduced at the \nfootball game, by the way, which SIU won 46 to 23 or something like \nthat. We beat Illinois State University. They announced me in about the \nthird quarter.\n  Well, after the game was over, I say to the Senators, there was a \nline of people lined up to talk to me. What were they saying in that \nline? Most of them were saying: Senator, whatever you do, we want you \nto keep a public option in that insurance bill.\n  I said: Well, there are three bills in the House, and they have a \npublic option in them. The bill that came out of the HELP Committee \nhere in the Senate has a public option. And we have not gotten the \nFinance Committee bill--as of last Saturday. But we just passed that \nbill the other day. Now, it does not carry a public option. What I am \nsaying is, I do not see how we can address all of these issues dealing \nwith health care rather than sick care, which is what has been taking \nplace in America, without dealing with something that is going to \ncreate competition, create a reduction in costs, and, of course, cover \nmillions of Americans. Senator Whitehouse just talked about that 90 \nmillion--well, 47 million who are underinsured, and another 25 million \nto 30 million who are uninsured. So those are the problems we are \nhaving, and that is what it is going to take in order for us to get \nreform in America.\n\n  It is unconscionable to think we could do insurance reform and think \nthat the insurance companies are going to not continue to make their \nprofits. As a matter of fact, I spoke about this on the floor a few \nmoments ago. Would you believe that what they have done is criticize \nthe bill that came out of the Finance Committee? They have played into \nour hands. They have criticized that bill, talking about how much money \nit is going to cost, which gives us the best reason we would need a \npublic option: because the premiums are going to go up if they don't \nhave any competition.\n  When we look at their profits over the years, we see a 428-percent \nincrease in their profits from 2000 to 2007. That is unacceptable. It \nis just unacceptable.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. As a former attorney general who had antitrust and \nconsumer responsibilities, how many industries can the Senator think of \nthat would get to announce to the world, if this bill passes: We are \ngoing to raise our prices! If you are in a competitive marketplace and \nyou are not colluding with each other, how on Earth do you know as an \nindustry that you are going to get to raise your prices, you are going \nto be able to decide to raise your prices? Isn't the market supposed to \ndo that?\n  Mr. BURRIS. It is market driven, that is correct. If they do, they \nhave collusion going on in terms of everybody raising their prices so \nthey would be competitive, and they couldn't then go to choice and \nthereby keep the rates up and their profits up. So we are talking to \nthe current AGs. If they would do this, we might have an antitrust \naction, but that certainly is a circumstance we must be concerned with \nin terms of how they are seeking to increase their prices, and they \nmight even be involved in a little price fixing.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Senator Whitehouse and Senator Burris, if \nyou would just give me a second, I want to make sure he talks about the \nsituation of workmen's compensation in the State of Rhode Island. I \nbelieve several States--and you have had experience with this--have \nexperimented with a public option in the workmen's compensation \ncontext. It tells us a lot about what public option would mean if we \nput this in our health care bill.\n  Could the Senator speak to that a little bit?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We have heard a lot about how, if we let a public \noption go forward, it will give terrible customer service, horrible \ncustomer service. Senators have said it will be the worst combination \nof the IRS and the local Department of Motor Vehicles. But we can go to \na State such as Wyoming, which is the home State, for instance, of the \nvery distinguished ranking member on the HELP Committee who is also on \nthe Finance Committee and, indeed, was one of the negotiators with \nSenator Baucus. When he goes home, he goes home to a workers' \ncompensation system that is a single-payer, government-run system. The \nWyoming business community doesn't seem to complain about it. So \nobviously, the customer service can't be that terrible because they \nwould be thrown out if they were that terrible.\n  The other thing we hear about the public option is that if we let it \nin the door, it will take over the system because a public insurance \nplan can't compete fairly with private plans. There are predators who \nwill be let loose in the system, we have heard people say. Well, half \nthe States in the country have public plans that sell insurance in the \nworkers' compensation market which provides--about half of it is health \ninsurance. Some of it is paid back wages that were lost, but the rest \nof it is health insurance. It is little things such as carpal tunnel, \nit is terrible wrecks that occur, chronic conditions. All the different \naspects of health care that get provided by health insurance also get \nprovided by workmen's compensation insurance.\n  If we go to Arizona, for instance, which is the home State of the \nvery distinguished Senator McCain who ran for President on the \nRepublican ticket, and Senator Kyl who is the assistant Republican \nleader of the Republican Party--they go home to a State where there is \nan Arizona public workers' compensation plan that has been competing \nwith the private sector in that market, I believe, since 1925. I don't \nhave my notes in front of me, but my recollection is that it was from \n1925. So for 80 years, they have been running in competition with the \nprivate sector.\n  That doesn't sound to me as though once we let the government in, \ncompetition is doomed.\n  The distinguished minority leader, Senator McConnell, goes home to \nKentucky. In the Kentucky workers' compensation system there is a \nprivate plan. The Kentucky workers' compensation plan, run by the \nState, is a public plan. It goes out and competes day to day with the \nprivate plans. It adds to the healthy marketplace. It adds to the \nchoices that Kentucky business owners have. I have never heard Leader \nMcConnell or Senator McCain come to the floor to criticize the workers' \ncompensation public plans that operate at home.\n  So I think there are at least some examples that disprove some of the \nworst arguments that have been made about the public option: that it \nwill give us terrible public service--well, the single-payer, all-\ngovernment plan in Wyoming seems to disprove that--and that half of the \nStates in which there is a competitive plan, including Arizona and \nKentucky, would seem to disprove the notion that as soon as we let a \npublic plan in to compete, it will take over. It just hasn't, it just \ndoesn't, and the actual facts--what the military calls the facts on the \nground--are different than the rhetoric in the air.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Senator Whitehouse, if I can interject at \nthis point, I think you have given great examples of why we need a \npublic option. As part of health care reform we are going to be doing \nin the next couple of weeks in the Senate--we have a Senate Finance \nCommittee bill out of the Finance Committee now and we have the HELP \nCommittee bill and our leadership is putting those two bills together--\nwe have to have a public option be a part of the bill.\n  Senator Burris was visiting a little bill earlier about Illinois and \nthe Illinois citizens and their comments on the public option. The \nSenator from Illinois may want to join in with what Senator Whitehouse \nsaid about that competitive factor with workmen's compensation.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I think we must also give what is a very \nsimple\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\ndefinition because I think the term has gotten misconstrued in terms of \nwhat the public option is. I hope our colleagues will understand it is \nnothing but choice. It will give the person who is uninsured, if they \ncannot get insurance--let's say the person has a preexisting condition \nand they lose their job and that person goes to get insurance and they \nwill not insure that person. Hopefully, our bill would take away the \npreexisting condition problem.\n  Let's just say the premiums are too high. Well, if there is a public \nplan, that person can go in and then acquire his or her insurance based \non his or her income and ability to pay. That is what we are talking \nabout. That is the option an uninsured person would have. That option \nwill entitle that person to get health insurance. It also, under this \nlegislation, would entitle that person to get preventive care, which \nwould prevent that person from getting a chronic disease or getting to \nthe point where a disease gets chronic and they end up going to the \nemergency room in order to get service.\n  So we are talking about saving funds. We are talking about cutting \ndown on the cost. We are talking about eliminating premiums.\n  So I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, it is crucial \nthe words ``public option'' don't turn people off because it has gotten \nto the point where it is creating problems in itself, the definition. \nBut the purpose is to make sure those persons who don't have insurance \nwill get insurance.\n  The President has said this. President Obama said: If you have your \ninsurance and you like your doctor, we are not going to touch you. The \nreform would not interfere with you. Therefore, we are going to have it \nso that all of those almost 90 million Americans can get insurance, \nwhich will mean it will cut down on the costs we are all paying because \nof those persons who have to go to emergency rooms and who are not \ninsured.\n  So I hope our colleagues will understand how important this piece in \nthe whole reform bill is, where there will be choice for Americans, \nchoice so they can select a company and not be paying premiums through \ntheir nose because premiums are going to go up. If we don't get reform, \nif we don't have reform for competition, if we don't do public option--\nthis document says if we compete with private companies, these \ncompanies will raise their rates during this critical time by 111 \npercent. If we look at the profits they are making now and over the \nyears, we will find those profits have been exorbitant. Therefore, I \nwill say to my colleagues, it is key, even to my State of Illinois \nwhere we have only two insurance companies doing 69 percent of the \ninsurance--that is almost a monopoly on who gets insurance--but two \ncompanies in Illinois, and we are a State of 13 million people. When \ntwo companies cover 69 percent of those who are insured, that, to me, \nis just not enough competition for rates to be reasonable so it is \naffordable.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the distinguished Senator from Illinois yield \nbecause he has made such an important point.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. He made the point about the lack of competition out \nthere right now. I know that in Illinois, the lead company has nearly \n50 percent market share, and the second company, a 22-percent market \nshare, for a grand total of 70 percent market share, just in those two \ncompanies.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. But it is not just a problem in Illinois. There are \n39 States--39 States--in which the top two insurers--just the top two \ninsurers--have the majority of the market; more than 50 percent of the \nmarket, just between two companies. In nine States, one insurance \ncompany--one insurance company--has more than 70 percent market share, \none company.\n  So the notion that there is a lot of competition going on out there \nisn't supported by the facts. If you are in one of those nine States \nwhere there is one insurer that has more than 70 percent of the market, \nyou don't have a lot of choice. That insurer has extraordinary market \npower, particularly since they are immune to the antitrust laws.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Extraordinary market power, and in the 39 States \nwhere more than 50 percent of the market is captured by only two \ninsurance companies, they have extraordinary room to raise prices and \nfix prices and work with each other to make sure they maximize profits \ninstead of taking care of regular folks, the folks I talked about \nearlier, real people who suffer real consequences. The result of it is \nthat our health care expenditures are going through the roof.\n  I was born in 1955. In 1955, we spent $12 billion a year on health \ncare. In 1979, I just got out of college. It grew nearly 20 times, to \n$219 billion that we spent on health care as a country. In 1987, I was \njust about to have my first child, my daughter, half a trillion \ndollars, $500 billion. In 1992, we spent $850 billion. Here we are in \n2009, $2.5 trillion. Look at the direction on the chart--the direction \nof that spending curve. We have to turn that around. Everybody in \nAmerica, the insured, uninsured, doctors, nurses, hospitals, everybody \nhas an interest in us getting this right and getting this bill passed \nso we can turn it around. I don't want to make a joke out of this, but \ndo you remember the last time we had tried for health insurance reform, \nthe insurance industry, which has turned on us now, turned on us then \nwith Harry and Louise, who were that nice couple who raised all these \nworries and fears. They always worked with fear. I said the other day \nthat Harry and Louise are not the problems; now it looks like Thelma \nand Louise. With those health care costs climbing, we are headed for \nthe cliff, and we are all in the car together. It will be Democrats who \nhave to work together to solve that problem before we go off that \ncliff.\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. That is key. I am looking at 29 of our colleagues in this \nbody calling for a public option. That is a tremendous number.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wouldn't be surprised if it were more.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Maybe there are 30 of us who signed the letter at this \npoint. Just what the Senator said--it is crucial that we now think \nabout 30 more. We have to work on that.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. We have now been joined by Senator Brown \nfrom Ohio. As the Senators who are on the floor know, he led an effort \nlike this last week to put the public option forward. He has been \namazing in terms of being dogged and being here on the floor fighting \nfor the public option. I know he talks frequently about how people in \nOhio have a real passion for this.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senators. Back in our States, Rhode Island, \nNew Mexico, Illinois, Ohio, and Washington, we all hear from \nconstituents all the time who are unsure of what their future is with \nhealth care. Too often they are denied coverage with preexisting \nconditions. Too often they have annual caps or lifetime caps on \ncoverage. They thought they had good insurance. In fact, what I found \nin the mail I got from Springfield, Cleveland, Dayton, Oxford, and \nother communities is people thought they had pretty good insurance, and \nthey find out, once they get circumstances when they needed insurance, \nit is not so great. They get sick and they have huge hospital bills and \nthey have huge doctor costs or other expenses and they get a note from \nthe insurance company that they are not going to cover that.\n  Some of the letters that break my heart are from people who clearly \nare under so much stress because of breast cancer or because their \nchild is sick and they are spending hours a week fighting with \ninsurance companies. It is those people who thought they had good \ninsurance who find out it is not so great after all and they really \nsupport the public option. They understand we are going to change the \nrules in this legislation. No more disallowing care for preexisting \nconditions, no more caps or discrimination based on gender, race, or \ndisability. They also know insurance companies are good at gaming the \nsystem. Without a public option, so many people think insurance \ncompanies will continue to game the system, even though we have written \nbetter rules in this bill. They understand insurance companies such as \nMedicare doesn't--excuse me, the public option, like Medicare, won't \ndisallow somebody for a preexisting condition and throw them off \ninsurance. They will keep the costs down. We know what the insurance \ncompanies said a couple\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\ndays ago when they talked about costs going way up as if they have not \ndoubled that anyway in the last 8 or 9 years. That was one more call \nand is actually is the best endorsement yet of why we need the public \noption.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Not to belabor the obvious, but could he comment on \nwhy it is that a for-profit private insurance company might pursue \nthings such as rescission, which is when they throw you off a policy \nwhen you get sick because they found an error in your form, and you \nhave been counting on the policy for years, but suddenly you are sick \nand they throw you out the door? What might the difference be between a \nfor-profit insurance company and a public option when they are looking \nat that circumstance?\n  Mr. BROWN. Right. I will answer it in a fairly unusual way. I have a \nfriend who is a lawyer for a company that produces soap. She said to \nme: I am glad we have a strong EPA because we are doing what I want to \ndo anyway, and now our competitors have to.\n  If you are an insurance executive--if the four of us were insurance \nexecutives and I disallow people and I put caps on coverage because of \npreexisting conditions, and I do rescission, you are all going to have \nto do that. A lot of people may think this group of Senators up here \nhates insurance companies. I think insurance companies operate in their \nown short-term financial self-interests. That is why we need different \nrules, so they cannot deny care this way, and that is why we need a \npublic option, which sets a gold standard. Public option will not use \nrescission. Public option will not deny care or put a cap on coverage \nor discriminate. Public option will not use preexisting conditions to \nkeep people off. The public option will set the standard. So if these \nother private companies want to compete--and Senator Whitehouse and I \nand our staffs in the HELP Committee wrote most of the language for the \npublic option in a way that there would be a level playing field, and \nthey will compete with Cigna and Aetna and United and WellPoint and \nthese other companies in a fair way. We may not see the Aetna or Cigna \nCEOs making $22 million next year because you can make that kind of \nmoney because you are cutting people off, you are using rescission. \nOnce these insurance companies have to go under a set of rules, \nenforced in part by the public option, these salaries and profits may \nnot be so gargantuan as the insurance companies have enjoyed all these \nyears.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I mentioned earlier that in Rhode Island a for-profit \ninsurer with only 16 percent market share, in a State of only a million \npeople--you are all from bigger States; Rhode Island is a million \npeople. It had 16 percent market share. It extracted in 1 year $37 \nmillion in profit to repatriate to its headquarters out of State--$37 \nmillion. Imagine how much care you could provide to 16 percent of a \nmarket of a million people with $37 million, if you put that back into \nhealth care instead of taking it out in profit.\n  Mr. BROWN. As the public option mostly will do.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, as the public option would do.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. We are near the end of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator. I point out tonight \nthat we have had a number of Senators come down here, and we have also \nbeen presided over by the gracious Senator from the State of \nWashington, Senator Cantwell. I know she is a strong proponent of a \npublic option. We have had Senator Cardin from Maryland, Senator Brown \nfrom Ohio, Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island; we had our \ndistinguished majority whip, Senator Durbin, here talking about public \noption. We have also had Senator Roland Burris from Illinois. So we \nhave had a key group here.\n  We are going to continue to do this because, as Senators Brown and \nWhitehouse and Burris know, we have to get this done. Our constituents \nwant it. The American people want it. There was a poll done, and 72 \npercent of the American people want to see a public option here.\n  I don't know if any other Senators want to sum up.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Well, 72 percent of the doctors also are supportive of \nthe public option.\n  Mr. BROWN. I know one doctor who may not be for it on the other side \nof the Chamber.\n  The Robert Johnson Foundation found that more than 70 percent of the \nphysicians supported the public option.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank Senator Coburn for not objecting. I \nthank all Senators who appeared here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I listened off the floor to the debate \nof my colleagues. Many of the things that they identify as problems, I \ncertainly agree with. Where we part company--having been in the health \ncare field for over 25 years, and having practiced medicine during that \nperiod of time--is on the solutions they propose. Oftentimes, that will \ndestroy the best of medicine that we have in America today and will \nrender a larger government with less freedom in our country.\n  I want to address a couple of the issues. From the start, the \nassumption of those for the public option is that the government has \ndone a good job with the health care programs they run today. I wanted \nto give a little history and put forth a little history.\n  There is no question that Medicare has benefited millions of \nAmericans, and will continue to do so if we can figure out a way to pay \nfor it, which is one of the sad things about the pay-fors in this \nbill--that we are going to borrow $500 billion and take another $500 \nbillion out of Medicare and create another program, when Medicare is \nnot funded. If you go through health care today in the country, 61 \npercent of all health care expenditures in this country go through the \ngovernment. If 61 percent is already going through the government and \nwe are having health care inflation at 7 or 8 percent, why is it that \nif we are so good in 61 percent of it, we still have these kinds of \nproblems as a whole? And actually health care inflation inside \ngovernment programs is higher than outside government programs, which \nproves the point that we should not eliminate health insurance \ncompanies, but we should make them more efficient and streamlined.\n  The assumption behind the public option is this: They look at \nMedicare and at the administrative costs of Medicare and say that is \nall it costs to run Medicare. Then they look at the 10(k)s, the profit \nand loss statements of the insurance industry, and say look how high \nthat is. If you take all of the health care insurance industry as a \npercentage of the dollars spent in health care and look at their \nexpenses and their profit and their costs for running their business, \nin terms of cost of capital, and compare it to the true cost of running \nMedicare, what you find is Medicare costs about 3 or 4 percent more to \nrun than private health care.\n  Nobody could be more disturbed as a practicing physician than I am \nabout wanting to rein in the abuses in the insurance industry. Their \nanswer is to create competition with a government plan. I believe you \ncreate competition by creating real competition. A government plan, \ngovernment option isn't competition. It is the elimination of any other \nmarket in health care. How do we know that? We know that the way people \nare going to sign up for a government plan is because it is going to be \ncheaper. If you take the same factors--for example, the 15-percent \nfraud rate in Medicare and Medicaid--and add that to the cost of the \nplan, what you are going to see is we are going to end up subsidizing \nthe government plan to a greater extent than even CBO would put \nforward. I will have a report in the next couple weeks that will \noutline CBO's accuracy on health care costs since they have been \nscoring them since 1965. I can tell you right now that the record is \natrocious. Sometimes they missed it by 15,000 percent. They \nunderestimate what the costs are.\n  I want to share a story about two of my patients over the last 6 or 7 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\nI also want to share another story about somebody I talked to this \nweek, whose son dropped out of medical school and chose to not go to \nmedical school. He was accepted, but he chose not to go because of this \nvery debate and the likelihood that the government will become more \ninvolved in health care.\n  The story I want to tell goes to the very real need that my \ncolleagues were addressing, which is true changes in health insurance. \nEverybody in this body wants to address the cost issue because that \nissue is what is driving the problems with health care. If somebody \ndoesn't have access, it is not because it is not available out there, \nit is because they don't have the money to buy the access. So cost \nbecomes the first stumbling block. Whatever we do, the No. 1 thing we \nought to do is try to decrease the costs associated with health \ncare. How do we do that? Do we do that by modeling Medicare, Medicaid, \nSCHIP, Indian health care, VA? Is that how we do it? Or can we do it in \na way that will truly drive down the costs? There is no estimate out \nthere about the actual cost reductions in the bills that are coming \nforward, either the Finance Committee bill or the HELP Committee bill. \nThe HELP Committee bill actually raises the cost of health care. Should \nwe be about figuring out how to lower costs? Let me give some examples.\n\n  Safeway has had no increase in health care costs for the last 4\\3/4\\ \nyears. How did they do it? They created incentives for their employees \nto stay healthy. When I say incentives, they were paying their \nemployees cash money to change their behavior. They are limited on how \nmuch they can do that by a law called HIPAA, and, in fact, if they \ncould do more, then they actually could have had a marked decline in \ntheir health care costs.\n  Then there is a company called MedEncentive where they run the \ninsurance program for communities' municipal employees. Everywhere they \nhave been they have lowered the cost of health care. How do they do it? \nThey incentivize doctors by paying them more and incentivize patients \nby agreeing to do what the doctor says by cutting off their deductible \nor lowering the cost of their prescriptions if, in fact, they will \nfollow good practices, best practices in terms of their care.\n  There are other examples such as Asheville, NC, where they have had a \nmarked decrease. On average, what we have seen is a 20 to 30-percent \ndecrease in health care. There is not a government involved in any of \nthat.\n  I want to go back. Why is it that we view a government option as the \nanswer? Because we perceive that the government can do it more \nefficiently and we perceive that is the only way you force competition \nin the health insurance industry. I agree, there is no significant \ncompetition in the health insurance industry. But having the government \ncompete in it versus forcing competition is where we divide and go \naway.\n  The second reason they want a government option is the following: If \nyou are my age, in your early sixties, what is going to happen to you \nin Medicare is you are not going to have the same care that the people \nin the last 10 years have had because the reason they want a government \noption and the reason we want what is called a comparative \neffectiveness board is because the real reason for having a public \noption and a comparative effectiveness board is to mandate what can and \ncannot happen to you.\n  As a physician who has delivered thousands of babies and cared for \nevery complication in gynecology and obstetrics one can imagine, as a \nphysician who has cared for thousands of children from birth to high \nschool, as a physician who has taken care of grandmas and grandpas in \ntheir elder years with complications from heart failure to cancer to \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease to pneumonia to anything else, \nwhat is going to happen is the options are going to be limited.\n  The ultimate undercurrent of why we need and want a public option is \nthat we will eventually create a system where most of America, about 82 \nmillion people, who have private insurance today will be in that public \noption and they will decide what you can and cannot have, which is \ncounterintuitive to how we allocate scarce resources everywhere else in \nthe country. We do allow the forces of competition to allocate it, but \nit requires individual personal responsibility. It requires a \ntransparent market, which I agree we do not have. It requires real \ncompetition, which I agree we do not have. But the answer is not \nanother government program.\n  Now back to the two examples in my practice. I give these examples \nbecause I want people to see what is going to happen as the government \nbecomes more and more involved in health care.\n  These are two patients I have cared for over 20 years each presented \nat different periods of time with no true signs or symptoms of \nsignificant disease other than the fact that having known these people \nfor years, I sensed something was different. I ordered a test. It was \ndenied by the insurance company. I managed to get my friends, who \nhappen to have an MRI who also practice medicine on a not-for-profit \nbasis, do an MRI on this one gentleman. It just so happens the \ngentleman had the same disease that Senator Kennedy recently succumbed \nto. No signs, no physical diagnosis.\n  The only thing that allowed me to query that was the art of medicine. \nNot the book training, not the gray hair, not the experience, but the \ngut of knowing and having seen and been experienced with a patient over \na long period of time to say something has changed. In fact, the \ninsurance company came back and paid for the MRI.\n  An identical thing happened about 4 months later with another \nindividual. One of those individuals, by the way, is still alive. The \nother, unfortunately, succumbed.\n  So we do need real competition in the insurance industry. We need to \nmake sure we create that. The debate between what my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle offered tonight is how do you best do that. Do \nyou do that by setting up a government program that is infinitely \nfunded and will actually charge rates that will be under the true costs \nand will be just like another Medicare Program where we have an \nunfunded, long-term liability that our kids are going to have to pay \nfor, close to $75 trillion? That is the worry. That is what the real \ndebate is.\n  I thought I would spend a minute talking about can we fix health care \nwithout tremendously growing the size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment. You cannot even talk about health care until you are \nwilling to talk about what we are doing today. What we are doing today \nand what we are going to be doing tomorrow, and, if this bill passes, \nwhat we are going to be doing for the next 20 years is borrowing a \nlarge percentage of the money we will spend from our grandkids. That is \nan unsustainable course. It is not one that we can achieve.\n  As we do that, we end up with youngsters such as this. If you cannot \nread this, it says: ``I'm already $38,375 in debt and I only own a \ndollhouse.'' That is a pretty stark statement. Here is a cute little \ngirl on whom her parents have put a placard. Her parents obviously \nrecognize that we are spending money we don't have on things we don't \nneed.\n  I am not saying there isn't anybody in this body who doesn't want \nhealth care reform. Nobody probably wants it more than I do. It is the \ntype and how we get there that is important and do we make her \nsituation worse. Do we raise the amount of money we are borrowing to be \nable to fix a problem that is going to be a government-centered problem \nrather than a patient-centered focus?\n  Then we have this quote from Thomas Jefferson:\n\n       I predict future happiness for Americans if they can \n     prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people \n     under the pretense of taking care of them.\n\n  That is a pretty interesting statement and pretty insightful and \nforetelling because that is exactly where our Nation finds itself \ntoday--``wasting the labors of the people under the pretense'' that the \ngovernment will take care of them.\n  In about 10 years, government spending is going to be about 35 \npercent to 40 percent of our economy, and that is if we make it in the \nnext 10 years given the present financial difficulties we have. But if \nwe think and ponder a little bit about what Jefferson had to say and we \nlook at the Constitution, what we find is that through the last 20, 30, \n40 years in this country, back to 1965, we started stepping outside the \nbounds\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\nof the enumerated powers that our forefathers brought forth. We have \nignored them. Consequently, now we have government program after \ngovernment program and agency after agency and we cannot afford it. We \nare borrowing the money. Under the guise of taking care of U.S. \ncitizens, we can rationalize it.\n  America's health care is the best in the world. It just happens to be \nthe most expensive. There are lots of ways to drive that cost down that \nare not at all considered in the bills in front of the Congress. \nIncentivizing people to do the right thing, the best thing, \nincentivizing the elimination--do you realize that 80 percent of the \ncost of health care today is defensive medicine; that if you attacked \nit slightly, not by eliminating lawsuits but by eliminating frivolous \nlawsuits--let me give the details. Ninety percent of all the suits that \nare filed never go to court and never get settled and never get \nanswered. In other words, they are extortion claims. There is not a \nreal medical claim. There is not a real issue, and it is not carried \nforward. Of the 10 percent that are either settled or carried forward, \n89 percent of those are decided in favor of the medical community. So \nthat is 11 percent of 10 percent, which is 1 percent of the cases.\n  If, in fact, we did not have the 90 percent of the cases that are \nfrivolous, that are extortion attempts, what we know is that we could \nsave about--CBO says under their score with limited liability changes, \n$54 billion over the next 10 years. Other sources say it is closer to \n$74 billion, $75 billion. Madam President, $74 billion to $75 billion a \nyear does a lot to help individuals in terms of free care, in terms of \nlowering the cost of care because, in fact, every insurance company in \nthe country is paying for that care.\n  Finally, I will make one other point, and it is this. What most \nAmericans do not recognize is that in this new bill that is coming out \nof the Finance Committee, there is a significant number of taxes. \nActually, you are going to recognize the fourth tax on health care in \nthis country. Right now you pay income taxes and a large portion of \nthat income tax is now paying for Medicare and Medicaid--57 percent of \nit and 43 percent we are borrowing.\n  The second tax you pay is a Medicare tax of 1.45 percent and your \nemployer pays 1.45 percent of every dollar you earn no matter how much \nyou earn.\n  The third tax you pay is your private health insurance, whether you \nbuy it through your employer or you buy it yourself, costs $1,700 more \nper year because of the underpayment for the cost of health care for \nMedicare and Medicaid. So the cost of actually purchasing your health \ncare goes up by about $150 a month per family because we underpay the \ntrue cost of care under Medicare and Medicaid, and they are both broke.\n  Now we have a fourth tax of which 50 percent is going to be levied on \npeople from $40,000 to $140,000 a year, billions and billions of \ndollars of new taxes.\n  Then we have taxes on the insurance industry. I don't have any \nproblem with that--taxes on medical devices, taxes on PhRMA. But who is \ngoing to pay those taxes? Those taxes are going to get filtered down to \nthe increased cost of health care. When we pay a tax when we go to a \nstore to buy something, we pay that tax on top of the price.\n  So the groceries or the TV or whatever it did cost--what we thought \nit cost--it would cost that plus tax. That tax, in terms of the \ninsurance industry, in terms of the Medicare, in terms of the drug \nindustry, in terms of the medical device industry, in terms of PhRMA, \nis going to get passed on, causing an increase in cost. That does not \ninclude the tax you will incur if you choose not to buy health \ninsurance because you think you are healthy or you want to self-insure \nyourself. You are going to pay a tax for that. Oh, by the way, if you \nhappen to have a great health care plan or maybe a moderate health care \nplan, the way the bill is written, you are eventually going to pay a \ntax because it is going to be too good a plan. So we are all going to \nhave four taxes on health care.\n  I wish to make one other comment. We all traveled during the month of \nAugust and we met with our constituents. This is the HELP bill that \ncame out of the committee after 3 weeks of hard work. This is not the \ncomplete bill that the Senate will be considering. This is just part of \nthe bill, and it is 840-some pages long. The standard protocol in \ncommittees, if you vote a bill out of committee and you have changes to \nit, what you do is put a modified bill on the floor--a substitute bill \nwhen the bill comes to the floor. Well, there are 85 changes to this \nbill that have not been approved by the committee. Yet this is the \ncommittee bill.\n  So not only do we have a debate that is erroneous in terms of the \ndirection it is taking--in creating a larger government, taking away \nindividual freedom, individual choice, limiting one's availability of \ninsurance, increasing premiums, increasing taxes, and taking away an \nindividual's ability to choose--we also have a bill that has been \nmodified, outside the rules of the Senate, 85 times versus the bill I \nvoted on in committee. That shouldn't surprise us, however, because of \nthe way we are handling health care.\n  So I will sum up with just a couple other points. I don't believe \nthere is an American out there who doesn't think we need to do \nsomething about making health care more affordable, more available, and \nfairer in its treatment. I don't think there is an American who doesn't \nagree that we have a lot of waste in the health care system that can be \neliminated. I don't think there is a physician out there who doesn't \nthink we need to make some changes in terms of competitiveness in \ninsurance and how that interferes with the decisionmaking by physicians \nand other caregivers. But I also don't think it is truly appreciated \nthat in this country, if you are sick, you are going to get the best \ntreatment anywhere in the world. It is just that it costs too much.\n  So how do we address that? Do we address that by growing the Federal \nGovernment and creating in this bill 88 new government programs with \nthe bureaucracies that come with it or do we enable people to have the \nfreedom to choose, to make their own choice about what they want and \nthey need? With the finance bill, we are going to tell you what you \nhave, we are going to tell you what the minimum is, we are going to \nlimit your choices, and we are going to see a run toward either a \nregional co-op plan or a public plan.\n  But there is no question that what we are going to see is government-\ncentered involvement in what we do and how we do it. That may be the \ndirection we ultimately go. But the loss that comes with that is the \nloss of freedom, a loss of choice, and a diminished demand for personal \nresponsibility and accountability, which is the very thing this young \nlady is counting on us doing the opposite of.\n  We are going to double our debt in the next 5 years. We are going to \ntriple it in the next 10 years. It is going to be worse than that \nbecause we are spending money like drunken sailors. What do we owe the \ngenerations who follow us? What is it that we owe them? Do we owe them \nthe heritage that was given to us? Are we going to transfer that \nheritage on, or are we going to ignore it?\n  In terms of health care, what is the best thing for our country in \nthe long term? Can we take on another $1.3 trillion of government at a \nconservative estimate, especially when you count what is going to \nhappen with what is called SGR--the physician payment reform? Can we \ntake on $1.3 trillion? Will it only be $1.3 trillion? Will we move \nanother 10 percent of our GDP to the government? Because that is what \nwe are doing. At what point in time does the American experiment quit \nworking?\n  I look forward to the debate on health care. The plans before us will \nraise premiums, decrease care, limit choice, and bankrupt our \ngrandkids. By saying no to that plan, it doesn't mean you don't want to \nfix health care. There are some great plans out there to fix health \ncare that don't cost money; that, according to CBO and others, will \ngive the same results but will not create the massive new Federal \nbureaucracies and take away personal freedom to make decisions about \nyou and your children and your family based on what your needs are, \nwhat your perception is, and what your ability is.\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time tonight, I yield the floor, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this evening, only an hour or so \nago, Senator Udall from New Mexico led a discussion with Senator Burris \nand Senator Whitehouse and others. I was there part of that time, with \nSenator Cantwell involved from the Chair. It was extolling the \nimportance of the public option, that it makes such a difference in \nterms of keeping the insurance industry honest, keeping costs down, and \nproviding extra choice, so if people want to choose private insurance, \nthey can; if they want to choose the pubic option, they can.\n  The insurance industry, in its wild claims only 2 days ago in a \nmanufactured report that an accounting firm did that was clearly \nincomplete and hastily done, claimed huge insurance company increases \nbased on our legislation. The fact is, they have already doubled \ninsurance rates in less than a decade, in only 7 or 8 years. That is as \ngood an argument for the public option as we can find.\n  In 5 minutes or so, I would like to speak to the Senate. I have come \nto this floor, night after night, reading letters from constituents I \nhave, from Trumbull County near Youngstown, near Summit County, the \nAkron area, from Cuyahoga County. These all happen to be, in this case, \nfrom northeast Ohio, from near Dayton or Cincinnati or Wilmington or \nChillicothe.\n  What I found in letters I am getting from my constituents, as is the \nPresiding Officer, I think, when he gets letters from Richmond or the \nWashington suburbs or from western Virginia, is that most of this mail \nI get comes from people who had good insurance policies, they thought, \nuntil they got really sick, and then their insurance policies would be \ncanceled or they would spend so much of their time fighting insurance \ncompanies just to get payment, to get payment for something they \nthought they were covered for. I would like to share a couple of these \nletters.\n  Beverly and Dennis from Trumbull County write:\n\n       My husband is 62 . . . and worked for the same factory for \n     42 years . . . last year the factory shut down and his \n     severance package was $8,500 before taxes and 3 months paid \n     insurance.\n\n  Forty-two years, $8,500 severance, 3 months paid insurance.\n\n       After the insurance ran out, we picked up COBRA, which will \n     be up this December right before Christmas. We've talked to \n     different private insurance companies, but without anything \n     really wrong with my health, they say my minor medical \n     condition diagnosed 30 years ago was a preexisting condition. \n     The best plan offered, just for me, was $1,000 a month with a \n     $10,000 deductible\n\n  A preexisting condition from 30 years before.\n\n       We have always been proud of our accomplishments over the \n     43 years of our marriage. I don't want to lose everything we \n     have worked so hard for if something happens to us medically.\n       I wish those opposed to reform--\n\n  I wish my colleagues would listen to this.\n\n       I wish those opposed to reform would have to worry about \n     the next meal, the next bill, the next doctor's appointment, \n     or what would happen to them if they got sick.\n       We thought things would be smooth sailing after we got to \n     our age, but we're afraid our boat is sinking and we are \n     drowning.\n\n  Forty-two years in the same plant, married for 43 years, played by \nthe rules, seemed to do everything right. This is what is happening to \nthese people in their early sixties.\n  As many of these letters indicate, a lot of these letters come from \npeople who are 59 or 63 or 61 or 64, just holding on until they can get \nMedicare because they know Medicare, like the public option, will never \ndrop them for preexisting conditions, will not discriminate against \nthem because of geography or age or disability, will not cut them out \nof their plan, whether it is the public option or whether it is \nMedicare, for all kinds of reasons the way private insurance does.\n  Angela from Cuyahoga County, Cleveland area:\n\n       As a registered nurse I have seen too many cases where the \n     lack of insurance prohibits needed care. I have experienced \n     first-hand what it means to have insurance but be afraid to \n     use it. My husband has worked for the same employer for more \n     than 10 years, but both he and I are afraid to use his \n     insurance for fear that too many medical bills will increase \n     the cost of our plan. In the past 2 years, he has received \n     memos stating that to keep medical bills down we should seek \n     medical visits only when necessary.\n       As a strong believer in preventive care, I feel discouraged \n     to go for my yearly physical and my husband has not had a \n     physical in 5 years.\n\n  This is from a nurse.\n\n       Thank goodness we are reasonably healthy. I encourage you \n     to keep pushing for a public option--I'd be one of the first \n     to sign up.\n\n  Think about that, her husband got a note from his employer saying: \nPlease don't go to the doctor unless you absolutely have to. She is a \nnurse. She hasn't had a physical for a year. She hasn't had her yearly \nphysical. Her husband hasn't had a physical in 5 years. They know they \nshould get a physical. They are afraid of what it would cost both them \nand the employer to do that. Again, they are the victims of the health \ncare system that too often skimps on preventive care, too often denies \npeople coverage for reasons it should not, too often simply is a burden \nto so many of the people who have insurance.\n\n  I will close with a letter that is about health care but also about \nsomething this Senate needs to vote on quickly; that is, unemployment \ninsurance. This is Mark from Franklin County, central Ohio. He writes:\n\n       I need my health insurance badly since I have had cancer \n     twice. The only way I could previously afford insurance was \n     through my employer. But my company was recently bought out \n     and I was laid off.\n       Because of my preexisting condition, I can't afford the \n     price of private insurance. In addition to my health and job \n     issues, I have only one more extension on unemployment.\n       I really don't know what to do if I can't afford insurance. \n     If I could find a way to receive insurance or get a job with \n     insurance, I could be here for my little girls who I care for \n     and who looks up to me for the world.\n\n  One person on the other side of the aisle, one Republican, stood up \nand objected. We were trying to pass the same unemployment insurance \nextension as they did in the House of Representatives. I know every \nDemocrat is for extending unemployment, and I know most Republicans are \nprobably for extending unemployment, but one Republican stood up and \nstopped us from doing that. That is so important because every day we \nfail to extend unemployment insurance, people are dropping off the \nunemployment insurance rolls and have to fend for themselves in ways \nthat they don't know what to do.\n  It is not as if people don't want to work. The situation clearly is \nthat people want to work, they are trying to find a job. In this \neconomy, in my State as in many States around this country, people \nsimply cannot find work, as hard as they are trying. We have an \nobligation to extend unemployment benefits. Not next month, not next \nyear, but tomorrow when we come back here, I am hopeful my Republican \nfriends across the aisle will not object to that extension of \nunemployment.\n  The last letter I will read is from Renee from Van Wert County, \nwestern Ohio, near the Indiana border. She writes:\n\n       I, along with 300 other workers, were locked out of our \n     company last year after it closed down and moved to Mexico. \n     We will be losing our benefits this month and it is urgent \n     you get unemployment extension passed as soon as possible. It \n     would help so much if we could get our benefits extended, at \n     least through the cold winter months.\n       I'm looking everywhere for a job and hope there is \n     something opens up by the spring and the economy will pick \n     up.\n       Thank you for reading my story and making me feel like \n     there is hope.\n\n  Renee, again, we will go to the floor tomorrow to try to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n  Renee points out, particularly with the winter months coming, people \nwill have to choose, if they don't have unemployment extension, between \nfood and heating their home and taking care of their kids and all the \nresponsibilities people have.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n  Somebody like Renee, from Van Wert County--I know Van Wert County. I \nspent a lot of time there. I know about the shutdown of this plant that \nwent to Mexico. There are 300 people who lost their jobs. It is not as \nif they don't want to work. They were working hard, showing up for work \nevery day. They were productive workers. They did what was asked of \nthem. They were taxpayers, were involved in Little League, involved in \ntheir community. Those 300 workers can't find work. It is not a \nquestion that there is a job out there for them; they were looking for \nwork. That is why it is so important, as they look for work, for them \nto get some help from their government. This is not welfare, extending \nunemployment insurance. It is called insurance, unemployment insurance, \nbecause they pay into it. They ought to get some help from that \nunemployment fund.\n  It is clear from this mail that people want this legislation to pass. \nThey know our health care bill will allow people who are happy with \ntheir insurance to stay in the insurance they have but will build \nconsumer protections around those policies--no more preexisting \nconditions, for instance, to deny care.\n  Second, this bill helps small business provide insurance as most \nsmall businesspeople do. They want to provide insurance for their \nemployees.\n  Third, this bill will help those who do not have insurance. They can \ngo into this insurance exchange and get insurance.\n  Fourth, this bill provides for a public option, so if they don't want \nto go to CIGNA or Wellpoint or United or one of the big health care \ncompanies, they can decide to sign up for the public option which will \nnever throw them off, just as Medicare would never disqualify their \ncoverage.\n  It is clear what we have to do in the next month. In my State alone, \nfrom Akron, to Ravenna, to Cleveland, to Garfield Heights, to Sylvania, \nto Cincinnati, 390 people in my State every day lose their insurance--\n390 people every single day lose their insurance. It is important that \nwe move as quickly as we can in the next month or so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10428-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

KENNEDY\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ngreat leader, inspiring public servant and American icon, Senator \nEdward Moore Kennedy.\n  I do not need to stand here and talk about what the Kennedy legacy \nhas meant and continues to mean to this country. It is, at this point, \nsimply a part of the fabric of our country.\n  I do not need to recite the resume of Edward Kennedy or extol his \nmany accomplishments. His life's work speaks for itself. It will stand \nthe test of time and, no doubt, become even more remarkable when viewed \nin hindsight.\n  I do not need to reiterate each of the noble causes Senator Kennedy \nfought for with passion and vigor. We know that his pursuit of dignity, \nopportunity and respect for every man and woman will benefit \ngenerations to come, and inspire so many more to carry on in the cause.\n  Yes, there is no doubt that Senator Edward Kennedy will be remembered \nfar into the future and that history will treat him well, but I want to \ntake some time today to talk about the people here and now that he \nleaves behind that may be the most telling about Ted Kennedy. In those \nmoments and for those people, we got a chance to see something very \nspecial.\n  For some people it was very personal moments shared between family \nand friends--the opportunity to know him in a way others could only \nhope to glimpse.\n  And some were his arch enemies at the podium while also his dearest, \nmost respected partners on causes behind closed doors.\n  Some became believers based on passion-filled political speeches \ndelivered from his earliest of days in the spotlight to some of his \nlast, spectacular moments right here on the Senate floor.\n  While others had their lives changed because he was brave enough to \nstand up for them when the cameras were not rolling and the majority \nwas not on his side.\n  Ted Kennedy, the lion of the Senate, would roar about the need for \nbetter health care, improved public schools, and providing help to \nworking families. He knew how to channel the emotion, the urgency and \nthe helplessness he saw in the eyes and heard in the voices of those he \nwas fighting for. And he didn't just beam it from the mountain tops--he \nworked on the solutions to these needs day in and day out with astute \nskill.\n  There is a Ted Kennedy that will be remembered in the history books \nand he will be great and strong and smart and good, but there is also a \nunique part of Ted Kennedy that will stay with many of us in our own \nspecial ways.\n  A politician. A public servant. A patriot. A prince of Camelot. A \nfighter. A negotiator. A liberal. A brother, husband, father, and \nfriend.\n  The Lion sleeps. . . .\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and \nadmiration of Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  By the time I took my seat in the Senate, Ted had already held his \nfor nearly four decades. He had already established himself as one of \nthe most influential members in this body's history. He had already \nintroduced hundreds of bills that became laws and shaped thousands of \nothers. He had already grown from youngest son to elder statesman and \nbecome an icon for millions of Americans.\n  Before I was ever elected, I respected Ted Kennedy. And after \nbecoming his colleague, my respect grew. I was privileged to serve with \nhim on the Judiciary Committee and to be ranking member when he chaired \nour Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees, and Border Security. We \nworked together closely, and that experience has made me a more \neffective Senator.\n  Ted Kennedy and I often held different principles, but we shared key \nconvictions too. We agreed that our immigration laws needed reform. We \nrecognized that judicial philosophy mattered. We believed that \nproviding advice and consent on appointments to the Federal bench was \nnot merely a right of Senators but one of our most solemn \nresponsibilities.\n  Ted Kennedy understood the power of language. On the Senate floor, he \nused words of passion, calling his colleagues to embrace grand visions \nwith great urgency. In bill negotiations, he used words with precision, \nunderstanding better than anyone how legislative language governs, and \nhow to codify his convictions into the law of the land.\n  Senator Kennedy and I shared an interest in the history of this body, \nand a special pride in those who held our seats before us. In my case, \nI have long admired Sam Houston, who liberated the people of Texas, \nserved as one of our first Senators, and raised his voice against \nsecession. In Ted's case, he looked to the great Daniel Webster, who \nalso stood for union, and for liberty.\n  Ted was drawn in particular to this quote by Webster:\n\n       Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its \n     powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great \n     interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation \n     may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\n\n  All Americans can agree that Ted Kennedy's service in the U.S. Senate \nis something worthy to be remembered. Sandy and I continue to keep his \nwife Vickie in our prayers. And we offer our condolences to all who \nmiss him most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10428-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10428-S10429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mel Martinez came to the United States from Cuba at the \nage of 15 as part of a humanitarian effort called Operation Peter Pan. \nWe are all familiar with the character of Peter Pan he is careless and \ndoes not want to grow up. He is sometimes selfish and often conceited. \nIt is ironic because Mel is the opposite of all of those attributes.\n  Mel Martinez arrived on our shores with no family and only the hope \nfor a\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\nbetter life. He had to grow up incredibly fast, and he did so with \ngreat determination. He worked hard to learn English, graduate from \ncollege and law school, and build a legal career and solid reputation.\n  And then he decided to selflessly give back to the community and \ncountry that had given him so much. He rose to the highest levels of \nour government as the 12th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \nunder President George W. Bush. He served from 2001 to 2003, an \nespecially trying time in our Nation's history. But his agency's focus \non rebuilding Lower Manhattan provided necessary healing for a city and \nits citizens.\n  In 2005, Mel was sworn in as the first Cuban American U.S. Senator. \nIt was a privilege to serve with him and to join together on many \nlegislative efforts. Most significant was our work on expanding freedom \nand democracy for the people of Cuba. Cubans have been stifled for too \nlong by a brutal communist dictator. They deserve a voice and an \nopportunity for a better life. Nobody knows that better than Mel \nMartinez, and I look forward to continuing our fight to support pro-\ndemocracy efforts.\n  Most recently, I was pleased to work with Mel on legislation to \npromote U.S. tourist destinations abroad. Florida and Nevada miss out \non vital international tourism dollars because the United States has no \nentity to promote our amazing tourism opportunities to other countries. \nI am confident that the Travel Promotion Act, cosponsored by Senator \nMartinez, will pass the Senate shortly and will represent another \naccomplishment by my former colleague to improve the lives of his \nconstituents and fuel success for all Americans.\n  I thank Mel Martinez for his decades of public service in Florida and \nhere in our Nation's Capital. He proved to us all that the hope for a \nbetter life combined with determination and the limitless opportunities \nhere in America can make any dream come true.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10429-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10429-S10431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n             ENHANCED PARTNERSHIP WITH PAKISTAN ACT OF 2009\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask that my statement and \naccompanying documents submitted this afternoon be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The documents follow.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss S. 1707, the \n``Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009,'' which President \nObama has committed to signing into law this week. The legislation is a \nresult of negotiations between the Senate and House of Representatives \nreconciling our respective bills that passed earlier this summer. The \nfinal version passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, sending a very strong message of the desire of the \nU.S. Congress to strengthen our relationship with the people of \nPakistan through a long-term pledge of economic and development \nassistance.\n  I hope that over time it will fundamentally change America's \nrelationship with the people of Pakistan. I especially want to thank my \ncolleagues Senator Lugar and Representative Berman for their \npartnership in crafting this bill and their ongoing leadership on this \nissue.\n  It is hard to overstate the importance to our national security of \ngetting our relationship with Pakistan right. The status quo has not \nbrought success, the stakes could not be higher, and we have little \nchoice but to think big. That is why the Obama Administration and many \nof us in Congress saw the need for a bold, new strategy for Pakistan.\n  The ``Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act'' is a centerpiece of \nthis new approach, which is why President Obama asked Congress to pass \nthe measure. This Act establishes a legislative foundation for a \nstrengthened partnership between the United States and Pakistan, based \non a shared commitment to improving the living conditions of the people \nof Pakistan through sustainable economic development, strengthening \ndemocracy and the rule of law, and combating terrorism and extremism. \nIt is the intent of Congress to strengthen the long-term people-to-\npeople relationship between the United States and Pakistan by investing \ndirectly in the needs of the Pakistani people.\n  The overall level of economic assistance authorized annually by this \nlegislation is tripled over FY 2008 levels, with the bulk of aid \nintended for projects such as schools, roads, medical clinics, and \ninfrastructure development. The legislation authorizes $1.5 billion \nannually for fiscal years 2010 to 2014 and recommends an additional \nfive years of funding to demonstrate a long-term commitment to the \npeople of Pakistan.\n  This legislation is an important first step in turning the page in \nour relationship with Pakistan and building mutual trust. It is a prime \nexample of ``smart power'' because it uses both economic and security \naid to achieve an overall effect that is greater than the sum of its \nparts.\n  But this bill is not a silver bullet. It provides powerful tools--but \nthese tools are only as effective as the policy-makers who wield them. \nWe must approach this endeavor with a large dose of humility. Our \nleverage is limited. This bill aims to increase that leverage \nsignificantly. But we should be realistic about what we can \naccomplish--Americans can influence events in Pakistan, but we cannot \nand should not decide them. Ultimately, the true decision-makers are \nthe people and leaders of Pakistan.\n  There have been serious concerns in Pakistan in recent days over the \nperceived intent of this bill. We have spoken with Pakistani government \nofficials, including Foreign Minister Qureshi and Ambassador Haqqani, \nto make sure we understand the nature of these concerns and to clear up \nany misunderstandings.\n  To clear up any lingering confusion and to reiterate Congress' intent \nwith respect to this legislation, Chairman Berman and I are submitting \na ``Joint Explanatory Statement'' for the Congressional Record. The \npurpose of the Joint Explanatory Statement is to facilitate accurate \ninterpretation of the text and to ensure faithful implementation of its \nprovisions in accordance with the intentions of the legislation.\n  As the Joint Explanatory Statement makes clear, the legislation does \nnot seek in any way to compromise Pakistan's sovereignty, impinge on \nPakistan's national security interests, or micromanage any aspect of \nPakistani military or civilian operations. There are no conditions on \nPakistan attached to the authorization of $7.5 billion in non-military \naid. The only requirements on this funding are financial accountability \nmeasures that Congress is imposing on the U.S. executive branch, to \nensure that this assistance supports programs that most benefit the \nPakistani people.\n  The certifications in the Act regarding certain limited forms of \nsecurity assistance track very closely with previous Congressional \nlegislation. The conditions set forth in the bill are reasonable and \nshould be easy for any nation receiving American aid to meet. They \nalign with and reinforce the publicly-articulated positions of the \ndemocratically-elected Pakistani government and Pakistani military \nleaders. The United States values its friendship with the Pakistani \npeople and honors the sacrifices made by Pakistani security forces in \nthe fight against extremism.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record this Joint \nExplanatory Statement along with letters of support for S. 1707, passed \nand printed in the Record of Thursday, September 24, 2009, from \nSecretary of State Clinton, Secretary of Defense Gates, and Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen.\n  The material follows.\n\nJoint Explanatory Statement--Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of \n                                  2009\n\n            Sen. John F. Kerry and Congressman Howard Berman\n\n       The following is an explanation of S. 1707, the Enhanced \n     Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. The final text of the \n     legislation reflects an agreement reached by the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs. The purpose of this Explanatory Statement is \n     to facilitate accurate interpretation of the text and to \n     ensure faithful implementation of its provisions in \n     accordance with the intentions of the legislation.\n       The core intent of the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan \n     Act is to demonstrate the American people's long-term \n     commitment to the people of Pakistan. The United States \n     values its friendship with the Pakistani people and honors \n     the great sacrifices made by\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\n     Pakistani security forces in the fight against extremism, and \n     the legislation reflects the goals shared by our two \n     governments.\n       The legislation does not seek in any way to compromise \n     Pakistan's sovereignty, impinge on Pakistan's national \n     security interests, or micromanage any aspect of Pakistani \n     military or civilian operations. There are no conditions on \n     Pakistan attached to the authorization of $7.5 billion in \n     non-military aid. The only requirements on this funding are \n     financial accountability measures that Congress is imposing \n     on the U.S. executive branch, to ensure that this assistance \n     supports programs that most benefit the Pakistani people.\n\n\n                    Summary of Congressional Intent\n\n       The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 (the \n     ``Act'') establishes a legislative foundation for a \n     strengthened partnership between the United States and \n     Pakistan, based on a shared commitment to improving the \n     living conditions of the people of Pakistan through \n     strengthening democracy and the rule of law, sustainable \n     economic development, and combating terrorism and extremism. \n     It is the intent of Congress to strengthen the long-term \n     people-to-people relationship between the United States and \n     Pakistan by investing directly in the needs of the Pakistani \n     people. This legislation is intended to fortify a lasting \n     partnership with Pakistan based on mutual trust.\n       The overall level of economic assistance authorized \n     annually by this legislation is tripled over FY 2008 U.S. \n     funding levels, with the bulk of aid intended for projects \n     such as schools, roads, medical clinics, and infrastructure \n     development. The funds directly authorized by this Act--$1.5 \n     billion in economic and development assistance annually for \n     five years, with a similar amount envisioned for a subsequent \n     five years--place no conditions on the Government of \n     Pakistan. The only requirements are accountability measures \n     placed on the United States executive branch to ensure that \n     the aid directly benefits the Pakistani people.\n       This Act fully recognizes and respects the independence of \n     Pakistan as a sovereign nation. The purpose of this Act is to \n     forge a closer collaborative relationship between Pakistan \n     and the United States, not to dictate the national policy or \n     impinge on the sovereignty of Pakistan in any way. Any \n     interpretation of this Act which suggests that the United \n     States does not fully recognize and respect the sovereignty \n     of Pakistan would be directly contrary to Congressional \n     intent.\n       The certifications in the Act regarding certain limited \n     forms of security assistance are consistent with previous \n     Congressional legislation regarding security assistance to \n     Pakistan and other nations. In all cases, they align with the \n     aims of, and serve to reinforce the publicly-articulated \n     positions of, the democratically-elected Government of \n     Pakistan, and Pakistani military leaders, to combat \n     extremists and militants.\n     Sections 1-4: Strengthening a Relationship Founded on Mutual \n         Respect\n       Sections 1-4 establish the framework and context for the \n     legislative provisions that follow. The Findings and the \n     Statement of Principles demonstrate an unequivocal \n     appreciation for the friendship of the Pakistani people, and \n     for the sacrifices made by the Pakistani security forces and \n     people in fighting extremism. The Findings in Section 3 \n     include:\n       Section 3(1): ``Congress finds the following: The people of \n     the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United States share \n     a long history of friendship and comity, and the interests of \n     both nations are well-served by strengthening and deepening \n     this friendship.''\n       Section 3(4): ``Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the \n     United States and has been a valuable partner in the battle \n     against al Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be \n     accomplished by both nations. The struggle against al Qaeda, \n     the Taliban, and affiliated terrorist groups has led to the \n     deaths of several thousand Pakistani civilians and members of \n     the security forces of Pakistan over the past seven years.''\n       The Statement of Principles in Section 4 include:\n       Section 4(1): ``Pakistan is a critical friend and ally to \n     the United States, both in times of strife and in times of \n     peace, and the two countries share many common goals, \n     including combating terrorism and violent radicalism, \n     solidifying democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and \n     promoting the social and economic development of Pakistan.''\n       Section 4(4): ``The United States supports Pakistan's \n     struggle against extremist elements and recognizes the \n     profound sacrifice made by Pakistan in the fight against \n     terrorism, including the loss of more than 1,900 soldiers and \n     police since 2001 in combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and \n     other extremist and terrorist groups.''\n\n Title I: Democratic, Economic and Development Assistance for Pakistan\n\n       This Title contains the core intention of this legislation: \n     To make a long-term commitment to the people of Pakistan by \n     tripling non-military assistance, free of any conditions on \n     the Pakistani government. The purposes set forth for the $7.5 \n     billion that is authorized here are all intended to reflect \n     the expressed priorities of the Pakistani people. \n     Specifically, Section 101(a) provides that:\n\n       ``The President is authorized to provide assistance to \n     Pakistan to support the consolidation of democratic \n     institutions; to support the expansion of rule of law, build \n     the capacity of government institutions, and promote respect \n     for internationally-recognized human rights; to promote \n     economic freedoms and sustainable economic development; to \n     support investment in people, including those displaced in \n     on-going counterinsurgency operations; and to strengthen \n     public diplomacy.''\n\n       The funds authorized under Title I are intended to be used \n     to work with and benefit Pakistani organizations. \n     Specifically, Section 101(c)(3) provides that:\n\n       ``The President is encouraged, as appropriate, to utilize \n     Pakistani firms and community and local nongovernmental \n     organizations in Pakistan, including through host country \n     contracts, and to work with local leaders to provide \n     assistance under this section.''\n\n       Section 102(a) makes clear that there are no conditions \n     placed on the Pakistani government for delivery of the $7.5 \n     billion in assistance. The only accounting requirements are \n     of the U.S. executive branch.\n       Section 102(d) makes clear that a long term commitment to \n     increased civilian assistance for the people of Pakistan is \n     envisioned by stating that it is the desire of Congress that \n     the amounts authorized for fiscal years 2010-2014 shall \n     continue from fiscal years 2015-2019.\n       Section 103(b) authorizes establishment of field offices \n     for Inspectors General to audit and oversee expenditure of \n     this assistance. It is the intent of Congress that such \n     offices would be established in consultation with appropriate \n     Pakistani authorities for the purpose of ensuring optimal \n     management of resources.\n\n               Title II: Security Assistance for Pakistan\n\n       The intention of this section is to strengthen cooperative \n     efforts to confront extremism. The purposes of security \n     assistance are intended to be completely cooperative, and \n     reflect the intention that such assistance be used to support \n     Pakistan in achieving its stated objectives in winning the \n     ongoing counterinsurgency, defeating terrorist organizations \n     that threaten Pakistan, and strengthening democratic \n     institutions. Specifically, Section 201(1) ``Purposes of \n     Assistance'' states that:\n\n       ``The purposes of assistance under this title are--\n       (1) to support Pakistan's paramount national security need \n     to fight and win the ongoing counterinsurgency within its \n     borders in accordance with its national security interests;\n       (2) to work with the Government of Pakistan to improve \n     Pakistan's border security and control and help prevent any \n     Pakistani territory from being used as a base or conduit for \n     terrorist attacks in Pakistan, or elsewhere;\n       (3) to work in close cooperation with the Government of \n     Pakistan to coordinate action against extremist and terrorist \n     targets; and\n       (4) to help strengthen the institutions of democratic \n     governance. . . .''\n\n       The provisions applied to certain limited portions of U.S. \n     security assistance in Section 203 are intended to be fully \n     in line with the existing policy of the Government of \n     Pakistan. Specifically, Section 203(c)(1) reflects our \n     understanding that cooperative efforts currently being \n     undertaken by the Governments of Pakistan and the United \n     States to combat proliferation will continue.\n       Section 203(c)(2) reflects the intent that U.S. security \n     assistance is used in furtherance of the purposes set forth \n     in Section 201 above, e.g., ensuring Pakistan's security, \n     winning the counterinsurgency within Pakistan, preventing \n     territory from being used for terrorist attacks in Pakistan \n     and elsewhere, and coordinating action against extremist and \n     terrorist targets. This section requires a certification by \n     the U.S. executive branch to Congress regarding the efforts \n     and progress made in achieving these purposes, and includes a \n     series of factors to be considered collectively by the \n     Secretary of State in making this assessment.\n       Section 203(c)(3) includes a provision intended to express \n     support for democratic institutions in Pakistan.\n       Section 203(e) contains a waiver making clear that this \n     certification could be waived if the determination is made by \n     the Secretary of State in the interests of national security \n     that this was necessary to continue such assistance.\n\n Title III: Strategy, Accountability, Monitoring, and Other Provisions\n\n       The intention of this section is to ensure that there is \n     transparency and accountability in the way authorized \n     assistance is spent. This Title requires the U.S. executive \n     branch to provide various reports to Congress designed to \n     demonstrate that funds are being used for the purposes set \n     forth in Title I and Title II; there are no requirements on \n     the Government of Pakistan.\n       Section 301 ``Strategy Reports'' requires three reports \n     from the U.S. executive branch that detail a plan for how \n     U.S. assistance to Pakistan will be spent and evaluated and a \n     regional security plan for how the United States can best \n     work with its partners for ``effective counterinsurgency and \n     counterterrorism efforts.''\n       Section 302 ``Monitoring Reports'' reflects the need for \n     ongoing consultation between the U.S. executive branch and \n     Congress on monitoring U.S. assistance to Pakistan, including \n     a ``Semi-Annual Monitoring Report'' where:\n\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\n\n       ``The Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report that describes the \n     assistance provided under this Act during the preceding 180-\n     day period.''\n\n       The many requirements of this report are intended as a way \n     for Congress to assess how effectively U.S. funds are being \n     spent, shortfalls in U.S. resources that hinder the use of \n     such funds, and steps the Government of Pakistan has taken to \n     advance our mutual interests in countering extremism and \n     nuclear proliferation and strengthening democratic \n     institutions.\n       There is no intent to, and nothing in this Act in any way \n     suggests that there should be, any U.S. role in micromanaging \n     internal Pakistani affairs, including the promotion of \n     Pakistani military officers or the internal operations of the \n     Pakistani military.\n       The reports envisioned in this Section are not binding on \n     Pakistan, and require only the provision of information by \n     the executive branch to the U.S. Congress, in furtherance of \n     the Act's stated purpose of strengthening civilian \n     institutions and the democratically-elected Government of \n     Pakistan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2009.\n     Hon.

We \n     appreciated the opportunity to work with your committees on \n     these concerns.\n       This bill would support U.S. national security interests in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Department of Defense strongly \n     supports moving this bill to final passage by the House and \n     Senate as expeditiously as possible.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, VSAC, for \nthree important milestones it has reached this year. This year marks \nthe 40th anniversary of the VSAC Talent Search Program, the 10th \nanniversary of the VSAC Gear UP Program, and the 10th anniversary of \nthe Vermont Higher Education Investment Program.\n  Although small in size, Vermont has a long history of establishing \nnational models for making higher education accessible to disadvantaged \nstudents. The University of Vermont provided Senator Justin Morrill the \ninspiration for the first and second Morrill Act. The student loan \nprograms which have made college possible for millions of students each \nyear bear the name of my former colleague and dear friend, Senator Bob \nStafford.\n  The Vermont Student Assistance Corporation has continued this \ntradition through innovative programs to encourage first-generation and \nlow-income students to pursue their career and education goals. Each \nyear more than 47,000 students and parents participate in one or more \nof their career, education and financial aid programs. In addition, \nVSAC has been at the forefront of efforts to reach young people with \nprograms that link career ambitions with educational requirements and \nopportunities. This past year, VSAC's Start Where You Are program won a \nprestigious WebAward for Education Standard of Excellence from the Web \nMarketing Association. In a more traditional vein, VSAC staff was \nrecognized this year with the David Swedlow Memorial College Access \nStaff Award of Excellence from the National College Access Network.\n  Several States have established not-for-profit State agencies to \nadminister financial aid and to provide their residents and students \nattending their schools with quality counseling services and low-cost \nloans. Vermont pioneered this movement by creating the Vermont Student \nAssistance Corporation more than 40 years ago. VSAC has worked hard to \nestablish and maintain strong and longstanding working relationships \nwith Vermont's higher education institutions as well as K-12 schools to \nprovide outreach programs critical to the economic vitality of Vermont.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has proposed that all future student \nloans be made through direct lending from the Federal Government to \nstudents. The Direct Loan program is projected to save students \nmillions of dollars in fees and interest payments. Additional savings \nwould be distributed to States for school construction and grants for \nK-12 education. Unfortunately this proposal does not include a role for \nnot-for-profit State agencies such as VSAC. I believe that is a \nsignificant oversight. Vermonters have come to rely on the high \nquality, comprehensive programs that VSAC offers. A one-size-fits-all \nFederal direct loan program does not acknowledge all of the hard work \nand experience of nonprofits such as VSAC and their tremendous staff. \nAs this proposal makes its way through Congress, Senator Sanders, \nCongressman Welch, and I will be working for changes to ensure a role \nfor nonprofit State financial aid agencies such as VSAC.\n  I congratulate VSAC on their landmark 40th anniversary, and I hope \nthere will be many more to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10431-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10431-S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING AMERICAN GOLD STAR MOTHER'S DAY\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize that \nSeptember 27, 2009, is designated as ``Gold Star Mother's Day.''\n  It is fitting that we recognize the American Gold Star Mothers, whose \nsons and daughters have died in defense of the ideals of individual \nliberty. They should be honored and offered respect and gratitude for \ntheir personal sacrifice.\n  Gold Star Mother's Day is intended to honor women who deserve special \nrecognition and gratitude for their tremendous personal loss on behalf \nof our country.\n  During the early days of World War I, a Blue Star was used to \nrepresent each soldier in military service of the United States, and as \nthe war progressed and soldiers were killed or wounded in combat or \ndied from wounds or disease, a Gold Star superimposed over the Blue \nStar designated the loss of these individuals. This tradition \nrecognized soldiers for their ultimate sacrifice to our country, and \nthe Gold Star offered families an outward symbol by which to honor the \nloss of a loved one. In 1928, the Gold Star tradition was formalized in \nWashington, DC, by a group of mothers who had lost sons and daughters \nin service to their country and met to form the American Gold Star \nMothers organization. This organization is a nondenominational, \nnonprofitable, and nonpolitical organization that is dedicated in \nsupporting veterans, military families, and servicemembers returning \nfrom our present-day battlefields.\n  In 1936, President Franklin Roosevelt issued a proclamation which \nrecognized Gold Star Mothers for their strength and inspiration to this \ncountry. The\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nservices rendered to the United States by the mothers of America have \nstrengthened and inspired our Nation throughout history, and we honor \nthe Gold Star Mothers of America for their courage and their \nstrength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10432-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING AUBURN MANUFACTURING, INCORPORATED\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I celebrate the vital work \nthat a small business in my home State of Maine is doing to provide \nextreme temperature textiles to dozens of industries worldwide. Auburn \nManufacturing, Incorporated--or AMI--of Mechanic Falls is a veritable \nleader in its field, and has been designing and manufacturing advanced \nindustrial textiles since its inception in 1979.\n  Auburn Manufacturing's name is synonymous with quality and \ndependability because of its longstanding dedication to providing \ncustomers with products made using the most cutting-edge technologies. \nAMI develops and manufactures top-of-the-line products for welding \nprotection, gasketing and sealing, and pipe and hose covering, as well \nas safety apparel like gloves and clothing. And the company's 48 \nemployees make all of its products at the company's central Maine \nfacility.\n  One of AMI's major new products is the Ever Green Cut 'n Wrap \ninsulated cover. Designed for companies seeking to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and heat loss while saving on energy costs, the custom-\nfit insulation blankets fit flexibly over valves and piping and reduce \nroom temperatures for workers in extreme conditions. In fact, the Ever \nGreen Cut 'n Wrap kits can reduce heat loss by over 85 percent, and \nthey have a payback of less than 1 year. Last month, AMI received a \nseed grant from the Maine Technology Institute to help the company \ncommercialize this forward-thinking, environmentally friendly product.\n  Additionally, earlier this year Auburn Manufacturing announced that \nit had received dual contracts to provide the U.S. Navy with the \ncompany's remarkable AMI-SIL fabrics that are used for hot work \nprotection during the repair of naval ships. The Navy has certainly \ndemonstrated its approval of this impressive product, having awarded \nAMI five contracts over the past 15 years to supply it with more than \n1.25 million yards of fabric.\n  Another quality that makes AMI special is its status as a Women's \nBusiness Enterprise, a certification made by the highly regarded \nWomen's Business Enterprise National Council. Additionally, AMI owner \nKathie Leonard was recently named one of Mainebiz's 2009 Women to \nWatch. In my estimation, Kathie Leonard has been a woman to watch \nthroughout her entire career. She founded AMI in 1979--at the age of \n27--when she realized the vast potential of new heat-resistant fabrics \nwhich were developed to replace asbestos. Over the company's 30-year \nhistory, Ms. Leonard has been a part of several major professional \norganizations both national and local, including the National \nInsulation Association and the Lewiston-Auburn Economic Growth Council, \nwhich she previously chaired. She readily admits that these connections \nhave helped her company grow into the giant it is today.\n  The quality of AMI's numerous products afford its clients a sense of \nconfidence that has solidified the company's status as a premier \ndeveloper and manufacturer of extreme textiles nationwide. I \ncongratulate Kathie Leonard and everyone at Auburn Manufacturing for \nthe incredible work they do, and I wish them much success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10432-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:25 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1593.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to generic drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two health \ncare bills that will help control health care costs and provide \npatients with better care. I believe these bills are easy to understand \nand reflect commonsense approaches to controlling health care costs.\n  The first bill, the Reducing Emergency Department Utilization through \nCoordination and Empowerment, or REDUCE Act, S. 1281, would reduce \ncostly and excessive emergency room visits by providing patients with \nmore consistent and coordinated care.\n  Emergency room overutilization is a source of wasteful spending in \nour health care system. Estimates show that $14 billion are wasted each \nyear in unnecessary emergency room visits. It drives up the cost of \nhealth care and leads to overcrowding of our emergency rooms.\n  Frequent users of emergency room services make up a small, but very \ncostly portion of the population. These individuals tend to have \nmultiple chronic illnesses and severe mental illness. They often live \nin poverty or are homeless. Many times they use the emergency room \nbecause they have nowhere else to go.\n  In the most extreme cases, these individuals can cost the system \nmillions of dollars. You heard right, one person can put a multi-\nmillion dollar strain on our health care system. For example in Camden, \nNJ, one person cost taxpayers $3.5 million over 5 years in Medicaid and \nMedicare payments.\n  We need to fix this problem, and I believe we can. The REDUCE Act is \nmodeled after successful pilot programs across the country. It provides \nbeneficiaries with a care management team consisting of a medical \nprovider, a social worker and a community health worker that can \nprovide medical care and support in any setting. The care management \nteam also helps to ensure that these individuals are going to their \nprimary care doctors and mental health providers on a regular basis.\n  Research shows it works. In fact, after two years of enrollment in \none pilot program, on average, individual emergency room visits were \nreduced by 61 percent and emergency room charges were reduced by 59 \npercent for those that participated.\n  There is a lot we need to do to reform our health care system, but as \nwe work on reform broadly, we also need to focus attention on \nindividuals, especially these high cost patients. Doing so will improve \ncare for this vulnerable population and reduce costs.\n  The second bill, the Access to Affordable Medicines Act, S. 1778, \nwill increase access to lower cost generic drugs by closing a loophole \nsome brand name drug companies exploit that needlessly and unfairly \ndelays the entry of safe, lower-cost generic drugs to the consumer \nmarket.\n  As the law currently stands, when brand name manufacturers make \nlabeling changes, generic drug labeling must reflect this change prior \nto the drug being approved and introduced in the market.\n  Too often, big pharmaceutical companies make last minute changes to \nthe label. Many times the labeling changes are insignificant and do not \ndeal with safety or warnings. In fact, these last minute changes are \noften used by brand name pharmaceutical companies to purposefully delay \nthe introduction of cost-saving generic drugs by weeks or months. This \ncan cost consumers and the federal government millions of dollars.\n  My bill would stop these costly practices by providing a 60-day grace \nperiod for the generic drug company to submit the new labeling for \napproval and marketplace distribution, while preserving safeguards if \nthe new labeling truly presents a safety issue.\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\n  As we work to pass comprehensive health care reform in Congress, we \ndo it with families and small businesses who struggle everyday with the \nhigh cost of health care in mind. These bills are the types of sensible \nreforms that we need to make so that the health care system is more \naffordable and more efficient. I look forward to working with my Senate \ncolleagues on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1782. A bill to provide improvements for the operations of the \nFederal courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nJudiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2009 on behalf of myself \nand the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators Leahy and Sessions. I thank them for their support. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with them on this important bipartisan effort.\n  The Federal Courts decide crucial issues of criminal and civil law \nevery day, providing justice and protecting our constitutional rights. \nIt is our responsibility in Congress to ensure that our governing \ntechnical issues of judicial administration will help them in this \neffort.\n  The Federal Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2009 takes \nup that responsibility by making nine technical fixes necessary for the \nbetter administration of the Federal courts. The bill will clarify the \nrole of Senior Judges in the selection of Magistrate Judges, enable \nbetter workload distribution among the judges of the District of North \nDakota, align the benefits received by territorial judges in Guam, the \nU.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands with those of \nother term judges, equalize leave limits and pay scales for judicial \nexecutives with those for senior executive branch officials, protect \nindividual privacy in connection with judges' role in the sentencing \nprocess, clarify the authority of pretrial service officers over \njuvenile offenders, amend requirements for the reporting of wiretap \ninformation to the Administrative Office of the Courts, and add an \ninflation adjustment for the case expenses that must be reviewed by the \nchief judge of a district court. The Administrative Office of the \nCourts supports each provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to act promptly on this bipartisan legislation. \nI again thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions for their \nsupport.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senators \nWhitehouse and Sessions to introduce the Federal Judiciary \nAdministrative Improvements Act of 2009, a bipartisan bill that would \nimprove the administration and efficiency of our Federal court system. \nThis legislation would also provide the third branch of government with \nimportant assistance to the women and men who comprise the Federal \njudiciary.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Sessions for their hard work \non this critical issue. I previously introduced a court improvement \nbill in the 108th Congress. I hope the bill we introduce today will \npass the full Senate with unanimous support, and will not be subjected \nto the objections of Senate Republicans as it was 5 years ago. I have \nalso supported past legislative proposals from the Judicial Conference \nto improve the administration of justice in the Federal courts, \nincluding a similar measure last year, which was enacted into law.\n  In recent years, the job of a Federal judge has changed considerably. \nToday, Federal judges at both the trial and appellate level are hearing \nmore cases with fewer available judicial resources. We have a \nresponsibility to pass legislation that helps them keep up with \nchanging times and circumstances. Just as it is the judiciary's duty to \ndeliver justice in a neutral and unbiased manner, it is the duty of the \nlegislative branch to provide the requisite tools for the women and men \nwho honorably serve on the judiciary to ably fulfill their critical \nresponsibilities. I believe our independent judiciary is the envy of \nthe world, and we must take care to protect it.\n  The legislation we introduce today contains proposals that the \nFederal judiciary believes will improve its operations and allow it to \ncontinue to serve as a bulwark protecting our individual rights and \nliberties. It also contains additional technical and substantive \nproposals carried over from previous Congresses.\n  The Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2009 would \nfacilitate judicial operations and improve judicial resource \nmanagement. The bill would clarify existing law to ensure that senior \njudges with a minimum workload can participate in the selection of \nmagistrate judges. The bill would also revise the statutory description \nof the District of North Dakota to eliminate unnecessary references to \ndivisions and counties, while maintaining the present requirement that \nNorth Dakota constitutes one judicial district. I believe this \ntechnical change would improve the judicial workload distribution in \nthat district and reduce travel time for litigants.\n  Our legislation also contains critical provisions that would improve \npersonnel and benefits for certain judges and their hardworking \njudiciary staff. The bill would authorize a cost-of-living adjustment \nfor Federal territorial judges entitled to receive an annuity. It would \nalso authorize territorial judges who are 65 years of age or older to \ncollect, for the remainder of their lives, an annuity equal to the \nsalary received when they left office. These changes would reduce \nexisting inequities between Federal territorial judges and other term \njudges such as Federal magistrate and bankruptcy judges. The bill would \nextend to senior executives in the Federal courts, the Federal Judicial \nCenter, and the Sentencing Commission the same ability to carry over \nannual leave hours as that enjoyed by senior employees in the Executive \nBranch and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, AO. \nIt would also allow the Federal Judicial Center to provide a modest \nincrease in pay for certain division directors.\n  The Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2009 would also \nimprove the administration of criminal justice. The bill would better \nprotect confidential information about a defendant during sentencing by \nallowing the ``statement of reasons'' form that judges are required to \nissue upon sentencing to be filed separately with the court. This \nchange would allow confidential information contained within the \n``statement of reasons'' to be more easily controlled and protected. In \naddition, the bill would clarify the scope of authority of Federal \npretrial services officers to supervise and assist juveniles awaiting \ndelinquency disposition in Federal court. Current laws regarding the \nduties of pretrial service officers focus solely on adults and thus it \nis unclear what duties those officers have to provide services to \njuveniles. This bill would fill that gap and ensure that pretrial \nservices officers are fully authorized to arrange drug treatment and \nother critical services for juvenile offenders. The bill would also \nimprove the statistical reporting schedule for criminal wiretap orders. \nIt would eliminate burdensome monthly deadlines for state and Federal \njudges to report their wiretap data and unrealistic interagency \ndeadlines for reporting that data to the AO. This change will allow for \nmore comprehensive reporting of wiretap data.\n  In addition, the legislation we introduce today would also conserve \njudicial resources over certain court requests from indigent \ndefendants. Under current law, a certain statutory threshold exists at \nwhich the costs of hiring expert witnesses and conducting \ninvestigations for indigent defendants must be approved by the court. \nThese thresholds do not account for inflation, however, which results \nin a waste of precious judicial resources. This bill would apply an \ninflationary index to the threshold amount to make them more cost-\neffective. As a result, this change will allow judges to spend more \ntime on less of these requests each year, which would better improve \nthe overall administration of justice.\n  I am glad that this important legislation has the support of the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, on behalf of the Judicial \nConference, and Senators on both sides of the aisle. The Federal \njudiciary needs these improvements to increase its efficiency and \nadministrative operations. I urge all Senators to support prompt \npassage of this noncontroversial legislation this year.\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1783. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to \nprovide for country of origin labeling for dairy products; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, all across the country, family dairy \nfarms are in dire straits. In Minnesota alone, 200 dairy farms have \nclosed this year. There is no single cause for this crisis. Family \ndairy farmers are confronting an unprecedented global recession, \nconsolidation in the market, high feed prices, and unpredictable price \nswings--all at the same time.\n  Since arriving in Washington, I have been proud to work with my dairy \nState colleagues in order to give our family farmers the tools they \nneed to weather this storm. In July, Senators from the midwest, the \nnortheast, and the southwest worked together with Secretary Vilsack to \nraise price supports. Just last week we provided the Department of \nAgriculture with another $350 million for price supports in the annual \nagriculture spending bill. Unfortunately, raising price supports alone \nwon't calm the economic storm.\n  Just as there is no single cause for this, there is no single \nsolution. Our family farmers need multiple tools in their shed. Today, \nI am introducing a bill with Senator Feingold and Senator Brown to give \nour family farmers another tool.\n  The Dairy Country Of Origin Labeling Act, or Dairy COOL, is really \npretty simple--it would extend mandatory country of origin labeling to \ndairy products. The current country of origin labeling law, which went \ninto effect last year, applies to meats, produce, and nuts, but it \ndoesn't include dairy products. Our bill would simply add dairy \nproducts--such as milk, ice cream and cheese--to the list.\n  Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio dairy farmers, as well as family \nfarmers across the Nation, have the right to distinguish their products \nfrom imported products. As families do their weekly grocery shopping, \nthey should have the option of putting milk, cheese, and ice cream from \nour own family farms into their cart. It is more than ``from farm to \ntable''--it's really ``from one family to another.''\n  Families are what this is about. Hardly a week goes by where you \ndon't hear another story of contaminated food and toys coming in from \nforeign shores. Labeling our dairy products lets parents make smarter \nchoices at the grocery store.\n  This bill isn't a silver bullet, but it does give family farms \nanother tool that will help them weather the current storm, grow a \nlittle stronger, and keep our families a little safer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 46\n\n       Whereas service-learning is a teaching method that enhances \n     academic learning by integrating classroom content with \n     relevant activities aimed at addressing identified needs in a \n     community or school;\n       Whereas service-learning has been used both in school and \n     community-based settings as a teaching strategy to enhance \n     learning by building on youth experiences, granting youth a \n     voice in learning, and making instructional goals and \n     objectives more relevant to youth;\n       Whereas service-learning addresses the dropout epidemic in \n     the United States by making education more ``hands-on'' and \n     relevant, and has been especially effective in addressing the \n     dropout epidemic with respect to disadvantaged youth;\n       Whereas service-learning is proven to provide the greatest \n     benefits to disadvantaged and at-risk youth by building self-\n     confidence, which often translates into overall academic and \n     personal success;\n       Whereas service-learning provides not only meaningful \n     experiences, but improves the quantity and quality of \n     interactions between youth and potential mentors in the \n     community;\n       Whereas service-learning empowers youth as actively engaged \n     learners, citizens, and contributors to the community;\n       Whereas youth engaged in service-learning provide critical \n     service to the community by addressing a variety of needs in \n     towns, cities, and States, including needs such as tutoring \n     young children, care of the elderly, community nutrition, \n     disaster relief, environmental stewardship, financial \n     education, and public safety;\n       Whereas far-reaching and diverse research shows that \n     service-learning enhances the academic, career, cognitive, \n     and civic development of students in kindergarten through \n     12th grade, and students at institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas service-learning strengthens and increases the \n     number of partnerships among institutions of higher \n     education, local schools, and communities, which strengthens \n     communities and improves academic learning;\n       Whereas service-learning programs allow a multitude of \n     skilled and enthusiastic college students to serve in the \n     communities surrounding their colleges;\n       Whereas service-learning programs engage students in \n     actively addressing and solving pressing community issues and \n     strengthen the ability of nonprofit organizations to meet \n     community needs;\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\n       Whereas Learn and Serve America, a program established \n     under subtitle B of title I of the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12521 et seq.), is the only \n     federally funded program dedicated to service-learning and \n     engages more than 1,100,000 youth in service-learning each \n     year;\n       Whereas Learn and Serve America is a highly cost-effective \n     program, with an average cost of approximately $25 per \n     participant and leverage of $1 for every Federal dollar \n     invested;\n       Whereas the National Learn and Serve Challenge is an annual \n     event that, in 2009, will take place October 5 through \n     October 11; and\n       Whereas the National Learn and Serve Challenge spotlights \n     the value of service-learning to young people, schools, \n     college campuses, and communities, encourages others to \n     launch service-learning activities, and increases recognition \n     of Learn and Serve America: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the benefits of service-learning, which \n     include--\n       (A) enriching and enhancing academic outcomes for youth;\n       (B) engaging youth in positive experiences in the \n     community; and\n       (C) encouraging youth to make more constructive choices \n     with regards to their lives;\n       (2) encourages schools, school districts, college campuses, \n     community-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and \n     faith-based organizations to provide youth with more service-\n     learning opportunities; and\n       (3) expresses support for the goals of the National Learn \n     and Serve Challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10440-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WORK AND FAMILY MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

Res. 296\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of their workplaces are key \n     predictors of workers' job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to employers and of employers' ability to \n     retain workers;\n       Whereas, according to the 2008 National Study of Employers \n     by the Families and Work Institute, employees in more \n     flexible and supportive workplaces are more effective \n     employees, are more highly engaged and less likely to look \n     for a new job in the next year, and enjoy better overall \n     health, better mental health, and lower levels of stress than \n     employees in workplaces that provide less flexibility and \n     support;\n       Whereas, according to a 2004 report of the Families and \n     Work Institute entitled ``Overwork in America'', employees \n     who are able to effectively balance family and work \n     responsibilities are less likely to report making mistakes or \n     feel resentment toward employers and coworkers;\n       Whereas, according to the ``Best Places to Work in the \n     Federal Government'' rankings released by the Partnership for \n     Public Service and American University's Institute for the \n     Study of Public Policy Implementation, work-life balance and \n     a family-friendly culture are among the key drivers of \n     engagement and satisfaction for employees in the Federal \n     workforce;\n       Whereas, according to a 2009 survey of college students by \n     the Partnership for Public Service and Universum USA entitled \n     ``Great Expectations! What Students Want in an Employer and \n     How Federal Agencies Can Deliver It'', attaining a healthy \n     work-life balance was an important career goal of 66 percent \n     of the students surveyed;\n       Whereas a 2008 study by the Partnership for Public Service \n     entitled ``A Golden Opportunity: Recruiting Baby Boomers into \n     Government'' revealed that workers between the ages of 50 and \n     65 are a strong source of experienced talent for the Federal \n     workforce and that nearly 50 percent of workers in that age \n     group find flexible work schedules ``extremely appealing'';\n       Whereas finding a good work-life balance is important to \n     workers in multiple generations;\n       Whereas employees who are able to effectively balance \n     family and work responsibilities tend to feel healthier and \n     more successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends;\n       Whereas 85 percent of wage and salaried workers in the \n     United States have immediate, day-to-day family \n     responsibilities outside of their jobs;\n       Whereas, in 2000, research by the Radcliffe Public Policy \n     Center revealed that men in their 20s and 30s and women in \n     their 20s, 30s, and 40s identified a work schedule that \n     allows them to spend time with their families as the most \n     important job characteristic for them;\n       Whereas, according to the 2006 American Community Survey by \n     the United States Census Bureau, 47 percent of wage and \n     salaried workers in the United States are parents with \n     children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in their children's lives and research demonstrates \n     that parental involvement is associated with children's \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates;\n       Whereas the 2000 Urban Working Families study demonstrated \n     that a lack of job flexibility for working parents negatively \n     affects children's health in ways that range from children \n     being unable to make needed doctors' appointments to children \n     receiving inadequate early care, leading to more severe and \n     prolonged illness;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to the beginning of 2008, 1,700,000 \n     active duty troops served in Iraq and 600,000 members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve (133,000 on more than one tour) \n     were called up to serve in Iraq;\n       Whereas, because so many of those troops and National Guard \n     and Reserve members have families, there needs to be a focus \n     on policies and programs that can help military families \n     adjust to the realities that come with having a family member \n     in the military;\n       Whereas research by the Sloan Center for Aging and Work \n     reveals that the majority of workers aged 53 and older \n     attribute their success as an employee by a great or moderate \n     extent to having access to flexibility in their jobs and that \n     the majority of those workers also report that, to a great \n     extent, flexibility options contribute to an overall higher \n     quality of life;\n       Whereas studies show that \\1/3\\ of children and adolescents \n     in the United States are obese or overweight, and healthy \n     lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical \n     activity, can lower the risk of becoming obese and developing \n     related diseases;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence children's health and \n     development and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally;\n       Whereas unpaid family caregivers will likely continue to be \n     the largest source of long-term care services in the United \n     States for the elderly;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services \n     anticipates that by 2050 the number of such caregivers will \n     reach 37,000,000, an increase of 85 percent from 2000, as \n     baby boomers reach retirement age in record numbers; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as ``National Work and Family Month'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2009 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and to healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/14/senate-section/article/S10440-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10440-S10441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2009\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
