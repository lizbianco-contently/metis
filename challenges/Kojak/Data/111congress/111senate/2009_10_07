Mr. President, the Senate is nothing if not a temple to \ntradition. We debate and we deliberate according to the same rules \nwhere Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun considered the \nfuture of this young Nation. We vote without the help of modern \nelectronics, as the first Senators did. We refer to each other in the \nthird person during even the most heated discussions.\n  Senators take pride in the desks they occupy. Senator Ted Kennedy \nsurrendered his rights as a senior member of the body at one time to \nmove closer to the front so he could share the same desk in which his \ntwo brothers' names are inscribed.\n  On the top of those desks, we still keep the same inkwell. Mine has \npaper clips in it now. But this is an inkwell. It has been there since \nwe moved to this Chamber and even before.\n  Also, we have something from the past. There is a spittoon. Most all \nSenators chewed tobacco and did a lot of spitting. But we still have \nthese here. I use mine to throw a few pieces of wastepaper in it. But \nit is traditional. That is the Senate.\n  There are other things that can be referred to if Senator Byrd were \nhere. He is an expert. In fact, he is the custodian of Senate \ntraditions. He can add countless more examples. I could add a few more, \nbut Senator Byrd could add an endless list.\n  Last week, the Republican leader and I spoke here about the Pledge of \nAllegiance to our flag. When we first came to the Senate--Senator \nMcConnell and this Senator--there was no Pledge of Allegiance before we \nstarted our sessions.\n  So today I will speak of one of our new traditions which we have \nobserved daily for more than a decade and, again, just a few minutes \nago when we recited the pledge. It has not always been this way.\n  The sentence itself, barely more than 30 words long, is not even 120 \nyears old. The pledge was born like many American rituals, out of \ncapitalism. It was written by a children's magazine trying to sell \nAmerican flags on the 400th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the \nAmericas.\n  The magazine sought to sell flags to every school in the country, and \na minister and author named Francis Bellamy penned the pledge to \npromote unity among schoolchildren as the Nation reeled from the recent \nCivil War.\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\n  Almost a half century later, at the end of World War II, Congress \nformerly recognized the pledge, but it was not yet a Senate staple, not \nuntil 10 years ago, when a New Hampshire schoolgirl wrote to Senator \nBob Smith of New Hampshire and asked why the Senate did not recite the \npledge every morning. She noted the House of Representatives recited it \nand her school did but not the Senate. Francis Bellamy would have been \nproud. The line he wrote to instill allegiance in schoolchildren \nultimately became part of the Senate procedure at the behest of a \nstudent from New Hampshire.\n  We now recite the Pledge of Allegiance before any Senate business \nbegins, and we are reminded of our common procedures and our shared \nloyalty, despite our often opposing outlooks politically.\n  The first day the pledge was recited in public schools across the \ncountry was Columbus Day in 1892. So ahead of this Columbus Day, which \nwill fall this coming Monday, I take a brief moment to remind my fellow \nSenators and all those who are watching and listening to the Senate of \none of our newest and proudest traditions, the salute to our flag.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10172-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have been troubled recently by some of \nthe claims I have heard about health insurance reform legislation that \nwe have been working on in the Senate. When I spoke on the floor \nearlier this July, I said all you had to do was look at a newspaper, \nturn on cable news to see that the rhetoric on health insurance reform \nwas heating up.\n  Unfortunately, as is often the case, the debate has not gotten any \nbetter, but it certainly has gotten louder. I know there is a lot of \nconcern out there, and there is a lot of bad information going around.\n  The latest outrageous claim about reform is it would hurt America's \nseniors. I am here to tell our seniors and their families: That claim \nis false. I wish to make this perfectly clear: We are not proposing, \nhere in the Senate, to cut Medicare benefits or to do anything to \nnegatively affect the health of those who are receiving Medicare.\n  When you hear rumors about how reform will affect seniors, consider \nthe source. Listen to some of the inflammatory quotes. A Republican \nMember of the House of Representatives said: ``Let me tell you here and \nnow, it is socialized medicine.''\n  Another Republican Congressman said: ``We cannot stand idly by now as \nthe Nation is urged to embark on an ill-conceived adventure in \ngovernment medicine, the end of which no one can see, and from which \nthe patient is certain to be the ultimate sufferer.''\n  Those are not quotes about the current health insurance reform \neffort. Those statements were made in 1965, when Republicans were \nopposing the establishment of Medicare. Their position has not changed. \nRepublicans have voted against Medicare almost 60 times in the last 10 \nyears. Now, all of a sudden, Republicans are claiming Democrats support \ncutting Medicare benefits.\n  That is why last Sunday the New York Times said Republicans are: \n``Obscuring and twisting the facts and spreading unwarranted fear.'' \nScoring cheap political points does not do anything at all to help \nAmericans get affordable health insurance. Our families, and especially \nour seniors, deserve better.\n  You do not have to go back too far to find a perfect example of this \nSenate's history on that subject. Just last year, Democrats overcame a \nRepublican filibuster and a veto by then-President Bush to pass the \nMedicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. That bill \nprevented physicians from suffering cuts in the rate at which Medicare \nreimburses them for providing care to seniors.\n  If those cuts had happened, many doctors would have been forced to \nstop treating patients with Medicare, severely limiting seniors' access \nto health care. Democrats wanted to make sure there were enough doctors \nto go around, and we did.\n  That bill also made commonsense fixes to Medicare, including \nrequiring that Medicare cover cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation \nprograms, lowering seniors' copayments for mental health services, and \npreventing cuts to vital oxygen equipment and wheelchairs.\n  That bill should not have been controversial. It was vetoed by \nPresident Bush. When the Senate had a chance to pass the bill over that \nveto, it was only the Republicans, almost 60 percent of those in the \nSenate, who sided with President Bush and said no to our seniors.\n  Actions speak louder than words. So do not be fooled when Republicans \ntell you Democrats do not want to protect Medicare or that health \ninsurance reform will not be good for seniors.\n  The truth is, the Democratic proposal will help our seniors get the \ncare and coverage they need and have earned. This should come as no \nsurprise to anyone. After all, Democrats have had a long history of \nworking to improve the health and general well-being of seniors. \nDemocrats created Medicare over the objections of Republicans because \nwe recognized that no American should go without health care, \nespecially once they reach retirement age.\n  The American people know it has been Democrats who have been \nprotecting Medicare for seniors since we created the program 44 years \nago. Nothing has changed. Today, it is still Democrats who are fighting \nfor better, more affordable health care for everyone, especially our \nseniors. Specifically, our plan moves toward closing that doughnut hole \nin prescription drug coverage and provides access to more affordable \ngeneric drugs. If you have Medicare, our plan makes recommended \npreventative services such as colonoscopies and mammograms free.\n  It will ensure that if you have Medicare you get a free physical \nevery year, not just when you enroll in the program. Our plan will \naggressively attack the fraud and abuse that raises Medicare costs for \nseniors and for all of us as taxpayers.\n  One thing that has been too often missing from this discussion is \nwhat will happen to Medicare if there is no reform. It is now projected \nthat as early as 2017, if we do not make changes, the money Medicare \nspends on benefits and services will be greater than its income. At \nthat point, seniors would have to pay a greater portion of their health \ncare costs or receive fewer Medicare benefits. That is unacceptable.\n  Our current system is unsustainable. That is one of the reasons the \nnonpartisan AARP supports reform this year. They know, like we do, that \nwe must protect Medicare for our seniors over both the short term and \nthe long term. Our plan will prevent cost increases and overpayments to \ninsurance companies in order to keep Medicare out of the red. Now is \nthe time to act on health care. Let me be clear. Under the Republican \nplan, insurance companies can dump you for preexisting conditions \nbecause you are a woman, because you are getting older, because you get \nsick, and Medicare will face bankruptcy.\n  Under our plan, if you like what you have, you keep it. If you don't \nwe will provide affordable choices for you. We are going to protect \nMedicare. We will not raise taxes on the middle class, and we will not \nadd a dime to the deficit.\n\n  Every day 14,000 more Americans lose their health insurance. That has \nto stop. This is not only about those who don't have coverage. The cost \nof treatment for the uninsured is passed on to every taxpayer. It is \nestimated that a family of four pays a hidden tax of\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\n$1,000 every year in premiums to help pay for those who don't have \ncoverage. We will help remove that burden from all working families. We \nwill provide stability and choice to families and businesses. We will \nreturn health care decisions back where they belong, in the hands of \npatients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats. Rumors and \nmisinformation and scare tactics about Medicare should not prevent us \nfrom passing meaningful health insurance reform legislation this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10173-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the latest trillion-dollar, 1,000-page \nDemocrat plan raises some questions--questions such as: What happens to \nMedicare?\n  Tens of millions of American seniors want to know.\n  Here is what we can say for sure.\n  The Democrat plan is a trillion-dollar experiment that cuts Medicare, \nraises taxes, and threatens the health care choices that millions of \nAmericans now enjoy.\n  We know the Democrat plan will make massive cuts to Medicare--$500 \nbillion worth--to fund more government spending.\n  We know Medicare Advantage benefits will be slashed almost in half, \ncausing many of the 11 million seniors enrolled in it to lose benefits, \nsuch as hearing aid coverage and dental care.\n  We know it contains nearly $120 billion in cuts to hospitals that \ncare for seniors, more than $40 billion from home health agencies, and \nnearly $8 billion from hospices.\n  And we know this: Medicare is already on the path to bankruptcy. Yet \ninstead of trying to fix it, the Democrat plan is to use it as a piggy \nbank to pay for new government-run health care programs.\n  Republicans have tried to protect Medicare throughout this debate. \nOur amendments to do so were rejected in committee. We proposed an \namendment to prevent cuts to skilled nursing facilities, long-term care \nhospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, hospice care and home health care. \nThey rejected it. We offered an amendment to strike cuts that wouldn't \nimprove Medicare. They rejected it. We offered an amendment to \neliminate an unaccountable commission that would have the power to \ndecide payments to Medicare providers. They rejected it. This isn't \nreform, and America's seniors know it.\n  Americans are demanding that their voices are heard in this debate. \nThey want their questions answered, particularly when it comes to \nMedicare. They don't want the status quo. But they don't want what \nDemocrats are pushing either: a trillion-dollar experiment that cuts \nMedicare, raises taxes, limits choices, and makes health care more \nexpensive. Americans have questions. They are not getting the answers \nthey deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, I have an \nappointment in my office. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was going to ask the minority leader for the Republican \nplan for health care reform. Unfortunately, there is not a Republican \nplan for health care reform. What we have is a litany of criticism, a \nlitany of complaint. That is what we have received during the course of \nthis debate.\n  Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, took three of \nthe most likely Republicans--Senators Grassley, Enzi, and Snowe--sat \nwith them literally for months saying: Let's do this on a bipartisan \nbasis. Meanwhile, the rest of us were a little frustrated, if not \nupset. We wanted to get moving, get into the debate. Let's get into \nthis. It is a big issue. Health care reform is important. But Senator \nBaucus said: I have to try everything I can to make this a bipartisan \neffort. And he did. He spent months at it, day after day after day. \nWhat does he have to show for it? In the end, two of the Republican \nSenators walked out saying: We are not interested. The other said: I \nwill wait and see.\n  So when they come to the floor critical of this debate on health care \nreform, the obvious question I would ask the Republican leader is: What \nis your plan? The status quo? You want to continue health care as we \nhave it in America today? Do you want to try to defend what is \nhappening to the cost of health care?\n  I was with a businessman from Chicago last week, a good, \nconscientious businessman, a young man, a principled man who has made \nmoney in his life but understands that he owes at least the people \naround him and his employees to give back. He said: Do you know what is \ngoing to happen to health insurance premiums for my employees? They go \nup 18 percent in 1 year, 18 percent. He said: I don't know if I can \nkeep doing this. Guess what? His situation is being repeated over and \nover again. Businesses across America are dropping health care coverage \nfor their employees because they can't afford it. The cost is out of \nhand.\n  Did we hear one word from the Republican leader about dealing with \nthis cost escalation? No. The Republicans have no plan to deal with \nthis. We are trying. It isn't easy. This is one-sixth of the economy. I \nlove it when Senators come to the floor and call this a $1 trillion \nexperiment. Let's put it in perspective. A trillion dollars is an \nenormous, almost unimaginable sum of money. But what will the cost of \nAmerica's health care system be, for all of our health care, over the \nnext 10 years? It will be $35 trillion. So $1 trillion in reform over \n10 years represents less than 3 percent of the amount we are going to \nalready be spending if we don't change the health care system and make \nit better. One trillion out of thirty-five million dollars? In \nperspective, we understand that if we are going to bring about real \nreform, we do have to invest in it.\n  Where will the trillion dollars go? The trillion dollars will go to \nhelp businesses with tax breaks to pay for health insurance for their \nemployees. It will go to lower income working families so they can \nafford to buy health insurance. That is where the money will go.\n  Ultimately, do you know where it goes? It means that more and more \nAmericans have health insurance coverage. Today, this day, and every \nday in America, 14,000 people will lose health insurance coverage. \nImagine waking up this morning, heading off to work and learning during \nthe course of the day that you have lost your job. It is happening. But \nyou are not only losing your job, you are losing your health insurance. \nYou go home at night and say to your spouse: Bad news. I just got the \npink slip. I will be laid off in 2 weeks. But even worse news, our sick \nchild with diabetes is no longer going to have health insurance \ncoverage.\n  That is the reality for 14,000 families a day. When I hear the \nRepublican leader criticize our effort to expand coverage of health \ninsurance to the millions of Americans who are unprotected, to slow \ndown this cancellation of health insurance for 14,000 Americans a day, \nmy obvious question to him is: What is your alternative? What do you \nwant to do? The answer is, nothing. Nothing except criticize.\n  There is nothing wrong with being critical. That is what this Chamber \nis all about. Ideas are up for debate. People will disagree. They will \ncome up with their own point of view. That is good. A good healthy \ndebate is what our government is about, what our Nation is about, and \nwhat can generate in the end a solution to our problems. But when I \nhear some of the things that have just been said: a 1,000-page bill. \nDoes that bring you up short? Can't breathe? Your heart skips a beat, \n1,000 pages? What if I told you this bill is addressing our health care \nsystem which consumes $1 out of every $6 in the American economy? One \nsixth of our gross domestic product deals with health care. Would it \ntake 1,000 pages to address this in a responsible way? I am surprised \nit didn't take more. And how are we going to measure a bill in terms of \nits value? That bill is just too long. It is 1,000 pages long. I am \nsorry, maybe God got it right with the Ten Commandments and their \nbrevity, but\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\nfor most of the rest of us, we struggle to make sure we get it right. \nAnd to make certain we get it right, we have to add some provisions to \ncover options and contingencies. It is 1,000 pages? So what. If it were \n100 pages or 2,000 pages, would that make it any worse or any better? I \ndon't get it.\n  Let me also talk about Medicare. Medicare was a creation in the 1960s \nof President Lyndon Johnson and a Democratic Congress, and by and large \nit was opposed by the Republican Party. The Republican Party in some of \ntheir criticisms will sound familiar. They argued that Medicare was \nsocialized medicine. Medicare was a government health insurance plan \nand the government was going to get it wrong. In the end, they argued \nit would cost too much money, and it wouldn't provide good health care. \nTurns out, after 45 years, we can say conclusively they were wrong. For \nthe 40 million Americans protected by Medicare, the results have been \nspectacular.\n  Look at one basic yardstick. Senior citizens in America are living \nlonger. That is a good thing. Life expectancy rates are better for \nseniors today. Does it have anything to do with Medicare? I think it \ndoes, because seniors have access to quality medical care. It gives to \nthose at age 65 the peace of mind of knowing that an accident that \noccurs this afternoon or a diagnosis that occurs tomorrow morning won't \nwipe out their life savings. If you are not lucky enough to have good \nhealth insurance at age 65, Medicare is there to protect you, your \nhealth, and your life savings in the process. Those who called it \nsocialized medicine, as they are calling health care reform now, mainly \ncame from the other side of the aisle. That is why when I hear them \nsaying they are going to defend Medicare today, I am glad they have \nconverted to our side. It is a late-in-life conversion, but some of \nthose work too.\n  Then listen to how they explain it. The Senator from Kentucky slipped \nup and used the term Medicare Advantage. That is what this is all \nabout. Let me explain what Medicare Advantage is. Private health \ncompanies came to Republicans years ago and said: The government has it \nall wrong in Medicare. They are not handling it well. They are not \nadministering it well. It costs too much money. Let us show you that if \nwe use the private sector health insurance companies, we can provide \nMedicare benefits at a lower cost than the government and do a better \njob.\n  They were given a chance to do it. They did it under the title \nMedicare Advantage, private health insurance companies competing with \nthe government to provide Medicare benefits to prove they could do \nbetter and more cheaply. Some did, but most did not. At the end of this \nexperiment, we find it is going to cost 14 percent more for the private \nhealth insurance companies to provide the same benefits the government \nis already providing. What it means is, we are subsidizing insurance \ncompanies to provide the same benefits the government already provides.\n  People across America under Medicare Advantage plans say: I kind of \nlike this. Well, it turns out that the government is subsidizing more \nthan Medicare. Who pays for the subsidy? Ultimately, the taxpayers but, \nin particular, the Medicare system. The money is taken out of the \nMedicare system to provide a subsidy to health insurance companies that \nfailed to prove they could do this more economically.\n  This subsidy is something I think should end. I am prepared to phase \nit out in a reasonable way, but it should end. The private health \ninsurance companies are being subsidized by our government to provide \nMedicare benefits which we can already provide at a lower cost. They \nhave come to the floor criticizing this attempt to end the sweetheart \ndeal with these private health insurance companies.\n  Make no mistake, the 800-pound gorilla in the room in this debate is \nthe private health insurance companies. They don't want to see this \nchange.\n  I quote my friend Dale Bumpers, a former Senator from Arkansas, who \nused to come to the floor and use this figure of speech. He said: They \nhate this like the devil hates holy water. They hate the idea of health \ncare reform, health insurance companies do, because they are extremely \nprofitable, when many other companies in America are failing. They do \nnot want to rock the boat with anything like a not-for-profit health \ninsurance plan that gives consumers a choice to leave private health \ninsurance, if they personally choose. They do not want that to happen.\n\n  They certainly do not want to end this $170 billion subsidy of \nprivate health insurance companies under the Medicare Advantage \nProgram. They do not want us to tell them they have to change their \nways and their practices, that they can no longer cut off people from \ncoverage just because of a preexisting condition, which they dream up \nor find buried in some application of 10 years ago.\n  We do not want them to be able to walk away from you when you need \nthem, when somebody in your family is sick and needs care. We want them \nto be able to treat people fairly. We have to end this battle between \ndoctors and insurance company clerks as to whether you are going to be \nhospitalized or receive a procedure.\n  These are things that go on every day. The health insurance companies \nhate these reforms that are part of this bill. The critics of the bill \nwill not come to the floor and say this. They will talk about \neviscerating Medicare.\n  Earlier, the Senator from Kentucky said we were going to cut $120 \nbillion from hospitals. Do you know what? We spend more money on health \ncare in America by a factor of two than any other country on Earth. \nHospital administrators, such as in my own hometown of Springfield, IL, \nhave said to me: Senator, if you can create a plan that provides \neverybody health insurance, and we don't have to provide charity care \nfor people who come in without health insurance, that is going to \ndramatically cut our costs.\n  So can we save $120 billion in the hospitals across America over the \nnext 10 years if more Americans have health insurance? Yes, without \ncompromising the revenues for the hospitals or the quality of care. \nThat is obvious. So when the Senator comes to the floor and says: They \nare going to take $120 billion from hospitals, he does not tell you the \nwhole story. The rest of the story is: But if those 40 million \nAmericans have health insurance, and the hospitals are getting paid \nthrough the health insurance, it is good for everyone. It is good for \nthe people who are protected, it is good for the hospitals, and it is \ngood for the rest of us who have health insurance and indirectly \nsubsidize the care of the uninsured.\n  He talks about cuts--$40 billion--in home health care. I refer the \nSenator to an article which I have quoted on the floor before. It is an \narticle entitled ``The Cost Conundrum,'' written by a surgeon in \nBoston, MA, named Atul Gawande, in the June 1 edition of The New \nYorker. Please read it. Most Senators have. The President has. Most \nMembers of the House have read it. It talks about McAllen, TX, where \nthe cost of treating Medicare patients is one of the highest numbers in \nthe Nation: $15,000 a year.\n  Why? What about McAllen, TX, makes it so expensive? It turns out it \nis so expensive because, unfortunately, many of the providers there are \nheaping on the procedures and heaping on the costs because they take a \nprofit from it. It does not have anything to do with the older folks in \nMcAllen, TX, being sicker or needing special care. It is \noverutilization, overuse of the system, and one of the areas is home \nhealth care.\n  Read this article about what is happening with much of--at least in \nthat area of the country--home health care services. There is collusion \nbetween doctors and these home health care agencies. It is nothing \nshort of an abuse of Medicare. It does not provide quality care. It \njust takes more money out of the system for care that is duplicative or \nunnecessary.\n  How is that good for America? How can we defend that? Can we do \nbetter there? Yes. Can we do better to the tune of $40 billion over 10 \nyears? I think so. To argue this is somehow insidious and wrong is to \nignore the obvious. We can find savings within the system that do not \ncompromise quality.\n  Let me also say this. This notion that Medicare is, as the Senator \nsaid, our piggy bank that we are going to use to pay for health care \nreform is just plain wrong. We know we can save money through \neliminating the subsidy to Medicare Advantage, phasing it out,\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\nreducing it. But we also know we have a solemn obligation to those \nseniors on Medicare. They paid into it all their lives. They are \ncounting on it. And they are counting on us.\n  The Democratic Party has been there for Medicare from its creation. \nWe are not going to let seniors down. We are going to provide for them \nthe basic care promised, and we hope more. I think, with a modest \neffort, we could close the doughnut hole in the prescription drug \nprogram under Medicare, and we should. That was something that never \nmade any sense and creates a real disadvantage for seniors on limited \nincome. I think we should close that. I also think preventive care for \nseniors makes sense--regular physical checkups, things that can enhance \ntheir lives and let them live independently as long as they want to and \ncan, with our help.\n  I will tell you, this debate will continue. Now it gets into the part \nwhere the bill comes to the floor within the next week or so. We will \nentertain amendments from both sides. I hope, from the other side of \nthe aisle, we have more than criticism. If they would step up and say: \nHere is our plan, it would be a much better debate. But so far they \nhave not. They have decided to step to the sidelines and be critical of \nthe game that is being played. That is their right to do under this \ndemocratic form of government, but it is a question of credibility.\n  If they are defending the status quo, if they want to continue with \nwhat we have in America, if they want to ignore the escalation in the \ncost of health care for businesses and individuals, families and \ngovernments, if they want to ignore the fact that 40 million Americans \ndo not have health insurance, that 14,000 will lose their health \ninsurance today, if they want to ignore the reality of all these people \nwithout insurance and the abuses heaped on them by health insurance \ncompanies for those who have insurance, then, frankly, that is not a \nconstructive position in this debate.\n  We need to work together. We have tried to work together. We have \ninvited the Republicans to come join us in this effort. But, \nunfortunately, they have taken the side of the insurance companies. \nThey have taken the side of the status quo. They have not joined us.\n  I do not want to put people's insurance at risk by allowing insurance \ncompanies to continue to drop insurance when people need it the most. I \ndo not think we should be in a position where we allow this to \ncontinue.\n  I hope, as part of health care reform, we can make a significant \neffort to change this, to bring real change to America. I am glad \nPresident Obama is leading us that way. I think together we can reach \nthat goal. I know a lot of people are confused across this country \ntrying to understand exactly what is going on in this debate. But a lot \nof people in good faith are trying to solve one of the biggest problems \nwe have ever faced. I hope my friends on the Republican side of the \naisle will do more than criticize. I hope they will join us in an \neffort to make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10175-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10175-S10181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is always a privilege to hear the \nassistant Democratic leader, who is one of the most skillful orators in \nthe Senate. In this case, he needs to be because he is put in the \nawkward position of having to defend, as I heard him, 1,000-page bills \nand Medicare cuts, which is an awkward place for the assistant \nDemocratic leader to be.\n  As far as the Republican plan, he has heard our plan many times. We \nwant to reduce costs. Instead of 1,000-page bills and changing the \nwhole system and adding to the debt and cutting Medicare and raising \npremiums for millions of Americans, we would like to say our goal is to \nreduce costs--costs to you when you buy your health insurance and the \ncost of your government. We would like to go step by step in the right \ndirection, which we say is reducing costs and re-earning the trust of \nthe American people, and then we can take some more steps. We have \noffered a number of proposals to do that, none of which have been \nseriously considered.\n  For example, small businesses should be able to pool their resources \nthe way big businesses can. If they could, they could afford to offer \ninsurance--it has been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office--to \nmillions more Americans. We should make a serious effort to eliminate \njunk lawsuits against doctors, which everyone agrees adds costs to the \ninsurance premiums we buy and to the cost of health care.\n  We could allow Americans to purchase insurance across State lines. We \ncould create health insurance exchanges so if you are buying an \nindividual policy, you could buy that more easily. We can go across \nparty lines to encourage the use of more technology. Almost all \nRepublicans and I imagine some Democrats would like to change the \nincentives behind health spending, so we take the money we are using to \nsubsidize health insurance now and spread it more equitably among all \nthe people and allow them to buy more of their own insurance.\n  Those are five or six steps we could take in the direction of cutting \ncosts. Instead, what we are presented with is, yes, another 1,000-page \nbill. We have some questions about the bill because it appears--we know \nit will cut your Medicare, and I want to go back to that in a moment--\nhalf the bill will be paid for by Medicare cuts. Forty million seniors \ndepend on Medicare. Are we going to cut grandma's Medicare? We are not \neven going to spend it on grandma. We are going to spend it on a new \nprogram, at a time when the trustees of the Medicare Program have told \nus Medicare is going to go broke between 2015 and 2017. We are going to \nraise your taxes.\n  That is what the bill coming toward us would be. We are going to make \nit hard for your States to support colleges and education or raise your \nState taxes because we are sending the bill to them for a large \nMedicaid expansion. For millions of Americans, we are going to increase \nyour premiums. We are going to make it more expensive for you to buy \nthe same kind of policy you already have because the government is \ngoing to tell you exactly what kind of policy you should have. We are \ngoing to increase your Federal debt because the plan, as we hear about \nit, does not have any provision for paying doctors serving Medicare \nmore over the next 10 years--which we always do--so that is another \n$285 billion on your debt, just if we pay doctors 10 years from now \nwhat we pay them today for the government-run programs. We are going to \nspend another $1 trillion. And, yes, it is a 1,000-page bill.\n  So we what we are saying is, we have had before this Senate for a \nlong time a number of proposals we could use to reduce your cost when \nyou buy health insurance and reduce the cost of your Federal \nGovernment, which is going broke because of health care expenses, but \nthey are not being seriously considered. So we are saying, at least if \nyou are going to come up with these 1,000-page bills to change our \nentire system, we want to read it and we want to know what it costs. \nEven the President has said we cannot add one dime to the deficit. How \ncan we know we are not adding one dime to the deficit if we cannot read \nthe bill and we do not know what it costs?\n  Senator Bunning of Kentucky brought up that in the Finance Committee \nthe other day, and the Democrats voted it down. They said you cannot \neven put the bill up for 72 hours--this 1,000-page bill--so we can find \nout if it cuts your Medicare, if it raises your taxes, if it bankrupts \nyour State, if it increases your premium, if it increases the Federal \ndebt. We cannot even find that out. They said: No, not even 72 hours.\n  Well, some Democratic Senators have taken a look at that and said--\nthe Democrats who voted that down; and every vote against the 72-hour \nprovision was a Democratic vote--they said: We do not agree with that. \nEight Democrats have written Senator Reid, and they said: The \nlegislative text and the complete Congressional Budget Office scores of \nthe health care legislation, as amended, should be made available to \nthe public for 72 hours prior to the vote on the final passage of the \nbill in the Senate. Further, the legislative text of all amendments \nfiled and offered for debate should be posted on a public Web site \nprior to beginning debate on the amendment on the Senate floor. The \nconference report ought to be as well.\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n  I think what that means, in plain English, is that once the Finance \nCommittee bill--which is not a bill now; it is just concepts--goes into \nMajority Leader Reid's office, and he puts it together with the HELP \nCommittee bill, which will be turned into legislative text, we would \nlike for that to be on the Internet for 72 hours so we in the Senate \nand our staffs and the American people can read it.\n  Second, we want to make sure the Congressional Budget Office has a \nchance to read the entire bill so some staff member does not change it \nin the middle of the night, as they apparently did with the HELP \nCommittee bill, and we can know exactly how much each of the provisions \ncost, and then we can start voting, then we can offer our amendments. \nAs the Republican leader was saying today, some of our amendments are \ngoing to have to do with Medicare, the program that 40 million seniors \ndepend on.\n  Let's be clear about this. Some things are facts. Half the bill is \ngoing to be paid for by Medicare cuts. Half the bill is going to be \npaid for by Medicare cuts. You can call them anything you want to, but \nthey are Medicare cuts.\n\n  The second thing about it is, it may be grandma's Medicare we are \ncutting, but we are going to spend it on somebody other than grandma. \nWe are going to take that money out of the Medicare Program, which is a \n$38 trillion unfunded liability and which the trustees say is going to \ngo broke in 2017 and which 40 million Americans depend on, and we are \ngoing to take those savings and we are not going to spend it to make \nMedicare stronger; we are going to spend grandma's Medicare benefits on \nsomebody else. We are going to cut her benefits and spend it on you. \nDoes that make sense? We don't think so. We don't think so. We don't \nthink we should be paying for this new $1 trillion bill by writing a \ncheck, as the Senator from Kansas has said, on an overdrawn bank \naccount and buying a new car, which is what that turns out to be.\n  The Republican leader talked about what the cuts are to Medicare \nAdvantage: $140 million. One-fourth of seniors on Medicare have \nMedicare Advantage accounts. Cuts include $150 billion for hospitals \nthat care for seniors; $40 billion, home health agencies; $8 billion, \nhospices--all from Medicare to be spent on something else.\n  The President said people who are currently signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage are going to have Medicare at the same level of benefits. \nWell, we want to read the bill and know what it costs because that is \nnot what the Congressional Budget Office Director said. He testified \nthat seniors under Medicare Advantage would have benefits that \ndisappear under the bill that is coming out of the Finance Committee. \nHe said those changes would reduce extra benefits such as dental, \nvision, and hearing coverage that currently are made available to \nbeneficiaries.\n  We want to read the bill. We want to know what it costs. We want to \nknow why we are cutting Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion--that is the first \nquestion--and the second question is, Why are we spending that money on \nsomething else when it ought to be spent on making Medicare stronger? \nThe bill has $\\1/2\\ trillion in savings from Medicare. At least they \ncould take that money and use it toward the money we pay to physicians. \nI mentioned it a little earlier, but every year physicians say: The \ngovernment-run program of Medicare only pays us 80 percent of what \nprivate insurance plans pay us, and you are about to cut that. So we \nalmost always, on a bipartisan basis, put it back up. That is not in \nthe bill. We don't even include that. We don't take that into account. \nSo that is going to add to the debt.\n  Then there are other questions we have in addition to the Medicare \ncuts. What about the elegantly called ``doc fix'' that will add to the \ndebt? It is the Medicaid Program. To some people, that may get a little \nconfusing. Medicare is for seniors. Medicaid is the program that \nusually has a different name in most States. It is a program that \nstarted years ago, and the Federal Government pays 40, 45 percent of it \nand the States pay the rest. It has been going straight to the Moon. \nAccording to the New York Times, costs are rising in Medicaid this year \nat record rates--7.9 percent.\n  I know as a former Governor, here is what really happens. You sit \nthere making up your budgets, and you do the part for prisons and you \ndo the part for kindergarten through the 12th grade and the part for \nhighways and the part for State parks, and then the rest of the money \nis usually split between higher education and Medicaid. Guess what is \nhappening. Medicaid goes up and higher education doesn't get the money. \nThen what happens? College tuition goes up because colleges such as the \nUniversity of Tennessee and Texas and New Mexico and Colorado are \nunderfunded today primarily because of increasing Medicaid costs.\n  What this bill does is dump a lot more low-income Americans into that \nMedicaid Program and send a lot of the bill to the States. The Governor \nof Tennessee, a Democrat, said in the morning paper that it is going to \ncost us $735 million at least--maybe over $1 billion--over the next 5 \nyears. Tennessee can't afford that. Tennessee is a conservative, well-\nmanaged State. Governor Schwarzenegger has said that in California it \ncould be up to $8 billion. California is already nearly bankrupt. The \nDemocratic Governor of Michigan has said he doesn't see how they can \npay for this. The Governors of every State have said to us: Mr. \nSenator, Mr. Congressman, if you want to expand Medicaid, if you want \nto expand Medicaid, pay for it; pay for it in Washington, don't send it \nto us.\n  So we are looking forward to reading this bill. We are looking \nforward to knowing what it costs. We have our proposals. I will be glad \nto spend some time on the floor with the assistant Democratic leader \nand talk with him about the Republican proposals to take us step by \nstep toward reducing health care costs, first for you and your premiums \nand next for your government, and why we are skeptical of this 1,000-\npage bill. But we at least want to know what it costs. We at least want \nto know why it is cutting Medicare by half-trillion-dollar, and if it \nis being cut, why is grandma's Medicare cut being spent on some new \nprogram. We would like to know how much does it raise your taxes. We \nwould like to be able to tell you what it is going to do to your \nState's education system and to your State taxes. We would like to be \nable to tell millions of Americans: Will this really raise your \npremiums instead of lowering them and will it really increase your \nFederal debt?\n  So we are grateful eight Democratic Senators have joined us in saying \nto the majority leader: Let's make sure this bill is finally a bill \nthat will give us all the language before us, that it is on the \nInternet for 72 hours, and that we know exactly what the provisions \ncost--all of that before we have our first vote.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nTennessee for speaking so eloquently and raising the issues that are on \nthe minds not just of Senators who are going to have to vote on this \nlegislation but our constituents all across America--people who will be \ndirectly affected by what we do here on health care reform.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor and I asked the question: Will we have \na transparent debate? This morning, when I got up and checked my e-\nmail, I was delighted to see that eight Democratic Senators have \nwritten to the majority leader, Senator Reid, and said they wanted to \nhave bill language posted on the Internet and a score or cost by the \nCongressional Budget Office at least 72 hours before we are required to \nvote on the bill. That is exactly what we had requested in the Finance \nCommittee, which we lost strictly on a party-line vote, an amendment \nthat would have made that part of the bill. So I consider that \nprogress. I am delighted that these eight Democratic Senators have \nasked the majority leader for that. I think that is a minimum we should \nexpect in terms of transparency.\n  Today, I have a new question, and that is whether seniors will get to \nkeep the Medicare benefits they currently have. Will seniors be able to \nkeep the Medicare benefits they currently have? The President has made \nthis a consistent theme, that if you like what you have, you are going \nto be able to keep it. He said in August that if you\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\nlike your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. It \nseems pretty straightforward and unambiguous.\n  Last month, he was more specific about one part of Medicare. He said:\n\n       People currently signed up for Medicare Advantage are going \n     to have Medicare and the same level of benefits . . . These \n     folks will be able to get Medicare just as good and provide \n     the same benefits.\n\n  Some of these programs get a little confusing, but let me explain \nthat Medicare Advantage is a private sector competitor to Medicare fee-\nfor-service, where you just--it basically provides people with an array \nof coverages, and I think Senator Alexander mentioned vision and dental \ncare and prescription drug coverage and the like.\n  I believe allowing seniors to keep the benefits they currently have \nunder Medicare Advantage--and there are some 11 million of them--is a \ngoal Republicans share with the President. So if the President is \nsincere when he says that Medicare--and particularly Medicare \nAdvantage--beneficiaries can keep what they have, we would like to help \nhim keep that promise. Medicare Advantage is working for about 11 \nmillion seniors to give them a choice with their health benefits, and \nhalf a million of those are in Texas. Half a million Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries are in Texas.\n  As we have heard, Medicare fee-for-service, which is the government-\nrun plan, pays doctors about 20 percent less than employer-sponsored \ninsurance for reimbursements for services. That is why in my State, \nabout 42 percent of doctors will not see a new Medicare patient under a \nfee-for-service arrangement, because the fees are so low that the \ndoctors can't provide the service at that price and still stay in \nbusiness. So what happens is that 89 percent of seniors have \nsupplemental coverage. My mother, who passed away this last spring, \nbought supplemental coverage to try to make up for the difference where \nMedicare fee-for-service left that gap. Of course, many low-income \nAmericans depend on Medicare Advantage as their supplemental coverage.\n  Some have claimed that Medicare Advantage provides extra payments, \nand they want to cut Medicare Advantage because they say it will reduce \ninsurance company profits and not harm coverage. But under Federal law, \nthat is simply not the case. Under Federal law, the fact is that 75 \npercent of those payments to Medicare Advantage over and above what \nMedicare fee-for-service pays go directly to better benefits for \nseniors, under current law. That is why we hear they get vision \ncoverage, dental coverage, prescription drug coverage; they get better \nbenefits because we as a Congress say 75 percent of those so-called \nextra payments go to provide better benefits. Unfortunately, the \nFinance Committee bill will take those benefits away from seniors \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage. In other words, if we were to call up \nthis Finance Committee bill today and to pass it, it would violate the \nPresident's promise, that the 11 million people on Medicare Advantage \nwould not see a cut in their benefits.\n  There are various numbers floating around. That is why we need what \nSenator Alexander said: the numbers from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. But the Finance Committee proposal cuts nearly $113 billion \nfrom the Medicare Advantage Program. Common sense tells us you can't do \nthat without having a negative impact on Medicare Advantage for those \n11 million seniors, 500,000 of them in Texas, as I said.\n  The Congressional Budget Office agrees with that sort of intuitive or \ncommonsense conclusion. They estimate that the Finance Committee bill \nwill cut benefits by more than half to Medicare Advantage seniors. \nDuring the Finance Committee markup, the Congressional Budget Office \nDirector, Dr. Doug Elmendorf, told us that approximately half of the \nMedicare Advantage benefits will be cut for those seniors enrolled in \nMedicare Advantage.\n  So just as yesterday when my question was, will this debate be \ntransparent, my question for today is, will seniors get to keep the \nMedicare benefits they currently have? I think that should be a focus. \nI know it will be a focus for the 11 million who are on Medicare \nAdvantage. But for all seniors who are seeing a proposed cut of $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in Medicare in order to pay for a new government program while \nMedicare itself is on the brink of bankruptcy and has tens of trillions \nof dollars of unfunded liabilities, this is a question a lot of my \nconstituents in Texas and a lot of seniors across the country are \nasking: Will seniors get to keep the Medicare benefits they currently \nhave? That is what the President promised. We need to make sure this \nbill keeps that promise.\n  In the coming days, I will come back to the floor and ask more \nquestions about these extraordinarily complex proposals we have seen, \nincluding the bills that have come out of the HELP Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and out of the House of Representatives, because I \nthink we need to break it down into smaller pieces and ask these \ndiscrete questions so the American people can judge for themselves \nwhether these bills do what the President has promised.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, do I have 10 minutes allocated?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. It sounds as if I have 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I also rise today to speak about the debate before the Congress right \nnow, which is health care reform.\n  I believe we need health reform in this country and health insurance \nreform in this country. I would love to see us embark on a set of time-\ntested, budget-neutral principles. I absolutely believe we ought to \naddress the issue of preexisting conditions. I absolutely believe we \nought to look at exchanges where citizens all across this country have \naccess to the same kinds of choices I have as a Senator. I hope we will \naddress the issue of cross-state competition where people in States are \nnot just stuck with the choices that exist because of the monopolies \nthat occur within their State boundaries. So I would love to see some \ncross-state competition.\n  I absolutely believe we ought to have Tax Code changes. I think we \nought to limit the amount of tax-free benefits individuals can receive \nfrom their employers. I will just throw out a number. If that number \nwas established at $17,000, for instance, about $450 billion would be \ngenerated over a 10-year period that could be used as a voucher or \nrefundable tax credit to enable 15 to 20 million Americans to be able \nto access private, affordable, quality insurance.\n  I think we ought to address tort reform. We know there is so much in \nthe way of medical procedures that are done, in essence, for defensive \nmedicine so that they are not sued or the victims of junk lawsuits.\n  I am one of those people who absolutely believes it is time in this \ncountry that we had certain health reforms and health insurance reform. \nI think now is the time to debate and put into place those sensible, \ntime-tested reforms. My guess is, if we sat down in a bipartisan way, \nwhich I know is not occurring at this moment, we could go 50 yards down \nthe field in a way to create access for Americans in our country that \nall of us want to see and, again, do so in a way that doesn't push off \ncosts into future generations.\n  I have serious problems with what is being discussed in the Finance \nCommittee today as far as how we are going to pay for the many reforms \nthat go beyond what I just discussed. In many cases, it is very \nunnecessary. Let me go over a couple of those.\n  No. 1, I think most people are aware by now that the Senate Finance \nCommittee mark is basically causing States to have an unfunded \nliability. The Governor of our State, who is on the other side of the \naisle, just sent me a letter yesterday and told me he expects the \nrevenues in the State of Tennessee to be at 2008 levels in the year \n2013. In other words, there has been a tremendous decrease in revenues \nfor State government. Yet per the mark before the Finance Committee \ntoday, they are pushing off on the citizens of our State a $735 million \nunfunded liability. That doesn't sound like a lot of money in \nWashington, but I can assure you it is a lot of money for the State of \nTennessee. As you can imagine, as the years go out that number \nincreases tremendously.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n  It is my belief there are States all across this country that are \ngoing to be coming to us asking why we are pushing off an issue to the \nState. I think that is incredibly irresponsible. I think we need to \nensure that does not occur.\n  I have to tell you, an issue I have an even greater problem with is \nthe fact that we all know we have a $40 trillion unfunded liability as \nit relates to Medicare. Two or three years ago, there was a broad \nconsensus, on a bipartisan basis, that we needed to address the \nunfunded liability that threatens our country under the entitlement \nprograms--mostly Medicare, which is $40 trillion. This bill takes $400 \nbillion to $500 billion from Medicare and uses it to create a whole new \nentitlement. Instead of doing those things that would strengthen \nMedicare, which the trustees have said is going to be insolvent in \n2017--instead of doing that, which is the responsible thing for us to \nfocus on today, this Finance Committee mark would take money from a \nprogram that is insolvent and use it to leverage a new entitlement \nprogram. I think that is the most irresponsible, shortsighted thing \nthis Congress can do.\n  In addition to that, it doesn't even deal with the issue of the doc \nfix. We all know physicians and providers who serve seniors today, to \nmake the same money in 10 years they are making today, would cost $285 \nbillion. Instead of dealing with that issue, the can is being kicked \ndown the road, and we are not dealing with that.\n  I think the American people respect--and I respect--the people who \ncame before us who are called the ``greatest generation.'' Sometimes \nthey are called the ``greatest generation'' because of their sacrifices \nand their military efforts overseas. Sometimes it is because they saved \nand made the tough choices that have helped make this country great. \nBut I believe if this Congress acts to take money from Medicare, which \nis insolvent, and doesn't use those cost savings to make Medicare more \nsolvent, we will be contributing to the fact--and there is no doubt in \nmy mind that the political leadership that exists today in this country \nis undoubtedly the most selfish that this country has ever seen. We are \nwitnessing that today. We are a part of that today.\n  It is my belief if we continue to throw future generations under the \nbus, which is what we are doing with legislation like is being proposed \ntoday--we are throwing future generations under the bus to score a \npolitical victory that we all know is not paid for--the wrath of the \nAmerican people is going to come upon us, and it should.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter from our Governor. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have this letter printed in the Record. It talks about the \ncosts this program will put on the State of Tennessee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           State of Tennessee,\n\n                                   Nashville, TN, October 5, 2009.\n     Hon.

Some of \n     these cuts would be unpleasant (e.g. complete transfer to the \n     Exchange of women with breast or cervical cancer, or \n     institutionalized patients) and will require the specific \n     approval of CMS, which has historically been difficult. I \n     want to acknowledge that the White House, and Nancy Ann \n     DeParle in particular, have been very helpful in facilitating \n     our getting the best information available.\n       I would also point out two areas that are potential \n     problems that are not incorporated in the table:\n       1. Broader Pharmacy Benefits ($1.07 billion exposure). The \n     Baucus bill contains a provision that Exchange plans are \n     required to have no lifetime or annual limits on ``any \n     benefits'' and that the pharmacy benefit design be at least \n     as good as Medicare Part D. We have (as do many states) a \n     much more limited pharmacy benefit than this for Medicaid and \n     I can't imagine that there won't be pressure to extend the \n     Exchange mandated benefit to Medicaid as well. It would cost \n     the state about a billion dollars over the period to do this, \n     and of course there are many sub-areas of restrictions and \n     controls such as mandates in the areas of preferred drug \n     lists, prior authorization criteria, quantity limits, or \n     additional drug rebate limitations (all of which are present \n     in Part D) that would drive costs up substantially as well.\n       The fear is that new requirements here would not occur as a \n     single action to be teed-up and discussed in the Congress, \n     but quietly and state-by-state in the ongoing process of \n     renewing waivers, approving state plans, and the like. It is \n     right now the stated intention of Senate Finance to leave the \n     Medicaid pharmacy benefit design alone; it would be of \n     enormous relief to us to get that clearly written into the \n     law.\n       2.- Provider Payment Rates ($2.1 billion exposure). Our \n     analysis is based on an assumption that we will not be \n     required as either a matter of law or practicality to \n     increase provider rates to maintain an adequate provider \n     network with the influx of new patients (and in the \n     environment of federal cuts to Medicare rates). We currently \n     pay on the average at 85% of Medicare (the national average \n     is 72%), but separately from reform have budgeted to reduce \n     these to the equivalent of 79% of Medicare in the next fiscal \n     year as the stimulus money runs out. The cost of increasing \n     provider payments from 79% to 100% of Medicare it $2.1 \n     billion over the 5\\1/2\\ year period being considered. \n     (Furthermore, in several states where provider payments have \n     been recently reduced in response to budget needs, providers \n     have filed suit in federal court seeking to prevent them, and \n     in at least two states (California and Washington) have been \n     successful. If this were to happen in Tennessee it would \n     represent a further immediate unbudgeted cost of \n     approximately $113 million annually, or an additional $1.2-\n     1.4 billion over the ten year period.)\n       Bob and Bart, the problem that we're facing is simple: by \n     2013, we expect to have returned to our 2008 levels of \n     revenue and will have already cut programs dramatically--over \n     a billion dollars. At that point, we have to start digging \n     out--we will have not given raises to state employees or \n     teachers for five years, our pension plans will need shoring\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\n     up, our cash reserves (``rainy day fund'') will have been \n     considerably depleted and in need of restoration, and we will \n     not have made any substantial new investments for years. \n     There will have been major cuts to areas such as Children's \n     Services that we really need to restore. On top of these, \n     there are all the usual obligations that need to be met--\n     Medicaid, for example, will continue to grow at rates in \n     excess of the economy and our tax revenues. It's going to \n     take at least a full decade to dig our way out and back to \n     where we were prior to the recession.\n       In this environment, for the Congress to also send along a \n     mandatory bill for three quarters of a billion dollars for \n     the health reform they've designed is very difficult. These \n     are hard dollars--we can't borrow them--and make the \n     management of our finances post-recession even more daunting \n     than it already is. We keep a running budgetary estimate for \n     my own use of what we project in the years ahead, and I've \n     attached the current version of it to give you a sense of \n     what we are facing.\n       I would point out that the problem is entirely recession-\n     related. If our revenues had grown from the 2008 base at the \n     normal average rates we have experienced over the years--good \n     times and bad--we would have well over $2 billion of \n     additional revenue in 2019 (and smaller obligations in the \n     pension area) and would definitely be prepared to accommodate \n     reform.\n       I very much want to support the President, and Lord knows \n     that we have plenty of people in Tennessee who need help with \n     health insurance. But this is an extraordinary time for us \n     (and we are better off than many other states) and I will \n     appreciate any way in which you can help us manage through \n     this.\n           Warmest regards,\n                                                    Phil Bredesen,\n                                                         Governor.\n       Attachment.\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS07OC09.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2847, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2847) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined today by \nmy distinguished colleague from Alabama, Senator Richard Shelby. We \nwish to present the Commerce-Justice appropriations bill to the Senate. \nWhat I wish to say to my colleagues is that as we do this, everyone \nshould know this bill is a product of bipartisan cooperation. At times, \nwhen one views the Senate through the lens of the media, one would \nthink that everything we do here is very prickly and very partisan. But \nthat is not true, certainly of the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations.\n  Senator Shelby and I worked together on this bill. Yes, I do chair \nit, but it has been with maximum consultation with others on the other \nside of the aisle. It was the same way when Senator Shelby chaired this \ncommittee.\n  We are pleased to present to the Senate the fiscal year 2010 bill to \nfund the Departments of Commerce and Justice and air science agencies. \nI thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for allowing \nto us to bring the CJS bill to the floor.\n  The CJS bill is a product of cooperation between Senator Shelby and \nme and our excellent staff. We have worked hand in hand. I thank \nSenators Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran for their allocation.\n  We were able to write a very good bill, but the stringent budget \nenvironment required the subcommittee to make difficult decisions. The \nCJS bill totals $64.9 billion in discretionary spending, consistent \nwith the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation. So any amendments to the \nbill will need to be offset.\n  The purpose of the CJS bill is to fund the Department of Commerce and \nits bureaus and administration. Many people do not know what the \nDepartment of Commerce truly does. It is an array of complex agencies \nthat is important to our economy: The Bureau of Industry and Security \ngives licenses for exports; the Economic Development Administration \ncreates economic growth in our communities, particularly midsized to \nsmall towns; the Census Bureau, preparing now, somewhat unevenly, for \nthe 2010 census; the Patent and Trade Office which protects our \nintellectual property; along with the International Trade \nAdministration which enforces our trade laws.\n  We are particularly proud of the Commerce Department, of the National \nInstitutes for Standards and Technology. It sets the standards for \ntechnology which allows our country and our companies to be able to \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  This subcommittee also funds the Department of Justice which keeps us \nsafe from violent crime and terrorism. It prosecutes criminals of all \nkind--white collar, blue collar or no collar. It also has a vigorous \napproach to the despicable practice of being a sexual predator.\n  This subcommittee through the Department of Justice funds our State \nand local police departments which are so important as well from not \nonly the enforcement end but the prosecution end through the U.S. \nAttorney's Office.\n  NASA is also funded through this subcommittee. It explores our \nplanets and our universe and inspires our Nation and next generation to \nbe scientists and engineers.\n  We also fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nprotecting our marine resources and the jobs that depend on them.\n  It also protects our weather to save lives. Many people don't realize \nthat the wonderful weather reports they get in their communities comes \nbecause of the NOAA weather administration. They think it comes from \nthe Weather Channel. We all love the Weather Channel, but the Weather \nChannel depends on NOAA.\n  The National Science Foundation is also funded, providing basic \nresearch at our universities to advance science and support teacher \ntraining and development.\n  We also fund several independent commissions and agencies, including \nthe Commission on Civil Rights, the EEOC, the Legal Services \nCommission, the International Trade Commission, and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Senator Shelby's and my No. 1 priority is making sure that 300 \nmillion Americans who work hard and play by the rules are safe from \nterrorism and violent crime. We also want to protect jobs in our \ncountry. So we are the basic investors in innovation through education \nand through promoting an innovation-friendly government, making \nstrategic investments in research and education in science and \ntechnology, keeping America No. 1 in science and also No. 1 in the \nspace exploration program.\n  We want to create jobs in America that will stay in America. However, \nwe, too, are fiscal stewards of the public purse and, therefore, \naccountability has been a hallmark of our bipartisan relationship. We \ndo stand sentry against waste, fraud, and abuse with strong fiscal \naccountability and stewardship of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to talk about keeping America safe. The \nCJS bill provides $27.4 billion for the Justice Department. We actually \nwent above the President's request by $300 million because we wanted to \nmake an extra effort to protect our homeland and protect our hometowns.\n  This bill is one of the most important sources of Federal funds for \nState and local law enforcement, for our frontline men and women of our \nState and local police forces. It is the cops on the beat who protect \nour families and at the same time they are asked to do more.\n  We are providing $3.2 billion to support that thin blue line to make \nsure the police are safe with equipment they need, such as bulletproof \nvests and also new technologies.\n  ``CSI'' is not only a great TV show, but we think CSI should be \nfunded in the Federal budget to use the best of science to catch the \nworst of the criminals.\n  We also fund Byrne formula grants, and this bill will provide $510 \nmillion for State and local police operations to do their job.\n  We are funding important programs in juvenile justice, which are very \nkey programs of intervention and mentoring, but also very strong \nprograms for antigang efforts--$407 million.\n  We also want to prevent, protect, and prosecute when it comes to \nviolence against women, whether it is domestic violence, sexual \nassault, rape, or stalking--over $435 million--the highest level of \nfunding ever.\n  We also have very important Federal law enforcement. All of us know \nand love the FBI. This bill will provide $7.9 billion to keep us safe \nfrom violent crime and also white collar crime, investigating financial \nand mortgage fraud.\n  I want to acknowledge the role of Senator Shelby, who is an \nauthorizer on the Banking Committee and a member of this Appropriations \nCommittee. He has taken on the issue of mortgage fraud and wanted it to \nbe thoroughly investigated. We have done that through the FBI.\n  Many people don't realize, though, that after 9/11, when everyone was \nclamoring for something like the MI-5, such as the British have, we \nsaid: Three cheers for the British way, but we want a USA way, so we \ncreated an agency within an agency where the FBI is part of our most \nsignificant fight against terrorism.\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\n  We also fund the Drug Enforcement Agency to fight international \nnarcoterrorists and drug kingpins. This bill provides $2 billion to do \nit.\n  I am very proud of the FBI because in the last few weeks their work \nhas led to the arrest of two terrorism suspects who planned to blow up \nbuildings in Texas and in Illinois. While they were working hard, the \nefforts of the DEA led to the arrest of drug kingpins who were shipping \n95 kilograms into New York City.\n  We also have the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the \nMarshals Service, each of which has been funded at $1 billion-plus.\n  Our U.S. attorneys, who are the prosecutors of Federal crimes, have \nbeen provided $1.9 billion, a significant increase.\n  Once we catch and prosecute these criminals, there has to be Federal \nprisons, and we want to make sure our communities are secure and our \nprison guards are safe. This is one of the tattered areas of neglect, \nand we are very concerned about the safety of our prison guards. This \nbill provides $6.1 billion to upgrade, where necessary, the protective \ndevices to ensure criminals are held securely--acknowledging their \nrights, but also the rights of those who guard them need to be kept \ntoo. Their first right is the right to security, guaranteed by their \nown government.\n  We look to protecting our children and our communities, and when it \ncomes to protecting our children, crimes have gotten more sophisticated \nin terms of the Internet and other things that are used to lure \nchildren into terrible criminal situations. We have provided over $265 \nbillion to deal with the issue of sexual predators, and we will \ncontinue that fight.\n  While we are busy fighting crime and protecting our children, we also \nneed to protect America's jobs, and this is where science and \ninnovation come in with an amazing race to keep America competitive.\n  This bill provides $880 million for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology and, particularly, $70 million for the new \nTechnology Innovation Program and $125 million for the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership, so that we can keep manufacturing in our \ncountry. We also want to do the basic research that is needed for the \nnew ideas that will come up with the new products for the new jobs.\n  This bill provides $6.9 billion for the National Science Foundation, \nand for NOAA we provide $4.7 billion, including $980 million for our \nweather service and $870 million for our fisheries.\n  This bill also funds our space program: $18.7 billion for NASA. In \nthe space program, we don't agree with the House strategy; we agree \nwith the White House strategy. The House strategy includes $500 million \nfor the NASA exploration program. We believe we need to meet our \nobligations to fully fund the space shuttle and the space station. For \nthe space shuttle, we need to make sure we keep our astronauts safe and \nour space station is able to continue the work we have begun. We also \nneed to invest in the next generation of space vehicles at $3.6 \nbillion.\n  It is very important we meet our obligations, our international \nobligations, as well as our obligations to our astronauts and to our \nEarth-bound scientists. However, if you meet those scientists, they are \nnot bound by Earth very much. They are continually breaking barriers.\n  We know the House withheld money while waiting for the Augustine \nreport. Well, we have the Augustine report. We know where the President \nwants to go. We know what the key advisers in the astronaut community \nhave recommended to us--the gallant leaders from the past, such as Buzz \nAldrin and John Glenn, to the most contemporary right now. I might add \nwe have a space Senator in Senator Bill Nelson, one of our authorizers. \nSo we have worked hand-in-hand with our authorizers.\n  We are also working very hard in terms of protecting our intellectual \nproperty. We have been concerned through the Bush administration--well, \nthe Clinton administration, the Bush administration, and now we want to \ndeal with this during the Barack Obama administration--that we have too \nmany backlogs at our Patent and Trademark Office. We want to reduce \nthose. American ingenuity should not have to stand in long lines to get \ntheir patents to protect their intellectual property and to come up \nwith the products that will go into the global marketplace and at the \nsame time create jobs here.\n  We are also very proud of what we do to protect our planet, and what \nwe have done through NASA Earth science--$1.4 billion--and also what we \nare doing in weather satellites--$1.2 billion--which are very important \nglobal warming tools. If we can better protect and warn, we can save \nlives and save money.\n  The CJS bill ensures our constitutional obligation to do the 2010 \ncensus. We provide $7 billion to the Census. We are working hand-in-\nglove with Secretary Locke to make sure the Census Bureau is well \norganized to be able to do this very important job.\n  There are many more things we can talk about, but I know my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, wants to discuss the bill, and our good \nfriend from Arizona has an amendment. So, Mr. President, I will amplify \nthese other parts of the bill as we move forward.\n  I know Senator Shelby will return in a moment or two, so with \ndeference and the usual courtesy and comity, if the Senator from \nArizona wishes to offer his amendment, and then when Senator Shelby \nreturns he can make his statement, we will just keep the business of \nthe Senate moving as promptly and as well as we can.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2629\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration--amendment No. 2629.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2629.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds appropriated under this Act for \nthe purpose of preventing individuals, wholesalers, or pharmacists from \n                 importing certain prescription drugs)\n\n       On page 202, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. 530A.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     for the Department of Justice may be used to investigate or \n     enforce Federal laws related to the importation of \n     prescription drugs by individuals for personal use, by \n     pharmacists, or by wholesalers or to bring an action against \n     such individuals, pharmacists, or wholesalers related to such \n     importation: Provided, That the Department of Justice or its \n     subagencies do not have a reasonable belief that the \n     prescription drug at issue violates the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.): Provided further, \n     That the prescription drug at issue is not a controlled \n     substance, as defined in section 102 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802), or a biological product, as \n     defined in section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 262).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished manager, the \nSenator from Maryland, that I will be glad to interrupt my amendment \nupon the return of the Senator from Alabama, if he wishes to speak, and \nthen I will continue after that. I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher hard work and excellent explanation of the legislation before the \nSenate.\n  This amendment would lower health care costs for Americans \nimmediately. It would provide access to safe, less expensive imported \nprescription drugs. For far too long, powerful lobbyists from the \npharmaceutical industry have stood in the way of Americans' access to \naffordable imported drugs. Their enormous political campaign \ncontributions made in return for political support of their agenda and \ntheir secret unsavory deal with the White House in exchange for their \nsupport of the health care reform have further contributed to the \nAmerican people being prevented from accessing cheaper prescription \ndrugs.\n  Instead, Americans continue to pay 60 percent or higher for the same \nprescription drugs that are sold in Canada. This amendment is necessary \nbecause Americans need access to lower cost drugs now. They need it now \ndue to these difficult economic times. We all know about unemployment. \nAmericans' salaries are being cut, household budgets are slim, and \nmillions of Americans are struggling to make their\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nmonthly mortgage payments. For these reasons, and so many more, \nAmericans should not be forced to wait another day to purchase safe and \naffordable prescription drugs from outside the United States. While \nAmericans all over the country are having to choose between their next \nmeal and their necessary prescriptions, the large pharmaceutical \ncompanies continue to pressure Congress to delay consideration of any \nlegislation to allow the importation of safe and lower priced \nprescription drugs.\n  I would like to also point out this is legislation on an \nappropriations bill, something I have long opposed, and still oppose. \nBut there has been an unusual process taking place, and that process is \none which has forced me to come to this situation. On two separate \noccasions the majority leader of the Senate assured me that legislation \nwould be taken up before the Senate, and both times he has changed his \nmind. The majority leader resisted consideration of an amendment to \nallow for the importation of prescription drugs during debate on the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.\n  At the time, the majority leader said on the Senate floor:\n\n       This is something that should have been done, I am sorry to \n     say, years ago, not weeks ago.\n\n  This issue is important legislation. If it should have been done \nyears ago, then why wasn't it brought up for consideration immediately \nafter the tobacco bill in June? While the stand-alone bill to allow \nimportation--S. 1232--was placed on the Senate's calendar on June 11, \n2009, there has been no further effort by the majority leader to call \nit up for consideration. Instead, he sent me a letter stating:\n\n       I committed to take up legislation that would permit the \n     safe importation of lower-cost prescription drugs as soon as \n     practicable.\n\n  The practicable time was back in June. There is no practical reason \nto prevent the majority leader from calling up this bill for a vote at \nany time.\n  I was told verbally by the majority leader as short a time as 3 weeks \nago that upon the completion of consideration of the Defense \nappropriations bill that this legislation would be brought to the floor \nof the Senate. Then a week later I was told, no; that is not going to \nbe the case. So I have been waiting for ``as soon as practicable,'' and \nso have millions of Americans who are looking for cheaper alternatives \nto the high-priced prescription drugs.\n  The majority leader also stated in his letter:\n\n       If this issue is not addressed during the full Senate's \n     consideration of comprehensive health reform, I guarantee \n     that I will move to proceed to S. 1232 before the end of the \n     year.\n\n  The majority leader of the Senate assured me it would be taken up \nafter completion of the Department of Defense appropriations bill, \nwhich we have completed. Given the fact that it is possible that the \nhealth care reform bill will be brought up under a truncated pressure \ntimeline, I have little faith that real, in-depth consideration of \nprescription drug import legislation will come about; therefore, I have \nno choice but to bring this issue up today as an amendment to this \nappropriations bill.\n  In the 2008 election cycle, pharmaceutical companies gave almost $30 \nmillion in campaign contributions to Members of Congress. Just this \nyear, according to an article published in The Hill, the prescription \ndrug industry has given more than $1 million to Republicans and \nDemocrats, and the companies whip up their protector in Congress each \ntime we bring forward legislation to help Americans get the imported \nprescription drugs they need.\n  Earlier this year, I read an e-mail sent by the top lobbyist for \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA--\nthis was back in June--which stated:\n\n       The Senate is on the bill today. Unless we get some \n     significant movement, the full blown Dorgan or Vitter bill \n     will pass. We are trying to get Senator Dorgan to back down, \n     calling the White House, and Senator Reid. Our understanding \n     is that Senator McCain has said he will offer regardless. \n     Please make sure your staff is fully engaged in this process. \n     This is real.\n\n  That was an e-mail from a lobbyist of PhRMA, which has given millions \nand millions in campaign contributions.\n  Guess what. In the immortal words of Jack Nicholson: I'm back. I am \nback on the Senate floor, trying to help millions of Americans who have \nlost their jobs, struggling to put food on the table, by giving them \nthe opportunity to save on their prescription drugs immediately.\n  Recently, the White House struck a deal with a pharmaceutical company \nto further protect its profits. The deal was bragged about by the head \nof the company's trade association, who cashed in for millions of \ndollars once he wrote the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nlegislation as a Congressman. He was quoted in an article in the New \nYork Times, published August 6, 2009, stating that the White House \n``wanted a big player to come in and set the bar for everybody else.''\n  The same article stated:\n\n       Mr. Tauzin said the White House had tracked the \n     negotiations throughout, assenting to decisions to move away \n     from ideas like the government negotiation of prices or the \n     importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. The $80 billion in \n     savings would be over a 10-year period.\n\n  Analyze that comment by the head lobbyist of one of the most powerful \nlobbies in Washington. He is saying the White House agreed to move away \nfrom--in other words, not support--ideas such as government negotiation \nof prices. Government negotiation of prices is absolutely necessary. We \ndid it in the prescription drug bill, and it has reduced costs. In \nother words, the pharmaceutical companies would have to compete for \nMedicare contracts. One would think that is an obvious solution to \nbringing down costs.\n  The second, of course, is the importation of cheaper drugs from \nCanada. Here everybody is talking about reducing health care costs. We \nknow that importation of less expensive drugs would save health care \ncosts for the American consumer. But the White House apparently, \naccording to Mr. Tauzin, agreed they would not support importation of \nless expensive drugs from Canada--a remarkable comment. You know, \npeople wonder why the tea parties are going on, why the approval rating \nof Congress is so low--amazing. The Fraser Institute found in 2008 that \nCanadians paid on average 53 percent less than Americans for identical \nbrand-name drugs. Specifically, the institute found that the most \ncommonly prescribed brand-name drug, Lipitor, is 40 percent less in \nCanada, Crestor is 57 percent less in Canada, and the popular arthritis \ndrug Celebrex is 62 percent less expense in Canada. Americans would \nlove a 60-percent-off coupon for prescription drugs and deserve such a \ndiscount now more than ever.\n  I have been working on this issue for many years, and I will continue \nto do so. Americans should not have to wait a day longer for relief \nfrom higher prices for drugs. Inexplicably, the majority leader keeps \ndelaying consideration of this needed legislation, which has now forced \nme to offer an amendment on the current appropriations bill. However, I \nbelieve it is necessary to protect all Americans' interests in \nobtaining affordable prescription drugs. The amendment states that no \nfunds can be used to prosecute those who seek to import prescription \ndrugs that have been approved by the FDA. If the big drug companies are \ngetting an $80 billion savings, shouldn't we give a savings to American \nconsumers? Why not now?\n  Again, I want to say there is going to be a point of order raised on \nthis bill, and with righteous indignation people will say it doesn't \nbelong on an appropriations bill. We just finished a Defense \nappropriations bill loaded--and I will have a list of them--with \nunauthorized appropriations on that bill. Every appropriations bill we \ntake up has unauthorized appropriations, ranging from $300,000 for a \nmuseum in Nebraska to the addition of C-17s for $2.5 billion. The \nargument that somehow we should not be taking up this legislation on \nthis bill flies in the face of what has been common practice around \nhere, even though I do not agree with it.\n  Let me say this, too. If I had full and complete confidence that this \namendment would get a full and complete airing as an amendment on the \nhealth care bill, I would be glad to withdraw this amendment. I will be \nglad to withdraw this amendment if we have assurance this amendment \nwill be taken up on the health care bill. There are all kinds of things \nthat are going to be\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\ndone in passage of the health care reform legislation--so-called--on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota here. I have appreciated his \nefforts for a long time. He and I have been working on this for a long \ntime. It is a fact that I received the word of the majority leader that \nthis bill would be taken up and that has not happened. That has \nhappened twice. I must say it has never happened to me before in the \nyears I have been a Member of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York \nTimes article of August 6, 2009, ``White House Affirms Deal on Drug \nCosts.''\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter \nfrom Senator Reid to Senator Snowe, Senator Dorgan, and to me.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 6, 2009]\n\n                 White House Affirms Deal on Drug Cost\n\n                         (By David Kirkpatrick)\n\n       Washington.--Pressed by industry lobbyists, White House \n     officials on Wednesday assured drug makers that the \n     administration stood by a behind-the-scenes deal to block any \n     Congressional effort to extract cost savings from them beyond \n     an agreed-upon $8o billion.\n       Drug industry lobbyists reacted with alarm this week to a \n     House health care overhaul measure that would allow the \n     government to negotiate drug prices and demand additional \n     rebates from drug manufacturers.\n       In response, the industry successfully demanded that the \n     White House explicitly acknowledge for the first time that it \n     had committed to protect drug makers from bearing further \n     costs in the overhaul. The Obama administration had never \n     spelled out the details of the agreement.\n       ``We were assured: `We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal,' '' Billy \n     Tauzin, the former Republican House member from Louisiana who \n     now leads the pharmaceutical trade group, said Wednesday. \n     ``Who is ever going to go into a deal with the White House \n     again if they don't keep their word? You are just going to \n     duke it out instead.''\n       A deputy White House chief of staff, Jim Messina, confirmed \n     Mr. Tauzin's account of the deal in an e-mail message on \n     Wednesday night.\n       ``The president encouraged this approach,'' Mr. Messina \n     wrote. ``He wanted to bring all the parties to the table to \n     discuss health insurance reform.''\n       The new attention to the agreement could prove embarrassing \n     to the White House, which has sought to keep lobbyists at a \n     distance, including by refusing to hire them to work in the \n     administration.\n       The White House commitment to the deal with the drug \n     industry may also irk some of the administration's \n     Congressional allies who have an eye on drug companies' \n     profits as they search for ways to pay for the $i trillion \n     cost of the health legislation.\n       But failing to publicly confirm Mr. Tauzin's descriptions \n     of the deal risked alienating a powerful industry ally \n     currently helping to bankroll millions in television \n     commercials in favor of Mr. Obama's reforms.\n       The pressure from Mr. Tauzin to affirm the deal offers a \n     window on the secretive and potentially risky game the Obama \n     administration has played as it tries to line up support from \n     industry groups typically hostile to government health care \n     initiatives, even as their lobbyists pushed to influence the \n     health measure for their benefit.\n       In an interview on Wednesday, Representative Raul M. \n     Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who is co-chairman of the \n     House progressive caucus, called Mr. Tauzin's comments \n     ``disturbing.''\n       ``We have all been focused on the debate in Congress, but \n     perhaps the deal has already been cut,'' Mr. Grijalva said. \n     ``That would put us in the untenable position of trying to \n     scuttle it.''\n       He added: ``It is a pivotal issue not just about health \n     care. Are industry groups going to be the ones at the table \n     who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over \n     the crust?''\n       The Obama administration has hailed its agreements with \n     health care groups as evidence of broad support for the \n     overhaul among industry ``stakeholders,'' including doctors, \n     hospitals and insurers as well as drug companies.\n       But as the debate has heated up over the last two weeks, \n     Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats have signaled that they \n     value some of its industry enemies-turned-friends more than \n     others. Drug makers have been elevated to a seat of honor at \n     the negotiating table, while insurers have been pushed away.\n       ``To their credit, the pharmaceutical companies have \n     already agreed to put up $80 billion'' in pledged cost \n     reductions, Mr. Obama reminded his listeners at a recent \n     town-hall-style meeting in Bristol, Va. But the health \n     insurance companies ``need to be held accountable,'' he said.\n       ``We have a system that works well for the insurance \n     industry, but it doesn't always work for its customers,'' he \n     added, repeating a new refrain.\n       Administration officials and Democratic lawmakers say the \n     growing divergence in tone toward the two groups reflects a \n     combination of policy priorities and political calculus.\n       With polls showing that public doubts about the overhaul \n     are mounting, Democrats are pointedly reminding voters what \n     they may not like about their existing health coverage to \n     help convince skeptics that they have something to gain.\n       ``You don't need a poll to tell you that people are paying \n     more and more out of pocket and, if they have some serious \n     illness, more than they can afford,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. \n     Obama's senior adviser.\n       The insurers, however, have also stopped short of the drug \n     makers in their willingness to cut a firm deal. The health \n     insurers shook hands with Mr. Obama at the White House in \n     March over their own package of concessions, including ending \n     the exclusion of coverage for pre-existing ailments.\n       But unlike the drug companies, the insurers have not \n     pledged specific cost cuts. And insurers have also \n     steadfastly vowed to block Mr. Obama's proposed government-\n     sponsored insurance plan--the biggest sticking point in the \n     Congressional negotiations.\n       The drug industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America, also opposes a public insurance \n     plan. But its lobbyists acknowledge privately that they have \n     no intention of fighting it, in part because their agreement \n     with the White House provides them other safeguards.\n       Mr. Tauzin said the administration had approached him to \n     negotiate. ``They wanted a big player to come in and set the \n     bar for everybody else,'' he said. He said the White House \n     had directed him to negotiate with Senator Max Baucus, the \n     business-friendly Montana Democrat who leads the Senate \n     Finance Committee.\n       Mr. Tauzin said the White House had tracked the \n     negotiations throughout, assenting to decisions to move away \n     from ideas like the government negotiation of prices or the \n     importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. The $80 billion in \n     savings would be over a 10-year period. ``80 billion is the \n     max, no more or less,'' he said. ``Adding other stuff changes \n     the deal.''\n       After reaching an agreement with Mr. Baucus, Mr. Tauzin \n     said, he met twice at the White House with Rahm Emanuel, the \n     White House chief of staff; Mr. Messina, his deputy; and \n     Nancy-Ann DeParle, the aide overseeing the health care \n     overhaul, to confirm the administration's support for the \n     terms.\n       ``They blessed the deal,'' Mr. Tauzin said. Speaker Nancy \n     Pelosi said the House was not bound by any industry deals \n     with the Senate or the White House.\n       But, Mr. Tauzin said, ``as far as we are concerned, that is \n     a done deal.'' He said, ``It's up to the White House and \n     Senator Baucus to follow through.''\n       As for the administration's recent break with the insurance \n     industry, Mr. Tauzin said, ``The insurers never made any \n     deal.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2009.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: During consideration of H.R. 1256, the \n     Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, I \n     committed to take up legislation that would permit the safe \n     importation of lower-cost prescription drugs as soon as \n     practicable. Shortly after making that commitment, Senator \n     Dorgan and I began the Rule XIV process on S. 1232, the \n     Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2009.\n       Unfortunately since taking that step, the Senate has \n     experienced an extremely full legislative agenda that has not \n     permitted me to turn to this important legislation as quickly \n     as I would have liked. In light of the approaching new fiscal \n     year, we have dedicated considerable time to appropriations \n     matters. (On March 24, I received a letter signed by all \n     Senate Republicans telling me it was critical that the Senate \n     dedicate an ``appropriate amount of time'' to pass the twelve \n     appropriations bills.) We have also completed action on the \n     FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act, a bill to extend \n     the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund and the unemployment \n     insurance program, as well as a number of executive \n     nominations.\n       Passing S. 1232 in the Senate will not be easy. Senate \n     action on many legislative items has taken significantly \n     longer than one would expect, even for measures that \n     ultimately pass by a broad bipartisan vote. Numerous \n     objections by Senate Republicans have forced the Senate to \n     jump through procedural hoops that accomplish little more \n     than delaying Senate action. Actions that have been taken by \n     consent with little or no debate now take many days. Further \n     complicating passage of this legislation is the fact that \n     during its markup of comprehensive health reform the HELP \n     Committee considered and defeated an effort to attach \n     importation language to the underlying bill.\n       Notwithstanding these obstacles, I stand by my earlier \n     commitment to make sure the Senate considers S. 1232 as soon \n     as practicable. If this issue is not addressed during the \n     full Senate's consideration of comprehensive health reform, I \n     guarantee that I\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\n     will move to proceed to S. 1232 before the end of the year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                                  Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to say again that we have been told \ntime after time that this legislation would come before the Senate. It \nhas not. I do not know what process the majority leader will use--\nreconciliation, fill up the tree, vote on cloture, make this amendment \nnongermane. I have no confidence. If I had the confidence that this \namendment would be taken up in a regular order fashion and that the \nfull Senate would vote on it on the health reform bill, I would have \nsome confidence we could get it done. In the absence of that, I will \nseek a vote on this amendment.\n  If there is a budget point of order on this amendment, let no one be \nfooled: It is not because they do not want to violate the budget rules \nof the Senate, because they violated them in every possible way in \nprevious appropriations bills, to the tune of billions of dollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me spend a few moments talking about \nthis issue of reimportation of prescription drugs and the history of it \nand the work many of us have done together, a large group of Members of \nthe Senate, including Senator McCain, working on this issue.\n  Senator McCain has offered an amendment, No. 2629, which he has just \nfinished discussing. As I understand the amendment, it would prohibit \nthe use of funds appropriated under the act for preventing individuals, \nwholesalers, or pharmacists from importing certain prescription drugs. \nThat is in the title. It does have, as I think Senator McCain \nsuggested, perhaps a point of order against it. I do not know whether \nit is because it would be legislating on an appropriations bill. In any \nevent, whatever the circumstances with this amendment, I was a bit \nsurprised to see this amendment on this bill, but everybody has a right \nto offer amendments.\n  Let me say that Senator McCain is a part of a group of us who have \nworked together. We have worked on a piece of legislation called the \nDorgan-Snowe legislation. Senator Snowe, as the major cosponsor, and \nmany others, including Senator McCain as a cosponsor, have worked on \nthis issue for a long time. The fact is, the appropriate place to \naddress this, in my judgment, is in the health care bill that is going \nto come to the floor in the next couple of weeks. I have said \npreviously that I fully intend to offer this bipartisan bill as an \namendment. We have over 30 cosponsors in the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats. It ranges from the late Senator Ted Kennedy, to John McCain \nand a wide range of Senators on both sides of the political aisle. That \nhas been the support for legislation that I think addresses a very \nimportant issue.\n  Let me describe the issue, if I might. I have in my desk in the \nSenate two bottles that contain medicine. Actually, these are empty \nbottles. This is Lipitor. The medicine that would be contained in these \nbottles is made in Ireland by a company that produces Lipitor. It is \nthe most popular cholesterol-lowering drug in America by far. It is \nmade in Ireland, in a plant that is inspected by the FDA, and the \nmedicine is then sent all around the world. These two bottles, as you \ncan see, are identical. These two bottles contained identical tablets, \n20 milligrams of Lipitor made in the same place, so it is the same \nmanufacturing, the same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same \ncompany. The difference? One is shipped to Canada, one is shipped to \nthe United States. Difference? Price. Here is the one that was shipped \nto Canada; this is $1.83 per tablet. This was sent to the United \nStates, $4.48 per tablet. The only difference is price. Why is that the \ncase? Because the American people are charged the highest prices for \nbrand-name prescription drugs in the world, the highest prices in the \nworld for brand-name drugs. In this case, we paid $4.48 per tablet; \nsomeone else paid $1.83. It doesn't matter whether it is Canada. It \ncould be England, Italy, France, Germany, Spain--we pay the highest \nprices in the world, and it is unfair.\n  The question is not, Is there a problem? Of course there is a \nproblem. We have a whole lot of folks in this country who cannot figure \nout how they are going to afford to pay for their groceries and their \nmedicine, so they go get their medicine first at the pharmacy in the \ngrocery store and figure out how much they can eat later. Of course \nthis is a problem.\n  I have described the guy who sat on a straw bale once at a farm a \nwhile back, 80 years old, who told me in a little meeting we had in a \nfarmyard: My wife has fought breast cancer for 3 years. She is in her \nseventies. And we have spent all of those 3 years driving to Canada to \ntry to buy Tamoxifen where it is sold for 80 percent less--an 80 \npercent lower price in Canada for the identical prescription drug. So \nmy wife and I are trying to drive up and get Tamoxifen in Canada.\n\n  The reason they can do that is, apparently at the border, a small \namount of personal use, up to 30 days or 60 or 90 days personal use of \nprescription drugs will be allowed to be brought over without a hassle.\n  But the question is what about the rest of the American people who \ncannot drive to the border or go to another country and access the same \nprescription drugs, same pill put in the same bottle by the same \ncompany who decided to charge the American people the highest prices in \nthe world? What about those people?\n  My point is this: We are going to have a big health care bill on the \nfloor of the Senate sometime in the next few weeks. Oh, it has been \nthrough this committee and that committee. It has been on a long, \ntortured trail. Lord knows every single day in the press we read the \nnext little news item about who said what about this.\n  One way or another we are going to have some kind of health care \nreform on the floor of the Senate. Will it pass? Will it be omnibus? \nWill it be comprehensive? I do not know any of those things. I do know \nthis: that the Gang of 6 and the gang in the Finance Committee or the \ngang in the HELP Committee are going to become a Gang of 100 or 100 \ngangs of 1 when it gets to the floor of the Senate. Everybody is going \nto have their amendments because most Members of the Senate have not \nhad an opportunity to weigh in on health care at this point with their \nown views and their own amendments. They are not on the committee, not \npart of a small gang. Let me say, on behalf of myself and I think \nSenator Snowe, it is the Snowe-Dorgan legislation with respect to \nprescription drug reimportation, which includes Senator McCain as a \ncosponsor, that when health care comes to the floor of this Senate, you \ncan count on it, that there is going to be an amendment and there is \ngoing to be a vote on the issue of the prices of prescription drugs.\n  Perhaps there are some people who do not want it. I understand they \ndo not want to have a vote on it. But in my judgment, there cannot be \ncredible efforts to address health care if you do not address the issue \nof health care costs, the relentless rising cost of health care.\n  Part of that, not an insignificant part, relates to the question of \nthe relentless runup of prescription drug costs every single year. Take \na look at the increased prices for prescription drugs every year and \nthen think about the people out there who are trying to figure out: How \ndo I pay for this?\n  I understand senior citizens have the opportunity, under Part D of \nMedicare, to have some drug coverage. I understand there is a problem \nwith that, there is what is called a doughnut hole in the Washington \nlexicon. I also understand that someone made a deal with the \npharmaceutical industry for $80 billion over 10 years, which is a \nrelatively small part of their gross revenues, in order to fill part of \nthe doughnut hole with 50 percent off on brand-name drugs.\n  I understand all that. I was not a part of it, nor was anybody I know \nof in this Chamber. The question is, What about all the rest of the \nAmerican people and the fact that they are now charged the highest \nprices in the world for brand-name prescription drugs? Is it fair? I \nsay no.\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n  We will offer an amendment. My colleague says he was promised and he \nwas concerned about that. I understand all that. All I am saying is, we \nare going to have this debate, this amendment, and this vote. It is \ngoing to be on health care. That is where it ought to be. It ought to \nbe on the health care bill.\n  I know that when we have this discussion, we are going to have people \nsay: If you do not allow the prescription drug folks, the \npharmaceutical industry, to charge these prices in our country, they \nwill do less research into finding cures for these deadly diseases.\n  You know what, the fact is they spend more money on promotion, \nmarketing, and advertising than they do on research. That is a fact. I \nmean you get up in the morning and turn the television set on, perhaps \nwhile you are brushing your teeth or something, and then listen to the \nads. The ads push at you every single day: Go ask your doctor today. It \nis Wednesday. Ask your doctor, is the purple pill right for you?\n  I do not know what the purple pill is, but it makes you feel like you \nshould go ask somebody if I should be taking the purple pill.\n  Go ask your doctor whether you might need Flomax. Go ask your doctor \nwhat you ought to be getting, what you ought to be taking that you now \ndo not know about or are not taking.\n  All these things are pushed at consumers in circumstances where the \nonly person who can prescribe that prescription drug is a doctor who \nhas decided you need it for your health. Yet every single day, \nrelentlessly across this country on television, in the journals and \nnewspapers and publications it says: Go check with your doctor. Ask \nyour doctor if you should be taking this medicine.\n  What about cutting back on some of that and reducing the price of \nprescription drugs? What about that? Let me make one other point, if I \nmight. My colleague indicated he has offered this, which is a funding \nlimitation on prescription drugs. The fact is, this has been a long and \ndifficult trail to pass legislation.\n  I understand. Were I working for the pharmaceutical industry, I would \nunderstand why you want to retain this little piece in Federal law that \nsays: The only entity that can reimport or import drugs into this \ncountry is the company that manufacturers them. I understand why they \nwant that to be the case. Because it allows them to price, in this \ncountry, however they want to price.\n  But we are told constantly this is a new economy, a global economy. \nIf it is a global economy, then what about allowing the American people \nthe freedom to access that global economy to find the identical FDA-\napproved prescription drug where it is sold for half the price?\n  They say: Yes, but you know what, if we do that, we are going to open \nit up to counterfeit drugs and so on. Guess what. Europe has been doing \nthis for 20 years. It is something called parallel trading. In Europe, \nif you are in Germany and want to buy a prescription drug from France, \nif you are in Spain and want to buy a prescription drug from England, \nthat is not a problem. They have a plan that is called parallel \ntrading. It has been going on for 20 years, and there are no \ncounterfeit issues of any significance at all.\n  Europe can do it and we cannot? We cannot keep track of this? The \nlegislation that I and Senator Snowe and many others, including Senator \nMcCain, have put together carefully has all kinds of safety measures \nthat will dramatically improve the safety of the prescription drugs \nthat are now sold.\n  It requires pedigrees be established on batch lots so you can track \neverything back. Everything. The only proposal we are suggesting the \nAmerican people be given the freedom to do is to access that FDA-\napproved drug--yes, only FDA-approved drugs--only from countries in \nwhich the chain of custody is identical to ours and as safe as ours is. \nThat is all we are talking about.\n  But that does it the right way. That says: Here is a plan. It funds \nthe FDA to make certain that the drug supplies are safe and so on. This \nis the right way to do this. That is why we have taken a long time to \nput this together. It is a piece of legislation that has all the \nelements you would want to have that gives the American people the \nfreedom to get lower priced drugs, FDA-approved drugs where they are \nsold and, at the same time, because they would have that freedom, would \nput downward pressure on drug prices in this country because the \npharmaceutical industry would be required to reprice their drugs in the \nUnited States.\n  Let me say, as I always have to say, I do not have a grief against \nthe pharmaceutical industry. I think it is a great industry. I think it \nproduces wonderful, miracle prescription drugs that if taken can keep \nyou out of an acute care hospital bed, which would be far more \nexpensive. Prescription drugs, if taken, in many cases, can manage a \ndisease that otherwise would have you in a debilitated condition.\n\n  I appreciate the research they do. I appreciate the new drugs they \ndevelop. Let me say this, that a substantial amount of work, with \nrespect to the development of new drugs, is done with public funding, \ntaxpayer dollars, through the National Institutes of Health, the \nknowledge from which then goes to the pharmaceutical industry to be \nable to use to create these drugs. That is a part of it.\n  Another part of it is the research they do themselves. Good for you, \nI say. My grief is not against an industry. I do not want to tarnish \nthis industry. All I want to say is: We deserve fair prices. This \ncountry and the consumers in this country deserve fair prices.\n  We have been trying for 10 years to get this done. If we bring health \ncare reform to the floor of the Senate and say: We are going to do \nsomething about health care costs and prices and fail to do something \nabout prescription drug costs, in which the American people are \nrequired to pay the highest prices for brand-name drugs, then, in my \njudgment, we will have failed miserably.\n  It is my full intention that when we have health care on the floor, \nwhich I expect to be within a week or 2 weeks or whenever it comes, but \nit is coming for sure, I will be here, and I will fully expect and \ndemand the opportunity to offer this amendment because there are 30 \nMembers of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, who have done \nthe work to put together the bill that has all the safeguards and, \nfinally, at long last, will give the American people what they deserve; \nthat is, fair pricing on prescription drugs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am very grateful for the leadership Senator Dorgan has \nshown on this issue for many years and it has been a pleasure and an \nhonor to work with him on that and many other issues.\n  I ask my colleague, does the letter that was sent by the majority \nleader to you and to me and to the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe--I \nknow you have read it--does it concern you that the last paragraph of \nthe letter says:\n\n       Not withstanding these obstacles, I stand by my earlier \n     commitment to make sure the Senate considers S. 1232 as soon \n     as practicable.\n\n  And then this is the question I have for the Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n       If this issue is not addressed during the full Senate's \n     consideration of comprehensive health reform, I guarantee \n     that I will move to proceed to S. 1232 before the end of the \n     year.\n\n  My question to the Senator from North Dakota is: Why would there be \nany question in the majority leader's mind that you or I and Senator \nSnowe would let a health reform bill go to the floor and be voted on \nwithout it being passed? It seems to me, and may I say, because I have \nbeen told twice by the majority leader we would take it up--and those \ncommitments have been reversed--would it not concern you a little bit \nwhen it says: `` . . . if this issue is not addressed during the full \nSenate's consideration of comprehensive health reform . . .''\n  That is my question. That is what I am concerned about, that \nparliamentary procedures would be used. You and I have seen it before. \nThe tree filled up. Cloture invoked, et cetera, where there have not \nbeen amendments that were clearly important to that legislation, not \nallowed to be considered.\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\n  That is my question to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say to Senator McCain that I expect the job of \nmajority leader is a pretty tough job. I have watched from Bob Dole on, \nTom Daschle, and so many majority leaders and minority leaders try to \nrun this place. It is pretty hard to run. Trying to figure out a \nschedule is pretty difficult. So I respect the difficulties of juggling \nall these things.\n  With respect to the specific letter Senator McCain referred to, \nSenator McCain, I, and Senator Snowe all talked to the majority leader \nabout this issue when the tobacco bill was on the floor of the Senate \nbecause we were fully intending to offer our prescription drug \nreimportation bill.\n  The majority leader did say to us, and then put it in writing, did \nsay to us: I will guarantee you that you will get that up on the floor \nof the Senate. So that was a commitment by the majority leader. And he \nunderstands that commitment.\n  When I saw the letter he wrote, I went to him immediately, and he and \nI talked about that. Because I indicated to the majority leader: You \nhave indicated that as soon as practicable, or perhaps at the end of \nthe year.\n  I said to the majority leader: You should understand that if it is \nnot up before health care, it has to be offered on health care. Because \nthat is exactly where it fits. Nobody can come to the floor and say: We \nhave to do health care. We have to try and control costs and put some \ndownward pressure on prices. But, by the way, you cannot offer a piece \nof legislation that would put downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices. I said: That cannot be the case.\n  He understood and said: I understand that. That is going to be at the \nfront end of this debate on health care. Based on that representation, \nI feel confident, I would say to Senator McCain, I understand the \nconfusion in the reading of the letter, the writing of the letter, but \nI feel confident, having talked to Senator Reid, that we are going to \nhave ample opportunity, right at the front end of this debate about \nhealth care, to have a full debate, to have a vote up or down, which is \nwhat we need to do, obviously. I think everyone in this Chamber, every \nRepublican, every Democrat, needs to be on record: How do they feel \nabout their consumers paying the highest prices for prescription drugs \nin the world? How do they feel about a bill we put together that has \npedigrees and batch lots, all the safety so our consumers can have the \nfreedom to access these lower priced drugs?\n  I think we can do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would you not feel better if the letter said--I know I \nwould feel better if the letter said: I expect this issue to be brought \nup in the health reform bill.\n  Instead, there is a loophole, with all due respect, that if it isn't \naddressed during the full Senate's consideration, ``I guarantee I will \nmove to it before the end of the year.'' Each day going by, seniors \nand, in fact, all citizens are paying a higher price for prescription \ndrugs. Frankly, we should never have made that agreement when the \ntobacco bill was taken up because we could have passed it. Today \nseniors could be paying as much as 60 percent less for their \nprescription drugs. But we know what happened. The pharmaceutical \ncompanies weighed in with all of their clout. I urge the Senator from \nNorth Dakota to go back and get this language changed. The majority \nleader looked me in the eye and said: We will take this up after we \nfinish the Department of Defense appropriations bill. And then decided \nnot to do it. Maybe the Senator from North Dakota understands why I am \nskeptical about the interpretation of a letter that could be \ninterpreted so that we don't take it up in the health care reform bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the anxious state of all of \nus to do what we have worked on for so long. I understand. I also \nunderstand that the letter probably could have been more artfully \ndrawn. I understand from my conversations with Senator Reid, the \nmajority leader, that he fully understands and expects us to be planted \non the floor when health care comes here and to offer our amendment and \nhave a full debate and vote. If there is an attempt when we debate \nhealth care to decide that 30 of us Republicans and Democrats somehow \ndon't have the opportunity we have been promised on the issue of \nprescription drug prices, in my judgment they are going to have an \nawful time getting any health care bill through this place. Because you \ncan't say to me or to anybody else: We will do the bill we want to do \nand, by the way, prescription drug prices that are going up by double \ndigits, we are not going to give you a shot at that.\n  Let me make one final representation. I said when I started, it is \nhard to schedule this place. I understand that. The Senator from \nArizona knows we have had noncontroversial bills where we couldn't even \nget past a motion to proceed without having a filibuster to something \nthat is noncontroversial. If I am majority leader, I am thinking this \nis not easy to do. I am sympathetic to the job he has to try to do all \nthese things. I am convinced Senator Reid will keep the commitment he \nmade to us. I am convinced that commitment will be kept when we get \nhealth care on the floor. I don't want it to be in the middle or toward \nthe end. I want to be here front and center at the front end because \nthe bill we have put together is a strong bill dealing with a very \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield further for one final question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have great sympathy for attempting to schedule \nlegislation in this body. I think our friend Trent Lott maybe didn't \ninvent it, but he used to say that it is like herding cats, conducting \nbusiness in the Senate. I agree with that.\n  I know the Senator from North Dakota is aware that no matter what the \nproblems are, if the majority leader says: I will take up this bill, \nthen you have to take his word. My question to the Senator from North \nDakota is, can we get a commitment from the majority leader that \nparliamentary procedures will not be used to block consideration of the \nissue of importation of pharmaceutical drugs?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe that commitment has already been \nmade by the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The letter is ambivalent.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand that. That is why I said I think the letter \nperhaps is not artfully drafted with respect to that last paragraph. I \nbelieve that commitment has been made to me because I went to the \nmajority leader following the release of that letter. I have found over \na long period that when the majority leader gives me a commitment, I \nbelieve he will keep the commitment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have not had that experience.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand, but I believe the Senator will have that \nexperience when health care comes to the floor and he and I are on the \nfloor with our colleague Senator Snowe and others pushing for a solid \npiece of legislation that has broad bipartisan support. The Senator \nthen will understand the commitment was made and the commitment was \nkept. I believe that will be the case.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All I can say to my friend is, if we can get a commitment \nthat parliamentary procedures will not be used to block consideration \nof an amendment concerning importation of prescription drugs, I will \nwithdraw this amendment from this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I believe that commitment has been made to me. In any \nevent, we are here on the floor on a Wednesday talking about something \nI believe is very important, and we have worked on this for a long \ntime. We have spent a lot of time working on it. I don't intend to \ndecide: OK, somebody is going to put up some barriers and that is OK \nwith me. That is all right. And I don't think Senator Reid is going to \ndo that. He has made a commitment to me that will not be the case. I am \nconvinced that Senator McCain and I and others who have put this \nlegislation together will have our day, and everybody else will have to \nstand up and say yes or no. I hope when the roll is called, we have \nsufficient numbers, finally, at long last, to pass legislation that \nshould have been passed 8 years ago. Again, I appreciate the comments \nSenator McCain has made this morning. I will have further visits with \nhim.\n  I know Senator Mikulski has a bill on the floor she wishes to manage, \nand we don't want to be in the way of that.\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\nMy view is that we are going to have our bill on this floor with a full \ndebate and an up-or-down vote, and that will come as a result of \nSenator Reid keeping his commitment. I am convinced of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very briefly, I say to Senator Dorgan, I appreciate his \nefforts, his leadership. I appreciate everything he has done. We have \nhad the privilege of working together on many issues over the years. I \nwish to be sure that when the health reform bill comes up, there will \nnot be parliamentary obstacles from that happening. I have seen the \nwill of the majority thwarted on the floor of the Senate by certain \nparliamentary maneuvers--filling up the tree, for example. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is as familiar as I am with some parliamentary \nprocedures which can be employed by the majority and have been employed \nwhen both parties have been in the majority to thwart the ability of \nSenators to have their issues considered. That is what I want to see, \nis to make sure that when the health reform bill is before us, we will \ntake it up.\n  But the sentence reads:\n\n       If this issue is not addressed during the full Senate's \n     consideration of comprehensive reform . . .\n\n  My question is, why wouldn't it? Why is that sentence necessary? All \nI can say is that I hope we can get that assurance. If we do, I will \nwithdraw the amendment and allow this appropriations bill to receive \nfull consideration and be passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to offer several amendments to \nthe health care bill. I have not had a chance. I am not part of a gang \nof anything. I wasn't part of the Gang of 6. I am not part of the \nFinance or HELP Committees. This is my first opportunity. I have some \nthings I think can improve it. If a bill comes to the floor with \nprocedures--and it will not happen--that lock this up and we can't \noffer amendments, I wouldn't stand for that. I am not going to be a \npart of that process. My expectation and the representation made to me \nwith respect to this amendment is when that bill comes to the floor, we \nwill have an opportunity to offer amendments. I don't know how you \nwould get health care through the Senate if the proposition would be \nthat somebody says: The Gang of 6, they had their 6 months or 3 months, \nwhatever they did. And the two committees had their opportunity. But \nthe rest of you, sorry, can't do that. In that circumstance, health \ncare would not be passed through the Senate. Perhaps we have tortured \nthis subject to death.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have probably tortured it to death. Considering the \nfact that reconciliation continues to be held out there as an option by \nthe majority is also a factor about which I have been concerned. All we \nneed is a clarification to make sure there will be no parliamentary \nobstacles to consideration of the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota, an effort joined by me and Senator Snowe and others, to allow \nprescription drugs to be imported into the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, my brief remarks this morning are going to \nbe on the cost of our broken health care system.\n  There have been times throughout our Nation's history when the \nAmerican people have called upon our elected leaders to make very \ndifficult decisions. This is one of those moments.\n  The debate over health reform has taken hold of this country and this \nCongress. We need a public option as part of any reform legislation, \nand we need it now. But the debate goes on. In House and Senate \ncommittee hearings, in townhall meetings, and at dining room tables \nacross America, people are talking about the cost of health care \nreform. But they are not just talking about dollars and cents. \nSometimes Washington forgets that. We worry about taxes, the deficit, \nand the need to keep Federal spending in check. We are right to debate \nthese issues. But in the swirl of numbers and the cold analysis of \ninsurance profits, we must not forget the extraordinary human cost of \nour broken health care system.\n  Nearly 45,000 Americans die every year because they do not have \ninsurance coverage and cannot get quality care. That is one death every \n12 minutes. This simply cannot stand in the United States of America. \nAs Members of the Senate, as Americans, and as human beings, we cannot \nallow this to continue. It is time to take bold action. We must not \ndelay any longer. The American people are waiting--people such as \nDeborah, a mother from Illinois, who works for a social service agency. \nHer employer had to cancel health care benefits and cut salaries more \nthan a year ago because the expenses were too high. Deborah had a heart \nattack in April. Her resulting hospital bills total almost $16,000. She \ncannot afford the medicine her doctors have prescribed for her. And now \nshe is having trouble paying bills. Her gas and electricity have \nalready been cut off in her home. Next it is going to be the water.\n  Thankfully, Deborah's children and foster children have health \ninsurance provided under an Illinois program called All Kids. But what \nif she suffers further complications or another heart attack? What if \nshe loses her home or her job? What will happen to Deborah and her \nfamily?\n  If this Congress does not pass meaningful health care reform, their \nfuture is uncertain at best. But if we do act, we can bring Deborah and \nher family back from the brink of ruin. If we pass health care reform \nwith a public option, Deborah and millions like her will be able to get \nthe quality care they need at a price they can afford.\n  Under a public plan, health care costs will come down. Perhaps \nDeborah's employer will be able to restore her insurance coverage. But \nif not, she will be able to get individual coverage by choosing between \nan affordable private or public plan. Competition will drive premiums \ndown across the board, making insurance more affordable for every \nsingle American. This means even with a preexisting condition, Deborah \nwill not have to worry about finding good coverage at a fair price. She \nwill be able to pay her bills again. In case she needs further \ntreatment down the road, she will not be forced to choose between \nkeeping food on the table or seeking the quality care she deserves. \nThat is what health care reform is with a public option, and that is \nwhat could help Deborah.\n  These reforms would also help working folks such as Scott and Cindy, \na self-employed couple from Oak Park, IL. Scott is a carpenter, and \nCindy is a freelance writer and editor. They have a combined income \nthat ranges from $50,000 to $120,000 per year, depending on the \neconomy. But Scott has a preexisting condition.\n  Unlike many people in similar situations, they were fortunate enough \nto find an insurance company that would cover them. But the costs are \nextremely high. Premiums run more than $500 a month. Scott is covered \nby one plan, and Cindy and the kids are on a separate plan, and each \none has a deductible of about $5,200 a year. That is the deductible.\n  That is why Scott and Cindy were so worried when their son broke his \narm last summer. It was a bad break, but it is the kind of injury that \nis common to an active 15-year-old kid. It was not catastrophic, it was \nnot unusual, and no one's life was at stake. But the medical bills \ntotaled about $4,000. Even though Scott and Cindy have insurance, they \nhad to pay every cent of this out of their pockets.\n  They are underinsured, and they know it. That is why they ration \ntheir own health care. I will repeat that: That is why they ration \ntheir own health care. Whenever they can skip a doctor's visit, or a \ncheckup, or a minor procedure, they will do so in the interest of \nsaving money. Of course, when their kids need treatment, they make it a \npriority.\n  But Scott and Cindy know they will not be able to afford it if either \nof them gets sick. What will happen to this family if they experience a \ncatastrophic illness? What will happen if their coverage gets dropped, \nor if the costs continue to go up?\n  With health care reform, private insurers could no longer \ndiscriminate\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\nagainst Scott's family because of his condition. If they are unhappy \nwith the private insurance, they will have the choice to purchase high-\nquality public insurance for the whole family. Regardless, their \ndeductible and monthly premiums will be much lower. For the first time, \nthey will not have to worry about Scott's preexisting condition, and \nthey can stop rationing their health care. They will be able to take \nadvantage of preventive care so they can catch potential problems \nearlier and minimize their chances of getting really sick.\n  This is what reform with a public option would mean for Scott and \nCindy, and for millions of Americans just like them in Illinois and \nacross the country. That is why I will not compromise on the public \noption. I will repeat that: I will not compromise on the public option \nbecause Deborah, Scott, and Cindy need our help. That is why I will not \nsettle for anything less than the real reform the American people \ndeserve. The human cost is too high.\n  As we move forward, it is important to consider all sides of this \ncontentious debate. But this debate has been going on for nearly a \ncentury. Since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, we have been trying to come \ntogether and solve this problem. The time for debate is drawing to a \nclose. The time for bold action is upon us now, and our path is clear. \nThe only way to achieve meaningful health care reform and bring costs \ndown is through a public option that creates real competition in the \nsystem.\n  Let me be clear on this--I will be very clear--I will not vote for \nany health care bill that does not include a public option. I urge my \ncolleagues to join with me, to stand on the side of the American \npeople, and to fight for ordinary folks such as Deborah, Scott, and \nCindy, and their families.\n  We must not delay. We must not let them down.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Afghanistan Policy\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the comprehensive \nreview of our Afghanistan policy being conducted by the Obama \nadministration. This is the right time for such a review because \nconditions have changed since the President's strategy was announced on \nMarch 27. I have traveled to the region twice since then--first in \nApril and again last month--and can confirm the recent observations of \nGeneral McChrystal that the Taliban has made inroads in Afghanistan and \nthe situation is deteriorating and serious. At the same time, political \ndynamics have changed in the region. There have been flawed elections \nin Afghanistan, and an emboldened Pakistani military has taken actions \nagainst elements in the Taliban in Pakistan. In light of these \ndevelopments, we must give the President the time he needs to review \nthe strategy and reevaluate the mission.\n  Today marks 8 years since the U.S. military entered Afghanistan, but \nif there is one message I hope to convey to the American people today, \nit is that we have not been there in earnest since 2003. After \nlaunching a successful NATO campaign against al-Qaida and the Taliban-\nled government that sheltered it, resources were diverted to Iraq in \n2003 before the job was finished. We essentially left Afghanistan to \ninvade Iraq, and the result in Afghanistan was a resurgent Taliban and \nfailure to capture Osama bin Laden.\n  This was not the first time we left Afghanistan. After resourcing the \nAfghans throughout the 1980s in their efforts to beat the Soviets, we \nabruptly ended our support in 1989 after Soviet troops withdrew. We \nwere then absent for 12 years until 9/11.\n  Historically, and especially since 2003, our commitment to \nAfghanistan has been wavering and halfhearted. This has created a \ndeficit of trust in the minds of the Afghans, especially among those \nwho have allied with us and faced the prospect of life or death in our \nabsence. I wish to repeat that. This has created a deficit of trust in \nthe minds of Afghans, especially among those who have allied with us \nand faced the prospect of life or death in our absence.\n  As we enter the ninth year of the war, it is critical to reassess our \nstrategy so we can get it right. This is why the President's review \nmust be complete and must be comprehensive. It is not just about combat \ntroops or the McChrystal report. Troops are just one part of the puzzle \nand the report submitted by General McChrystal is just one input. The \nPresident must consider multiple perspectives on the political and \nregional situation from U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry, \nU.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson, and the Special \nRepresentative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. He must \nalso weigh broader concerns from the Department of Defense, including \noverall force structure and other global military requirements. The \nreview will take time. There are many complex issues to deal with in \nAfghanistan which closely relate to our policy in Pakistan.\n  The President will present his plan to the American people when he \nhas made his decision. At that time, Congress will be an important part \nof the process and will hold hearings on the President's plan, as it \ndid with the President's plans in Iraq. Then each Member of Congress \nwill cast the most important vote for any Member of this body: whether \nto send additional troops abroad and how to protect them. That debate \nshould not be about politics.\n  I believe we must look at this challenge as a sum of the parts, and I \nwish to raise two primary questions. The first is about our mission and \nour objectives, which have been complicated by changes on the ground \nsince March. The second is about waging an effective counterinsurgency \nstrategy and what it would take to meet those requirements in \nAfghanistan. After we review our mission strategy in Afghanistan, we \nmust also review how it correlates to our strategy in Pakistan. I will \ntake each one of these questions in turn, both to give an indication of \nthe complexity of the decisionmaking process and to share my \nobservations on each subsidiary question.\n  First, the President must ask: What are our missions and objectives? \nIn March, he presented his mission statement:\n\n       To dismantle, disrupt, and defeat al-Qaida and its safe \n     havens in Pakistan, and to prevent the return to Pakistan or \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  He also laid out key objectives: promoting a more capable, \naccountable, and effective government in Afghanistan, developing \nincreasingly self-reliant Afghan security forces that can take the lead \nin counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, and assisting efforts to \nenhance civilian control and stable government in Pakistan.\n  As I have said, since March there have been at least three specific \nchanges to the situation.\n  First, there were flawed Presidential elections in August which have \nfurther eroded confidence between the Afghan people and the government.\n  When I was in Afghanistan in April, there was hope--real hope--that \nthese elections would lead to real change and progress. Unfortunately, \nthe outcome has been a worst-case scenario, validating the fears of \nthose who view the Afghan Government as plagued by corruption. As each \nday passes, the steady stream of election fraud revealed in the media \nfurther undermines trust in the Karzai government. This is especially \nharmful to our overall counterinsurgency strategy because the goal is \nto build support among the Afghan people for their government. \nRemember, this is not--not--between us and the Taliban, it is between \nthe Afghans and the Taliban, and the perception of government \ncorruption only strengthens the Taliban.\n  Second, we must review the challenges of training the Afghan national \nsecurity forces.\n  While the Afghan National Army has demonstrated an ability to fight, \nthere are serious questions about its size and effectiveness, and \nproblems are even\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\nworse among the Afghan National Police. Recruitment has been slow, \nattrition has been high, there are no noncommissioned officers, and \nmany among the ranks are illiterate.\n  To build the ANA and ANP, we need to overcome limiting factors in the \ndearth of leadership development, qualified recruits, infrastructure, \ntrainers, and equipment. During my trip to Helmand Province last month, \nI was struck by the side-by-side image of the Afghan Army troops in \nToyota pickup trucks and U.S. troops in Mine Resistant Ambush Protected \nVehicles, or MRAPS.\n  There is widespread recognition that there is a long way to go before \nthe Afghan security forces can be self-sufficient and that the training \nplan requires adjustments.\n  We are now embedding American trainers with Afghan battalions to \nenhance leadership development, but we continue to do this better, \nwhich is why I strongly support Senator Levin's plan to prioritize and \nfocus on training the Afghan Army and police. Specifically, I agree \nthat we must expedite the training, equipping, and support for the army \nand police so they can double in size to 240,000 for the army and \n160,000 for the police, not by 2013 but by 2012, and hopefully by the \nend of 2011. Based on my September trip to Afghanistan with Senators \nLevin and Reed, I believe this training can be expedited with the \nnecessary focus and resources. This must--I say, must--be a top \npriority because our overall goal is not nation building in \nAfghanistan; it is self-sufficiency for the Afghans so they can provide \nfor their own security, much like what has happened in Iraq.\n  The third changed condition we must consider is recent developments \nin Pakistan. When I traveled there in April, the situation was grave. \nThe tension between the Pakistani Government and the Taliban was \nmounting. The deal that was cut with the Taliban to relinquish control \nover Swat Valley was unraveling, the Frontier Corps did not have the \ncapacity to ``clear and hold'' in the tribal areas and border region, \nand I walked away very concerned about the overall political situation.\n  Immediately after the trip, the Pakistani military took decisive \naction against the Taliban in Swat Valley and has since regained \ncontrol of the area. With our help, the Frontier Corps is building its \ncapacity, and we just passed the Kerry-Lugar legislation, which would \ntriple economic aid to Pakistan.\n\n  On my most recent trip in September, it was clear the political \nsecurity environment had improved, but I still remain concerned about \nal-Qaida and its allies continuing to use Pakistan as a safe haven.\n  As we review our mission--taking into account these three \ndevelopments and changing conditions--we must also consider the \nstrategy used to meet our objectives. In March, the President announced \n``an integrated civilian-military counterinsurgency strategy'' for \nAfghanistan. Partnering with the population and training local security \nforces has proven to be the best way to defeat insurgencies over time. \nLet me repeat: Partnering with the population and training local \nsecurity forces has proven to be the best way to defeat insurgencies \nover time. Therefore, the second principal question we must ask is, Do \nwe have the requirements necessary for waging an effective \ncounterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan?\n  Before I address these questions, let me say that I am struck--truly \nstruck--by how quickly the military has adapted to counterinsurgency \nand how, from the bottom up, it has been adopted. Since General \nPetraeus wrote the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual in \n2006, counterinsurgency has become fundamental to our military \ndoctrine.\n  As long as we maintain the strength of our conventional forces, it is \nincreasingly unlikely anyone will take on the U.S. military through \nconventional means. Let me repeat that. As long as we maintain the \nstrength of our conventional forces, it is increasingly unlikely anyone \nwill take on the U.S. military through conventional means. We must, \ntherefore, prepare to fight future wars against insurgencies, nonstate \nactors, and asymmetrical forces. As such, the military, under the \nleadership of Secretary Gates, is rebalancing its budget and making \nother fundamental changes.\n  This is remarkable to me because any large organization, especially \none as large as the U.S. military, is like a supertanker: it just does \nnot turn easily. Through an incredible organizational effort, however, \nthis supertanker has changed course, and I am truly impressed by the \nextent to which DOD and the U.S. military have accomplished this and \nhave embraced counterinsurgency, from the privates to the four-star \ngenerals.\n  Counterinsurgency is a four-step process: First, shape a strategy; \nsecond, clear the area of insurgents; third, hold the area; and fourth, \nbuild through governance, essential services, and economic ability. It \nis important to note that troops are just one part of a \ncounterinsurgency strategy. Equally important is training the \nindigenous security forces, providing essential services, promoting \neconomic development, and strengthening systems of governance.\n  General McChrystal has recommended a full counterinsurgency approach \nin Afghanistan. As he mentions in his report, we should not resource \nthe mission without reconsidering the strategy, and focusing on troop \nlevels or resources alone ``misses the point entirely.'' Therefore, I \nask again, do we have the requirements for an effective \ncounterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan? In order to explore this \nquestion, we must look at three key areas--governance, training, and \nthe civilian role--and ask the following questions: First, can the \nAfghan Government offer a winning alternative to the Taliban? Second, \ncan we train enough Afghan troops and police to meet the required \nnumber of counterinsurgents? Third, do we have enough civilians? \nFinally, we must also consider how to develop an effective strategy for \nreintegrating low-level insurgents.\n  Counterinsurgency is about trust building between the local \npopulation, the security forces, and the government. Without trust, we \ncannot expect sustainable progress, and that is why I am particularly \nconcerned about allegations of fraud in the Afghan elections.\n  If this were a political campaign, there would be no need to run \nnegative ads against the Taliban. According to the polls, the Taliban \nhas only 6 percent support among the Afghan population. This is the \ngood news. The bad news is that in the absence of jobs, credible \ngovernance, and essential services, this does not translate into \nsupport for the Afghan Government by the Afghan people. This is why we \ncannot just target the Taliban or insurgents. We must help the \ngovernment develop a capacity to provide for its people so it can be \nviewed as credible and effective.\n  This is why the outcome of the recent election must be resolved in a \nclear manner so that whatever trust remains between the Afghan people \nand the government is not further diminished. We must ask--can we \nsucceed in a counterinsurgency with a Karzai government tainted by \nallegations of fraud and corruption? How do we recalibrate our strategy \nin light of the recent flawed elections?\n  The second question I would like to raise is about the amount of \ncounterinsurgents we need to succeed. Counterinsurgency doctrine tells \nus that troop size is not determined by the size of the enemy, but \nrather, by the size of the population. As such, we need a ratio of one \ncounterinsurgent for every 50 citizens. The latest CIA World Factbook \nestimates the population of Afghanistan at 28 million, which means that \nwe need roughly 560,000 ``boots on the ground'' which includes Afghans, \nNATO troops, and Americans.\n  During our visit, we learned that there have been 94,000 Afghan \nNational Army and 82,000 Afghan National Police trained as of August. \nThis brings the total number of trained Afghans to slightly less than \n200,000. Combine this with 68,000 U.S. troops by the end of the year, \nand 38,000 NATO forces, and we have reached nearly 300,000. This is \nslightly more than half of the requisite number of troops, and is \noverly-generous in assuming that all trained Afghan security forces are \ncombat ready and effective. Just by comparison, in Iraq, a country of \ntwo-thirds the size, there are already more than 600,000 trained \nsecurity forces.\n  No one is suggesting we fill this enormous vacuum with American \ntroops,\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nwhich is why we must focus on expediting training for the Afghans. And \nthis is what Senators Levin, Reed, and I heard was wanted and needed by \nthe Afghans themselves during our recent visit.\n  In the Garmsir District of Helmand Province, we met with more than \none hundred local Afghans and tribal elders who insisted they want to \nindependently secure their own population. They realize the need for \nU.S. troops to help to train and equip the Afghan National Security \nForces, and recognized that American assistance is needed to accomplish \nthis mission. But once the Afghans are able to provide security for \nthemselves, they will be ready for us to end our military presence. In \nthe words of the elders--once the Afghan security forces are trained, \nwe will be welcome simply as ``guests.'' In the meantime, we have to \nfind a way to prioritize training, so Afghans can eventually fill the \nsecurity vacuums with minimal American assistance.\n  The third question regarding an effective counterinsurgency strategy \nis: do we have enough civilians to implement counterinsurgency in \nAfghanistan, and how can we expedite the deployment and training of \ncivilians?\n  According to counterinsurgency strategy, once the troops have cleared \nand held an area with the support of Afghan Security Forces, civilians \nmust partner with Afghans to build. And we need hundreds of additional \ncivilians on the ground to fulfill a wide range of non-military \nrequirements including improvements in agriculture, economic \ndevelopment, essential services, and governance.\n  We have heard lots of talk in Washington about the need for a \n``civilian surge'' to complement the additional troops President Obama \nhas pledged for Afghanistan this year. Many of those civilians have \nbeen hired, and the State Department expects to have nearly 1,000 \ncivilians on the ground in Afghanistan by the end of this year. I \nsupport these efforts, but still believe that more must be done to \nbuild a stronger civilian capacity in Afghanistan.\n  During a visit to Camp Atterbury in Indiana last week, I met with 38 \ncivilians deploying to Afghanistan. At Atterbury, civilians train with \nthe military to cultivate an integrated approach and greater unity of \nmission. Like our soldiers, these civilians volunteer to leave their \nfamilies behind and put themselves in harm's way to better the future \nof Afghanistan. We owe them and their families a debt of gratitude for \ntheir service, and we must ensure they have the tools, support, and \ntraining they need to succeed.\n  Civilians serving in Afghanistan from across the interagency are \nsharing trir expertise in everything from agriculture to governance, \ncounternarcotics, accounting, energy, development, and education. The \nrole of the military and civilians are complementary--one cannot \nsucceed without the other. This is why military officials including \nSecretary Gates and General McChrystal are some of the strongest \nadvocates for a deepened civilian commitment to Afghanistan. To succeed \nin counterinsurgency, we must do everything we can to expedite and \nincrease the recruitment and deployment of qualified civilians.\n  Finally, when formulating an effective counterinsurgency strategy, we \nmust ask if we have developed a plan for reintegrating low- and mid-\nlevel Taliban. I am not suggesting we speak with Mullah Omar or other \nmembers of the Taliban leadership, but we must recognize there are many \nAfghans working with the Taliban for purely economic reasons. One of \nthe striking observations on my two trips was the fact that a primary \nconcern of Afghans is jobs, just like Americans. And if we can offer \neconomic incentives and alternative sources of livelihood--especially \nwith regard to the drug trade--I am hopeful that we can reintegrate \nsome insurgents ready to disavow violence. This will not be quick or \neasy, but the good news is that reintegration is possible, based \nlargely on the model we successfully used for the Sons of Iraq.\n  You can see the complexities of determining our mission and \nobjectives are great, and multiple questions remain in developing an \neffective counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan. But these \nconsiderations are only half the story.\n  Once we have reviewed the strategy and mission, we must also consider \nhow our policy in Afghanistan impacts Pakistan. As the President \nannounced on March 27, ``the ability of extremists in Pakistan to \nundermine Afghanistan is proven, while insurgency in Afghanistan feeds \ninstability in Pakistan.'' The relationship is clear and U.S. interests \nare inextricably linked, which is why the President adopted the \nregional approach coined ``Af-Pak.''\n  In my view, there are four primary challenges in Pakistan that we \nmust consider when formulating our strategy in Afghanistan.\n  First, Pakistan is a vital security interest because it has become a \nsafe haven for al-Qaida, which has continued to train there and plan \nfor future attacks on Americans. We know this based on the arrest less \nthan three weeks ago of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan planning a large-\nscale attack in New York, who is believed to have trained with al-Qaida \nin Pakistan.\n  Second, Pakistan has nuclear weapons and the delivery vehicles to use \nthem. Therefore, political instability in Pakistan is not only a \nregional threat, but a larger global security interest. If Pakistan was \ndestabilized or if control over its nuclear arsenal was compromised, it \nwould pose severe security repercussions. It would be a nightmare \nscenario to have Pakistan ruled by fundamentalist religious fanatics \nwith ``loose nukes'' in the hands of al-Qaida or other extremists.\n  Third, Pakistan's ongoing tension with India has limited its ability \nto respond fully to internal threats, such as the Taliban. The \nPakistani military continues to see India as its number one threat, and \nhas therefore hesitated to shift its focus from its eastern border to \nthe west. This has improved in recent months since the Pakistani \nmilitary went into Swat, but any U.S. policy must take into account \nPakistani concerns about India.\n  Fourth, elements of the Pakistani intelligence service, or ISI, have \nat times allied with the Afghan Taliban. On the one hand, they want to \nhedge against a total U.S. total withdrawal from Afghanistan, as we did \nin 1989, or a limited withdrawal as we did in 2003. On the other hand, \nmany in Pakistan worry that an increase of U.S. forces in Afghanistan \nmay push extremists further into Pakistan.\n  This view was expressed today by the Pakistani Foreign Minister in \nthe Washington Post. Quoted in an editorial, Foreign Minister Qureshi \nstated, ``If the likes of Mullah Omar take over in Afghanistan, it will \nhave serious repercussions for Pakistan . . .'' He went on to say that \nthe Taliban's actions in Afghanistan ``. . . will have implications on \nPakistan and it will have implications on the region.''\n  All of these considerations indicate the need for a sustained U.S. \ncommitment to Pakistan, which is why Congress just passed the Kerry-\nLugar bill and economic assistance package. This is a $7.5 billion vote \nof confidence in the Pakistani people, meant to demonstrate that our \ncommitment to Pakistan is strong and enduring. It is also meant to \ndemonstrate that our interests are not just limited to the border with \nAfghanistan.\n  In conclusion, as one can see in the detail and number of questions \nthat I have raised, this reassessment of our Af-Pak strategy is about \nmuch more than sending additional U.S. combat troops into Afghanistan. \nAs Senator Levin has pointed out, talking about troop levels in \nAfghanistan is similar to talking about the public option in health \ncare reform. Just as the public option is only one element of the \nhealth care debate, U.S. troop levels are just one element of a much \nbroader set of issues in Afghanistan.\n  The White House is now engaged in the necessary process of evaluating \nrealities on the ground and questioning underlying assumptions. I fully \nsupport this process. The questions I raise today are intended to \ncontribute to this ongoing review, so that we may find the right \nsolution.\n  The stakes are too high for us to carry on business as usual or to \nignore the changing dynamics in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is why \nthe President should weigh all perspectives about conditions on the \nground and the region, our counterinsurgency strategy, and the way \nforward in our mission. I fully support the President's comprehensive \napproach, and I agree it\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\nis needed because we have to get this right. We owe it to ourselves, we \nowe it to the American people, and we owe it to the brave men and women \nwho continue to serve with great courage, honor and sacrifice in \nAfghanistan.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and to call up Vitter amendment No. 2644.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment currently pending, so \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 2644.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that none of the funds made available in this Act \n   may be used for collection of census data that does not include a \n        question regarding status of United States citizenship)\n\n       On page 110, line 7, strike ``activities.'' and insert \n     ``activities: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     provided in this Act or any other act for any fiscal year may \n     be used for collection of census data that does not include \n     questions regarding United States citizenship and immigration \n     status.''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I present this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and my distinguished colleague from Utah, Mr. Bennett, who will \nspeak after me. It is a very simple but, I believe, a very important \namendment. It says we are not going to do a census that doesn't ask \nsome basic questions about citizenship and immigration status.\n  Specifically, the amendment reads:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this act or any other act for \n     any fiscal year may be used for collection of census data \n     that does not include questions regarding United States \n     citizenship and immigration status.\n\n  I believe this is a vital amendment for two reasons. If we don't \nadopt this amendment or other legislation, the census will move forward \nand will not distinguish in any way between citizens and folks in this \ncountry legally and noncitizens. That, in my opinion, is absolutely \ncrazy, again, for two reasons.\n  No. 1, the census is done every 10 years to give Congress an \nimportant tool in terms of many things that Congress and other bodies \nof government do: funding, public policy, different programs. Clearly, \nwe need accurate, specific information about the illegal alien question \nin this country. I assume we will all agree, however we come down on \nthe issue, that illegal immigration is a big issue and a big problem. \nWe debate that issue, we try to solve that issue in different ways all \nthe time in this body. Yet we would do a census, we would spend tens of \nbillions of dollars on a census, and we wouldn't ask the question: Are \nyou a citizen and, if not, are you in this country legally or \nillegally? That is absolutely crazy. The census does ask those \nquestions in the long form. They are able to get the long form \ncompleted. They are able to compile information, but that is not the \nfull census; that is a tiny percentage of the full population.\n  So if we are going to spend tens of billions of dollars every 10 \nyears to do a major census, it seems absolutely a no-brainer that we \nwould get full and accurate information about the number of illegals in \nthis country.\n  Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, the single most \nimportant thing we use the decennial census for is to reapportion the \nHouse of Representatives, to decide how many House Members each State \ngets. Under the Federal plan, the way the census is designed, the House \nwould be reapportioned counting illegal aliens. States that have large \npopulations of illegals would be rewarded for that. Other States, \nincluding my home State of Louisiana, would be penalized.\n  I believe it is very clear that when the Founders set up our \nrepresentative democracy, they didn't think of the basic fundamental \ninstitutions of our government as representing folks who come into the \ncountry breaking the law, staying here illegally. I think it is \nshocking to most Americans when they hear we would even consider \nreapportioning the House of Representatives counting illegals, but that \nis exactly the plan now. Of course, we would have no opportunity to \ndebate that or to adopt a new plan unless the census distinguishes \nbetween citizens and legals and illegals, which my amendment would \ndemand we do.\n  This isn't some theoretical issue. This is a very concrete issue, a \nvery meaningful issue about how much representation each State has in \nthe House of Representatives. There are many States that will lose \nrepresentation from what they would otherwise have if illegal aliens \nare counted in congressional reapportionment. Specifically, the States \nof Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, \nOregon, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina would lose out. So I wish to \nspecifically speak to my colleagues in this body--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--from those States: Please support the Vitter and \nBennett amendment No. 2644. It has a direct impact on whether you are \ngoing to have less representation in the House of Representatives or \nmore. Let me be even more blunt. If you vote against this amendment, \nyou are voting against the interests of your State. If you vote against \nthis amendment, you are voting for your State having less \nrepresentation in the House of Representatives than they would if \nillegals are not counted in reapportionment. Again, with that in mind, \nI wish to repeat the list: Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, \nMississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. \nFor Senators from those States, it is a vote directly about their \nState's own interests and their State's representation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  More broadly speaking, I think the huge majority of Americans would \ncertainly take the view I am suggesting, which is we should not \napportion Members of the House based, in part, on illegals. We should \nnot reward States for having large illegal populations and penalize \nStates that do not. I think that is on a different planet from where \nour Founding Fathers were in setting up the basic Democratic \ninstitutions of our country, and there is no more basic and no more \nDemocratic institution than the House of Representatives.\n  With that, I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield time to my distinguished colleague from Utah, Mr. Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Vitter for proposing this \namendment. It follows the idea of the bill I introduced a few weeks ago \nthat is now S. 1688, the Fairness in Representation Act.\n  My bill, obviously, will not pass before we get so far down the road \nto deal with this issue. So it is appropriate for the amendment to be \noffered, and we can accomplish the same thing with the amendment that \nwould happen if my bill were to pass.\n  Since my bill was introduced, I have had three primary objections to \nit. I\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nwish to deal with each of those, because they would probably be raised \nwith respect to this amendment as well.\n  No. 1, you cannot ask somebody who is an illegal alien to identify \nhimself or admit that he is here illegally when you are doing the \ncensus calculation. Well, it may surprise some people to know that the \nCensus Bureau already asks for this information. It collects it on the \nongoing American community survey. That is not as comprehensive as the \nentire census. If it were, we wouldn't need to do it here. But the \nCensus Bureau already has a track record of asking this question \nwithout running into that particular difficulty. The information \ncollected by the census is 100 percent confidential under penalty of \nlaw, and the census takers can make that clear to any individual who \nmight be concerned about that. So that is not a major problem.\n  No. 2, people say, well, since the census data is used to determine \nfunding levels for a variety of programs, and since the illegal aliens \nget involved in the funding, if you do this, you will be cutting \nfunding for State programs that service the illegal aliens, and that is \nnot fair. The reality is that this amendment, and my bill, do not cut \nfunding. There is nothing in the bill that would say that funding \nformulas would change. This is an attempt to find out how many illegal \naliens we have in this country and where they live--the statistical \ninformation, which we do not fully have now, as a result of the \nAmerican community survey. We have a hint at it in the American \ncommunity survey, but we are extrapolating for that and making a guess.\n  Since the census is a once-every-10-year attempt to discover what \nAmerica is like, who the Americans are, and where they live, it seems \nto me very logical that the census should add this particular piece of \ninformation to it.\n  Well, after these two arguments have been made and dismissed, the \nthird argument--and we get this most strongly from the people at the \nCensus Bureau--is that it is too late, too bad; you should have brought \nit up earlier, Senator Bennett, but we started to print our surveys \nalready and we cannot reprint them; it is too late.\n  I wonder if they have ever thought of printing an extra sheet or \nextra card. You don't have to reprint the whole survey if you have one \nadditional question you want answered. I have seen books where there \nhave been errors in the book that have come out after the book is \npublished with an errata sheet--that on page so-and-so this particular \nentry is not correct. It is not that big a deal for the Census Bureau \nto do some kind of addendum that could be printed and made available so \nwe could solve this particular problem.\n  All right. Aside from knowing, what do we intend to do with this data \nif we get it? Senator Vitter made reference to this in his discussion \nof the amendment. I want to use it today to deal with the question of \nthe apportionment of the voting powers in the House of Representatives. \nIf we go back in history, we find there was no more controversial issue \nin the writing of the Constitution than the question of representation \nin Congress. Small States wanted it by State. Large States wanted it by \npopulation. The great compromise came along that created this body and \nsaid that membership in the Senate would come by State, and membership \nin the House of Representatives would come by population. But it was \nleft up to the State legislatures to determine how that population \nwould be apportioned. Each State was given a number of representatives \nbased on the population. But the State legislatures could determine \nwhere the lines were drawn and how the districts would be created. We \nhad a situation develop over time where States would draw a line and \nsimply leave it. People would move from one congressional district to \nthe other, but the line would not be changed. There was a situation \nwhere there were many congressional districts whose representation, \nnumerically, was substantially less than that of some other \ncongressional districts in the same State.\n  This brought about a lawsuit that went before the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn the decision in the case of Reynolds v. Symms, issued in 1964, the \nSupreme Court gave us the one man, one vote rule, which said that the \ndistricts should be close enough in population that, in effect, every \nvoter had the same weight of representation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  If we have this tremendous number of illegal aliens concentrated in a \nfew States, we have an impact of changing the one man, one vote dictum \nof the Supreme Court; that is, a State with a large number of illegal \nimmigrants will see to it that its voters have greater representation \nthan voters where the illegal immigrants are not.\n  All we ask in this amendment and in the bill I proposed is that the \nCensus Bureau be instructed to ignore the presence of illegal aliens \nwhen allocating the number of representatives in a State. As I say, it \nhas nothing to do with the funding of programs, because the programs \nhave to be funded where the people are, and we understand that. I \nbelieve it is entirely constitutional that the allocation of the \ncongressional seats can be done on the basis of those who are here in a \nlegal circumstance.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana has pointed out, this is not a trivial \nmatter. There will be eight States that will lose representation to \nfour States if this is not done. Four States' voters will be \noverrepresented in the House of Representatives because of the large \npopulation of illegal immigrants in those four States, and nine States \nwill be underrepresented because of the fact that their voters do not \nhappen to live in a State where there is a large population of illegal \naliens.\n  I am happy to join my colleague from Louisiana in cosponsoring this \namendment. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will see fit to support \nit.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a new amendment for us. We had \nnot anticipated that this amendment--that a debate on immigration and \nthe value of one person over another was going to become a subject of \ndiscussion in an appropriations bill. We would hope this type of \nconversation would be taken up on comprehensive immigration. I know my \ncolleague from Utah, who is on the Appropriations Committee--and both \nare important to me, that he is from Utah and that he is on the \nAppropriations Committee--has thought this through greatly. He raises \nsome very important points. I have discussed this amendment with my \nleadership. I know they want to take a more careful look at this and \nalso consult on its full ramifications.\n  We are now talking about questions being asked through the census and \nthe objective to be accomplished for that, which the census was \noriginally for counting people for tax purposes, ironically. This is an \napportionment question. So what we would like to do is go into a quorum \nwhile we look at how we may proceed on this amendment.\n  Having said that, I want to reiterate the importance of the census \nbeing taken every 10 years. The census must be taken for the reasons \nthat our colleague from Utah outlined. No. 1, it determines the use of \nFederal funds, and that is why we count persons, because regardless of \nyour status, you are a user of services--in some instances, maybe even \nmore than a user of services. The second thing is with apportionment. I \nthink that is a delicate matter that the Senator from Utah is raising. \nThis gets us into constitutional questions. I am apprehensive about it. \nAgain, we are going to consult with the leadership.\n  Also, as we move forward on the issue of the census, we have to make \nsure we do have a head count. The Census Department itself, right now, \nis under very serious duress. They were late getting started on some of \ntheir issues. There has been an enormous technological boondoggle with \nthe hand-held technology, the enumerator, with which I believe the \nSenator from Utah is familiar. We have been working with the previous \nadministration, this administration, and the Secretary of Commerce to \nget the census straightened out. My colleague said: Why don't they just \nprint one more piece of paper? One more piece of paper sounds\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nsimple. But everything we do that affects the census at this point \npresents a logistical and financial challenge that borders on a \nchallenge to a nightmare. Again, we have calls in to the census that \nsay, what will it take to do it?\n  I have reservations about adding this question, because I believe it \nwill add to the logistics and costs. And No. 2, it could be a deterrent \nto people answering those questions because of who else is in their \nhousehold. The other thing is that we have many people in our country \nwho are green card people, who are here absolutely legally and \njustifiably. Some are in our own community at some of our community \nhospitals and are working as nurses. And asking this question and that \nquestion--I don't want to raise the issue of a deterrence and the \nability to cooperate.\n  I want to take a closer look at this amendment. While we do that, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we are debating here the nature \nof the questions that should be asked on the census. Our colleague, \nSenator Carper of Delaware, in a matter of minutes is holding a hearing \non the census. At that hearing, he is going to seek some clarification \non this and report back to us.\n  As we continue the debate on that amendment, I also want to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate some of the very important things that are \nin this bill. We want to move this bill forward. I want to move this \nbill forward. We will dispose of, in an orderly, civil, rational way, \nthe pending amendment of Senators Vitter and Bennett on the census. But \nwe also want to move this bill forward. We want to do everything we can \nso that this bill passes by the end of this week so we can go to \nconference and be ready to move very important funding forward, \nparticularly in the area of law enforcement.\n  This is absolutely a very compelling need. When we think about law \nenforcement, yes, we can think about law enforcement with illegal \naliens. Yes, we can also think about law enforcement with violent \ncriminals. We do deal with that in our bill. But we are also very much \nfocused on white-collar crime. One of the areas on which we have worked \non a bipartisan basis on this bill is the issue of mortgage and \nfinancial fraud. So, as we are debating amendments that are \ncontroversial, I want the people of America to know we are on their \nside and we can do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  One of the great pleasures of being on the committee is my ranking \nmember--or the vice chairman, some people might call him--Senator \nShelby is the ranking member on the Banking Committee. We put our heads \ntogether on how we can fight mortgage and financial fraud. He brought \ngreat expertise from his work on the Banking Committee. We now are \nlooking at what we can do, by putting the money in the Federal \ncheckbook, to go after those engaged in predatory practices, deceptive \nmarketing and lending schemes.\n  Mr. President, you know from your background as a legislator and \ncommunity leader that where there is need, there is often greed and \noften scams and scum doing it. We see it in the mortgage business. \nThere are so many unsuspecting people who want just a piece of the \nAmerican dream who were lured into some of the most deceptive practices \nthat we have not seen in our country for several decades. They do have \nnames. They are antiseptic names, but they mean a lot: predatory \npractices, deceptive marketing, lending schemes, flipping. The \nconsequences have been enormous. During the past year, financial \ninstitutions have written off $500 billion in losses because of fraud \nin the subprime mortgage industry--$500 billion in losses. That is a \nlot when you think about what we have had to do to try to stabilize \nhousing, to try to stabilize our mortgage industry. Numerous publicly \ntraded financial institutions have declared bankruptcy or have been \ntaken over by the Federal Government. I don't mean to imply that being \ntaken over by the Feds was all due to the fact that they had been \ninvolved in fraudulent schemes, but it is time to say: No more.\n  What we want to be able to do is to go after the scammers who caused \nAmericans to lose their homes, their life savings, and their dignity. \nYes, I worry about the financial institutions, but I worry about people \nwho put their money in the bank or took these loans that caused them, \nthrough balloon payments, excessive interest rates, two, three, four, \nfive mortgages, all of which were unable to be sustained, to lose their \nhomes. We on this committee say and we want our Senate colleagues to \nsay: No more scamming and scheming. No more preying on hard-working \nAmerican families.\n  What did the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee do? Senator \nMikulski, you don't have to use a lot of rhetoric, but will it take a \nlot of money? We are going to do it. We are going to put $437 million \nin the Justice Department to combat financial fraud and be able to do \nwhat we need to do. This is a $63 million increase over fiscal year \n2009. We are going to hire new agents, new attorneys, and new special \nsupport staff--people who will be skilled in an exciting new field \ncalled forensic accounting.\n  Our FBI is going to play a major role in this. I talked personally \nwith Director Miller about it, as has Senator Shelby. We have gotten \nthe FBI's commitment to really beef this up. In our own hometown of \nBaltimore, the U.S. attorney has put together a special task force to \nbe able to deal with this.\n  What does it mean? First of all, in the Federal checkbook, we put in \n$75 million. This is going to increase the number of these mortgage \nfraud task forces around the country. We have a very excellent one \nunder Rod Rosenstein, working in Baltimore, in our State, right this \nminute. But we also wanted to be able to go into States with large \nrural populations and others that right now do not have them.\n  Specifically, the funding will be used for the FBI to hire, as I \nsaid, new agents and forensic accountants. This is highly specialized, \nbut there are people with backgrounds in accounting with special \ntraining in forensics. It is like the CSI not only says ``hi'' to a \ntest tube but says ``hi'' to the kind of accounting that will go after \nthese crooks. It is amazing how they can look at the books and know how \npeople have been cheating.\n  We want the agents to be able to detect and investigate and capture \nthese white-collar criminals, but we also want our U.S. attorneys to \nprosecute complex financial fraud. We want to be able to increase \nprosecutions by adding U.S. attorneys. We are adding several U.S. \nattorneys and support staff around the country to be able to establish \nthe task force and work in the task force. We are very proud of our \nU.S. attorneys, and I believe our Attorney General, Eric Holder, is \nhelping to restore the integrity of our U.S. attorneys around the \ncountry.\n  We believe in Maryland we have a very high-value functioning U.S. \nAttorney's Office, but they are swamped. They are going after \neverything from drug dealers to other violent criminals, and we also \nwant them to have the resources to go after the white-collar crime. \nThis is a crime. It is not as if just because it is white collar we \noften don't equate it as a crime, but for the Criminal Division at \nJustice, we are also encouraging them to step up their activity. Again, \nwe are adding attorneys and support staff and putting the money behind \nit to be able to do it.\n  We are also doing increased work in the Civil Division to fund \ninitiatives and to also litigate these cases and make sure we not only \ndetect them, we not only prosecute them, but we have the lawyers and \nthe support staff to do it. Support staff are paralegals, clerical \npeople. But again, it is a unique kind of crime. You have to come with \nmultiple skills. You have to come being a great lawyer or a great \nperson who is part of the legal team. You have to have strong \nlitigating skills, but you also have to be well versed in financial \nservices and accounting practices. So we want to be able to bring them \non and be able to keep them as we go through many of these other cases.\n  These are the kinds of skills we need to not only go after white-\ncollar crime but also violent crime. Remember, we got Al Capone, not in \nthe act of robbing a bank but cheating on his taxes.\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\nIt was that brilliant FBI generation where you had to be either a \nlawyer or accountant to work for the FBI. Now, again, lawyers and \naccountants are welcome at the FBI. But they caught Al Capone cheating \non his income tax. It was one of the ways we could nail him.\n  I am not saying we are going to be nailing people for cheating on \ntheir income tax, but we are going to nail people who cheated and \nschemed and gouged against innocent people who wanted to buy a home--\nthrough acting like loan sharks, having phony ads, having fine print so \nthat you bought a home in the large print and you lost it in the fine \nprint. We want to make sure those people know how to read the fine \nprint and know what it means.\n  While we are debating this bill and we are looking at those things \nthat are going to focus on topics outside the scope of this bill, we \nwant people to know we are on their side. For everybody who is \nstretched very thin financially, trying to keep their head above water, \nand trying to buy their home, we want them, at least when they go to \nget a loan or to refinance it, to be dealing with honest, reputable \ndealers. Let's foreclose on the bad guys and stop the foreclosure on \nhomes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                            Health Insurance\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the comments of the senior Senator from \nMaryland--the junior Senator from Maryland is presiding--and especially \ntheir work jointly on housing issues and how important that is.\n  I come to the floor pretty regularly to share letters from people in \nmy State, in Ohio, letters about health care. These are typically \npeople who had health insurance with which they were satisfied and who \nthought they had good health insurance policies, were maybe concerned \nabout job loss--certainly because that is too common in our country \nnow--but were generally satisfied with their health insurance until \nsomeone in their family got very sick and they lost their insurance or \nit got so expensive that they declared bankruptcy or all kinds of \nproblems that happen too often in our health care system. I would like \nto read four or five letters, if a could for a moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to address the Chamber as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. David from Cuyhoga County, Cleveland, northeast Ohio:\n\n       My family's health care costs have tripled in five years. I \n     have a generous employer-provided plan and my employer has \n     done what it can to use its purchasing power to buy \n     competitive coverage. But the co-pays and deductibles go up \n     astronomically each year while covering fewer services. We \n     need to cover everyone and find ways to reduce costs across \n     the system to promote a sustainable health care system in \n     America.\n\n  One of the things this legislation will do is bring more competition \ninto the system. One of the choices, according to the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee bill and three bills that have \npassed the House of Representatives, until we come forward in final \npassage, and passed the committee in the House of Representatives, \nincludes--the menu of choices people have for insurance will include a \npublic option. So people will be able to choose Aetna or CIGNA or, if \nthey are in Ohio, Medical Mutual, a not-for-profit medical mutual \ninsurance company, or they will be able to choose the public option.\n  Having the public option there will, No. 1, keep the insurance \nindustry honest and make sure some of the gaming of the system and \nthrowing people off insurance and disqualification because of \npreexisting condition or discrimination based on age or gender--those \nthings won't happen because the public option will be an option and \nwill give people more choice in competing with the insurance industry \nto keep costs down.\n  Mike from Richland County, where I grew up, the Mansfield area:\n\n       My mother-in-law has worked hard all her life. But today, \n     she can't afford her medication, which she takes only when \n     she can afford them. She cuts them in half and takes them \n     every other day. I have coworkers and friends with their own \n     stories. They have worked hard all their lives and paid their \n     taxes, but are worried what happens when they get sick or if \n     they'll have enough savings to retire.\n\n  As we have discussed, the whole point of the public option is to keep \nprices down. The whole point of the public option is to compete so that \ninsurance companies no longer game the system.\n  We know that the insurance system without the public option doesn't \nhave the kind of competitiveness it needs to keep the insurance \ncompanies honest, to give people full choice, and to keep prices in \ncheck and keep quality of the insurance coverage better.\n  I hear people all over--not just from Mansfield, but I hear people \nall over our State--complaining and asking for the public option \nbecause it gives people that ability to compete. It makes the insurance \ncompanies better, it keeps prices in check, and it will mean more \ncompetition in those parts of Ohio. In Cincinnati, only 2 companies \nhave 85 percent of the market. I know those same kinds of things happen \nin the State of the Presiding Officer, in Oregon, where the public \noption will mean more competition, better choice, keeping prices down. \nThat will matter for all of us whether we choose the public option or \nwhether we choose to go into a private insurance plan.\n  Betsy from Lake County writes:\n\n       I never thought in a million years that health care reform \n     was necessary for me. Our family was covered and thought that \n     was enough. But recently my 5-year-old daughter got sick with \n     cancer. Over two years, she was hospitalized 37 times and \n     treated with chemotherapy and countless medications.\n       At the time, my husband worked at a small, struggling \n     business. He was essentially tied to a job that didn't pay \n     our bills, but we needed [his] insurance.\n       After each hospital visit, the insurance company would send \n     us a letter denying a portion of the stay unless a doctor \n     could justify the hospitalization.\n       In addition, at the end of every quarter, the insurance \n     company raised the premium for each worker in my husband's \n     business.\n       Finally, my husband took what little savings we had and \n     started his own business--only to be told my daughter was \n     uninsurable because of her preexisting conditions. She \n     finally got insurance through the State.\n\n  I am guessing it was the SCHIP plan we passed 2 years ago that \nPresident Bush vetoed; then we passed it again this year, and it was \nsigned into law by President Obama.\n  She finally got insurance through the State. But Betsy from Lake \nCounty is asking: How is it possible in America that a now 8-year-old \ngirl is branded as uninsurable. This speaks to all the problems that \nhave happened in your health care system. Some 3 or 4 years ago, Betsy \nthought she had no problems with health insurance. Her husband was \nemployed in a decent job that sounded like he had health care \ninsurance. They were covered. They had a small child.\n  But when their child got sick, they found out their insurance was not \nnearly as good as they thought it was. It is an old story and a way too \ncommon story in our great country that the fine print of an insurance \npolicy so often ends up denying people care. So often they have to take \nhuge expenses out of pocket. Betsy did. So often they raised the \npremium every quarter for everyone else in the small business.\n  If you are in a small business and you have 20 employees and one of \nthose employees gets sick, as Betsy's daughter did, then everybody's \npremium goes up to the point that the company can no longer afford \ninsurance or sometimes the insurance is actually canceled for all the \nemployees.\n  Then last, this little girl, this 8-year-old, was uninsurable when \nBetsy's husband changed jobs and became self-employed. She could not \nget insurance. The family could not get insurance because of the \ndaughter's preexisting condition. That is what this health care bill is \nall about. That is what the public option is all about.\n  The health care bill will simply allow small businesses to go into \nthe health insurance exchange so they can spread out in a much larger \ninsurance pool, so one person, very sick and getting a very costly \nillness, will not blow a hole in the insurance coverage.\n  Our legislation will eliminate the denial of care for preexisting \nconditions. No more raising premiums indiscriminately the way they do. \nHaving the public option will exert that discipline on the private \ninsurance companies that they are going to have to compete. They cannot \nindiscriminately raise premiums on worker after worker, on employer \nafter employer, on small business after small business after small \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\n  In Betsy's case, as sad as it is, as tragic as it is, although she is \nnow getting insurance through the State health insurance program, it \nsounds like, as much anxiety as she must have faced in the last 3 years \nas her daughter got so sick as a 5-year-old, and at the same time, \nwhile combatting her daughter's illnesses and going into the hospital \n37 times, as she points out, she had the anxiety, this family always \nhad the anxiety in back of their minds that they were going to lose \ntheir insurance and what were they going to do to take care of their \ndaughter.\n  That is why the public option is so important to people; that \nsecurity and that understanding that they are, in fact, protected, that \ntheir insurance cannot be taken away from them, that their insurance \ncompany cannot deny this little girl the care and coverage because she \nhas this ``preexisting condition,'' a term I hope will not be in the \nAmerican vocabulary, in the English vocabulary, come this time next \nyear.\n  Marti, from Franklin County, central Ohio, Columbus area, writes:\n\n       I am writing to urge you to support health care reform that \n     would reduce costs, would offer choice, including a public \n     option, and would provide quality care. My wife and I have \n     coverage, but our daughter is one of the millions of \n     uninsured. After college she could not find a job with health \n     benefits. She incurred considerable debt paying for out-of-\n     pocket doctors visits and prescriptions. We need health \n     reform that will benefit American families.\n\n  Marti, from Franklin County, asks for choice, including a public \noption. She understands, as the majority of Ohioans do and a majority \nof people in this body understand, that the public option gives people \none more choice: Do they want to go with CIGNA? Do they want to go with \nAetna? Do they want to go with Blue Cross? Do they want to go with \nMedical Mutual Ohio? Do they want to go with the public option? Give \nthem that additional choice.\n  That is what Marti is asking for herself, for her daughter, and for \nher neighbors. But Marti also pointed out that her college graduate \ndaughter lost her insurance. One of the things our legislation does is \nit says to an insurance company: You cannot drop a college student \nafter college. They can stay in the plan until they are 26.\n  So we understood, as we wrote this bill, that the junior Senator from \nOregon helped write in the HELP Committee, that there are an awful lot \nof young people, the pages sitting in front of us may face this--they \nare not going to face it because we are going to fix it. But they would \nhave faced that, their older brothers and sisters might, when they join \nthe Army, leave home or finish college. At 22 or 23 or 24 years old, so \nmany people lose their insurance, sons and daughters of people who have \ninsurance.\n  Under our bill, the company must keep you on the policy, if you so \nchoose and if your parents so choose, until your 26th birthday. As I \nsaid, Marti understands the importance of a public option there. So \nwhen their daughter does, under our bill, when their daughter does turn \n26, she will then be faced with, if she does not have employer \ninsurance, she will then be faced with does she want to go into a \nprivate plan or does she want to look at the public option. She will \nhave the choice.\n  The choices will be much better because we have changed the rules. No \nmore preexisting condition denial of care, no more annual caps on \nbenefits. So if you get sick, and it is expensive, you will lose your \ninsurance. No more of that. No more discrimination based on disability \nor age or gender or geography. The public option will make sure the \ninsurance companies do not game the system.\n  The last letter comes from Jason from Cuyahoga County. Jason says:\n\n       I sand and refinish hardwood floors for a living. I work \n     for a small business with only four employees. Unfortunately, \n     my boss cannot get a group discount for health insurance \n     because there is not enough of us to qualify for one. I am \n     24. I make $1,500 a month depending on how much work we have. \n     I live on my own. I cannot afford health insurance on my \n     income. I am in good health, but that can change in the blink \n     of an eye with the work I do. If or when I get hurt while at \n     work, I will not be able to make any more money and will have \n     to drain my savings to get well enough to work again. Please \n     vote yes on health care reform with a public option.\n\n  Jason, in the Cleveland area, sums it up here. A young man who is \nworking hard, four of them starting a business. They have jobs. They \nare creating jobs. They are the kind of people we want to help. People \nworking hard, playing by the rules, saving some money. Even at his \nrelatively low income, he is saving some money. But he is praying every \nday he does not get hurt in a job that workplace injuries are not all \nthat unusual.\n  Are we going to turn our back on someone such as Jason in Cuyahoga \nCounty or are we going to say: Well, tough luck. We hope you do not get \nhurt. If you do, then we hope you get well soon.\n  But a guy such as Jason, he loses his job, he gets sick or he gets \ninjured on the job, he is out of work. He may be able to get disability \nfor a little bit. He might be able to get unemployment benefits for a \nlittle bit, maybe. But probably not if it is an injury on the job or if \nhe is sick.\n  But what do we have for him to help him get through the day? He \ncannot afford insurance because there are only four of them. They pay \nexorbitantly high rates. What our legislation would do is give Jason \nseveral choices.\n  It would mean Jason could, with his small business of four people, go \ninto a public option or get private insurance but go into a larger pool \nof workers so the costs would be shared and the price would be much \nless. We know insurance for one person or five people is much more \nexpensive per person than insurance at a big corporation, where they \ncan spread the cost around among dozens or hundreds or thousands or \ntens of thousands of people.\n  Second, our bill will provide a tax credit for small businesses to \ninsure their employees, so they will get some help that way.\n  Third, where Jason can decide instead to go directly into the \ninsurance exchange we set up in the HELP Committee in our legislation. \nThe insurance exchange will give him the opportunity, give him a \nchoice, a full choice: Do you want a private plan? Do you want Aetna? \nCIGNA? Medical Mutual? Or do you want the public option? We know that \nchoice will be less expensive. We know that choice, because of the \npublic option, will stop the insurance companies from denying Jason or \none of his coworkers coverage because of a preexisting condition. We \nknow the public option will stop the insurance companies from \ndiscriminating against people based on gender, disability or geography \nor age.\n  We know the public option will enforce all these rules on the \ninsurance companies and help to keep prices down because of the \ncompetition. The whole idea of the public option is about choice. It is \nabout keeping prices down. It is about making this insurance bill cost \nsignificantly less because people will have that choice and that \ncompetition we inject into the system.\n  Last, as I have said, the public option will help to make sure that \neven though we have passed these new rules to keep the insurance \ncompanies from gaming the system, the public option will help us \nenforce those rules so the company cannot game the system the way they \nhave too many times in the past.\n  As we move forward in the next few weeks, we know that four \ncommittees in the Congress, three in the House of Representatives, the \nEducation and Labor Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, plus the HELP Committee in the Senate on \nwhich the Presiding Officer sits, that those four committee have all \npassed a good health care bill, very important assistance to small \nbusiness, wellness and prevention programs, and a strong public option.\n  Only one of the five committees has not passed the public option. We \nknow that. We know, second, the public option will help us keep costs \nin check. That is what is so important about it. We also know an \noverwhelming majority of the public, something like 2 to 1, support the \npublic option and would like to see the public option as part of this \nlegislation.\n  We know in a recent doctors' survey, a Robert Wood Johnson survey, \nthat more than 70 percent of this Nation's doctors support the public \noption. Why? Because they have been used to dealing with insurance \ncompanies that deny care, that pay them late, that hassle them on bill \nafter bill after bill. The doctors in this country, the real\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\nfrontline doctors and nurses and physical therapists and speech and \nhearing therapists, they understand that in overwhelming numbers a \npublic option will be good for them and more importantly good for their \npatients and good for this country.\n  It is pretty clear an overwhelming number of people in this country, \nan overwhelming number of people in both Houses support the public \noption. I am confident it will be part of the bill. It is important \nthat it is, because it will make this health care legislation, already \na pretty good bill, significantly better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Sorry I cannot stand. As the Senator from Ohio knows, \nof course, from the chair I am sitting in I have become an expert on \nhealth care from the wheelchair up. I broke my ankle coming out of \nchurch a couple weeks ago.\n  But I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio to yield for a few \nquestions. I was taken by the three vignettes he just told. They are \nfairly representative of what I get from Maryland. I would like to talk \nabout the young girl who had graduated and was deluged now with the \ndebt of medical bills and the public option.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that there are 47 million \nuninsured in our country? Does the Senator from Ohio know how many of \nthose are between the ages of 18 and 30?\n  Mr. BROWN. I do not know the precise number. But I know it is \nmillions of them are that age who lose their insurance and do not get \ninsurance and hope they do not get sick.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, again, for background in continuing the \ndiscussion. That is 35 percent of the uninsured. So is the Senator \naware that if we followed through with the HELP Committee bill and the \npublic option and also private sector competing with the public option \noffer, a reasonably no frills, reasonable cost health insurance bill \nfor young people, especially young people's benefit, that we would \ncover 35 percent of the uninsured?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think that is right. As the Senator knows as a senior \nmember of the HELP Committee who wrote some major part of this bill, we \nare not only going help those 25-, 28-year-olds buy insurance through \nthe public option or through private insurance, as the Senator \nsuggests, we also, if they are low or moderate income, give them \nassistance to be able to afford these plans.\n  We are not going to say: Go out and buy insurance. We are going to \nkeep the cost down through competition but also help them with some \nkind of subsidies to help them buy that insurance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Can I go to the man who sands floors for a living, the \nsmall businessperson whom we worry about who is a self-employed person. \nUnder the Senator's concept of a public option, is it true then that \nwhether it is he or a florist, maybe a real estate agent, that one of \nthe reasons they could afford it is they could go into the health \nexchange or the public option--would the public option not only offer \ninsurance but offer bargaining power for better prices on insurance? \nThey could bargain for better prices from hospitals, doctors, and \npharmaceuticals?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is exactly right.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In other words, why would a little guy or gal not only \nwant to be able to buy in, not only would the price be exorbitant, or \nis it that it would be an Uncle Sam's club that is buying things at \nbulk rate that enables them to afford the services?\n  Mr. BROWN. The Senator makes a terrific point. The man she talked \nabout, Jason from Cleveland, who sands and refinishes hardwood floors, \nhe was only in a group of four. You can't get good prices in a group of \nfour. He would be joining a group of millions, whether he chooses a \nprivate company or especially the public option. The Senator knows, \nfrom her work with the number of Federal employees she has in the \nWashington, DC, area and the suburbs of Maryland that the Veterans' \nAdministration is able to negotiate for prescription drugs. The VA pays \nprobably no more than half as much for prescription drugs as any of us \ngoing to the drugstore would pay. The public option will work the same \nway. They will use the size. The larger pool of employees will be able \nto get much less expensive hospital, doctor, and prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to express my concerns about \nthe PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act. This bill, which is currently \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, could have dire consequences on \nintelligence collection and investigations. While I have several \nconcerns about the provisions in this bill and how they will adversely \naffect the intelligence community, particular attention should be given \nto what our intelligence professionals have said about this bill.\n  Stakeholders in the intelligence community and the FBI have expressed \nconcern that this bill will have serious consequences on the tools \nthose agencies rely on to carry out intelligence investigations, \nidentify operatives, and prevent future attacks. These tools are \ncritical for detecting and disrupting terrorist plots in the United \nStates before they become imminent threats to our safety.\n  As we have seen in the past few weeks, investigations in Texas, \nIllinois, Colorado, and New York confirm what we already know: there \nare people in this country who want to and intend to harm us. The only \nway to stop these terrorist operatives is to give our counterterrorism \nspecialists the tools they depend on to detect these plots, thwart \nattacks, and, if possible, arrest the persons planning these \noperations.\n  I am troubled by the fact that we are rushing this bill through \ncommittee without taking the time to consider the concerns of those \ncharged with detecting terrorist plots. I urge my colleagues who are \nready to stand up and say this bill will not adversely affect current \nand future investigations to stop for a moment and listen to the \nprofessionals who use and need these tools on a daily basis. Do not \njust hear their concerns, really listen to them. Many of these \nprofessionals were around before September 11, and they remember how \ndifficult it was to act quickly to collect basic information about \nterrorists.\n  Three provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire on December 31, \n2009. These are roving wiretaps; business records access, also referred \nto as section 215 business records; and the lone wolf provision. At \nthis time, the lone wolf provision has yet to be used. It was created \nin response to the Moussaoui case. The provision amended FISA's \ndefinition of an ``agent of a foreign power'' to include any person, \nother than a U.S. person, who ``engages in international terrorism or \nactivities in preparation therefore.''\n  The expanded definition allows the government to obtain a FISA, \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, court order to surveil a non-\nU.S. person who has no known ties to a group or entity. Congress passed \nthis lone wolf provision because it was concerned that previous FISA \ndefinitions did not cover unaffiliated individuals--or those for whom \nno affiliation can be established--who, nonetheless, engage or are \npreparing to engage in international terrorism.\n  FBI Director Mueller has asked specifically that this authority be \nextended so if the FBI comes across another ``Moussaoui,'' there will \nbe no doubt that the FBI can intercept that target's communications. \nThis seems reasonable to me. We would not tell a police officer he had \nto give up his gun simply because he has not used it yet, would we?\n  The other two provisions set to expire are roving wiretaps and \nbusiness records searches. These tools are extremely important in the \nFBI's investigative work, and the FBI has a solid track record of using \nthem too. From 2004 through 2008, the FBI has obtained 236 orders from \nthe FISA court to produce business records. The business records \nauthority has been exceptionally useful in many types of national \nsecurity investigations. It routinely gives the intelligence community \nimportant information that can be used\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\nto build the case for FISA searches or surveillances of terror \nsuspects.\n  Roving wiretap authority has similarly increased the FBI's efficiency \nin critical investigations. The FBI has obtained roving wiretap \nauthority an average of 22 times per year. During the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's oversight hearing of the FBI, I asked Director Mueller if \nhe supported the reauthorization of these tools. He told me these tools \nare extremely important to investigations, and he hoped the tools would \nbe extended. Director Mueller has repeatedly expressed his support of \nthese tools to other Senators and committees.\n  In September, Director Mueller appeared before the Senate Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. Chairman Lieberman asked \nthe Director if there was one thing that the Bureau needed that would \nassist in its counterterrorism mission. Director Mueller responded by \nsaying:\n\n       I'll leap into the fray and say yes, the PATRIOT Act is \n     going to be debated. I know these provisions are essential to \n     us, particularly the first two which relate to business \n     records and secondly the roving wiretaps. And third, while it \n     has not been used, the lone wolf will be and is important if \n     we get a similar situation that we had with Moussaoui in \n     2001. So I would urge the reenactment of those provisions.\n\n  In his response to Chairman Lieberman, Director Mueller also endorsed \nNational Security Letters as a vital tool in gathering information. He \nfurther stated that NSLs contribute to the success of investigations \nthrough ``information we can gather, not of substantive conversations \nbut of tag data or the telephone toll data that we can obtain by reason \nof National Security Letters. So it is retaining these capabilities \nthat is important.\n  National Security Letters have come under fire from some on the left, \nand the substitute takes aim at them as well. Currently, NSLs cannot be \nused to wiretap citizens, scan e-mails, or conduct any kind of \nintrusive surveillance. NSLs simply allow the government to retrieve \nthe sort of transactional records that are extremely useful in \nuncovering terrorist activities.\n  NSLs are the most effective method of obtaining this routine data \nthat is critical to detecting, monitoring, and undermining terrorist \nactivities. They are also regularly used to rule out individuals as \nterror suspects. Intelligence investigations are a mosaic. Each bit of \ninformation is laid out and compared to other data. When these records \nare compared to other facts or information, they become the tiles that \ncompose the picture and provide investigators with the identities of \nconfederates and operatives.\n  The Supreme Court has clearly stated the fourth amendment is not \nimplicated when these types of records, held by third parties, are \nshared with the government. The High Court has reasoned that citizens \nhold no expectation of privacy when such records are created through \nbusiness transactions or otherwise.\n  The same records and data are just as easily obtained by \ninvestigators in criminal cases when they seek this information through \nan administrative or grand jury subpoena. This information is routinely \nobtained with little oversight in criminal investigations. NSLs are \nnarrow in scope and already have multiple layers of oversight and built \nin protections for privacy.\n  Some on the left have maligned NSLs as a sinister and baleful device \nfrom George Orwell's ``1984.'' The source of this accusation is clear: \nthese critics have misread the findings outlined in the DOJ inspector \ngeneral reviews of the FBI's use of National Security Letters.\n  In March 2007, the inspector general released its first report in \nwhich it criticized aspects of the FBI's use and record keeping of \nNSLs. I have reviewed the full report and it is clear to me that the \nerrors identified by the IG with respect to NSLs are largely \nadministrative in nature. Some critics have been quick to point to the \nIG's criticism of the FBI's use of what are called ``exigent letters'' \nas a reason to clamp down on the use of NSLs. But this is simply not \nsupported by the evidence. Exigent letters are not--I repeat not--\nnational security letters and the IG's findings should have no impact \non whether current NSL authorities remain intact.\n\n  In March 2008, the IG issued a second report that reviewed the \ncorrective measures as a result of the first report. The IG found that \nthe FBI and DOJ were committed to correcting and improving the earlier \nidentified administrative problems with NSLs. The report also stated \nthat the FBI has made significant progress in addressing compliance \nissues and implementing recommendations.\n  Under the leadership of Director Mueller, the FBI has made great \nstrides in correcting previous errors associated with NSLs. For \nexample, they have revised and clarified policies and increased \ntraining on the proper issuance and handling of NSLs. They created the \nOffice of Integrity and Compliance to ensure that the FBI continues to \ncomply with applicable statutes, guidelines, and policies.\n  Most significantly, the FBI mandated the use of a Web-based, \nautomated NSL creation system that prompts the drafter to enter all \ninformation necessary to create an NSL. This system supplies the \nappropriate statutory language and ensures that the NSL and the \nsupporting memorandum are internally consistent. An NSL can be issued \nfrom this system only after all the required officials have approved it \nwithin the system. This system will go a long way toward curing the \nadministrative errors identified by the IG.\n  Although both reports show that the FBI has sometimes struggled to \nmeasure up to its own internal standards in using NSLs, they also \nreveal that incidents of misuse were infrequent and unintentional. In \nshort, there were no abuses of NSLs as we have so often been led to \nbelieve. It is my opinion--and many in the FBI and Congress share this \nopinion--that the administrative errors identified by the IG could be \nsolved easily if the FBI had a national security administrative \nsubpoena--one type of subpoena for all national security records--just \nas the FBI, DEA, postal inspector, and a host of other agencies have in \nother types of criminal and administrative matters.\n  Those on the left who would prefer that the FBI not have NSL \nauthority ignore the many investigative successes attributed to this \nbasic tool outlined in the IG reports. For example, NSLs have provided \ninformation identifying terrorist financiers, revealed key information \nregarding pre-attack behavior, and detected an attempted espionage plot \nby a government contractor. The reports are unequivocal: NSLs are \nindispensable tools to national security investigations. Unfortunately, \ncertain provisions in the S. 1692 substitute will undoubtedly have a \nnegative effect on their operational efficaciousness.\n  But NSLs aren't the only tool that will suffer under this substitute. \nNew and, frankly, unprecedented minimization requirements would wreak \nhavoc on ordinary pen registers; unreasonable and confusing standards \nof proof will delay, and even prevent, usage of basic tools; new \nreporting requirements could compromise sources and methods; and sneak-\nand-peek search warrants have been rendered useless. My greatest fear \nis that this bill will reduce our terrorist detention capability to the \nstandard we possessed in the days preceding the horrific attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  I have a profound respect for the fine men and women who serve our \ncountry in our law enforcement and intelligence communities. Their \nfocus, vigilance, and attention to detail are critical in intelligence \ncollection, analysis, and detection of terrorist plots. Only \noccasionally, as in the past few weeks, does the American public hear \nabout the successes that their tireless efforts and these basic tools \nbring about. But here in Congress, we know the truth and we should do \nall in our power to help these professionals do their jobs. I am \nreminded of the quote attributed to British Prime Minister Winston \nChurchill, who said:\n\n       We sleep sound in our beds because rough men stand ready in \n     the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.\n\n  We should never lose sight of the fact that we are at war. One of our \ngreatest assets in this war is the ability to detect, investigate, and \ndisrupt terrorist plots, the purpose of which is to harm our citizens \non our own soil.\n  Neither this substitute nor its original bill is an improvement to \nthe PATRIOT Act. I believe firmly that this bill could reduce our \nintelligence collection capability to the level that existed before the \nattacks of 9/11. I urge\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nmy colleagues to take careful notice of the operational disadvantages \nin this substitute. The best path forward is clear. Congress should \nsimply vote to extend the sunsets on the three expiring PATRIOT Act \nprovisions and reject any measure that would tie the hands of those \ncharged with safekeeping and safeguarding our great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Mikulski and Ranking \nMember Shelby for their work on this bill. I rise today to speak about \nthe importance of strengthening the Federal Government's ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of financial crimes that have \ncontributed to our financial crisis. I am pleased this appropriations \nbill adds significant resources for fraud enforcement, thanks to \nChairwoman Mikulski and her committee and their attention to this \ncritical issue.\n  In May, Congress passed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act or \nFERA. In the aftermath of September 11, Federal law enforcement \nresources were shifted dramatically, and understandably, to \ncounterterrorism.\n  One of the central features of FERA was to authorize the \nappropriation of substantial resources to rebuild our capacity to \nattack mortgage fraud and other white-collar crime. FERA was passed \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support. The vote was 92 to 4 in the \nSenate, demonstrating our shared commitment to this effort.\n  Today's economic crisis has many causes, from serious regulatory \nfailures to recklessness and greed. While we still have much to learn \nabout what happened, one thing is absolutely certain: We need law \nenforcement investigators and prosecutors with ample resources and \ntraining to drill down now. Only a targeted and thorough investigation \ncan find out the extent to which financial fraud contributed to the \ncrisis and identify the individuals involved who should be held \nresponsible.\n  We need to look at the mortgage brokers who engaged in systemic \nfraud. But we must also examine the financial institutions that pooled \nsubprime mortgages and sold them with knowledge that they were toxic, \nthe credit rating agencies that failed due to conflicts of interest to \ngrade the assets properly, and the investment banks that failed to \ndisclose the fair value of the toxic assets on their books.\n  In order to restore the public's faith in our financial markets and \nin the rule of law, we must identify, prosecute, and send to prison \nthose individuals who broke the law. If we do less than that, we will \nfail to serve the American public and we will risk history repeating \nitself. But these cases are extremely complex. In this area, the bad \nguys have substantial resources at their disposal to fend off \ninvestigations. We need to remain vigilant in ensuring that our \ninvestigators and prosecutors are not overmatched.\n  That is why I am pleased to see the substantial resources devoted to \nfraud enforcement in this bill. The bill appropriates over $500 million \nfor fraud enforcement, a 10-percent increase over last year. At the \nFBI, it adds funding for 50 new agents, 61 new forensic accountants, \nand 32 professional support staff, all devoted to investigating \nfinancial fraud. As a result of this increase and other resource \nallocation decisions by the FBI, we now will have investigative \nresources approaching those devoted to the savings and loan crisis. The \nbill also adds funding for 155 new lawyers and 49 support staff in the \nDepartment of Justice and U.S. Attorneys offices, all dedicated to \nfinancial fraud enforcement.\n  I was proud to join with Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley in \nsponsoring the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. I look forward to \nworking with them and our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to make \nsure these significant new resources are used wisely and effectively.\n  In closing, I thank Chairman Inouye as well as, again, Chairwoman \nMikulski and Ranking Member Shelby for making funding for financial \nfraud enforcement a high priority of this bill. I look forward to \nworking together going forward to make sure that as the economy \nrecovers, we do not lose sight of the importance of fully funding \nenforcement efforts, not only to uncover and prosecute financial crimes \nthat have already been committed but also to defer future crimes. \nProsecuting bad people won't put an end to bad behavior, but it will \nhave an impact on those people in the mortgage industry, on the trading \ndesks, and in the boardrooms who might be tempted to put greed ahead of \nthe law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Recognizing Earl and Wanda Barrs\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize two of my \nconstituents, Earl and Wanda Barrs from Cochran, GA. Last Wednesday, \nthe American Tree Farm System named Earl and Wanda as its 2009 National \nOutstanding Tree Farmers of the Year. This award is presented by the \nAmerican Forest Foundation through its ATFS program and recognizes \noutstanding sustainable forest management on family-owned woodlands.\n  I have known Earl and Wanda since my early days in the House and have \nalways valued their advice and friendship. They have been involved in \nforestry for over 30 years and have owned and operated Gully Branch \nFarm since 1987 when they purchased the initial acreage.\n  This land is very special to the Barrs and they have a long family \nhistory connected to it. Earl's great-grandfather and grandfather \nsharecropped the land for years and, as a teenager, he spent countless \nhours hunting and fishing there.\n  Wanda has used her background in education to create an outdoor \nenvironmental classroom at the farm. Students, teachers, and forestry \nprofessionals from all over Georgia visit their farm to learn about the \nbenefits and science of sustainable forestry. They are then able to \ntake that knowledge back to their respective communities and teach \nothers about the importance of forest stewardship. Every April, the \nBleckley County Schools bring thousands of students to Gulley Branch \nfarm to have fun and participate in educational activities. Students \nenjoy wagon rides and learn about the different aspects of sustainable \nforest management.\n  This is not the first time Earl and Wanda have been recognized for \ntheir achievements in forestry. They were named the 2008 Georgia Tree \nFarmers of the Year and the 2009 Southern Regional Tree Farmers of the \nYear. In 2006, they received the Outstanding Achievements in \nSustainable Forestry Award, and Wanda has been named the Georgia \nProject Learning Tree Educator of the Year in both 1990 and 1995, as \nwell as the National Outstanding Educator of the Year in 1996.\n  I am proud to see the National Tree Farm of the Year award brought to \nGeorgia and look forward to continuing to work with Earl and Wanda to \ndevelop policies that will promote sustainable forestry management for \ngenerations to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it was called to my attention a few \nminutes ago that our deadline for comments about Ted Kennedy is coming \nup tomorrow. I wanted to beat the deadline. I always wait until the \nlast minute, it seems. One of the reasons I did is because there are so \nmany things\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\npeople are not aware of, so I took the time to send to places such as \nWestern Sahara and elsewhere to get documents that better explained a \nlittle bit more about who Ted Kennedy was than has already been stated \non the floor of the Senate.\n  I have a good friend whose name is Mouloud Said. He is the Ambassador \nat Large of Western Sahara. He and I worked together for many years \ntrying to bring some sanity into what has happened over the last 35 \nyears in Western Sahara.\n  For the record, since people are not aware of this conflict that took \nplace, back in 1975, the Moroccans invaded what was then called Spanish \nSahara, later called Western Sahara. There were a lot of people chased \nout at that time. They fled. War ensued between 1975 and 1991. It \ncontinued during that time. When Morocco invaded that area that was \nlater called Western Sahara, the refugees, the people who were living \nthere who rightfully should be in that area, who should be living there \ntoday, were chased into Algeria. Tindouf is an area I have been to a \ncouple times. The refugee camps there are so large. There are actually \n175,000 refugees who were chased out of Western Sahara and have been \nwanting to be repatriated ever since then.\n  One of the former Secretaries of State, James Baker, was a hero in \nthis area. He did the best he could to see that repatriation would take \nplace. It seemed like every time they got close to working out \nsomething with Morocco, they would get right up to the altar and then \nthey would cut it off. They would agree something should be done, but \nas they would come to agreement and get together, Morocco would back \ndown. That took place for a long period of time.\n  You cannot be empathetic with the people who are there until you have \nwalked through the little alleys and the stucco houses in Tindouf and \nsee how these people are living, hearing their chants, their cries for \nfreedom. Three generations now have been trying to escape, to be \nrepatriated, and it hasn't worked.\n  I have a letter--I will read part of it--that ties Senator Kennedy \nand me to this issue. This is from Mouloud Said, who is Ambassador at \nLarge of Western Sahara:\n\n       Indeed, this was precisely the case when Senator James \n     Inhofe and the late Senator Edward Kennedy reached across the \n     political aisle to jointly promote the cause of justice and \n     freedom in the Western Sahara, and respect for human rights \n     of the Sahrawi people. As recognized by the United Nations \n     Charter, the African Union, and the American Constitution, \n     all people have the inalienable right to freedom and self-\n     determination, and the Sahrawi people will be forever \n     indebted to these great Senators for their principled and \n     bipartisan stand on behalf of the Sahrawi's fundamental \n     rights.\n\n  That is what it is all about. We would see these people out there, \nand they had no one to take care of them. The Moroccans, they have \nfriends. I have to say this: I testified probably 2 or 3 years ago at a \nHouse committee hearing. At that time, we made a list of all the \nlobbyists Morocco had hired. They had everybody. The money was all on \none side, and only the Lord and a few people who were sympathetic to \nthem were on the side of those people who have been living on the \nAlgerian border for the last 35 years. That is what they are going \nthrough at this time. It is very sad.\n  I want to mention, talking about Ted Kennedy, how persistent he was. \nThis goes all the way back to his involvement, back to the time when \nthe war was still taking place. I have statements I am going to enter \ninto the Record. They are not long. One goes back to October 1, 1992, a \n``Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy at Senate Foreign Relations \nAfrica Subcommittee Hearing on the Western Sahara.'' He goes through \nand tells the story of what he has attempted to do, and he had not been \nable to successfully get it done. The same as with James Baker and \nmyself.\n  January of 1994, ``Statement by Edward M. Kennedy in Support of \nAmendment Promoting Implementation of Peace Plan in Western Sahara.'' \nJanuary of 1994, we thought at that time we had it done. Again, an \narrangement was made. It was agreed to by all parties until they got \ntogether.\n  June 23, 1999, ``Senator Kennedy Calls for Greater Progress in the \nWestern Sahara Referendum.'' A referendum is all they want. They want \nself-determination. They want to be able to vote as to whether they \nwant to be repatriated, which is something we in America would assume \neverybody has that right. But that is not the situation.\n  Senator Kennedy, again, went to battle to help them in June 23, 1999, \nand was not able to get it done.\n  Then, again, in 2000, he actually offered amendments for holding \nreferendums in Western Sahara.\n  Later in that same year, he appealed to King Mohammed VI of Morocco \nto give these people a chance, at least, of self-determination. He was \nunable to get that done.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these \ndocuments.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy at Senate Foreign Relations \n           Africa Subcommittee Hearing on the Western Sahara\n\n       I want to thank Senator Simon, the Subcommittee Chairman, \n     for holding this important hearing today.\n       The ongoing crisis in the Western Sahara raises serious \n     questions regarding the Government of Morocco's willingness \n     to honor its international commitment to a free and fair \n     referendum in that territory. It also brings into question \n     the credibility of the United Nations in administering the \n     Western Saharan peace plan, and our own government's \n     commitment to the principles of sovereignty and self-\n     determination.\n       Barring immediate and dramatic progress, the peace plan for \n     the Western Sahara is destined to fail. If the peace plan is \n     to succeed, the United States must do more to make clear--\n     through deed as well as word--its commitment to a free and \n     fair referendum for the indigenous Saharawi people.\n       The Western Sahara is the last vestige of colonialism in \n     Africa. The U.N. Decolonization Committee called for \n     decolonization in 1966, while it was still under Spanish \n     rule. In 1973, the General Assembly called for a referendum \n     on self-determination by the Saharawi, Spain agreed to hold a \n     referendum and took a census to provide a voting list.\n       Shortly thereafter, Morocco and Mauritania, seeking access \n     to the territory's valuable natural resources, laid claim to \n     the Western Sahara. In an effort to strengthen its claim to \n     the territory, Morocco requested an advisory opinion from the \n     International Court of Justice on its legal status. The Court \n     found that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had ties to the \n     Western Sahara sufficient for claims of territorial \n     sovereignty. Like the United Nations, The Court supported \n     ``self-determination and genuine expression of the will of \n     the peoples'' to determine the territory's legal status.\n       Rather than accept that decision, King Hassan II sent \n     Moroccan troops into the Western Sahara. Clashes ensued \n     between Moroccan forces and the Polisario, the armed \n     resistance of the Saharawi. Invading troops ``disappeared'' \n     thousands of Saharawi civilians, most of whom were killed. \n     Hundreds of others were detained without charge--and remain \n     imprisoned today.\n       The Moroccan invasion touched off an exodus of refugees \n     from the Western Sahara into Algeria. Seventeen years later, \n     tens of thousands of these refugees continue to subsist in \n     emergency relief tents with minimal food and water under \n     extremely oppressive desert conditions including violent \n     sandstorms and blistering heat exceeding 160 degrees.\n       In what became known as the ``Green March,'' King Hassan \n     then sent 350,000 Moroccan civilians into the territory to \n     strengthen his claim. Within months of the Moroccan influx \n     Spain withdrew, granting Morocco and Mauritania ``temporary \n     authority'' to administer the territory until a referendum \n     could be held.\n       Neither Morocco nor Mauritania granted the Saharawi the \n     right to self-determination, and their war against the \n     Polisario steadily escalated. The Polisario's use of land \n     rovers and quick strike tactics, however, achieved \n     surprising successes against Moroccan and Mauritanian \n     forces, and in 1979 Mauritania renounced its claims to the \n     territory.\n       Finally, after over a decade of war, the Government of \n     Morocco agreed to a U.N.-sponsored peace plan leading to a \n     referendum, under which the Saharawi would vote for \n     independence or integration with Morocco. In 1990, the \n     Security Council adopted resolutions approving the plan and \n     establishing the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in \n     Western Sahara (MINURSO).\n       Under the plan, a cease-fire was to go into effect on \n     September 6, 1991, and the referendum was to be held in early \n     1992. The parties agreed to use the 1974 Spanish census, \n     which recorded approximately 74,000 Saharawis, to establish a \n     voting list for the referendum.\n       Yet, only days before the cease-fire was to go into effect, \n     Morocco bombed a compound that the Saharawi had constructed \n     to house MINURSO personnel.\n       Inexplicably, the United States was the sole country on the \n     U.N. Security Council which failed to condemn this outrageous \n     action.\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\n       After the cease-fire went into effect, King Hassan changed \n     his position on the voting list. After vmg agreed to base the \n     list upon the 1974 census, he presented the U.N. with a list \n     of 120,000 additional voters from Morocco whom he claimed \n     were Saharawi and should also be permitted to vote. These \n     individuals were transported into the Western Sahara in \n     violation of the peace plan, which forbids the unilateral \n     transfer of populations into the territory without \n     identification at the border by U.N. personnel.\n       Under the peace plan, MINURSO observers are to implement \n     and monitor the cease-fire, oversee the release of POWs, \n     identify and register voters, and organize the referendum. \n     Fully employed, MINURSO was to consist of 1,695 military and \n     civilian personnel.\n       Yet as of today, nine months after the referendum was to \n     have been held, fewer than 400 MINURSO personnel are in the \n     Western Sahara. With severely limited equipment and \n     personnel, these observers have been forced to restrict their \n     focus to monitoring the cease-fire. Due to serious violations \n     of the peace plan by the Government of Morocco, the observers \n     have been prevented from fostering an atmosphere of \n     confidence and stability conducive to holding a free and fair \n     referendum.\n       These violations include preventing critical supplies for \n     U.N. personnel from reaching the field; denying U.N. \n     observers access to military areas; threatening to shoot U.N. \n     personnel; intercepting and blocking U.N. patrols and \n     sideswiping U.N. vehicles; refusing to identify land mines to \n     U.N. observers, resulting in the loss of three U.N. vehicles \n     and serious injury to U.N. personnel; banning access to the \n     territory by international observers, reporters, and human \n     rights organizations; refusing to withdraw any of its 130,000 \n     troops; and declining to provide figures on the strength and \n     deployment of its armed forces, despite written instructions \n     to do so from the U.N. Secretary General.\n       Last month, in the most serious violation of the peace \n     process, King Hassan announced his intention to hold his own \n     elections in the territory, independently of the United \n     Nations--thereby wholly undermining the U.N. effort.\n       Ironically, U.N. observers have also been severely hampered \n     by lack of material and political support from the U.N. in \n     New York, which has routinely ignored Moroccan violations of \n     the peace plan. The Secretary General has failed to respond \n     politically to MINURSO's reports of cease-fire violations--\n     including 178 confirmed violations of the cease-fire, the \n     transfer of thousands of Moroccan citizens to the territory \n     prior to their identification by the U.N., and continuous \n     misbehavior with respect to MINURSO.\n       Accordingly, MINURSO personnel in the field today are \n     attempting to carry out their duties without the cooperation \n     of the Government of Morocco and without the political \n     backing of the U.N.\n       Despite Morocco's flagrant violations of the peace plan, \n     the Bush Administration has failed to press King Hassan in \n     any significant manner with respect to the Western Sahara. To \n     the contrary, the Administration has requested that $40 \n     million in military aid and $12 million in Economic Support \n     Funds be earmarked for Morocco for FY '93. This is \n     particularly perplexing, inasmuch as no funds were earmarked \n     for Morocco during FY '92.\n       I hope that the witnesses for the Administration will make \n     clear today why the U.S. is not condemning Morocco for its \n     violations of the peace plan. The Administration should also \n     explain why it is unwilling to urge the United Nations to do \n     more to defend this important peace initiative.\n       Failure of the U.N. peace plan will have serious \n     consequences for the stability of North Africa. Unless the \n     Administration makes clear to the Government of Morocco its \n     commitment to a free and fair referendum for the Saharawi, \n     fighting in the Western Sahara may soon be renewed. That is a \n     result none of us wants, and now is the time to prevent it \n     from happening.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Statement by Senator Edward M. Kennedy in Support of Amendment \n      Promoting Implementation of Peace Plan in the Western Sahara\n\n       I am introducing today, on behalf of myself and Senators \n     Pell, Kassebaum, and Simon an amendment to support the \n     indigenous people of the Western Sahara in their long and \n     arduous struggle for self-determination.\n       As U.S. citizens, we are fortunate to live in a country \n     founded on human rights principles and the right to a \n     government of our own choosing. Our democratic ideals have \n     inspired peoples in all hemispheres around the world. \n     Elections during the past twelve months in Russia, Burundi, \n     Cambodia, Paraguay, and Yemen are examples of the world-wide \n     trend away from authoritarianism and toward representative \n     government.\n       Sadly, this trend has not yet reached all regions of the \n     world. The indigenous Saharawi people in the Western Sahara \n     have waited more than 18 years to regain their right to self-\n     determination. Hopefully, that right will soon be restored to \n     them.\n       Since Morocco's invasion of the Western Sahara in 1975, \n     King Hassan II has staged a long and costly war against the \n     Saharawi people to obtain permanent access to that \n     territory's valuable natural resources.\n       For years, Morocco ignored proposals by the U.N. General \n     Assembly calling for a referendum on self-determination by \n     the Saharawi. When Morocco took its claim over the territory \n     before the International Court of Justice, the Court found \n     that Morocco did not have ties sufficient for claims of \n     territorial sovereignty. Like the United Nations, the Court \n     supported ``self-determination and genuine expression of the \n     will of the peoples'' to determine the territory's legal \n     status.\n       Rather than accept that decision, King Hassan sent Moroccan \n     troops into the territory who killed and ``disappeared'' \n     thousands of Saharawi who were unwilling to recognize \n     Moroccan sovereignty. Then, in what became known as the \n     ``Green March,'' King Hassan sent 350,000 Moroccan citizens \n     into the Western Sahara to strengthen his claim to it.\n       Finally, after over a decade of war, the Government of \n     Morocco agreed to a U.N.-sponsored peace plan leading up to a \n     referendum under which the Saharawi would vote for \n     independence or integration with Morocco. Under this plan, a \n     ceasefire was to go into effect on September 6, 1991, and the \n     referendum was to be held in early 1992. The parties agreed \n     to use a 1974 census, which recorded approximately 74,000 \n     Saharawis, to establish a voting list for the referendum.\n       Yet, only days before the cease-fire was to go into effect, \n     Morocco bombed a compound the Saharawi had constructed to \n     house U.N. personnel. In addition, King Hassan changed his \n     position on the voter list.\n       After having previously agreed to base the list upon the \n     1974 census, he presented the U.N. with a list of 170,000 \n     Moroccans whom he claimed should also be permitted to vote. \n     These individuals were moved into the Western Sahara in \n     violation of the peace plan, which forbids the unilateral \n     transfer of population into the territory without prior \n     identification by U.N. personnel.\n       U.N. observers have also expressed concern regarding other \n     violations of the peace plan by the Government of Morocco. \n     These violations have prevented the observers from fostering \n     an atmosphere of confidence and stability conducive to \n     holding a free and fair referendum.\n       The violations include preventing critical supplies for \n     U.N. personnel from reaching the field; denying U.N. \n     observers access to military areas; threatening to shoot U.N. \n     personnel; intercepting and blocking U.N. patrols and \n     sideswiping U.N. vehicles; refusing to identify land mines to \n     U.N. observers, resulting in the loss of three U.N. \n     vehicles and serious injury to U.N. personnel; banning \n     access to the territory by international observers, \n     reporters, and human rights organizations; refusing to \n     withdraw its troops; and declining to provide figures on \n     the strength and deployment of its armed forces, despite \n     written instructions to do so from the U.N. Secretary \n     General.\n       In one of the most serious violations of the peace process, \n     King Hassan held his own elections in the territory in June--\n     thereby directly undermining the U.N. effort.\n       U.N. officials nonetheless remain hopeful of holding the \n     referendum this year. For the referendum to be free and fair, \n     the U.N. must disqualify Moroccan settlers from eligibility \n     to vote in the referendum.\n       Failure of the U.N. peace plan is likely to have serious \n     consequences for the stability of North Africa. If the \n     Government of Morocco continues to obstruct the peace \n     process, fighting in the Western Sahara may well be renewed.\n       At this critical stage in the peace process the United \n     States must do more to make clear--through deed as well as \n     word--our commitment to a free and fair referendum for the \n     Saharawi people.\n       The amendment we are introducing today:\n       (1) Commends the President for his commitment within the \n     United Nations and in bilateral relations to a free and fair \n     referendum on self-determination in the Western Sahara;\n       (2) Supports the United Nations' commitment to holding a \n     free and fair referendum, and commends the Secretary General \n     for intensifying his efforts towards that end;\n       (3) Commends the Administration for undertaking new policy \n     initiatives with regard to the Western Sahara, including the \n     opening of contacts with the Polisario Front at the Saharawi \n     refugee camp in Tindouf, Algeria;\n       (4) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to comply \n     strictly with the terms of the peace plan as accepted by the \n     parties and approved by the United Nations Security Council;\n       (5) Calls upon Morocco to put an end to the transfer of \n     population not properly identified by the United Nations as \n     eligible voters in the referendum from Morocco into the \n     Western Sahara, and to return to Morocco all such individuals \n     currently in the Western Sahara;\n       (6) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to continue \n     the direct dialogue they begun under the auspices of the \n     United Nations in July 1993 with the goal of furthering the \n     peace process;\n       (7) Calls upon Morocco and the Polisario Front to allow \n     international human rights organizations to enter Morocco, \n     the Western Sahara, and refugee camps under their control to \n     assess the human rights situation; and\n       (8) Calls upon the President to:\n       Strongly advocate within the United Nations and in \n     bilateral relations the implementation of the peace plan as \n     accepted by the Polisario Front and Morocco and approved by \n     the U.N. Security Council;\n       Urge all parties concerned to take all steps necessary to \n     begin voter registration, starting with the updated lists of \n     the 1974 Spanish census, and to overcome their differences \n     regarding the interpretation and application of the criteria \n     for voter eligibility;\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\n       Institute regular contact at all levels in Washington with \n     representatives of the Polisario Front, in order to \n     strengthen the United States' evenhanded position with \n     respect to the Western Sahara; and\n       Encourage the parties to allow independent international \n     observers, including human rights organizations, to monitor \n     the situation in the territory and observe the referendum \n     process.\n       The ongoing crisis in the Western Sahara raises serious \n     questions regarding the Government of Morocco's willingness \n     to honor its international commitment to a free and fair \n     referendum in the Western Sahara. This amendment would make \n     clear our government's support for the U.N. peace process and \n     America's commitment to the principles of sovereignty and \n     self-determination.\n       I urge my colleagues to join us in enacting this timely and \n     important measure.\n                                  ____\n\n\nSenator Kennedy Calls for Greater Progress on Western Sahara Referendum\n\n       Senator Edward M. Kennedy today praised the Senate for \n     calling for greater progress on a long-stalled referendum on \n     self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara.\n       Since 1988, the United Nations has sought to organize a \n     free, fair, and open referendum in the Western Sahara, the \n     former Spanish colony that Morocco has illegally occupied \n     since 1975.\n       Kennedy said, ``A solution to the conflict over the Western \n     Sahara will enhance security and stability in Northern \n     Africa. After more than ten years of delay, the people of the \n     Western Sahara should be permitted to determine for \n     themselves who will govern them.''\n       Kennedy, Republican Senator Gordon Smith, and Democratic \n     Senator Patrick Leahy sponsored an amendment accepted by the \n     Senate on the State Department Reauthorization Bill to \n     require the State Department to report on progress on the \n     referendum. The bill, including the Western Sahara amendment, \n     was passed by the Senate yesterday.\n       The International Court of Justice, the Organization of \n     African Unity, the United States, and many other nations \n     throughout the world have not recognized Morocco's claim to \n     the Western Sahara, but Morocco's occupation continues. Tens \n     of thousands of the Sahrawi people languish in refugee camps \n     in southern Algeria and have been denied the opportunity to \n     determine their own future.\n       A UN referendum was originally scheduled for 1992. It has \n     since been delayed many times, primarily due to the \n     resistance of the Government of Morocco. The referendum is \n     now scheduled for July 2000.\n       In the 1997 Houston Accords, achieved under the leadership \n     of former Secretary of State James Baker, and in a UN plan \n     last December, the international community called for the \n     conclusion of the voter registration process and a \n     referendum. Morocco subsequently agreed to allow the \n     referendum to occur by July 2000.\n       Senator Kennedy praised the Administration's efforts to \n     resolve this longstanding dispute. He urged the State \n     Department to make it clear to both parties to this dispute \n     that the United States expects the people of the Western \n     Sahara to be allowed to exercise their right to self-\n     determination in a free, fair, and open referendum by July \n     2,000.\n       ``Morocco has been a faithful ally of the United States for \n     more than 200 years,'' said Kennedy, ``but its refusal to \n     allow the people of the Western Sahara to determine their own \n     political future undercuts America's efforts to promote \n     democracy worldwide.''\n       The Kennedy-Smith-Leahy amendment requires the State \n     Department to report on January 1, 2000 and again on June 1--\n     2000 on specific steps being taken by the Government of \n     Morocco and by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia \n     el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) to ensure a free, fair, \n     and open referendum by July 2000 for the people of the \n     Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration \n     with Morocco.\n       The State Department reports will include a description of \n     preparations for the referendum and the extent to which free \n     access to the territory will be guaranteed for independent \n     and international organizations, including election observers \n     and international media. Human rights organizations and other \n     international organizations must also be permitted to observe \n     the referendum.\n       In addition, the reports will include a description of \n     current efforts by the Department of State to ensure that the \n     referendum will be held, and an assessment of the likelihood \n     that the July 2000 date will be met.\n       The reports will also include a description of obstacles, \n     if any, to the voter registration process and other \n     preparations for the referendum and efforts being made: by \n     the parties and the United States Government to overcome \n     those obstacles. Finally, the reports will include an \n     assessment of progress being made in the repatriation \n     process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     (Purpose: To require reports with respect to the holding of a \n                     referendum on Western Sahara)\n\n       On page 115; after line 18, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. _. REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO A REFERENDUM ON WESTERN \n                   SAHARA.\n\n       (a) Reports Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than each of the dates specified \n     in paragraph (2)1 the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     report to the appropriate Congressional committees describing \n     specific steps being taken by the Government of Morocco and \n     by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra \n     and Rio de Oro (POLIS--RIO) to ensure that a referendum in \n     which the people of the Western Sahara will choose between \n     independence and integration with Morocco will be held by \n     March 2000.\n       (2) Deadlines for submission of reports.--The dates \n     referred to in paragraph (1) are November 1, 1999, and \n     February 1, 2000.\n       (b) Report Elements.--The report shall include--\n       (1) a description of preparations for the referendum,\n       (2) a description of current efforts by the Department of \n     State to ensure that a referendum will be held by March 2000;\n       (3) an assessment of the likelihood that the March 2000 \n     date will be met,\n       (4) a description of obstacles, if any, to the voter-\n     registration process and other preparations for the \n     referendum, and efforts being made by the parties and the \n     United States Government to overcome those obstacles;\n       (5) an assessment of progress being made in the \n     repatriation process; and\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Statement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy on IDS Meeting With King \n                         Mohammed VI of Morocco\n\n       I welcome this opportunity to meet with the King. I have \n     great respect for his leadership, and I wished him well in \n     his important responsibilities, and in maintaining close ties \n     between our nations.\n       A particular issue I discussed with the King was the United \n     Nations referendum on the Western Sahara.\n       Morocco gained the respect of the international community \n     when it agreed in 1991 and again in 1997 to allow a \n     referendum on the future of the Western Sahara. These actions \n     demonstrated an impressive commitment to the right of self-\n     determination for the people of the Western Sahara.\n       The referendum is an important part of the peace process, \n     and I hope that it will take place as soon as possible.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me conclude by saying that other \nthings were happening too. When you think about countries, I often said \nAfrica is the forgotten continent. I can remember so well back when \nthey were talking about taking our troops into Bosnia and then later \nKosovo, the excuse they were using--this is back in the Clinton \nadministration--they were saying it was ethnic cleansing taking place \nthere. I said on the Senate floor standing at this podium--this is way \nback in the late nineties--I said for every person who has been \nethnically cleansed in Bosnia, there are hundreds on any given day in \nany Western Africa country. But people did not care about it. Senator \nKennedy did.\n  I know this is a little bit sensitive subject, but even to this day, \nright now, every other week, there is a group of people, staff people, \nwho get together. They have nothing in common except a heart for \nAfrica. There are liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. They \nmeet every other week, in Senator Kennedy's office and then in my \noffice, and they pray for Africa. This is something about Senator \nKennedy people did not know. That is something that takes place even to \nthis date.\n  I have a letter written recently by Lindsey Gilchrist of Senator \nKennedy's office:\n\n       I know Senator Kennedy and Senator Inhofe had always been \n     thought of as the bipartisan leaders on this issue. The \n     Africa prayer group was not something Senator Kennedy was \n     directly involved in [or Senator Inhofe]--\n\n  But they have stimulated and motivated us to do this very thing. That \nwas one of the things that occupied 20 years of Senator Kennedy's time. \nI feel committed to continuing to work with the people of Western \nSahara to try to make that a reality. When that happens, we are going \nto be able to say--he will be watching down: All right, we finally did \nit.\n  Let me share a couple personal experiences I had with Senator \nKennedy. One is a little bit humorous. In 2005, the Republicans were in \nthe majority. I was chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We did the 2005 transportation reauthorization bill. It was \na huge thing. I am a conservative, but this is something we need to be \ndoing in this country, something about infrastructure.\n  As is always the custom of the Senate, as the Chair is well aware, \nwhen we pass a big bill, we stand on the floor and thank all the staff \npeople and talk about the significance of it and how important it is.\n  We had just passed the bill when I was getting ready to make my \nspeech about what a great job we did when the\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nbells went off. They said: Bomb threat, bomb threat; evacuate, \nevacuate. Everybody started running. I had not made my speech yet, so I \nstood up. It is kind of eerie when you are the only person in the \nCapitol and giving a speech. Of course, there was nobody here, and the \ncameras were still going.\n  I remember, after finishing my speech, I looked down at the bottom of \nthe stairs and saw a very large man walking out. I went down and I \nsaid: Ted, we better get out; this place might blow up.\n  He said: Well, Jim, these old legs don't work like they used to.\n  I said: Let me help you. It happened, by the way, this was right \nafter the American Conservative Union came out with the ratings where I \nwas the No. 1 most conservative Member of the Senate and he was the \nsecond from the most liberal Member of the Senate. I said: Let me help \nyou. I put my arm around his waist and he put his arm around my arm. \nSomeone took a picture. It ended up on the front page of a magazine. \nThe caption was: ``Who Says Conservatives are Not Compassionate?'' That \nis the kind of relationship we had. I will always remember this.\n  He did things that people are not expected to do. There was a show--\nthey don't have it on television anymore--called ``Crossfire.'' Some \nmight remember that. It was an aggressive program, where you get two \npeople debating each other on an issue. The issue that particular day--\nthis was back in 2000--was Vieques. Vieques is an island off Puerto \nRico. They were trying to shut it down. They were successful. I don't \nblame it on the Democrats or Republicans. President Bush went along \nwith Al Gore and closed down the live range at Vieques, which was the \nonly place the Navy and marines could do integrated training.\n  I was actually debating Bobby Kennedy--he was his nephew--on the \n``Crossfire'' show. It was one of these things where I really knew the \nissue. I knew I had him on this debate. It came down to the end, and I \ncould have put the knife in at that time. I didn't have the heart to do \nit.\n  I was sitting, Madam President, where you are sitting the next day, \npresiding over the Senate, and Ted Kennedy came up. He said: Well, Jim, \nI came up to say thank you.\n  Thank you for what?\n  He said: I was watching this debate you had last night, and I knew \nwhat you were thinking and I knew that you had won this thing and right \nat the last you could have inflicted great harm to Bobby. You elected \nnot to do it. I want to tell you I appreciate it very much.\n  That was Senator Kennedy.\n  There are things still going on today to which he committed his life. \nWe are going to win some of those, and we are going to rejoice when \nthat happens. He will be right here with us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               CBO Scores\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Congressional Budget Office has \nissued its report on the Finance Committee legislation. That bill was \nsent over to the Congressional Budget Office a couple days ago. The \nreport is quite promising. The report is good news.\n  Our balanced approach in the Finance Committee to health reform has \npaid off once again. Today, the Congressional Budget Office confirmed \nthat America's Healthy Future Act--that is the legislation in the \nFinance Committee--remains fully paid for and reduces the Federal \ndeficit. In fact, it reduces the deficit by $81 billion in the first 10 \nyears.\n  CBO also says in its report that the legislation continues to reduce \nthe deficit in the second 10 years; that is, it bends the cost curve in \nthe second 10 years as well.\n  More important, it improves and expands health care coverage for tens \nof millions of American families. That is done by raising the coverage \nrate of 83 percent to 94 percent. In fact, that might be a slight \nincrease from what we earlier anticipated in the committee bill.\n  This legislation, I believe, is a smart investment on the Federal \nbalance sheet. It is an even smarter investment for American families, \nbusinesses, and our economy. Health reform will modernize the health \ncare system for America for the 21st century. It is about time we got \nto that point.\n  The bill also reduces inefficiencies and focuses on quality and \nensures we are getting the best bang for our health care buck.\n  Health care reform should be fiscally responsible as it expands and \nimproves coverage. CBO confirms the legislation does that.\n  I am very pleased with that report. It will help us move toward the \nnext steps in merging the bill with the HELP Committee bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, may I ask the Chair what is the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the amendment offered \nby Senator Vitter, No. 2644.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I just walked out of a hearing on the census, and \nthe Vitter amendment applies to that. It is interesting. We send a \nmillion forms out a year called the American Community Survey, and in \nthat survey we ask people whether they are citizens of the United \nStates. And you know what, they answer it. They give an answer to that. \nAnd that is a million of those we send out every year.\n  We are about to conduct a census that ignores the Constitution and \nwill, in fact, disrupt the true allocation of apportionment in this \ncountry because the census we are getting ready to ask will ignore \nwhether you are a true citizen of this country. Legal or otherwise, it \nwill ignore that. It will ignore whether you have voting rights, \nwhether you are here properly, whether you have broken our laws and are \nhere improperly, and we will see a maldistribution to the tune of 10 \nseats in States that shouldn't have them and States that should have 10 \nmore seats won't have them. And that is based on the Census data this \nyear.\n  So what Senator Vitter is offering is a response to following the \nConstitution and also recognizing that we are getting ready to do a \ncensus next year that is going to get it wrong. My hope is that my \ncolleagues will consider very carefully that they took an oath to \ndefend the Constitution, and that Constitution speaks very clearly--in \nthis little book--about what the enumeration is supposed to be. It is \nabout citizens of the United States, not residents of the United \nStates. If, in fact, we do this the way it looks like we are going to, \nwhat we will be doing is changing our Constitution. What we are \nactually going to do is we are just going to throw our Constitution \ndown and step on it.\n  So he is not asking anything from a racial standpoint or anything \nother than for a fair enumeration by which the Census agrees that if \nthey were to do it properly, they would need to ask that question. They \nhave printed 100 million forms already, and the question is, Do we want \nto waste that money and throw those forms out? Well, there is an answer \nto that. All you have to do is put in an insert, and here is question \nNo. 11. That will cost very little money and then we will actually have \na true census based on what the Constitution says, not on what we think \nmight politically benefit one State over another.\n  Madam President, I know the chairman of the Finance Committee is here \nand would like to make a unanimous consent request, and I will yield to \nhim at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3631\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, unless the Senate acts soon, millions of \nseniors and disabled individuals will face sharply higher Medicare \npremiums next year. In this great recession, we\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nmust act quickly to ensure we do not allow a formulated quirk to punish \nour seniors on fixed incomes in our financially strapped States.\n  Many seniors have their Medicare Part B premiums deducted from their \nmonthly Social Security checks. Normally, the Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustment is greater than the increase in the Part B premium \nfor that year. As a result, the beneficiaries' monthly checks in the \nnew year are greater than their monthly checks were in the last year. \nBut next year there is not likely to be an upward cost-of-living \nadjustment in Social Security checks. When that happens, most Medicare \nbeneficiaries are held harmless against reductions in their Social \nSecurity checks. The Part B premium is reduced so that their monthly \nSocial Security checks in the new year are not less than they were in \nthe prior year.\n  However, 27 percent of Medicare enrollees do not benefit from hold \nharmless. The absence of a cost-of-living adjustment will expose these \nseniors to big premium increases next year. Under current law, these \nenrollees not only have to pay their own premiums, but they must make \nup the premiums by the 73 percent of beneficiaries we hold harmless. \nThese 27 percent of Medicare recipients will be forced to shoulder the \nfull load of next year's premium increases. This will mean an increase \nin premiums up from $96 to $120 a month next year. Who are these \nrecipients? They include low-income beneficiaries who participate in \nboth Medicare and Medicaid. They include new enrollees in Medicare Part \nB. They also include Medicare Part B enrollees who don't receive Social \nSecurity, such as some Federal retirees. They include higher income \nenrollees who already pay higher premiums.\n  This burden will hit Medicare beneficiaries hard, but financially \nstrapped States will also feel the effect because State Medicaid \nPrograms pick up the cost of Part B premiums for Medicare beneficiaries \nwho are also eligible for Medicaid. The premium hike would also hit \nState budgets because of that reason. States all across the Nation are \nfacing huge deficits and difficult choices, and we should not allow \nthis quirk in the law to add to their burden.\n  The Medicare Premium Fairness Act would correct this. It would ensure \nthat these 27 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would not have to \nshoulder any additional burden. No Medicare Part B enrollee would face \na higher premium next year over this year. The bill would provide \nsecurity to seniors on fixed incomes. To prevent Federal cost shift to \nStates, the bill would pay for and would tap into the Medicare \nImprovement Fund, which was created to solve problems such as this.\n  Inaction on this bill is not an option for seniors and States, and I \nhope the bill will have broad bipartisan support.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3631, the Medicare \nPremium Fairness Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; further, that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent to \nbe recognized for 3 or 4 minutes as I respond to this, if the Senator \nfrom Montana does not have any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. None.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, America has to ask itself a question \nright now. This bill costs $2.8 billion, and 95 percent of the people \nwill not feel anything if we don't do this. But 5 percent will, and I \nreadily admit that. We are going to take $2.8 billion from our kids or \nfrom future Medicare payments--one way or the other, we are going to \nsteal it from our kids--to fix a problem for 5 percent of the people \nwho are on Medicare or will be on Medicare.\n  This is exactly the kind of problem that the Congress ducks. We are \nducking it. We are kicking the can down the road because we are afraid \nto do the right best thing for America.\n  Let me give a breakdown. First, I will just say I appreciate the \nleadership of the Senator from Montana on the Finance Committee.\n  The Social Security Act holds three-quarters of the beneficiaries \nharmless for increases in the Medicare Part B premium during the years \nin which there is no COLA, as the chairman just stated. But for the \nother one-fourth of the beneficiaries not held harmless, little impact \nwill be felt. According to the Congressional Research Service, the \nmajority of this group is comprised of Medicaid, as the chairman just \nstated, the vast majority of them, which covers their premiums anyway. \nSo if there is a cost transfer, it will be cost-transferred back to the \nFederal Government anyway because we pay 67 percent of all the Medicaid \ncosts anyway. Finally, the remainder of those not held harmless--high-\nincome individuals making over $85,000 a year as an individual or \n$170,000 as a couple and new beneficiaries during their first year, for \nwhich they will receive Medicare, Social Security, or Medicare Part B \nbenefits--the vast majority of all these people have a supplemental \npolicy, so they won't feel anything.\n  So what are we doing? We are taking $2.8 billion--and we may be \ntaking it from the Medicare Improvement Fund, which ultimately takes it \nout of Medicare, or we are going to take it from our grandkids, and we \nare not going to say that we can't do this. There was no inflation \nexcept in health care. And when you look at it, there is actually a \nnegative number, negative inflation. There was actually deflation. \nThings roughly cost six-tenths of 1 percent less this year than last, \nand those are the basic necessities of life. And because we don't have \nthe courage to face the situations in front of us, we are just going to \nkick it down the road. That is what is wrong. That is why we find \nourselves with $12 trillion worth of debt, almost now $100 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities. That is why we find that a child born today has \n$400,000 in unfunded liabilities, and by the time they are 20 years of \nage they will be responsible for $800,000 worth of debt on them that \nthey incurred for us.\n  So I will make two final points. The heritage of this country is for \none generation to sacrifice for the next. This generation in this body \nhas turned that upside down, and we are saying to the next two \ngenerations: You sacrifice for us because we don't have the courage to \nmake the hard choices. And the hard choices have to be made. We are on \nan absolutely unsustainable course in this country financially. Read \nthe papers. The dollar is under assault. We are dependent on foreign \ncountries to finance our debt. Our debt will double in the next 5 years \nand triple in the next 10. And now we are playing the political game of \nnot having a small percentage of seniors having an increase in cost, \nand mainly those who can afford it.\n  So the question is, take $2.8 billion from our grandkids, one way or \nthe other, and protect that 5 percent of the seniors, including Bill \nGates and every other very rich person in this country, or do as the \nHonorable Steny Hoyer said, the majority leader for the Democrats in \nthe House:\n\n       I don't know how many of you can go to sleep at night \n     worried about whether Ross Perot can pay his premium, but \n     this will freeze Ross Perot's basic premium from going up. I \n     think that as well meaning as this legislation is, it's not \n     about poor seniors, it's about politics.\n\n  I recognize this can come back and we will do it, but at this time, \nfor the good of our country, to restore the heritage of our country, \nMadam President, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I regret that the Senator from Oklahoma \nfeels constrained to object. I will continue to work to see that \nMedicare beneficiaries are not unfairly harmed. I must also say that \nthis is not for the Ross Perots of the world. There are due eligibles--\nthere are many people who are very poor who will be harmed unless this \nlegislation is passed. I might also say that this bill is paid for, \ndespite the implications to the contrary. It is paid for with funds \nalready set aside at an earlier date in the Medicare Improvement Fund--\na fund that was set up for just such purposes. So despite the \nimplications about the future children and grandchildren, the fact is, \nthis is already paid for in funds previously set aside.\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Hippocrates once said: ``A wise man \nshould consider that health is the greatest of human blessings.''\n  Every day we see the real-world consequences for Americans who have \nbeen deprived of that blessing. A Harvard study found that every year \nin America, lack of health coverage leads to 45,000 deaths. People \nwithout health insurance have a 40 percent higher risk of death than \nthose with private health insurance. No one should die because they \ncannot afford health care.\n  Every 30 seconds another American files for bankruptcy after a \nserious health problem--every 30 seconds. Every year, about 1.5 million \nfamilies lose their homes to foreclosure. Why? Because of unaffordable \nmedical costs. No one should go bankrupt because they get sick. A \nKaiser Family Foundation survey found that health care coverage for the \naverage family now costs more than $13,000 a year. If current trends \ncontinue, by the year 2019, 10 years from now, the average family plan \nwill cost more than $30,000 a year.\n  No one should have to live in fear of financial ruin from crushing \ninsurance premiums. Americans are looking for commonsense solutions to \nthese problems. Americans want a balanced plan that takes the best \nideas from both sides. Americans want their leaders to work together to \ncraft a health care package that will get 60 votes it needs to pass.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has just given us their analysis of \nlegislation we put together in the Finance Committee and it shows that \nour bill reduces the deficit by $81 billion over 10 years. That is a \nreduction in the Federal deficit of $81 billion. CBO also says the \nlegislation out of the Finance Committee continues to reduce the \ndeficit in the outyears; that is, the years after 10 years, the second \n10 years, and the legislation increases coverage from 83 percent to 94 \npercent, so 94 percent of Americans will have health insurance.\n  For 2 years now, that is exactly what we have been doing in the \nFinance Committee--working to get that result. Over the last 2 years, \nthe Finance Committee has held 20 hearings on health care reform. Last \nJune we held a health care summit at the Library of Congress. The \ncommittee held three roundtable discussions with experts on each side \nof the area, especially on the three major areas of reform. We held \nroundtables on how health care is delivered, on coverage--that is \ninsurance coverage--and on how to pay for health care. In connection \nwith each roundtable--we had experts around the table, asked lots of \nquestions, the experts just balanced--experts were not chosen for a \ncertain point of view but just to get the facts. The committee put out \na detailed option paper after those roundtables and we then held three \nwalk-throughs to hash out those options--walk-throughs to see what \nmight make sense after those walk-throughs.\n  Six members of the Finance Committee--three Republicans and three \nDemocrats--then had meetings. They held 31 meetings to try to come to a \nconsensus. We held exhaustive meetings and met for more than 61 hours. \nWe went the extra mile.\n  I might say if a fly on the wall were to watch those six meet, three \nRepublicans and three Democrats, I think Americans would be very proud. \nThis was hard work. It was not ideologically driven. It was based on \nthe facts. We asked questions of experts, actuaries were objective--of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Tax--a very \nsolid effort to try to find out how the various parts would be put \ntogether in a balanced and fair way.\n  I can say the Finance Committee has held the most open and exhaustive \nconsideration of this health care proposal. I put out the starting \npoint and posted it on the Web on September 16. That was nearly a week \nbefore we started our markups, a full week notice before we started our \nmarkup.\n  In a first for the committee, we posted every amendment, all 564 of \nthem, on the Web. We had never done that before, all posted, all \navailable to the world. The committee has held a thorough markup, and I \nknow the present occupant of the chair can attest to that. When the \ncommittee reconvenes to report the bill, the committee will have met \nfor 8 days. Many of those were long days, often running past 10 o'clock \nat night. In fact, last Thursday we worked until 2 o'clock in the \nmorning. It has been more than 22 years since the Finance Committee met \nfor 8 days on a single bill. In the committee's consideration, Senators \noffered and the committee considered about 135 amendments. The \ncommittee conducted 79 rollcall votes and the committee adopted 41 \namendments.\n  The result is a balanced, commonsense plan that takes the best ideas \nfrom both sides. It is a plan that essentially implements President \nObama's vision to improve America's health care and it is a plan \ndesigned to get the 60 votes it needs to pass. We have just received \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office the numbers that we need to have \nto proceed to the next step. The CBO says we reduce the deficit by $81 \nbillion in the first 10 years and the legislation that will be reported \nout of the committee soon will reduce the deficit further in the next \n10 years, and it increases coverage to 94 percent.\n  I am confident that after Senators have had a opportunity to review \nthe CBO numbers the Finance Committee will report the bill. Then we on \nthe Finance Committee expect to work together with the HELP Committee \nto meld our two bills together. Our colleagues on the HELP Committee \nhave done some wonderful things, especially in the area of prevention, \nworkforce, and quality. We look forward to bringing together the best \nof both bills.\n  Then the majority leader will offer the combined bill as an amendment \non the floor and I expect we will have a full and vigorous debate here \nin the Senate. I am proud of our work.\n  All Americans should have access to affordable, quality health care \ncoverage. Our bill would raise the share of Americans with insurance \ncoverage from about 83 percent currently to 94 percent, and our bill \nwould deliver coverage to millions through new insurance exchanges and \nto millions more through Medicaid--that is the Finance Committee bill I \nam discussing.\n  Our bill would dramatically increase prevention and wellness, will \nbegin shifting health care delivery to the quality of care provided--\nnot the quantity of services rendered but the quality of care provided. \nIt is so important. This is transformative. This is game changing. When \nwe look back several years from now we are going to see this is \nprobably one of the more important items in this legislation because it \nwill begin American health care to focus on where it should be, on \nquality and teamwork and the patient, more than today, where it is \nfocused on quantity under the fee-for-service system. This is clearly \nthe major, most important part, I think, when we look back at this bill \n5, 6, 8, 10 years from now.\n\n  The bill also will lower prescription drug costs dramatically for \nseniors--no small point.\n  Our bill would reform the insurance market. It would protect those \nwith preexisting conditions. It would prevent insurance companies from \ndiscriminating and capping coverage. And it would require insurance \ncompanies to renew policies as long as policyholders pay their \npremiums. No longer would insurance companies be able to drop coverage \nwhen people get sick. These reforms would give Americans real savings.\n  Under the Finance Committee bill, everyone making less than 133 \npercent of poverty would receive health coverage through Medicaid. Our \nplan will provide tax credits to help low-and middle-income families \nbuy private insurance coverage. These tax credits would mean that our \nbill would deliver tax cuts for those whom it affects. Overall taxes \nwould go down for people affected by this bill. These tax credits would \nhelp make insurance more affordable.\n  Some have made some pretty outrageous claims about our bill. Some \nfolks frankly have said some whoppers. Let me take a few minutes to \nbust some of those myths.\n  Myth No. 1. Some say our bill cuts benefits for seniors. That is \nfalse. Nobody cares more about maintaining Medicare than I do. Medicare \nbenefits will not be reduced under our bill. Seniors will get the same \nlevel of benefits they receive today. In fact, seniors have a lot to \ngain from health care reform by lower prescription drug costs\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\nand more free preventive care such as mammograms and colonoscopies. \nPlus our bill takes the long view to help preserve the life of the \nMedicare Program. Our bill puts the Medicare Program on sounder \nfinancial footing. Our bill will remove from a system that pays for \nvolume to one that pays for value. It would improve Medicare solvency \nby reforming the way Medicare delivers health care.\n  Don't just take my word for it. Don't just take President Obama's \nword for it. Go to the AARP Web site and see what they say. AARP is \nprobably one of the greatest advocates for seniors. This is what AARP \nsays:\n\n       Myth: Health care reform will hurt Medicare.\n       Fact: None of the health care reform proposals being \n     considered by Congress would cut Medicare benefits or \n     increase your out-of-pocket costs for Medicare services.\n\n  That is the conclusion of AARP in their letter to seniors.\n  Myth No. 2. Some say our bill will lead to rationing because we \nencourage comparative research. That, too, is false. The Institute of \nMedicine--MedPAC, that is the bipartisan group, nonpartisan group that \nadvises Congress on Medicare payments--and former CMS administrators \nhave all recommended that Congress invest in research to compare what \nworks and what doesn't work in medicine. Groups such as the American \nMedical Association and the American Health Association support this \nidea.\n  Our bill would set up a nonprofit institute to provide for this \n``comparative effectiveness research.'' The goal is better evidence, \nunbiased information that doctors and patients can use to make better \nhealth care decisions. Comparative effectiveness research is about \ngiving doctors and patients the best information available on what \nworks so they can decide, the doctors can decide in consultation with \ntheir patients, as to what procedure, what drug, makes most sense and \nwhat doesn't.\n  If one treatment works far better than another, then doctors and \npatients have a right to know. That is what our bill tries to do, it \ntries to foster the kind of commonsense research that can get better \ninformation in the hands of doctors and patients.\n  Nothing in our bill would ration care--nothing. The new institute \ncould not make coverage decisions or issue medical guidelines. And our \nbill would prevent the HHS Secretary from using the research to ration \ncare in any way. The Secretary could never use the evidence to \ndiscriminate against individuals based on age, disability, terminal \nillness, or their preferences between length of life and quality of \nlife.\n  Calling this rationing only supports a delivery system that is pro-\nwaste and antipatient education. That is what opponents will end up \ndoing. That is the effect of it. That is not the type of care people \ndeserve. They deserve the information that comparative effectiveness \nresearch produces to help them make informed health care decisions.\n  Myth No. 3. Some say our bill will cause premiums to go up. That, \ntoo, is false. There are a lot of things in our bill that would cause \npremiums to go down. Our bill would cut out fraud, waste, and abuse in \nour health care system. That is going to help. Our bill would spread \ninsurance risk through a much broader population, including younger, \nhealthier people. That would clearly help. And our bill would help to \neliminate the cost of uncompensated care, which results in more than \n$1,000 in additional premium costs each year for American families. The \neffects of open competition in our new insurance exchange should bring \npremiums down as well.\n  CBO has said there are a lot of factors in whether premiums go up or \ndown and, frankly, they punted on a lot of those factors. But in the \none part of premium costs about which they did make a projection, CBO \nsaid that premiums would go down. In a September 22 letter CBO said:\n\n       CBO currently estimates that about 23 percent of premiums \n     for policies that are purchased in nongroup market under \n     current law go toward administrative costs and overhead.\n\n  About 23 percent of premiums for policies goes toward administrative \ncosts and overhead. CBO goes on to say:\n\n       Under the proposal, that share would be reduced to 4 or 5 \n     percentage points.\n\n  So if 23 percent of costs are administrative overhead under the \nlegislation the committee reported out, that should be reduced by 4 or \n5 percentage points. That is lower costs, administrative costs, which \nshould result in lower premiums.\n  Myth No. 4. Some say you will not be able to keep your insurance. \nThat, too, is false. Nothing in our bill would take people's insurance \naway from them. No one would be forced into a particular plan. This is \nthe central feature of the way we have gone about health care reform. \nWe have not tried to change the employer-based system, a system \nAmericans know and understand. We improve upon it, make it work a lot \nbetter. We have not tried to fix something that is not broken. We have \nan employer-based system and it is very important we improve upon it, \nnot eliminate it.\n  Some who do not share our best interests assert that cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage will cause some plans no longer to be offered. We do bring \nthe government's subsidies to Medicare Advantage more in line with the \ngovernment's own commitment to Medicare, but our bill would not cut \nbenefits under Medicare Advantage. Rather, it would cut out waste in \nthe system to ensure that Medicare is sustainable for years to come.\n  Even after the cost of marketing and delivering benefits and after \nmaking a profit, insurance companies are paid about 14 percent more, on \naverage, under Medicare Advantage than under traditional Medicare. \nInsurance companies pad their pocket with those subsidies. Our bill \nwould end those subsidies for insurance companies.\n  If insurance plans want to pass cuts along to seniors instead of \nreducing their huge profits, that is up to them. In a competitive \nmarket, it will be hard for plans that do that to keep their customers.\n  Yes, under our bill Medicare Advantage plans will have to compete in \nthe free market. But that has been true of insurance companies \ngenerally for as long as there has been insurance. It is true that we \nin our bill do not guarantee that the government will keep each and \nevery insurance company in business. We should not and we do not, in \nour bill, guarantee that each and every insurance plan will continue to \nbe offered. Those are business decisions. Those are decisions for the \nprivate sector. And that is where we leave it.\n  It is absurd to say that people will not be able to keep their \ninsurance because the government is going to trim back wasteful \nsubsidies. That is a pretty absurd statement.\n  Myth No. 5. Some stated our bill will raise taxes. That is false. In \nfact, our bill is a tax cut. Our bill will cut taxes for millions of \nAmericans. When fully phased in, our bill will cut taxes by tens of \nbillions of dollars every year. Let me restate that. When fully phased \nin, our bill will cut taxes by tens of billions of dollars every year. \nAnd millions of Americans will be able to use those tax cuts to buy \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  Myth No. 6. Some say that a high-cost premium excise tax will raise \ntaxes on working families. That too is false. The bill levies the high-\ncost premium excise tax on the insurance companies. It will put \ndownward pressure on insurance company profits. And it will put \npressure on insurance companies to offer more efficient insurance \nplans.\n  In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation tells us that much of the \nrevenue that the high-cost premium excise tax brings in is because \nemployers will give workers raises. People will avoid insurance plans \nwith high-cost premiums, and as a result employers will raise workers' \nsalaries with the money they save. That is what the Joint Committee on \nTaxation predicts will happen. That is what they say over and over \nagain in publicly given testimony.\n  Finally, the biggest myth of all, myth No. 7. Some say our bill is a \ngovernment takeover of health care. That is so false. We have built our \nplan on the exchange marketplace that allows choice among private \nhealth insurance company products, choice among private health \ninsurance products.\n  People will be able to choose their own plan. They can choose their \nown plans among private options. Our bill does not include a public \noption. We did not include an employer mandate.\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nAnd we pay for every cent. This is a uniquely American solution. We are \nnot Canada. We are not Britain. We are America. This is a balance. We \nhave a tradition of balance between public and private. This \nlegislation accomplished that.\n  We do not buy into government-only solutions in America, but we do \nbelieve in rules of the road. Our bill provides a balanced solution. \nAnd CBO says we do so in a balanced way.\n  Soon it will come down to the Senate. My colleagues, this will be our \nopportunity to make history. Think of it. Our actions here will \ndetermine whether we will extend the blessings of better health care to \nmore Americans.\n  Ours is a balanced plan that can pass the Senate. Our bill should win \nthe support of Republicans and Democrats alike. Now the choice is up to \nSenators.\n  Hippocrates said that ``health is the greatest of human blessings.'' \nBut too many Americans are being deprived of that blessing. Let us \nenact this balanced, commonsense plan to improve health care. Let us \nreform the health care system to control costs and premiums. And let us \nextend the blessings of health care coverage to all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that we call up amendment No. 2393.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2393.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Prohibiting use of funds to fund the Association of Community \n                 Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       On page 203, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 5__.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be distributed to the Association of Community \n     Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) or its subsidiaries.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I rise to talk about an amendment that should come as no \nsurprise to my colleagues. The amendment is simple and straightforward. \nIt is an amendment I have offered on a number of occasions that has \nbeen approved by this body. It prohibits any Federal funds from going \nto ACORN or any of its subsidiaries.\n  This amendment I have offered today was offered on three prior \nappropriations bills. Each time my amendment has gained significant \nbipartisan support: 83 votes the first time, 85 votes the second time, \nand by voice vote a third time. It is important we continue to take \nthis action to prohibit funding in each of the remaining appropriations \nbills because ACORN is still eligible to receive Federal dollars from \nmany other sources.\n  For any of my colleagues who might put forward the argument that \nACORN typically does not get funding from the CJS appropriations bill, \nwe can't be so sure. The fact is, ACORN has the opportunity to get \nmoney from various Federal pots that we could never have envisioned. \nFor example, a public notice was sent out by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity on October 2 of this year announcing that ACORN was the \nrecipient of an almost $1 million grant for funds typically reserved \nfor fire departments. Remarkable. Who knew that ACORN specialized in \nfirefighting? I never would have thought ACORN could win a grant \ndesigned for fire safety and prevention. But, lo and behold, that is \nwhat happened only a few days ago. This happened after the Senate took \nseveral stands against providing Federal funds to this group and after \nHouse action.\n  Until a full government investigation is launched and completed into \nACORN, no taxpayer money should be used to fund their activities. I \nurge all colleagues to once again support my amendment. The identical \namendment has passed twice on strong bipartisan votes with over 80 \nSenators voting in favor, and the third time it passed by a voice vote. \nWhere Senators stand on this issue is now well known.\n  For the record, I respectfully suggest that we can agree upon this \namendment by voice vote at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2630\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up Vitter amendment No. 2630.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2630.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used in contravention of section \n 642(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n                              Act of 1996)\n\n     At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n     Sec. __.  None of the amounts made available in this title \n     under the heading ``Community Oriented Policing Services'' \n     may be used in contravention of section 642(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I will read the amendment to explain what \nit is about:\n\n       None of the amounts made available in this title under the \n     heading ``COMMUNITY ORIENTED POLICING SERVICES'' may be used \n     in contravention of section 6429(a) of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.\n\n  That is the entire amendment. What does that mean? That Illegal \nImmigration Reform Act is about the mandate that local government has \nto fully cooperate with Federal immigration officials with regard to \nimmigration enforcement. It doesn't mean that local governments become \nimmigration agents, that they have the affirmative responsibility to do \nall of that work for the proper Federal authorities. It does mean that \nwhen they come across illegal immigrants and arrest them, for instance, \nfor local law violations, they are dutybound under Federal law to \nproperly inform Federal authorities.\n  The problem is, in several select jurisdictions, so-called sanctuary \ncities, they have made the affirmative public statement and decision \nthat they are not going to do that. They will not comply with Federal \nlaw. They are going to ignore Federal immigration law, and they are not \ngoing to cooperate in any way with Federal immigration enforcement \nauthorities.\n  We can debate whether that is good policy or bad, but we don't really \nneed to get to that level of debate because it is present Federal law \nthat cooperation must be extended by local police agencies and local \ngovernments. These sanctuary cities--it is beyond debate--are violating \ncurrent Federal law. They are taking Federal law and saying: Too bad. \nWe are not going to have anything to do with it. We will violate \nFederal law. We will not cooperate in any way with Federal immigration \nenforcement.\n  My amendment says if you violate Federal law, you will have to live \nby some consequences. Specifically, you will lose COPS funding for your \nspecific jurisdiction. If you want to do that, if you want to flaunt \nthe law, there is going to be a meaningful consequence. You will lose \ncommunity policing grants.\n  I believe this is reasonable and necessary because there are a number \nof sanctuary cities that have made the affirmative decision that they \nare going\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nto flaunt and ignore and violate Federal law, have nothing to do with \nproper enforcement of Federal immigration law and the necessary \ncooperation between those Federal agencies and local law enforcement.\n  Nobody wants to make local law enforcement immigration enforcement. \nNobody wants to place on them some affirmative duty to do the work of \nFederal immigration offices, which is significant. We are not trying to \nplace that additional burden or some unfunded mandate on them. But \nexisting Federal law does say they need to cooperate with Federal \nimmigration enforcement. They can't have an affirmative policy that \nwhen they arrest, for a local charge, somebody who is in the country \nillegally, they forget about that, turn their eye to it, and never \nnotify Federal authorities.\n  Tragically, this bad sanctuary city policy has had tragic results. I \nwill mention one such instance. This involved an illegal alien, Edwin \nRamos, who is currently being charged with three counts of murder in \nSan Francisco. That is because he shot and killed Tony Bologna, 48, and \nhis two sons--Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16--after they were driving \nhome from a family picnic last June. Apparently, this dispute started \nafter Tony Bologna blocked the gunman's car from completing a left \nturn. That was enough to merit getting out of the car and unloading a \nsemiautomatic weapon on Bologna's vehicle, killing him and both of his \nsons.\n  Ramos is a native of El Salvador. He was in the country illegally. He \nis a reputed member of the gang MS-13, and had previously been found \nguilty of two felonies as a juvenile; not exactly misdemeanors either, \na gang-related assault and the attempted robbery of a pregnant woman. \nRamos had been arrested at least three times before this triple murder. \nHe was living illegally in the United States. There was no \ndocumentation of legal status, no temporary visa status.\n  So why wasn't he deported when he was arrested, particularly on \nviolent charges? Because San Francisco is a sanctuary city. They have \nmade the affirmative determination that established a policy of \nbreaking Federal law and not having anything to do with immigration \nenforcement. That led directly to a triple murder of three innocent \nAmerican citizens. This is one tragic story. There are others.\n  The bottom line is, we have a Federal law that should prevent that. \nWe need that law enforced and lived by, by all local jurisdictions. The \nVitter amendment will put some reasonable teeth behind enforcement and \nsome meaningful consequence when local authorities choose to completely \nignore and violate Federal law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, reasonable \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will speak more on this amendment at a \nlater time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, NASA is at a very difficult crossroads \nright now in determining the future of human space flight, and I would \nlike to talk about that.\n  NASA is in the process of deciding where to put its full support and \nfunds--whether it should be behind the current Constellation Program or \nwhether it should change course and go in another direction.\n  The Augustine Commission has announced some recommendations and \ndescribed them both but leaves it up to NASA to make the decision as to \nwhere it will go. I am very concerned NASA will agree with those \nrecommendations that will relate to access to the International Space \nStation and will affect low-Earth orbit in these difficult budgetary \ntimes.\n  We have just finished the space station. So the time comes now to \ndecide how to use it to its greatest advantage. The space station was \nbuilt with the shuttle program, and it has always\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\nbeen understood that the space shuttle will be retired next year. After \nthat happens, we will be relying upon Russia to get our astronauts into \nspace.\n  The original plan was that once the shuttle was retired, the next \nvehicle to get us into space would be the Ares I. That is the pivotal \npoint where the decision has to be made: Shall we go ahead with Ares I?\n  I am very concerned that NASA may want to divert precious resources \nfrom the Ares I program in the hope that the commercial space industry \ncan fill the void. Well, it is disconcerting to me because we have a \nsuccessful track record of the Ares program but a less than desirable \nrecord of the commercial space industry. We have invested over 4 years \nand $6 billion in the Ares I and Orion programs, and it is on track.\n  Just last month, we had a successful ground test of the new Ares I \nrocket in Utah. Later this month, NASA will conduct the first flight \ntest--on track to deliver a safe, reliable rocket.\n  Changes in NASA's plan should only be made if alternatives are \navailable to provide significant advantages in cost, schedule, \nperformance, and safety. The program that is working should not be \ndropped unless those advantages are very clear, and as of now there are \nno credible alternatives. To me, it makes sense to stay committed to a \nprogram we have already invested billions of dollars in and which has \nmet its significant benchmarks.\n  Right now, the Ares I is the only credible solution we have for \ngetting crew and cargo services into space once the shuttle is retired. \nThe Ares I system came out of the Gehman report that followed the \nColumbia accident, recommending that the shuttle be replaced with a \nlaunch system that would maximize crew safety. Aries will achieve those \nstandards.\n  The system builds on an existing manufacturing infrastructure that \nbuilds on our strengths. We already have the industrial base to go \nahead with Ares. We do not have to invent anything new. We paid for the \nresearch. Why would we forego years of successful research and billions \nof dollars in the promise of an untested method of getting into space? \nWhy would we take the gamble? If it turns out the hope that the \ncommercial people could fill the void is wrong, we will have lost the \nindustrial base that preserves our existing alternative to the \ncommercial system.\n  What will NASA do then, if that which they might place their hopes in \nturns out to fail, and they have dismantled the program we now know \nworks? How much money would we save if we were confronted with that \nsituation a few years down the road? We risk losing the industrial base \nthat is paramount to American competitiveness.\n  I know I will be accused of being parochial because a good portion of \nthat industrial base is in my home State of Utah, but that does not \nlessen its significance or its competence.\n  The Ares program takes advantage of facilities and an already-trained \nworkforce that has made the most reliable rockets in the world, having \nflown and tested over 200 of these solid rocket motors. We are already \nseeing reductions in our manufacturing base in this circumstance in \nUtah. Just this last week, 550 more people who would be critical to \nNASA in maintaining that base have lost their jobs, and if we abandon \nthe Ares program, we could lose thousands more. Yes, I am interested \nbecause it is important to my State, but I am equally, if not more, \ninterested because I think it is important to the Nation not to take \nthis kind of gamble.\n\n  I seriously urge the administration to take a look at the bird they \nhave in their hand, the bird that has flown over 200 times \nsuccessfully, and not be too excited about the bird that may lie \nwaiting for them somewhere in the bush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Utah \nfor his remarks. We have essentially three space Senators on the \nfloor--the distinguished Senator from Florida, our Presiding Officer, \nwho has actually been an astronaut, and you can ask him if he wants to \ngo into space with the lowest bidder. I think there are certain things \nthat one can't pick who the lowest bidder will be.\n  I think there is much to be debated. We have the Augustine report, on \nwhich there has been a hearing, and our bill, the CJS bill, we fully \nfund the reliable transportation system that would be developed by our \ngovernment. If the President were to change that, that would be a new \ndirection and a new appropriation on which there would be tremendous \ndebate and discussion.\n  So I wish to assure the Senator from Utah and the Presiding Officer, \nwho often speaks for the brave men and women who go into space, that \nwhat the CJS bill does is fully fund, No. 1, what we need now to make \nsure our space shuttle is safe and fit for duty as it comes to the end \nin this decade of its usable service. Our No. 1 priority will always be \nthe safety of the astronauts, not the bottom line.\n  The second thing is that in our appropriations we disagreed with the \nHouse. We actually put money in the Federal checkbook to develop the \nnew programs, the new technologies for the next generation of reliable \nspace transportation vehicles, and it follows very much the framework \nthat the Senator from Utah has outlined.\n  So we look forward, once again, to working on our space program in a \nbipartisan way. One of the joys of chairing this committee is that when \nit comes to our National Space and Aeronautics Agency, we work on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  The Senator from Utah might be interested to know, when I first came \nto the Senate and went on the then VA-HUD Committee that funded NASA, \nthe ranking member was Jake Garn, your colleague. As we all recall with \nfondness, Senator Garn was himself also a Senator astronaut. I must say \nit was Senator Garn who--I was a Goddard gal; Goddard is in Maryland. \nBut space is about space, not about an individual State. Through his \nexcellent workmanship, his patience, his guidance, I came to know the \nspace program. Within 2 years, I happened to, with the retirement of \nSenator Proxmire, take over the committee. I could not have been an \neffective Senator had it not been for the wise guidance I received from \nJake Garn. We did it because we worked together.\n  So this Senator has a real fondness for the Senator from Utah \nspeaking about the space program. But I only want to reiterate how, \nwhen we work together, it is bipartisan, it is in the interests of our \ncountry, it is about the stars and the galaxies and the planets, but it \nis also about developing that new technology that creates the new jobs.\n  I am here sitting in a wheelchair wearing a space boot. I look like I \nam Sally Ride's advance woman. But it is a special device. Many \nmaterials were developed through our space program. It is an innovative \ntechnology, where you go beyond the outdated casts that neither \nexpanded nor contracted during the day that this one can do. So this \ntechnology externally protects me from, quite frankly, anybody treading \non me, if you can believe it, but it protects me. Internally, it has \nthe genius devices that can deal with either the contraction or the \nexpansion of your leg in the course of a day. All of that came out of \nour space program. So it is not only about Senator Barbara Mikulski and \nher space boot but all over we have been able to develop new medical \ndevices because of our space program: digital mammography, saving the \nlives of women; a space boot that makes sure that after you have had \nthe services of a talented and gifted surgeon, your leg is also \nprotected. So you better believe I am going to protect the space \nprogram as much as the space program helped protect my leg today. So I \nwanted to let the Senator know that.\n  We are going to be voting in about 5 minutes on a Vitter amendment. I \nknow there is another one that the Senator from Utah has cosponsored, \nwhich is going to be tomorrow. Right now, we are going to vote in a few \nminutes on sanctuary cities. I am going to yield the floor to the \nSenator from New Jersey, who is very knowledgeable on this topic.\n  I yield to Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland for yielding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2630\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:55 p.m. \nbe for\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\ndebate prior to a vote in relation to the Vitter amendment No. 2630, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form, and \nthat at 5:55 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Vitter \namendment No. 2630, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Vitter \namendment. This amendment is downright dangerous. It is dangerous to \nthreaten policing funds to cities such as New York, San Francisco, Los \nAngeles, Chicago, Washington, DC, and smaller towns across America that \nhave chosen to encourage their community members to report crime.\n  The Senate tabled this same amendment last year. The reason this body \nwas wise enough to defeat it last year was because we understood that \nsome of the toughest law enforcement officials in our country, from \nsheriffs to prosecutors, and a whole host of law enforcement officials \nin between, understand the cooperation of the communities essential in \nfighting crime. Senator Vitter's amendment would deny moneys to at \nleast 50 cities in a whole host of States represented by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  I want to solve the crime. I want to get the perpetrator. I want to \nconvict the person and put them in jail. I don't want the opportunity \nto go to waste because of some political statement having nothing to do \nwith the core issue of security in our communities. Do we want \nwitnesses to be able to come forward and provide essential, crucial eye \nwitness testimony about the crime or do we want them to hide in the \ndarkness and not talk to police because they are afraid of their \nimmigration status? I want to make sure a witness comes forth and \ntestifies against a perpetrator and has no fear to do so. That is why \nlocal police oppose this amendment.\n  The unwillingness of that person to come forward because of a fear \nmay lead to other crimes being committed by that same individual in the \nsame community; perhaps to a child who might be molested, to a person \nwho might be assaulted, to a family who might get robbed.\n  So instead of catching the perpetrator, we prefer to deny moneys to \ncommunities that have a view that community policing is in their best \ninterests and that means bringing the community in as part of that \neffort. These cities have made decisions across the landscape of this \ncountry--urban, suburban, and rural--to say we care more about \nprosecuting the crime and finding the criminal and having the witness \ncome forward to tell us all about that crime so we can stop that person \nfrom continuing to perpetrate crimes against other people in our \ncommunities than we care about the person's status. These cities have \ndecided they do not want a chilling effect to prevent people from \nreporting crime.\n  That is what tough law enforcement will tell you. Sheriffs will tell \nyou, prosecutors will tell you, police chiefs will tell you, and they \nwill tell you they want the community to participate in fighting crime. \nThat is why we should vote to table the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REVIEW AND AUDIT OF ACORN FEDERAL FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Review and Audit.--The Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall conduct a review and audit of Federal \n     funds received by the Association of Community Organizations \n     for Reform Now (referred to in this section as ``ACORN'') or \n     any subsidiary or affiliate of ACORN to determine--\n       (1) whether any Federal funds were misused and, if so, the \n     total amount of Federal funds involved and how such funds \n     were misused;\n       (2) what steps, if any, have been taken to recover any \n     Federal funds that were misused;\n       (3) what steps should be taken to prevent the misuse of any \n     Federal funds; and\n       (4) whether all necessary steps have been taken to prevent \n     the misuse of any Federal funds.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the results of the audit required \n     under subsection (a), along with recommendations for Federal \n     agency reforms.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment relates to an organization \nthat is controversial--an organization known as ACORN. We have seen \nvideos in which the employees of ACORN were alleged to have said \ndespicable things, and in fact, on those tapes, did say despicable \nthings. The employees in question have been fired by their \norganization, and ACORN is being investigated by several State and \nFederal agencies because of their misconduct and potential misuse of \ngovernment funds.\n  I am also troubled by the discoveries of voter registration fraud, \nand I am glad that ACORN reported those incidents to authorities. The \nemployees involved have also been fired by ACORN. The actions by those \nemployees were not tolerated, and should not be tolerated. They were \ninexcusable. Anyone who has broken the law should be held accountable \nand, if necessary, prosecuted.\n  ACORN deserves much of the criticism it has received for allowing \nthis type of behavior to happen. However, although ACORN was clearly \nwrong, we are seeing in Congress an effort to punish ACORN that goes \nbeyond any experience I can recall in the time I have been on Capitol \nHill. We have put ourselves--with some of the pending amendments--in \nthe position of prosecutor, judge, and jury.\n  Mr. President, I went to one of these old-fashioned law schools. We \nbelieved that first you have the trial, then you have the hanging. But, \nunfortunately, when it comes to this organization, there has been a \nsummary execution order issued before the trial. I think that is wrong. \nIn America, you have a trial before a hanging, no matter how guilty the \nparty may appear. And you don't necessarily penalize an entire \norganization because of the sins or crimes of a limited number of \nemployees. First, we should find out the facts.\n  I know ACORN is unpopular right now, and much of that scorn they \ndeserve, but ACORN has a number of affiliated organizations. \nIncidentally, they are not in Illinois. They do not operate in my \nState. It is my understanding they have been gone for several years. \nBut they have a number of affiliated organizations that would be \naffected by the approach which has been suggested, by an amendment \nwhich is pending on this legislation.\n  To my knowledge, we have not yet seen any review or analysis of \nwhether the misconduct was the work of a few employees or whether the \nentire organization and all of its affiliates should be held \nresponsible. There may well be entities affiliated with ACORN that are \nnot at fault and that provide essential services to low-income \ncommunities.\n  Let's get to the bottom line. Why has this organization been treated \ndifferently than others? Why has it been the focus of attention? This \norganization focuses on poor people in America. They have registered \nover 1 million voters, and I am sure most people believe those voters \nare going to vote in a certain political way. Folks on the other side \nof the political equation don't care for that--1 million voters voting \nagainst them. So they have been inspiring this effort against ACORN.\n  Also, over the years, ACORN has been involved in many different \nStates to improve minimum wages for poor employees--poor people who are \ntrying to get enough money to keep their families together. That \ndoesn't sit well with a number of businesses, and I am sure they have \nincreased the anger of a lot of people over their conduct. They have \nalso been involved in counseling people who are about to lose their \nhomes to foreclosures, how to avoid predatory lenders--banks that are \nunscrupulous. I am sure those banks don't care for ACORN either.\n  So they have made their share of enemies working with and standing up \nfor poor people across America. They have certainly made their share of \nmistakes. We saw that in videotapes, and we have seen it in other \ndisclosures. But Congress should not, without careful consideration, \npermanently deny assistance to the thousands of people and families who \nhave been receiving ACORN's legitimate legal help to avoid predatory \nlending and foreclosure because of the misconduct of a handful of \nemployees who have been terminated by ACORN.\n  That is why I am proposing that we get to the bottom of this by \nhaving a thorough investigation; that Congress direct the Government \nAccountability Office to review and report back to us within 180 days \non whether any Federal funds have been misused by ACORN or its \naffiliates; and, if so, in what amounts and in what ways.\n  This doesn't stop this administration from deciding not to use the \nservices of this organization when it comes to taking the census. The \nObama administration announced they were not going to use this \norganization. That is within their right to do. I am not questioning \nthat decision. But the efforts by Members on the Senate floor have gone \nfar beyond any agency's single decision. They have tried to blackball \nthis organization and say it shouldn't do any work of any kind in any \ncapacity before we have thoroughly investigated the charges that have \nbeen raised against it.\n  The report I have called for should also identify the steps necessary \nto correct any deficiencies, along with an assessment of whether all \nnecessary steps have been taken to prevent any future misuse of Federal \nfunds. The GAO will be able to conduct a government-wide review--not \njust one agency--looking at any funds ACORN or its affiliates have \nreceived from any Federal agency. It will be a complete and \ncomprehensive review and investigation.\n  I am not excusing ACORN or its employees for any misconduct. To the \ncontrary, I think they should be held accountable, particularly for the \nmisuse of any Federal funds, if it occurred. But if we get into the \nbusiness of passing bills and resolutions against unpopular people or \norganizations, this is a road we ought to carefully travel. There are a \nlot of companies and organizations out there that have received \ngovernment funding and that have had employees commit fraud or other \ndespicable acts.\n  I found it curious, the level of anger and the level of interest when \nit comes to ACORN. Yet when it turned out that Kellogg Brown & Root--a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton, which was a sole-source contractor during \nour war in Iraq--was found to have been involved in conduct that led to \nshoddy workmanship and which cost the life of an American soldier by \nelectrocution and endangered many others; when this same organization \nwas involved in supplying water supplies and sources to our troops that \nwere dangerous; when in fact there was evidence of sexual harassment, I \ndidn't see the same level of anger coming from the media or from my \ncolleagues on the floor of the Senate. No. But when it comes to ACORN, \nregistering poor people to vote, then we have to take action.\n  We need an approach that can stand the test of time and the test of \njustice. My approach is based on some pretty fundamental American \nprinciples, calling for this GAO study and investigation. First, \nindividuals should be held accountable for their actions. Second, \norganizations--and I might add corporations too--should be held \naccountable for the policies they set. Third, organizations and \ncorporations should not be permanently cut off based on the actions of \nindividual employees who violated the organizational policy and were \nfired.\n  There should be a process for addressing wrongs and moving forward \nwith\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\npolicies that will prevent future misdeeds. That isn't a new idea, it \nis a very old idea. It is the American system of justice. So let's let \nthe Government Accountability Office get to the bottom of this. Let's \nmake sure we have done our due diligence; have a thorough, complete, \nhonest and accurate, fair investigation before we pass laws that turn \nus into judges and juries.\n  The report I am calling for will provide us with the guidance we \nneed. Let's follow the facts. Let's not follow our passions. It is a \nclear call for accountability from the Government Accountability Office \nwhen it comes to this organization of ACORN. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a \nreport, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify that the information required by rule XLIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate related to congressionally \n     directed spending items has been identified in the committee \n     report which accompanies H.R. 2847 and that the required \n     information has been available on a publicly accessible \n     congressional website at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to speak on an amendment I have \nfiled with my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski.\n  This amendment will repeal a provision contained in the Commerce, \nJustice, and Science Appropriations bill each year since 2004, which \nhas prevented tribes in certain areas of Alaska--and only in Alaska--\nfrom receiving any Federal funds to support their programs. This rider \nwas added several years ago as part of a dispute over tribal \nsovereignty, but I join with Senator Murkowski to say to our colleagues \nthat whatever the merits of the past dispute, this provision is having \nreal and adverse impacts on the administration of justice in Alaska.\n  Perhaps no place is seeing the negative impacts of this policy quite \nas acutely as Sitka, AK. This provision is currently harming the \nefforts of the Sitka Tribe of Alaska to work with the judicial system \nof the State of Alaska, and everyone in that part of the State--Alaska \nNative or not--is paying the price.\n  The Sitka Tribe has been working with the State of Alaska's court \nsystem to create a collaborative effort to battle substance abuse in \ntheir community. Tribal leaders and local court officials created the \nTribal Youth Diversion Effort, TYDE, which currently takes on the \nnonviolent drug possession cases of both native and non-native minors, \nrather than forcing local youth to go through the State court system. \nThis program has reduced the caseload of the both the State courts and \ncity attorney. Perhaps even more importantly, the TYDE program provides \nthe youth with a comprehensive program to deal with substance abuse. It \nis a successful program, and both tribal leaders and local criminal \njustice officials would like the opportunity for the Sitka Tribe to \nreceive Federal funds to support and expand their important work.\n  Currently, because of this 2004 rider, the Sitka Tribe cannot receive \nany Department of Justice funding for their programs. I believe we \nshould do more to support local programs such as the TYDE in their \nefforts to prevent alcohol and drug abuse. This is a problem for \nAmerican youth wherever they live, but it is an especially devastating \ncircumstance for Alaska Natives. Tribal governments in the lower 48 do \nnot face similar restrictions, and along with my colleague Senator \nMurkowski, I respectfully request that my colleagues support this \nimportant amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10212-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today we remember our colleague and our \nfriend Senator Ted Kennedy. There are few people alive today whose \nlives have not been impacted by the work of Senator Kennedy.\n  A brilliant legislator, Senator Kennedy championed bipartisanship and \ncompromise to leave behind an incomparable record. In his 45 plus years \nin the U.S. Senate, he authored over 2,500 bills and several hundred \nbecame law. Today, people with disabilities cannot be discriminated \nagainst in the workplace because of Senator Kennedy. Women must be paid \nthe same as men for the same work because of Senator Kennedy. And low-\nincome children have access to health care because of Senator Kennedy.\n  Like his brothers before him, Senator Kennedy challenged young people \nacross America and around the world to devote their lives to something \nmore than just themselves and lead by example. Whether it was \nchampioning civil rights legislation in the 1960s, condemning apartheid \nin South Africa before it became politically popular to do so, \npromoting the need for early childhood education or advocating for \nhealth care, Senator Kennedy led the charge.\n  Senator Hubert Humphrey once said that the moral test of government \nis how it treats those in the dawn of life, our children, those in the \ntwilight of life, our older citizens, and those in the shadows of life, \npeople with disabilities, the homeless, the dispossessed. Senator \nKennedy took up the causes of these Americans as his own. The poor, the \npowerless and the forgotten lost an ever-faithful protector and their \ntireless advocate.\n  On a personal note, I recall in early 2007, during my first weeks in \nthe Senate, Senator Kennedy gave me and other freshman Senators floor \ntime to speak about increasing the minimum wage. In early 2009, when I \nwas named to the HELP Committee, Senator Kennedy called to welcome me \nto the committee and invited me to hold field hearings in Pennsylvania \non issues like health care and education. I will never forget his \ncourtesy and the respect he showed to fellow Senators.\n  In closing, I am reminded of the words Senator Kennedy spoke about \nMike Mansfield when the majority leader retired:\n\n       No one in this body personifies more nearly than Mike \n     Mansfield the ideal of the Senate. Wisdom, integrity, \n     compassion, fairness, humanity--these virtues are his daily \n     life. He inspired all of us, Democrat and Republican, by his \n     unequalled example. He could stretch this institution beyond \n     its ordinary ability, as easily as he could shame it for \n     failing to meet its responsibility.\n\n  The same can be said about Senator Kennedy. We will miss him in this \nChamber, but we will never forget the lessons he taught us or the \nlegacy he leaves behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10212-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10212-S10213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Paul E. Andersen\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SPC Paul E. Andersen from South Bend, IN. Paul was 49 years old \nwhen he lost his life on October 1, 2009, due to injuries sustained \nfrom indirect fire in Baghdad, Iraq. He was a member of the 855th \nQuartermaster Company, U.S. Army Reserve, South Bend.\n  Today, I join Paul's family and friends in mourning his death. He \nwill forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, and friend to \nmany. Paul is survived by his wife Linda, children, grandchildren, and \nextended family.\n  Paul joined the Army in 1984. In November of 2008, he began his \nsecond tour in Iraq. Paul was a Michiana native who grew up in Elkhart \nand graduated from Buchanan High School in 1979. For the past 8 years \nhe was living and working in South Bend. He loved his wife Linda deeply \nand returned home on leave this past August to celebrate their fifth \nwedding anniversary. Family members say he lived to be in the service \nand loved military life. Though he was scheduled to return from Iraq in \nearly November, Paul had expressed a strong desire to stay in Iraq for \nanother year. Just prior to his death, he had reenlisted for the next 6 \nyears. His family takes comfort in the idea that he died doing what he \nloved most.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nthe example Paul set as a soldier, father, and grandfather. Today and \nalways, he will be remembered by family, friends and fellow Hoosiers as \na true American hero, and we cherish the legacy of his service and his \nlife.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Paul E.

Mr. President, under paragraph 9 of rule XLIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, I am here by submitting a description of \nSenate amendment No. 2605 that was accepted by unanimous consent to \nH.R. 3326 as follows:\n  Item: Additional User Evaluation and System Study for Advanced \nTactical Laser (ATL)\n  Request Amount: $5.0M.\n  Requestor: Boeing Corporation\n  Address: Boeing--SVS, 4411 The 25 Way NE #350, Albuquerque, NM 87109-\n5858\n  Suggested Location of Performance (major portion of the work): \nAlbuquerque, NM.\n  Senate amendment No. 2605 proposes to allocate up to $5 million \nconsistent with the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report entitled \n``The Airborne Tactical Laser (ATL) Feasibility for Gunship \nOperations'' to conduct additional enhanced user evaluation of the ATL \nand enter into an agreement with a federally funded research and \ndevelopment center to conduct a system analysis of integrating solid \nstate laser systems onto C-130, B-1, and F-35 platforms for the purpose \nof close air support. Such system study shall estimate per unit costs \nof such laser systems as well costs to operate and maintain each \nplatform with the laser system.\n  Why Spending is in Interest to the Taxpayer: The Air Force Scientific \nAdvisory Board report entitled ``The Airborne Tactical Laser (ATL) \nFeasibility for Gunship Operations'' made a number of recommendations \nregarding the advanced tactical laser. In addition to phasing out the \nATL chemical laser system and transitioning to an electric laser \nsystem, the board recommended that additional enhanced user evaluations \ntake place of the integrated laser-gunship system so that the most data \npossible can be collected of the funds spent to date on operational \naspects of the tactical laser system regardless of laser \ncharacteristics. In addition, the board questioned the utility of \nplacing tactical laser systems on high-speed platforms such as the F-35 \nand B-1, which were not designed for low speed, long-loiter close air \nsupport missions and recommended a system study of the available \nplatforms to understand the cost per unit of integrating the laser onto \neach platform as well as long-term operations and maintenance costs \nwith each integrated system. Senate amendment No. 2605 carries out the \nrecommendations of the board to get the best benefit of the taxpayer's \ndollar spent to date and into the future on tactical laser systems \nunder development by the Air Force.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated \nOctober 7, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2009.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I wish to remember the life of an \nextraordinary woman. Belle Ackerman Lipman passed away at her home in \nMemphis, TN, on August 17, 2009, in the 100th year of her remarkable \nlife. A beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and \nfriend, Mrs. Lipman is a model for all of us who hope to live life \nfully and for all the years granted us.\n  A daughter of Romanian immigrants, Belle Ackerman was born in 1910 in \nPhiladelphia, where her parents owned a general store. Just five blocks \naway from the store lived young Mark Lipman, who would become the love \nof Belle's life. The businessman and his young wife moved not long \nafter their marriage to Little Rock, AR, where Mark saw new business \nopportunities, and then in 1958 to Memphis, TN. There, Belle Lipman \nbecame a pillar of the community. Her work in civic affairs was \nextensive. She was president of the Little Rock chapter of Hassadah, \nthe worldwide Jewish women's organization, among a host of endeavors in \ncharity, service and the arts.\n  But it is not those remarkable accomplishments alone that made Belle \nLipman such a special woman. As years passed, her zest for life, for \nnew experience, and to learn of new cultures grew apace. A lifelong \ninterest in travel made her one of the first American citizens to \ntravel to China after diplomatic relations with that nation were \nreestablished in 1979. Her travels took her to a hot-air balloon over \nthe plains of Kenya, the rivers of the Amazon, and the ancient cities \nof Peru. She rode the Orient Express at the age of 87. At 92, she \ncrossed the Arctic Circle. At 95, she visited the mountains of Tibet \nand a host of other places. At her 95th birthday party, she celebrated \nthe only way she knew how, with verve by dancing the Charleston.\n  Belle Lipman was a model--a model of how to live life to the fullest \nand how a thirst for new experiences can fill a lifetime. My wife \nBarbara and I send our condolences to her beloved children, her son Ira \nand her daughter Carol, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren. \nWe do so with the sure knowledge that the joy of Belle Lipman's life \nwill over time ease the pain of her passing, leaving the warmest of \nmemories to sustain family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10213-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10213-S10214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LOUISIANA WWII VETERANS\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 90 \nWorld War II veterans from all over Louisiana who traveled to \nWashington, DC, on September 26 to visit the various memorials and \nmonuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservice members.\n  Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, sponsored this \ntrip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring surviving \nWorld War II Louisiana veterans by giving them an opportunity to see \nthe memorials dedicated to their service. The veterans visited the \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima Memorials. They also \ntraveled to Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This was the first of three flights Louisiana HonorAir made to \nWashington, DC, this fall. It is the 18th flight to depart from \nLouisiana, which has sent more HonorAir flights than any other State to \nthe Nation's Capital.\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\n  World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs but was also a \nconflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 \nmillion people worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, \nand more than 400,000 American service members were slain during the \nlong war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in \nEurope is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also witnessed an \nunprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our \nmilitary on two distant fronts.\n  In Louisiana, there remain today about 30,000 living WWII veterans, \nand each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of \nfreedom over tyranny. This group had 25 veterans who served in the U.S. \nArmy, 19 in the Army Air Corps, 29 in the Navy, 11 in the Marine Corps, \n2 in the Merchant Marines, 2 in the Coast Guard, and 2 were Army \nnurses.\n  Our heroes, many of them from South Louisiana, trekked the world for \ntheir country. They fought in Germany, Holland, France, Italy, Africa, \nGuam, Bougainville, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, the Philippines, \nNew Guinea, Japan and Saipan. Their journeys included the invasions of \nNorth Africa, Sicily, and Normandy.\n  One of our Army Air Corps veterans was declared missing in action for \n58 days in Yugoslavia after bailing out of his aircraft. Another Army \nveteran fought bravely in the Battle of the Bulge, while an Army Air \nCorps veteran made the Bataan Death March and spent 5 years in prison \ncamps before being liberated on August 17, 1946.\n  One Navy veteran earned a Gold star, Bronze star, and Hazardous Award \nfor his service in the Pacific. An Army Air Corps veteran fought in \nEurope, Africa, and the Middle East where he received an Air Medal, \nthree oak leaf clusters, and a Distinguished Unit Badge for his \noutstanding service.\n  A Navy veteran earned seven campaign stars and was in Tokyo Bay the \nmorning of the Japanese surrender. Another veteran served as part of \nthe 101st Airborne, fighting in Holland, Bastogne, Alsace, Ruhr, and \nBerchesgarten.\n  I am also proud to acknowledge that of the 90 veterans who visited \nWashington this past weekend, 5 were women who served our country with \nhonor and distinction during World War II. Three brothers also made the \ntrip together.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 90 veterans, all \nLouisiana heroes, who visited Washington, and Louisiana HonorAir for \nmaking these trips a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10214-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING REED & REED, INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, today I congratulate the \ncity of Louisville, CO, for being named recently as the top place to \nlive in the Nation by Money Magazine. I know that Colorado is home to \nmany amazing towns, cities and communities. It would be nearly \nimpossible to choose which among them is the top place to live, but I \nam proud that Louisville received this prestigious honor.\n  Every 2 years, Money Magazine releases a ranking of cities under \n50,000 residents. In compiling these rankings, the editors consider \nfactors such as economic opportunity, schools, affordability of homes, \ncrime rates, and entertainment options for families. This year marks \nthe third consecutive time Louisville has made the list, ranking fifth \nin 2005 and third in 2007.\n  In addition to the usual factors, this year's survey had an added \ncomponent. People from around the nation said that the availability of \ngreat jobs was the most important factor to them when deciding where to \nlive. This does not come as a surprise to any of us, but makes \nLouisville's ranking all that much more impressive for Colorado. While \nLouisville has certainly seen the effects of the economic downturn, it \nhas been able to continue to support and attract cutting-edge \nbusinesses. ConocoPhillips is an example of just one business that has \nrecently decided to put down roots in Louisville, where it plans to \nbuild a renewable energy and new technologies research facility. The \nbusinesses located in Louisville's Tech Center continue be at the \nforefront of Colorado's high-tech development, and those located on \nLouisville's historic Main Street support jobs while continuing \ntraditions started generations ago.\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\n  But more than its ability to attract businesses and jobs, the heart \nof Louisville and what makes it the top place to live is its solid \ncommunity and commitment to the outdoors. Louisville supports a vibrant \nsummer farmers' market and Friday night Street Faire, which brings to \ntown musical acts from across the West. Earlier this summer, the annual \nLouisville Fourth of July celebration included the traditional \nfireworks show and a giveaway of 4,000 hot dogs and bratwursts cooked \nby the mayor and city council, part of a long-standing tradition. Money \nMagazine also remarked on Louisville's share of the legendary Colorado \nsunshine and beautiful open spaces. In a town of 18,000 residents, \nLouisville has over 2000 acres of open space, 26 parks and nearly 30 \nmiles of trails, most with panoramic views of the Front Range \nMountains.\n  I congratulate both Louisville and the town of Superior, CO, which \nearned a ranking of 13th on the list. We know that Coloradans are proud \nof their outstanding communities, and it is only appropriate that \nColorado is home to the ``Best Place to Live'' in the Nation. \nCongratulations again to the residents of Louisville.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10215-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10215-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10215-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10215-S10216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3663.

S. 1759. A bill to authorize certain transfers of water in the \nCentral Valley\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nProject, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Boxer to introduce the Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009.\n  The measure should reduce unnecessary delays in water transfers at a \ntime when Central Valley farmers have been hard hit by a 3-year \ndrought. It would allow new water transfers of roughly 250,000 to \n300,000 acre-feet of water per year, depending on the rainfall that \nyear.\n  Here is how the bill would work: it would grant new authority to the \nBureau of Reclamation to approve water transfers between sellers and \nbuyers in the San Joaquin Valley. The measure also would streamline \nenvironmental reviews for Central Valley water transfers by ensuring \nthat they occur on a programmatic basis, instead of project-by-project \nbasis as is current practice.\n  Here is why we need this bill: this past water year, South of Delta \nagriculture users received 10 percent of their contractual allocation \nfrom the Central Valley Project. At the same time others in the San \nJoaquin Valley, such as the Friant Division and the exchange \ncontractors, had a surplus of water and were willing to sell some of \ntheir water to Westlands Water District, where fields have been \nfallowed and communities have close to 40 percent unemployment--yet \nthere were serious obstacles to making those transfers happen.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill. It will address those \nobstacles.\n  Specifically, the bill will do three things to ease the drought \ncrisis:\n  First, it would authorize transfers within San Joaquin Valley between \nDivisions of the Central Valley Project and among contractors within a \nDivision by removing two of the biggest obstacles to these transfers.\n  Water users tell me that the Bureau of Reclamation has not allowed \ntransfers of water if the water could have been used for irrigation or \nstored, or if the total amount of water transferred was more than what \nhad been received on average the 3 years prior to 1992. These two \nconditions previously prevented a whole host of potential transfers of \nwater.\n  Neither of these restrictions is necessary for environmental reasons, \nand removal of these two obstacles alone could make up to 100,000 or \n150,000 acre-feet of water available for transfer to the communities \nmost in need, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  So, this bill would explicitly grant the Bureau the authority to \napprove these types of East-West transfers, as long as they qualify \nunder environmental regulations.\n  Second, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to facilitate \ntransfers from the Sacramento Valley to the San Joaquin Valley by doing \nprogrammatic consideration of all the environmental concerns, rather \nthan requiring individual review on each transfer as is current \npractice.\n  Water users and the Bureau of Reclamation estimate that this step \ncould facilitate up to 150,000 or 200,000 acre-feet of transfers each \nyear.\n  Third, the bill also requires the Bureau of Reclamation to prepare a \nreport and recommendations on how to facilitate transfers more \nefficiently and expeditiously, including transfers in all directions \nand between the state and federal projects.\n  The bill is supported by a great number of water users across the \nCentral Valley, including: Friant Water Users Authority; San Joaquin \nRiver Exchange Contractors Authority; Delta-Mendota Canal Authority; \nWestlands Water District; Metropolitan Water District; Glen Colusa \nIrrigation District; Northern California Water Association; Banta-\nCarbona Irrigation District; Tehama-Colusa Canal Authority; Association \nof California Water Agencies; Placer County Water Agency; Conaway \nPreservation Group; Reclamation District 2035; and San Luis Water \nDistrict.\n  Companion legislation is also being introduced today by \nRepresentatives Costa and Cardoza in the House of Representatives.\n  There is no question that the drought and federal pumping \nrestrictions have had huge impacts on Central Valley Agriculture.\n  Nearly 500,000 acres of fields have been fallowed. Fields of fruit \nand nut trees have been stumped and uprooted. Some farmers simply chose \nto forego planting their row crops at all.\n  The agricultural industry estimates that about $700 million in \nrevenues have been lost.\n  About 21,000 agriculture jobs have been lost, nearly all in San \nJoaquin Valley.\n  For example, Mendota unemployment is currently 37.4 percent.\n  Workers who once tended America's ``bread basket'' are now standing \nin bread lines.\n  The impacts are not limited to agriculture:\n  Urban areas like Los Angeles are imposing rate hikes for non-\nconserving households, limiting lawn irrigation, and other conservation \nmeasures.\n  Municipal industrial users south of Delta are restricted to 60 \npercent of their contractual allocation.\n  The truth is that this crisis has been building for some time--and \nthere are several causes to blame.\n  California's population is close to 40 million, but its water \ninfrastructure hasn't been updated in three decades.\n  Due to groundwater pumping, the Central Valley lost 60 million acre-\nfeet of groundwater since 1962.\n  This year, Federal agencies imposed pumping restrictions to protect \nendangered species--yet there is some misconception about the scope of \nthese restrictions.\n  In 2009, roughly 25 percent of delivery shortages for farms and water \nusers due to pumping restrictions, about 500,000 acre-feet.\n  The other 75 percent of the restrictions were due to lack of run-off, \nabout 1.6 million acre-feet.\n  So, the drought is largely to blame for California's water shortages.\n  Invasive and non-native species are also a threat. The non-native \nstriped bass, although a popular sport fish, are top predators on \nnative fish like the smelt.\n  Pollution remains a problem, despite water quality standards. Ammonia \ndischarge may be a problem from wastewater treatment discharge, and \ntoxic insecticides accumulate and contribute to the deterioration of \nthe ecosystem.\n  So, California's water crisis is a complicated issue that cannot be \nsimply solved by saying ``Turn on the Pumps.''\n  It is clear that we need solutions for the Delta, both long-term and \nshort-term.\n  I am working with my colleagues on both.\n  The bill we are introducing today will provide more flexibility in \nthe system, allowing water to flow more freely around the Central \nValley. Just this past water year, 600,000 acre feet were transferred \naround the Central Valley, and this bill will allow even more water to \nflow.\n  But transfers alone cannot provide the entire solution--they are \ncostly, and they are still constrained by the pumping restrictions.\n  So this legislation is just one of several steps we are taking to \nprovide timely relief to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  In the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, there is $10 million for \nthe construction of short term projects that could provide more water \nsupply or flexibility, including Two Gates and the Intertie.\n  We also provided funding for the science that will be relied on by \nthe Bay Delta Conservation Plan--our best long-term option to restore \nthe Delta and improve water supply.\n  We also included funding for water recycling projects, and are \nworking to authorize more projects to help communities develop local \nwater supplies based on groundwater and desalination.\n  Finally, there is $750,000 for the National Academy of Sciences \nreview of the two biological opinions that currently govern water flows \nin the Central Valley. The independent scientific study, announced by \nSecretaries Salazar and Locke last week, should be completed within six \nmonths.\n  The National Academy study will assess whether there are other ways \nto provide the same protections for endangered species, while supplying \nmore water to the drought-stricken Central Valley. And it will put to \nrest any lingering questions about whether pumping restrictions in the \nDelta are based on the best available science.\n  It is a critical step to moving forward with any near-term and long-\nterm solutions for the Delta.\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n  This bill we are introducing today is but one of several steps we are \ntaking to address the water crisis in California.\n  We look forward to an early hearing on this bill, and working with \nothers towards its passage and implementation. I thank Senator Bingaman \nfor his commitment to hold an early hearing on the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill and the letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

As \n     California's water supply challenges multiply, this \n     legislation can provide greater flexibility for management of \n     CVP water supplies. As you know, ACWA's 450 public agency \n     members are collectively responsible for 90 percent of the \n     water delivered in California for residential and \n     agricultural uses.\n       California's water supply situation is dire and worsening. \n     Three years of below average precipitation along with heavy \n     regulatory restrictions through the ESA and Biological \n     Opinions, have seriously diminished California's water \n     supplies. Under these conditions, it is essential that short \n     term actions, such as provided by your legislation to \n     flexibly enable water supplies to move across the San Joaquin \n     Valley, be pursued.\n       Again, thank you for introducing water transfer \n     legislation. ACWA looks forward to working with you to secure \n     its passage in an expedited manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Timothy Quinn,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 San Joaquin River\n\n\n                                              Water Authority,\n\n                                 San Joaquin, CA, October 5, 2009.\n     Re Support for Transfer Legislation for the Central Valley \n         Project.\n\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the San Joaquin River \n     Exchange Contractors Water Authority (Exchange Contractors), \n     we thank you for introducing transfer legislation for the \n     Central Valley Project (CVP) and we support your efforts and \n     this legislation as a means of providing greater flexibility \n     for management of CVP water supplies.\n       The diminished water deliveries to the CVP as a result of \n     various regulatory restrictions, including the most recent \n     delta smelt and salmon Biological Opinions and three years of \n     below average precipitation statewide, have, as you know, \n     created a desperate situation in the San Joaquin Valley.\n       While long-term solutions are being sought, numerous short \n     term efforts are needed to help bridge the water supply gap \n     and great flexibility, as provided in your legislation, to \n     move water supplies within the San Joaquin Valley would be a \n     useful tool.\n       The Exchange Contractors consist of four member agencies \n     serving over 240,000 acres in the San Joaquin Valley in \n     Fresno, Madera, Merced, and Stanislaus Counties.\n       We look forward to engaging in this effort and working \n     closely with you and your staff in advancing this legislation \n     and addressing California water issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Steve Chedester,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Friant Water Users Authority,\n\n                                     Lindsay, CA, October 1, 2009.\n     Subject SUPPORT for Transfer legislation for the Central \n         Valley Project.\n\n     Hon.

Water transfers are a critical tool for providing \n     water supplies for areas that are faced with chronic water \n     supply shortages. However, the approval process for many \n     transfers often distract from their usefulness. Your \n     legislation will bring important reform to existing transfer \n     authorization thus increasing the efficacy of this essential \n     water management tool.\n       As you are keenly aware, the chronic water supply shortages \n     impacting the area of the San Joaquin Valley served by the \n     Central Valley Project demands that water users in the \n     affected area rely on water transfers. Moreover, the need to \n     transfer water is often urgent and in response to climactic \n     conditions that are frequently sporadic and ephemeral. \n     Regrettably, bureaucratic process can unnecessarily thwart \n     successful execution of a transfer. The clarity your \n     legislation brings to existing authorizations will only \n     improve the capability of water managers throughout the State \n     to effectively respond to the ongoing crisis and put our \n     scant water resources to use even more efficiently.\n       The westside of the San Joaquin Valley is inarguably the \n     most transfer dependent region of the State. Your efforts to \n     address this important matter are greatly appreciated.

Water transfers are essential to \n     sound water management and often are time sensitive. Your \n     legislation will bring important reform to existing transfer \n     authorization thus increasing the efficacy of this essential \n     water management tool.\n       As you are keenly aware, coping with California's water \n     crisis and, in particular, the chronic water supply shortages \n     impacting the Central Valley Project demands utilization of \n     various best management practices including water transfers. \n     Moreover, the need to transfer water is often urgent and in \n     response to climactic conditions that are frequently sporadic \n     and ephemeral. Regrettably, bureaucratic process can \n     unnecessarily thwart successful execution of a transfer and \n     the best management of this all too precious resource. The \n     clarity your legislation brings to existing authorizations \n     will only improve the capability of water managers throughout \n     the State to effectively respond to the ongoing crisis and \n     put our scant water resources to use even more efficiently.\n       The Westside of the great San Joaquin Valley is inarguably \n     the most transfer dependent region of the State. Your efforts \n     to address this important matter as well as your vast \n     knowledge of and longstanding commitment to water resource \n     issues vital to the State are most deeply appreciated. If \n     there is anything I can do to be of further service to you in \n     this cause, please do not hesitate to call.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Daniel G Nelson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Water Transfer \nFacilitation Act of 2009. Senator Feinstein and I have introduced this \nlegislation to facilitate voluntary water transfers within the San \nJoaquin Valley.\n  Three years of below-average precipitation have restricted water \nsupplies for much of California. Drought conditions have particularly \naffected agricultural communities in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  As a result of these water shortages, more than 500,000 acres of \ncropland have been fallowed in the San Joaquin Valley, and some cities \non the west side of the Valley are facing nearly 40 percent \nunemployment.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have worked with Representatives Cardoza and \nCosta to identify measures to address these water shortages. We \nincluded a measure in the Energy and Water appropriations bill allowing \nvoluntary\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\nwater transfers between water users on the east and west side of the \nSan Joaquin Valley.\n  The final provision included in the conference report will allow \nthese transfers for a two-year trial period. We are now seeking to \nextend this provision permanently and to enable more water users to \nparticipate in these transfers.\n  In addition, our legislation directs the Department of the Interior \nto use a programmatic approach to environmental review for certain \ntypes of water transfers, helping to expedite them.\n  Finally, it requires the Department of the Interior to prepare a \nreport and recommendations on how to facilitate water transfers \nthroughout California, including between the State and Federal water \nprojects.\n  These water transfers are an important tool for improving flexibility \nin managing water supplies, providing a mechanism for getting water to \nthose communities who need it most. Preliminary estimates suggest that \nthis legislation may enable the transfer of as much as 250,000 to \n300,000 acre-feet of water per year to communities in need. This will \nprovide a crucial resource to agricultural communities in California \nthat lost 90 percent of their expected water allocations this year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and in the \nCalifornia delegation to advance this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10222-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 307--TO REQUIRE THAT ALL LEGISLATIVE MATTERS BE \nAVAILABLE AND FULLY SCORED BY CBO 72 HOURS BEFORE CONSIDERATION BY ANY \n SUBCOMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE OR ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Johanns, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nVitter, Mr. Thune, Mr. Risch, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Grassley: Mr. Wicker, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nChambliss, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Burr, \nMr. Corker, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Roberts) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 308\n\n       Whereas the number of runaway and homeless youth in the \n     United States is staggering, with studies suggesting that \n     between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 youth live on the streets \n     each year;\n       Whereas the problem of children who run away from home is \n     widespread, as youth between 12 and 17 years of age are at a \n     higher risk of homelessness than adults;\n       Whereas runaway youth are often expelled from their homes \n     by their families, discharged by State custodial systems \n     without adequate transition plans, separated from their \n     parents by death and divorce, or physically, sexually, and \n     emotionally abused at home;\n       Whereas runaway youth are often too poor to secure their \n     own basic needs and are ineligible or unable to access \n     adequate medical or mental health resources;\n       Whereas effective programs that provide support to runaway \n     youth and assist them in remaining at home with their \n     families can succeed through partnerships created among \n     families, community-based human service agencies, law \n     enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and \n     businesses;\n       Whereas preventing youth from running away from home and \n     supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family, \n     community, and national priority;\n       Whereas the future of the Nation is dependent on providing \n     opportunities for youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and \n     abilities necessary to develop into safe, healthy, and \n     productive adults;\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and its members \n     advocate on behalf of runaway and homeless youth and provide \n     an array of community-based support to address their critical \n     needs;\n       Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard provides crisis \n     intervention and referrals to reconnect runaway youth with \n     their families and link youth to local resources that provide \n     positive alternatives to running away from home; and\n       Whereas during the month of November, the National Network \n     for Youth and the National Runaway Switchboard are co-\n     sponsoring National Runaway Prevention Month, in order to \n     increase public awareness of the circumstances faced by youth \n     in high-risk situations and to address the need to provide \n     resources and support for safe, healthy, and productive \n     alternatives for at-risk youth, their families, and their \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and supports the goals \n     and ideals of National Runaway Prevention Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10222-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10222-S10223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 46--RECOGNIZING THE BENEFITS OF SERVICE-\nLEARNING AND EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF THE NATIONAL LEARN AND \n                            SERVE CHALLENGE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nFeingold, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bayh, and Mrs. Gillibrand) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\nwas referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 46\n\n       Whereas service-learning is a teaching method that enhances \n     academic learning by integrating classroom content with \n     relevant activities aimed at addressing identified needs in a \n     community or school;\n       Whereas service-learning has been used both in school and \n     community-based settings as a teaching strategy to enhance \n     learning by building on youth experiences, granting youth a \n     voice in learning, and making instructional goals and \n     objectives more relevant to youth;\n       Whereas service-learning addresses the dropout epidemic in \n     the United States by making education more ``hands-on'' and \n     relevant, and has been especially effective in addressing the \n     dropout epidemic with respect to disadvantaged youth;\n       Whereas service-learning is proven to provide the greatest \n     benefits to disadvantaged and at-risk youth by building self-\n     confidence, which often translates into overall academic and \n     personal success;\n       Whereas service-learning provides not only meaningful \n     experiences, but improves the quantity and quality of \n     interactions between youth and potential mentors in the \n     community;\n       Whereas service-learning empowers youth as actively engaged \n     learners, citizens, and contributors to the community;\n       Whereas youth engaged in service-learning provide critical \n     service to the community by addressing a variety of needs in \n     towns, cities, and States, including needs such as tutoring \n     young children, care of the elderly, community nutrition, \n     disaster relief, environmental stewardship, financial \n     education, and public safety;\n       Whereas far-reaching and diverse research shows that \n     service-learning enhances the academic, career, cognitive, \n     and civic development of students in kindergarten through \n     12th grade, and students at institutions of higher education;\n       Whereas service-learning strengthens and increases the \n     number of partnerships among institutions of higher \n     education, local schools, and communities, which strengthens \n     communities and improves academic learning;\n       Whereas service-learning programs allow a multitude of \n     skilled and enthusiastic college students to serve in the \n     communities surrounding their colleges;\n       Whereas service-learning programs engage students in \n     actively addressing and solving pressing community issues and \n     strengthen the ability of nonprofit organizations to meet \n     community needs;\n       Whereas Learn and Serve America, a program established \n     under subtitle B of title I of the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12521 et seq.), is the only \n     Federally funded program dedicated to service-learning and \n     engages more than 1,100,000 youth in service-learning each \n     year;\n       Whereas Learn and Serve America is a highly cost-effective \n     program, with an average cost of approximately $25 per \n     participant and leverage of $1 for every Federal dollar \n     invested;\n       Whereas the National Learn and Serve Challenge is an annual \n     event that, in 2009, will take place October 5 through \n     October 11; and\n       Whereas the National Learn and Serve Challenge spotlights \n     the value of service-learning to young people, schools, \n     college campuses, and communities, encourages others to \n     launch service-learning activities, and increases recognition \n     of Learn and Serve America: Now, therefore, be it:\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the benefits of service-learning, which \n     include--\n       (A) enriching and enhancing academic outcomes for youth;\n       (B) engaging youth in positive experiences in the \n     community; and\n       (C) encouraging youth to make more constructive choices \n     with regards to their lives;\n       (2) encourages schools, school districts, college campuses, \n     community-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, and \n     faith-based organizations to provide youth with more service-\n     learning opportunities; and\n       (3) expresses support for the goals of the National Learn \n     and Serve Challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10223-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2627.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Real time intelligence, surveillance, and \n     reconnaissance (ISR) is critical to our warfighters in \n     fighting the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\n       (2) Secretary of Defense Gates and the military leadership \n     of the United States have highlighted the importance of \n     collecting and disseminating critical intelligence and \n     battlefield information to our troops on the ground in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan.\n       (3) The Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Norton \n     Schwartz, has stated that the Air Force is ``all-in'' for the \n     joint fight.\n       (4) One of the most effective and heavily tasked \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets \n     operating today is the Air Force's E-8C Joint Surveillance \n     Target Attack Radar System, also known as Joint STARS.\n       (5) Commanders in the field rely on Joint STARS to give \n     them a long range view of the battlefield and detect moving \n     targets in all weather conditions as well as tactical support \n     to Brigade Combat Teams, Joint Tactical Air Controllers and \n     Special Operations Forces convoy overwatch.\n       (6) Joint STARS is a joint platform, flown by a mix of \n     active duty Air Force and Air National Guard personnel and \n     operated by a joint Army, Air Force, and Marine crew, \n     supporting missions for all the Armed Forces.\n       (7) With a limited number of airframes, Joint STARS has \n     flown over 55,000 combat hours and 900 sorties over Iraq and \n     Afghanistan and directly contributed to the discovery of \n     hundreds of Improvised Explosive Devices.\n       (8) The current engines greatly limit the performance of \n     Joint STARS aircraft and are the highest cause of maintenance \n     problems and mission aborts.\n       (9) There is no other current or programmed aircraft or \n     weapon system that can provide the detailed, broad-area \n     ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and airborne battle \n     management support for the warfighter that Joint STARS \n     provides.\n       (10) With the significant operational savings that new \n     engines will bring to the Joint STARS, re-engining Joint \n     STARS will pay for itself by 2017 due to reduced operations, \n     sustainment, and fuel costs.\n       (11) In December 2002, a JSTARS re-engining study \n     determined that re-engining provided significant benefits and \n     cost savings. However, delays in executing the re-engining \n     program continue to result in increased costs for the re-\n     engining effort.\n       (12) The budget request for the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 2010 included $205,000,000 in Aircraft \n     Procurement, Air Force, and $16,000,000 in Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Air Force for Joint STARS \n     re-engining.\n       (13) On September 22, 2009, the Department of Defense re-\n     affirmed their support for the President's Budget request for \n     Joint STARS re-engining.\n       (14) On September 30, 2009, the Undersecretary of Defense \n     (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) signed an \n     Acquisition Decision Memorandum directing that the Air Force \n     proceed with the Joint STARS re-engining effort, to include \n     expenditure of procurement and research, development, test, \n     and evaluation funds.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Funds for re-engining of the E-8C Joint Surveillance \n     Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) should be \n     appropriated in the correct appropriations accounts and in \n     the amounts required in fiscal year 2010 to execute the Joint \n     STARS Re-Engining System Design and Development Program; and\n       (2) the Air Force should proceed with currently planned \n     efforts to re-engine Joint STARS aircraft, to include \n     expending both procurement and research, development, test, \n     and evaluation funds.\n       Sec. 8109. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act and except as provided in subsection (b), any report \n     required to be submitted by a Federal agency or department to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of either the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives in this Act shall be posted on the \n     public website of that agency upon receipt by the committee.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a report if--\n       (1) the public posting of the report compromises national \n     security; or\n       (2) the report contains proprietary information.\n       Sec. 8110. (a) The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a \n     study on defense contracting fraud and submit a report \n     containing the findings of such study to the congressional \n     defense committees.\n       (b) The report required under subsection (a) shall \n     include--\n       (1) an assessment of the total value of Department of \n     Defense contracts entered into to with contractors that have \n     been indicted for, settled charges of, been fined by any \n     Federal department or agency for, or been convicted of fraud \n     in connection with any contract or other transaction entered \n     into with the Federal Government; and\n       (2) recommendations by the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Defense or other appropriate Department of \n     Defense official regarding how to penalize contractors \n     repeatedly involved in fraud in connection with contracts or \n     other transactions entered into with the Federal Government.\n       Sec. 8111.  Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title IV under the heading ``Research, \n     Development, Test, and Evaluation, Army'', $12,000,000 shall \n     be available for the peer-reviewed Gulf War Illness Research \n     Program of the Army run by Congressionally Directed Medical \n     Research Programs.\n       Sec. 8112. (a) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) All of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     sites, including the Nevada Test Site can play an effective \n     and essential role in developing and demonstrating--\n       (A) innovative and effective methods for treaty \n     verification and the detection of nuclear weapons and other \n     materials; and\n       (B) related threat reduction technologies; and\n       (2) the Administrator for Nuclear Security should expand \n     the mission of the Nevada Test Site to carry out the role \n     described in paragraph (1), including by--\n       (A) fully utilizing the inherent capabilities and uniquely \n     secure location of the Site;\n       (B) continuing to support the Nation's nuclear weapons \n     program and other national security programs; and\n       (C) renaming the Site to reflect the expanded mission of \n     the Site.\n       (b) Not later than one year after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Administrator for Nuclear Security shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a plan for \n     improving the infrastructure of the Nevada Test Site of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration and, if the \n     Administrator deems appropriate, all other sites under the \n     jurisdiction of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration--\n       (1) to fulfill the expanded mission of the Site described \n     in subsection (a); and\n       (2) to make the Site available to support the threat \n     reduction programs of the entire national security community, \n     including threat reduction programs of the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, \n     the Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies as \n     appropriate.\n       Sec. 8113.

TECHNICAL CORRECTION.\n\n       Section 5503(c) is amended by striking ``veterans' '' and \n     inserting ``veteran's''.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting on \nS. 728, the proposed ``Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2009.'' \nThis broad benefits package will help veterans young and old, as well \nas their survivors. The amended bill contains 6 titles and 28 \nprovisions that are designed to enhance compensation, housing, labor \nand education, burial, and insurance benefits for veterans. A full \nexplanation of the bill is available in the Committee's report \naccompanying this legislation, Senate Report 111-71.\n  I will highlight a few of the provisions that I have sponsored in the \nlegislation that is before us today. Before I begin, let me state that \nthe version before us today includes a manager's amendment that makes a \nslight modification on the version passed by the Committee. The \namendment's purpose is to pay for the bill's burial provisions by \nextending a mandatory offset currently in the underlying bill. The \namendment would also eliminate two contingent entitlement provisions in \nthe bill which are not paid for with mandatory funds. With this \namendment incorporated, this bill would save, rather than cost, the \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  Many disabled veterans find it difficult to obtain commercial life \ninsurance, often due to their service-connected injuries. This \nlegislation would improve the Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance \nprogram for totally disabled veterans, by providing the first increase \nin the maximum amount of supplemental insurance they can purchase \nthrough SDVI since 1992. If enacted, the maximum amount would increase \nfrom the current level of $20,000 to $30,000 for all eligible totally \ndisabled veterans.\n  This legislation would also increase the maximum amount of Veterans' \nMortgage Life Insurance that a disabled veteran may purchase. The VMLI \nprogram was established in 1971 and is available to those service-\nconnected disabled veterans who receive specially adapted housing \ngrants from VA. In the event of the veteran's death, his or her family \nis protected because the Department of Veterans Affairs will pay the \nbalance of the mortgage owed up to the maximum amount of insurance \npurchased.\n  In today's housing market where, according to the Federal Housing \nFinance Board, the average mortgage loan in the United States in May \n2009 was $221,200, the current maximum of $90,000 in VMLI insurance \nprotection is not adequate. This bill will increase the maximum amount \nof insurance that may be purchased under the VMLI program from the \ncurrent maximum of $90,000 to $150,000 and then, on January 1, 2012, \nfrom $150,000 to $200,000.\n  This benefits package also includes a provision that will expand \neligibility for retroactive benefits from traumatic injury protection \ncoverage under the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program, \ncommonly referred to as TSGLI. Section 1032 of Public Law 109-13, the \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War \non Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005, established traumatic injury \nprotection under the SGLI program. TSGLI went into effect on December \n1, 2005. Therefore, all insured servicemembers under SGLI from that \npoint forward are also insured under TSGLI and their injuries are \ncovered regardless of where they occur. In order to provide assistance \nto those servicemembers who suffered traumatic injuries on or between \nOctober 7, 2001, and November 30, 2005, retroactive TSGLI payments were \nauthorized under section 1032(c) of the Supplemental Appropriations Act \nto individuals whose qualifying losses were sustained ``as a direct \nresult of injuries incurred in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation \nIraqi Freedom.'' Under section 501(b) of Public Law 109-233, the \nVeterans' Housing Opportunity and Benefits Improvement Act of 2006, \nthis definition was amended to allow retroactive payments to \nindividuals whose qualifying losses were sustained ``as a direct result \nof a traumatic injury incurred in the theater of operations for \nOperation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.''\n  However, without corrective action, men and women who were \ntraumatically injured on or between October 7, 2001, and November 30, \n2005, but were not in the OIF or OEF theaters of operation, will \ncontinue to be denied the same retroactive payment given to their \nwounded comrades. This legislation would correct that inequity.\n  Importantly, this legislation will also relieve the burden on certain \ncombat veterans who seek to prove that their disabilities are service-\nconnected. The committee bill would direct VA to promulgate regulations \nthat direct how VA should generally consider lay evidence that is \nconsistent with the place, conditions, dangers, or hardships associated \nwith a particular veteran's military service. For example, in assessing \nlay testimony concerning a claimant's exposure to sub-freezing \nconditions, the regulation may acknowledge that lay evidence, such as \nweather reports or contemporaneous newspaper accounts of sub-freezing \nconditions, may provide corroboration of exposure to the cold when a \nservicemember was assigned to an area when sub-freezing conditions were \npresent. Another example would be in a claim alleging hearing loss or \ntinnitus. Although an individual's service record might not include \ndetails of exposure to improvised explosive devices the individual may \nhave been assigned to a particular unit at a particular location where \nlay evidence shows that the unit was repeatedly exposed to IEDs.\n  Currently, VA provides a special dependency and indemnity \ncompensation payment to a surviving spouse with one or more children \nunder the age of 18. However, these payments are not adjusted. This \nlegislation would provide automatic cost-of-living adjustments for \nthese payments.\n  For veterans whose injuries are so significant that employment is not \nan option, VA operates an independent living rehabilitation program to \nhelp them achieve a maximum level of independence in daily life. \nUnfortunately, under current law, the number of veterans who in any one \nyear can enroll in these programs is capped at 2,600. While I have \nheard from VA that this enrollment cap does not present any problem for \nthe effective conduct of the program, I remain concerned that the \neffect of the cap is to put downward pressure on VA's enrollment of \neligible veterans in this very important program. This is of particular \nconcern today, as veterans are returning from the current conflicts \nwith disabilities that may require extensive periods of rehabilitation \nand assistance in order to achieve independence in their daily lives. \nThis legislation would remove the 2,600 cap and allow all qualified \nveterans to enroll in VA's independent living program.\n  This legislation would provide many other benefits that I have not \nmentioned, such as improving the lives of veterans and troops with \nsevere burn injuries and clarifying veteran and reservists' employment \nrights. I thank the members of the Veterans' Affairs\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nCommittee and others in this Chamber who have worked hard to craft the \nmany provisions in this bill.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this important legislation that \nwould benefit many of this Nation's nearly 24 million veterans and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. BENNET.

Res. 308\n\n       Whereas the number of runaway and homeless youth in the \n     United States is staggering, with studies suggesting that \n     between 1,600,000 and 2,800,000 youth live on the streets \n     each year;\n       Whereas the problem of children who run away from home is \n     widespread, as youth between 12 and 17 years of age are at a \n     higher risk of homelessness than adults;\n       Whereas runaway youth are often expelled from their homes \n     by their families, discharged by State custodial systems \n     without adequate transition plans, separated from their \n     parents by death and divorce, or physically, sexually, and \n     emotionally abused at home;\n       Whereas runaway youth are often too poor to secure their \n     own basic needs and are ineligible or unable to access \n     adequate medical or mental health resources;\n       Whereas effective programs that provide support to runaway \n     youth and assist them in remaining at home with their \n     families can succeed through partnerships created among \n     families, community-based human service agencies, law \n     enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and \n     businesses;\n       Whereas preventing youth from running away from home and \n     supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family, \n     community, and national priority;\n       Whereas the future of the Nation is dependent on providing \n     opportunities for youth to acquire the knowledge, skills, and \n     abilities necessary to develop into safe, healthy, and \n     productive adults;\n       Whereas the National Network for Youth and its members \n     advocate on behalf of runaway and homeless youth and provide \n     an array of community-based support to address their critical \n     needs;\n       Whereas the National Runaway Switchboard provides crisis \n     intervention and referrals to reconnect runaway youth with \n     their families and link youth to local resources that provide \n     positive alternatives to running away from home; and\n       Whereas during the month of November, the National Network \n     for Youth and the National Runaway Switchboard are co-\n     sponsoring National Runaway Prevention Month, in order to \n     increase public awareness of the circumstances faced by youth \n     in high-risk situations and to address the need to provide \n     resources and support for safe, healthy, and productive \n     alternatives for at-risk youth, their families, and their \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and supports the goals \n     and ideals of National Runaway Prevention Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/07/senate-section/article/S10255-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. BENNET.
