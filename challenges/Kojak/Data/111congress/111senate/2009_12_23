Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10 a.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I just received this morning--and I am \nsure it is on the CBO Web site, the Congressional Budget Office Web \nsite--an analysis of the health care bill we are considering today. \nThat analysis is crystal-clear and confirms what CMS has told us; that \nis, the proponents of the legislation before us have been double-\ncounting--double-counting--the savings from Medicare, and as a result, \nit cannot be said that this bill is going to create a surplus in the \nTreasury but, in fact, will put us in a deficit.\n  I think every Member of this body needs to read this communication \nbefore they cast their vote. I know a lot of Members of the Senate who \nvoted for the bill did so under the belief that it would be deficit \nneutral. They have said so publicly. The President has repeatedly \nstated--and he did to the Joint Session of Congress--that not one dime \nwill be added to the national debt, and that is not so.\n  I will reveal what we were told by CBO this morning in their report. \nThis is what the CBO said to us, and it is very simple. It is actually \nstunning that we have been confused about this issue when we are \ntalking about hundreds of billions of dollars. It is absolutely an \namazing event that the U.S. Congress can't get its act together when we \nare talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  They say this:\n\n       The key point is that the savings to the HI trust fund--\n\n  Talking about Medicare--\n\n     under the PPACA--\n\n  That is the health care bill we are considering--\n\n     would be received by the government only once, so they cannot \n     be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the \n     same time, pay for current spending on other parts of the \n     legislation or on other programs.\n\n  That is exactly what this bill proposes to do.\n  Just 2 days ago at this press conference, the President said:\n\n       Medicare will be stronger and its solvency extended by \n     nearly a decade.\n\n  Then he goes on to say this:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office now reports that this bill \n     will reduce our deficit by $132 billion over the first \n     decade.\n\n  That is counting the money twice. It cannot be done. That is wrong, \nand it must not be allowed to occur.\n  Senator Gregg, the former chairman of the Budget Committee and \nranking Republican on that committee, proposed an amendment that said \nany savings in Medicare stay in Medicare, and our colleague who voted \nit down--Senator Harkin said: You have to vote it down--to our \ncolleagues in his speech on the floor--you have to vote it down because \nit will kill the bill. Why would it kill the bill? Because they are \nplanning to use the money both ways, and it cannot be done and ought \nnot to be done.\n  This is very much consistent, entirely consistent with the \ncommunication from the Chief Actuary, Richard S. Foster, of the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Foster laid it out. We should \nhave seen this back on December 10. It is really what piqued my \ninterest in this whole matter because I was wondering how this could be \ndone. It didn't make sense to me. And I read his letter, and he says \nthis:\n\n     The combination of lower Part A costs--\n\n  And that is Part A of Medicare, the hospital part--\n\n     and higher tax revenues results in a lower Federal deficit \n     based on budget accounting rules.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       However, trust fund accounting considers the same lower \n     expenditures and additional revenues as extending the \n     exhaustion date of the Part A trust fund.\n\n  They are running out of money, and if you cut the cost to Part A, you \nwould extend, according to the trust fund accounting, the lifetime of \nthe trust fund before it goes broke.\n  He adds:\n\n       In practice, the improved Part A financing cannot be \n     simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays.\n\n  Then he put in parentheses:\n\n     such as the covered expansions under the PPACA--\n\n  Which is the health care bill--\n\n     and to extend the trust fund, despite the appearance of this \n     result from the respective accounting conventions.\n\n  So there are two different accountings. The one from CMS says one \nthing. The one from CBO, which is a unified accounting, a different \nprocess of accounting for Federal expenditures--both say good \nthings. But both can't be accurate. Both Members say, CBO says you \ncan't count it twice, and CMS also says that.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and urge my colleagues to access this \ninformation on the CBO Web site and mine if they would like.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 2 p.m. will be controlled in alternating 1-hour blocks of time, \nwith the majority controlling the first hour.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it has been nearly 5 weeks since the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S13797]]\n\nleader moved to proceed to the health care reform bill before us today. \nAnd it has been more than 2 months since the Finance Committee reported \nits bill, a great deal of which is reflected in the bill before us \ntoday.\n  It has been 3 months since the Finance Committee publicly posted the \n564 amendments that Senators filed for consideration in the committee.\n  It has been 7 months since the Finance Committee convened three \nbipartisan roundtable discussions on each of the three major areas of \nreform: delivery system reform, insurance coverage, and options for \nfinancing reform.\n  It has been 7 months since the Finance Committee issued three \nbipartisan policy papers detailing the options from which the committee \nchose to craft its bill.\n  It has been 18 months since the Finance Committee convened a \nbipartisan, day-long health care summit at the Library of Congress.\n  It has been 19 months since the Finance Committee began holding open \nhearings to prepare for the bill before us today.\n  It has been more than 15 long years since the last time that the \nSenate took on this fight to enact comprehensive health care reform.\n  It has been 38 years since our late Colleague, Ted Kennedy, proposed \na plan to extend health insurance coverage to all.\n  It has been 44 years since Congress created Medicare, providing \nhealth care for America's seniors, and Medicaid, providing health care \nfor the poorest among us.\n  It has been 64 years since President Harry Truman asked the Congress \nto enact a national insurance program ``to assure the right to adequate \nmedical care and protection from the economic fears of sickness.''\n  It has been 97 years since President Theodore Roosevelt ran on a \nplatform that called for ``the protection of home life against the \nhazards of sickness . . . through the adoption of a system of social \ninsurance adapted to American use.''\n  And it is now only hours until this Senate will pass meaningful \nhealth care reform.\n  It will not be long now until the law will prohibit insurance \ncompanies from cancelling insurance policies when people get sick.\n  It will not be long now until people with preexisting conditions will \nhave access to health care.\n  It will not be long now until the law will prohibit insurance \ncompanies from imposing lifetime or annual limits on benefits.\n  It will not be long now until parents will be able to include their \nchildren up to age 26 on their insurance policies.\n  It will not be long now until the law will require insurance \ncompanies to report on the share of premium dollars that goes to pay \nmedical care, and the share that doesn't.\n  It will not be long now until consumers will be able to shop for \nquality insurance in new Internet Web sites, where insurance companies \nwill compete for their business.\n  It will not be too long now until millions of uninsured Americans \nwill be able to buy insurance on new exchanges with tax credits to help \nmake it affordable.\n  It will not be too long now until the law will prohibit insurance \ncompanies from discriminating against women in setting premiums.\n  It will not be too long now until the law will limit insurance \ncompanies in how much more they can charge when people get older.\n  It will not be too long now until more than 30 million Americans who \notherwise would not have health care coverage will finally get that \npeace of mind.\n  It will not be too long now until more than 30 million Americans will \nhave a better chance to live longer, healthier, less pain-ridden lives.\n  It will not be too long now until more than 30 million Americans will \nbe able to share their family Christmas free of the fears of medical \nbankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, it will not be long now. It has been a long time \ncoming.\n  I thank God that I have lived to see this day. I thank God for \nsustaining us and for enabling us to reach this time. Let us now, at \nlong last, pass this historic legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, it will not be long now until we \nachieve universal health care coverage affordable care for all \nAmericans. I thank Senator Baucus for making this moment possible. I \nknow how hard he has worked for so many weeks, so many months, so that \nwe could bring very different views together but all focused on the \ngoal of achieving affordable health care for every American.\n  Senator Baucus never lost sight of that goal. As a result, we are now \njust hours away from the last procedural hurdle until we will have a \nchance in the Senate to vote on a bill that for the 23 years I have \nbeen in Congress I have told the people of the Third Congressional \nDistrict and the people of Maryland that I am going to fight to change \nour health care system so that every American has access to affordable, \nquality health care.\n  We are going to take a giant step forward to reaching that goal in \nthe legislation we have before us today. Through the Chair, I thank \nSenator Baucus very much for his extraordinary patience and leadership \nto bring us to this moment.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of discussion on both sides as to what \nthe facts of the bill are. I am going to use the CBO because that is \nwhat we agreed to. That is the objective scorekeeper. They are not \npartisan. Everybody agrees to that.\n  The CBO tells us that for the under-65 group we are going to increase \nthe number of insured from 83 percent to 94 percent. For all Americans, \nwe are going to have 98 percent covered by health insurance. That is \nuniversal. We are going to have a framework so that at long last \nAmerica joins every other industrialized nation in the world with a \nhealth care system where everyone is included.\n  To me, this is a moral issue. It is an issue of whether health care \nis a privilege or a right. I believe the values of America teach us \nthat health care should be a right for all Americans.\n  The bill we will be voting on will take us very much in the direction \nof achieving that goal. Today in America too many people fall through \nthe cracks. Too many families are literally destroyed because they \ncannot afford access to health care. Therefore, they don't get the \ntests they need, and perhaps a disease that could have been caught \nearly or prevented is lost, and a person has to go through tremendous \nhealth care treatment; perhaps even losing their life.\n  We have seen too many families go through bankruptcy because they \ncannot afford the health care they need. We see too many literally \ncutting their prescription pills in half in the hopes of being able to \nkeep their medicine for a longer period of time because they cannot \nafford it, knowing full well they are compromising their health.\n  I have mentioned the case of Deamonte Driver which, to me, is \nrepresentative of so many tragedies in our community that could be \navoided. Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old in Prince George's County, MD, \nvery close to here, had a tooth ache. His mom tried to get him to a \ndentist, but he had no insurance, and they couldn't find a dentist. \nThey went to a social worker and made dozens of calls and still \ncouldn't find a dentist. Deamonte was complaining of severe headaches. \nAfter weeks of not being able to get to a dentist, he went to the \nemergency room--the only option that was still available. They found \nout the tooth had become abscessed, which went into his brain. He had \nemergency surgery. He lost his life because our health care system \ndidn't provide access to affordable, quality care for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, that is about to change. I am proud to be a part of \nit. I have been asked by many in recent days as to what is in it for \nthe people of Maryland. The people of Maryland are going to get a \nnational health care system that makes a lot more sense, a rational \nsystem for care in America. With the current system, too many people \nare being left out. Small employers have a hard time finding affordable \nproducts.\n  I have gotten many letters from constituents that I have read. I must \ntell you about the letter I received from a small business owner in \nMontgomery\n\n[[Page S13798]]\n\nCounty. She and her husband had to take out two separate policies to \ncover their family of four. The private insurance companies \ndiscriminated and said each has preexisting conditions, and the only \nway to have full coverage is to have two policies with two separate \ndeductibles--which the family cannot afford--two separate premiums that \nthe family cannot afford.\n  There is not competition to provide coverage to small businesses in \nAmerica. Small businesses in Maryland want to have the opportunity to \ncover their employees, and they know competition will work, and this \nbill provides for a lot more competition.\n  This bill will help those who are losing coverage today. Many people \nin Maryland are losing their health care coverage every day. Hundreds \nlose their health insurance in my State every day. We live in the \nwealthiest Nation in the world, and Maryland is the wealthiest State, \nand we are still losing health coverage today.\n  Our Medicare beneficiaries are finding their program under attack. \nThey want to have the stability of knowing Medicare will be there not \njust this year but for decades to come. This bill starts to reform \nMedicare by reforming health care so we can sustain it and fill in the \nprescription drug doughnut hole under which so many seniors are finding \nit very difficult to afford their medicine.\n  For the people of Maryland, this bill will provide a rational way in \nwhich they can maintain their existing coverage, find it more \naffordable, and certainly sustain coverage for our Medicare population \nand provide competition for small business owners to find affordable \nhealth care. It ought to bring down health care costs. Marylanders are \nvery interested in that.\n  Again, let me use the CBO, the objective scorekeeper. They say for \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans, their health premiums will go \ndown because health care costs are coming down. This legislation \ninvests in prevention and wellness. We know prevention and wellness \nworks. We know if you can detect a disease early, you cannot only save \nlives, but you can save health care costs because the preventive \nservices only cost a couple hundred dollars, and an operation you can \navoid is tens of thousands of dollars. Screening and early detection \nworks. Management of diseases works.\n  Most of our health care costs in America are spent on the leading \ndiseases such as cardiac care and diabetes. We know we spend a lot of \nmoney, but we can manage those diseases more effectively, and this bill \ntakes us down that path. We can save money by investing in health \ninformation technology. Think about that--about how much paper we \nreceive every year from our health care system. Think about our own \nmedical records and how that could be used to help us each manage our \nown health care and take more responsibility. We are not doing that \ntoday. We know that we can use a card to go anywhere in the world, and \nthey can track our financial records. But for health care, that is not \ntrue today.\n  By investing in health information technology, we can reduce a \nsignificant amount of administrative costs in health care and better \nmanage each of our own health care needs. That is what this bill does.\n  This bill will cover 31 million more Americans. That is not what I am \nsaying as a Democratic Senator from Maryland; that is what the CBO is \nsaying this bill will achieve--31 million more Americans that will not \nhave to go to an emergency room to get their primary care needs met.\n  Think about how much it costs each one of us when that person whose \nonly option is to go to an emergency room, how much that costs us. You \nsee, many of those individuals cannot afford those hospital charges, so \nit becomes uncompensated care. It is added to the rates at the hospital \nthat you and I pay--those of us who have health insurance.\n  The people in Maryland who have health insurance have a hidden tax of \n$1,100 every year. It is not only a waste of money that we have to pay, \nit is an efficient way to work the system. There should be facilities \navailable so that everybody can get care in a much more cost-effective \nway. This bill moves us toward those goals. It provides competition so \nwe can bring down the cost of health insurance through the local \nexchanges.\n  Another provision in the bill that I am very excited about is that we \ncan cross State lines for competition, so if you are an employer in \nMaryland and you hire workers in Maryland and Virginia and \nPennsylvania, you are able to get the regional and national competition \nso you have more choice on the health insurance companies. That will \nalso bring down costs but also increase quality, which is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  For Marylanders, this bill is important. This bill will help reduce \nthe Federal deficit. How many of us have talked about that? I know that \npeople who watch us say: Gee, I hear a Republican Senator and then a \nDemocratic Senator; is this the same bill they are talking about?\n  Let's talk about the Congressional Budget Office, the objective \nscorekeeper. The Congressional Budget Office says this bill will reduce \nthe Federal deficit by $132 billion--billion, that is a B, billion. \nThat is quite an accomplishment when you realize that to get everyone \ncovered, the Federal Government is providing subsidies which will cost \nus some additional investments. To make sure small businesses can \nafford it, we provide tax credits. That costs revenues--people insured, \nthey have tax preferences. Yet the Congressional Budget Office has \nconfirmed that this bill brings down the deficit by $132 billion in the \nfirst 10 years.\n  Let's look at the second 10 years because a lot of us want to look at \nthe long-term impact. The Congressional Budget Office, the objective \nscorekeepers, tell us it will reduce the deficit by one-half of 1 \npercent of the GDP or about $1.3 trillion. It is quite an \naccomplishment to get everybody covered and reduce the deficit and have \nthat confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office. That helps the \npeople of Maryland, and that is why the people of Maryland benefit from \nthis bill, as do the citizens of every State in the Nation.\n  I wish to talk about protecting consumers. Senator Baucus talked \nabout this. I wish to make sure people understand what is involved. \nSenator Baucus mentioned a lot of the provisions that are in the bill \nabout preexisting conditions and pediatrics for children take effect \nimmediately, the caps we bring in, the lifetime caps we deal with \ncovering children under the age of 26, the reinsurance program for 55- \nto 64-year-olds, the loss ratios that were added to the bill by the \nmanagers' amendment to make sure insurance companies are using your \npremium dollar to pay for benefits, the independent review of a \ndecision made by an insurance company whether to cover a charge.\n  But I wish to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights because I think \nthe people of this Nation would be surprised to find out we have not \nyet enacted the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It was 1997 when we started talking about a Patients' Bill of Rights, \nabout enacting it so we had national protection against the arbitrary \npractices of private insurance companies. In 1998, President Clinton, \nby Executive order, applied the Patients' Bill of Rights to the \ngovernment insurance programs. But today there is still no protection \nagainst private insurance companies with a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I am very pleased the managers' amendment has added four very \nimportant provisions I authored by an amendment, that I have been \nworking with Democrats and Republicans over the last decade to get into \nFederal law.\n  Access to emergency care--let me talk about that for a moment because \ntoday there are people who live in New Mexico and live in Montana and \nlive in Maryland who go to their emergency rooms. They read the fine \nprint of their insurance plan. It says: Before you go to an emergency \nroom, you have to call for preauthorization or you need to go to the \nemergency room that is in network or we may second-guess whether you \nneeded to go to that emergency room, if, in fact, your final diagnosis \nwas you did not have an emergency need or condition. You may have \nsweating, the traditional chest pains, the traditional symptoms for a \nheart attack. You did exactly what a prudent layperson would do: get to \nthat emergency room as quickly as possible. Then you find out it was \nnot a heart attack. Today the insurance companies can second-guess your \ncoverage.\n  Thanks to the managers' amendment Senator Baucus helped us put \ntogether,\n\n[[Page S13799]]\n\nwe now are going to cover access to emergency care as a requirement for \nevery private insurance company. Prudent layperson standards, no \npreauthorizations, get to the closest emergency room as quickly as you \ncan--those are important protections to get into Federal law.\n  Then there is the ability to choose your primary care doctor. Your \nprimary care doctor is the person you have to have confidence in. If \nyou are a woman, if you want it to be OB/GYN, you should have that \nright. Many insurance companies deny you that today. If you are a \nparent and you want a pediatrician for your child, you should be able \nto have a pediatrician as a primary physician for your child. It is not \nguaranteed to today. Many insurance plans deny it. This will make sure \nit is in law.\n  I am pleased, and I know the people of Maryland will be glad to know, \nat long last, we get the Patients' Bill of Rights protected.\n  There are a lot of groups that supported this over the years. I wish \nto acknowledge the long list of people, the long list of groups, \nbipartisan groups, that have worked on this issue, from AARP to the \nConsumers Union to the NAACP to the SEIU, YMCA--the list goes on and on \nof groups that have supported the Patients' Bill of Rights against \nprivate insurance companies. At long last, we have the ability, with \nthe passage of this bill on the Senate floor, to move it one step \ncloser to passage and to be the law of the land.\n  I wish to talk about minority health. The reasons I wish to talk \nabout minority health are twofold. First, I know my colleagues are \ninterested to know that the amendment that is currently pending that \nthe leader filed, technically on my behalf, which establishes the \nminority health protections within the different Federal agencies--I \nwish to assure my colleagues that it is in the underlying bill. It is \nin the package. It is in the managers' package which has been adopted.\n  I am going to suggest to the body that we withdraw the amendment \nbecause we do not need it to pass; it is already in the underlying \nbill. This was the original amendment I submitted. I wished to explain \nthat because the amendment I filed to establish the Minority Health \nOffice at the Department of Health and Human Services and also within \nNIH will be in the underlying bill because of the managers' package.\n  This is an important moment because there are huge disparities in our \nhealth care delivery systems in America, bringing about huge \ndisparities among different ethnic communities. The life expectancy of \nAfrican Americans, for example, is 5.3 years lower than Whites. When we \nlook at diabetes in America, the incidence of diabetes is two times \ngreater among minorities than the general population. That means we \nneed to have a strategy to deal with it. We need to know how can we \nreach out to minority communities to deal with their special needs. \nUnless you have a focus within the Department of Health and Human \nServices, unless you have a focus within NIH and the other agencies, \nyou will not deal with it as effectively as we should. I, again, thank \nSenator Baucus, Senator Dodd, Senator Reid, and the rest who understood \nthis and put it into the managers' package because we can then develop \na national strategy to help deal with the issues of the minorities.\n  I also will mention heart disease. African Americans have a 33-\npercent higher death rate due to heart disease. The list goes on and \non. That is why this bill codifies the Office of Minority Health in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, establishes \nindividual Offices of Minority Health at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, Health Resources and Services Administration, \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality, Food and Drug Administration, the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and it elevates the current \nCenter on Minority Health and Health Disparities at NIH into an \ninstitute. That is good news for this Nation in dealing with this \nissue.\n  I, again, thank those who helped me get this into the managers' \npackage--and it is now in the bill--that we will be taking up for a \nvote tomorrow.\n  I also compliment Senator Sanders--I have done this before--on the \ncommunity health centers. I mention that because as we deal with the \ndisparities in health care in America, we deal with minority health \ncare issues, yes, we have to get people health insurance, we have to \nget people the financial wherewithal to provide health care, but you \nalso have to have the facilities in place if you are going to deal with \nhealth care needs. It is one thing to say we will cover the costs, it \nis another thing to say we will have the doctors available.\n\n  I met with one of the leaders at Johns Hopkins University, which is \nlocated in the urban part of Baltimore city. He said: We need help. We \nneed more community health centers. We need more primary care doctors. \nWe need more nurses. We need help with more people seeking care through \ntraditional channels rather than using emergency rooms. That is great \nnews. With them being able to afford insurance, that is great news, but \nlet us have the facilities.\n  There are many underserved in Maryland and around the Nation who just \nneed facilities. Thanks to the Sanders amendment, of which I am proud \nto be a cosponsor and worked with him, that is in this bill. We are \ngoing to see $10 billion to expand community health centers and 25 \nmillion more Americans will be able to get access to care through our \ncommunity health centers. That is good news and that will help and we \ninvest in creating more primary care doctors, which is a very valuable \npart of this bill. I applaud all those.\n  Let me point out this bill will help families in America. The choice \nis whether we pass this bill which sets up the framework for America to \nfinally become a nation that provides universal coverage or we maintain \nthe status quo. Let me tell you what happens if we maintain the status \nquo. These are the numbers. Right now, the average cost for a family \nfor health insurance is $13,244. If we do not take action, by 2016--\nthat is not too many years away--it is going to be $24,291.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed the 20 \nminutes he was yielded.\n  Mr. CARDIN. May I have 2 more minutes, if that is possible?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, if people are going to be able to maintain \ntheir existing coverage, we have to act, and this bill will allow us to \nact. That is why the American Medical Association supports the bill. \nThis bill will help our Medicare population because it strengthens \nMedicare, as I pointed out before. That is why the AARP supports it. We \nwill be able to provide preventive services, such as annual physicals, \nfor our seniors. This bill is important for small business owners who \nno longer will be discriminated against by paying 20 percent more than \ncomparable large companies pay for the same type of insurance product.\n  This bill is good for Marylanders. It is good for every American. It \nmoves us toward universal coverage. The bill is not perfect. I am \ndisappointed with some of the things in the bill and some of the things \nthat did not make it into the bill. But this bill establishes the \nframework for universal, affordable, quality care for every American. \nIt speaks to the values of our Nation.\n  I am proud to support this legislation, and I know we will look back \nat this day as being one of the bright moments for America, where we \nsaid to the people of our Nation that, indeed, we will provide \naffordable, quality health care for every American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nKaufman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank the manager not just for this but \nfor the many things he has done to make this bill a possibility. It is \ntruly historic, transformational. To a large degree, it is because of \nhis hard work. I appreciate that.\n  Also, I yield him 30 minutes of my postcloture time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time will be so yielded.\n\n[[Page S13800]]\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise, once again, to express my support \nfor this historic health care legislation before us. After more than a \nyear of debate and months and months of negotiations, I welcome the \nextraordinary opportunity finally to enact meaningful health care \nreform. Yes, I mean years and months, since this reform effort has been \na long and deliberative process, not the rush job opponents of this \neffort have been claiming.\n  I must admit, however, there were times during this debate when I was \nnot sure if we were ever going to reach this point. In fact, I was \nconvinced we were not. But I found in my life that when you think \nthings are never going to happen, as with every important thing I have \never done, you reach a point when you say this is never going to \nhappen, and this is another example. There are many times I never \nthought this would happen.\n  From the bogus charge of death panels--which was just named \npolitifact.com's ``Lie of the Year''--to the tension over whether the \nbill will contain a public option, which I supported, there were some \nlong days where it was hard to see how we were going to get to the end \npoint.\n  But thanks to the hard work of the majority leader, as well as \nSenators Baucus, Dodd and Harkin and their staffs, we are finally here.\n  As many of you know, I have worked in and around the Congress for \nmore than 36 years. I have learned quite a bit about how things operate \nin the Senate.\n  The Senate is commonly referred to as the most deliberative body in \nthe world. But such deliberations are not always pretty. Sometimes \ntempers flare, sometimes debate does not reach the level we aspire to \nor the American people deserve. Sometimes the most important \nlegislation actually fails to get the votes necessary to pass.\n  We all know what happened to health care reform the last time we \nattempted a major overhaul 15 years ago when President Clinton tried to \npass his version of health care reform. The debate was just as \npassionate with charges and countercharges on both sides of the aisle. \nBecause of the coarseness of that debate, because of the seemingly \nintractable opposition to health care reform, Congress has been wary in \nthe intervening 15 years to take up this cause again, and it is \nunderstandable.\n  But over the past 15 years, our health care system has gotten more \nexpensive. Rising medical costs, skyrocketing premiums, increasing \nnumbers of the uninsured and the strain on both business and providers \nhave brought the critical need for health reform back to the Senate \nthis year.\n  Make no mistake, we need health care reform now. The status quo--what \nI call the present health care system--is simply unsustainable.\n  Medical costs account for one-sixth of domestic spending and are \nheaded upward. In 1979, we spent approximately $220 billion as a nation \non health care. In 1992, we spent close to $850 billion. In 2009, we \nwill spend $2.5 trillion on health care. Listen to this: $220 billion \nin 1979, $850 billion in 1992, and $2.5 trillion in 2009. How can \nanyone argue it is not time to deal with health care reform and that \nthe need is urgent? The trajectory of our national health care \nexpenditures is out of control.\n  In addition, one of the biggest--if not the biggest--forces behind \nour Federal deficit, which we hear so much about on this floor, are the \nskyrocketing costs of Medicare and Medicaid. In 1996, Medicare and \nMedicaid accounted for only 1 percent of all government expenditures; \nthey now account for 20 percent. If we do nothing to start bending the \ncost curve down for Medicare and Medicaid, we will eventually spend \nmore on these two programs than on all other Federal programs combined. \nWe must slow the level of growth in the Medicare and Medicaid Programs \nif we are to ever get our budget situation under control.\n  In addition to the fiscal pressures crushing our Federal and State \ngovernments, the present health care system is also crushing families \nand workers. Just look at the rise in the insurance premiums in my home \nState of Delaware. In 2000, the average premium for family health \ncoverage was just over $7,500. That is $7,500. By 2008, the number had \njumped to $14,900--that is $14,900--almost doubling in just 8 years. If \nwe fail to enact the pending health care reform legislation, the same \npremium for family coverage is expected in Delaware to reach $29,000 in \n2016.\n  Let me repeat that: $29,000 for family coverage in Delaware in 2016 \nif we don't pass health care reform now.\n  States around the country will see similar increases, which are \nsimply unaffordable. Too many people are going bankrupt paying for \ntheir medical care. Today, the inability to pay for skyrocketing \nmedical bills accounts for more than 60 percent of U.S. personal \nbankruptcies, a rate of 1\\1/2\\ times what it was just 6 years ago. Keep \nthis in mind: More than 75 percent of families entering bankruptcy due \nto health care costs actually have health insurance.\n  Let me repeat this because it is a critical point: Three-quarters of \nall Americans filing for bankruptcy because of medical bills already \nhave insurance. We also need reform to stop the worst abuses in the \nhealth insurance industry. In my year as serving as the Senator from \nDelaware, I have heard from far too many constituents who have been \nrefused an insurance policy because they have a preexisting condition.\n  I have heard from fathers who were denied family insurance coverage \nbecause they were told their children had preexisting conditions too \nexpensive to cover. Much to my shock--and I have talked about this on \nthe Senate floor--I have received letters from women who have been \nturned down for coverage because their pregnancy was considered a \npreexisting condition. Pregnancy a preexisting condition? That is \nsimply intolerable. Even worse, however--if that is possible--is the \npractice of rescission, where insurance companies drop coverage for \nindividuals the moment they get sick and need their insurance the most. \nBeing denied coverage after you have already paid your premiums is just \nplain cruel.\n  For all those reasons and more, we must reform the present health \ncare system. Thankfully, we now have the opportunity to bring about \nmeaningful health care reform through the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, and I would like to take just a couple more \nminutes to discuss why this legislation has earned my support.\n  First off, it is fiscally responsible. President Obama laid down a \nmarker that any health care reform legislation that landed on his desk \ncould not add to our Nation's debt. I am happy to say this legislation \npasses this test.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act will reduce the deficit by $132 billion over \nthe first 10 years. This bill is fully paid for.\n  Second, the bill helps stabilize Medicare and Medicare Programs. In \nthe absence of this legislation, the Medicare trust fund is expected to \ngo bankrupt in 2017. According to the head actuary at the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, passing this bill would extend the \nsolvency of the trust fund for an additional 9 years--9 years. Medicare \nis a sacred trust with Americans, and this bill ensures this trust is \npreserved.\n  In addition to reducing the deficit and shoring up the Medicare \nProgram, this bill contains numerous provisions that will help \nAmericans afford their premiums and prevent them from filing for \nbankruptcy protection. Starting next year, insurers will no longer be \nable to place lifetime caps on health care benefits. For the next \nseveral years, insurers will also be restricted in the annual limits \nthey can place on benefits, and then these will be eliminated \naltogether in 2014.\n  These are huge changes for people with debilitating diseases and \nthose who experience unexpected catastrophic events costing millions of \ndollars in treatment.\n  In addition, premium subsidies for families with incomes under 400 \npercent of the poverty level--or $88,000 for a family of four--will be \navailable to help them afford their premiums once the new insurance \nexchange is up and running. There will also be annual limits on out-of-\npocket costs for individuals, and dependents will be able to be covered \nunder their parents' insurance policies until the age of 26.\n  All of these are meaningful reforms that will dramatically lower the \nrate of bankruptcies associated with medical costs.\n\n[[Page S13801]]\n\n  The bill also contains some other great consumer protections that \ndon't currently exist in our present health care system. I have already \nhighlighted the problems in the current system with insurers denying \ncoverage for people with preexisting conditions and rescinding coverage \nwhen people get sick. Under this bill, Americans will finally be freed \nfrom the shackles of preexisting clauses that have kept so many from \nobtaining much needed health insurance.\n  Starting next year, insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage \nto children with preexisting medical conditions. This ban on not \ncovering preexisting conditions will be extended to all Americans in \n2014.\n  The bill also forbids insurers from rescinding health insurance after \nAmericans have already paid their premiums. Americans will no longer \nlose their coverage when they get sick and need it most.\n  In addition, the bill dramatically expands coverage of prevention and \nwellness services. It provides incentives for employers to implement \nwellness programs and offers a new annual wellness checkup for seniors \nenrolled in Medicare.\n  These are all good, positive reforms to our health care system.\n  Now that we are close to finishing this debate, the media has focused \nits attention on particular deals that benefit certain Senators and \nspecific States, but I want to point out that all the benefits I have \ntalked about--all of them--are available to every American in every \nState.\n  Most every Senator has brought something to this debate and to this \nbill. I am very pleased that the managers' package includes the health \ncare fraud enforcement amendment, which I introduced, along with \nSenators Leahy, Specter, Klobuchar, and Schumer as cosponsors. Again, \nthis benefits all Americans not just Delawareans.\n  The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association conservatively \nestimates that 3 percent of all health care spending--some $72 \nbillion--is lost to health care fraud in both public and private health \ncare plans. That is $72 billion lost in health care fraud in both \npublic and private health care plans. Other estimates place the figure \nas high as 10 percent over $220 billion.\n  Fraud hits every one of us in every corner of our Nation where we can \nleast afford it--our health care premiums--while simultaneously driving \ndown the quality of, and our trust in, the health care system. This \namendment increases funding for fighting fraud in public programs.\n\n  It improves screening of providers and suppliers and requires \nimplementation of meaningful compliance programs. This section tightens \nrequirements for claims submissions and provides new tools to deter \nfraud and abuse in the private insurance market.\n  It also strengthens criminal investigations and prosecution. Today, \noutdated laws and punishments insufficient to provide effective \ndeterrence hamper prosecutors and agents. This may seem incredible, but \nmany criminals have told law enforcement officers that they switched to \nhealth care fraud from the drug trade because the reward-to-risk ratio \nis so much higher. Can you imagine that? There is actually an incentive \nfor crooks in the present health care system to commit health care \nfraud.\n  This antifraud amendment can begin to reverse this trend. \nSignificantly reducing costs attributable to fraud will go a long way \ntoward bending the cost curve down. What this bill does is it increases \nthe sentencing requirements for people who commit health care fraud to \nmake it much less attractive for them to get into the health care fraud \nbusiness. It gives us the prosecutors and the agents we need--just like \nwe did in the financial regulatory reform--to go after these folks and \ncatch them, then put them in jail. With these new sentencing \nguidelines, we can put them there for a longer time, discouraging \npeople from getting into the health care fraud business to begin with.\n  In addition, the package of amendments I cosponsored with my fellow \nfreshman Democrats will also improve the bill and benefit all \nAmericans.\n  I am lucky to be a member of a dynamic freshman class, including the \nPresiding Officer, and I have enjoyed teaming up with them in our \nmorning speeches and colloquies to push the health care reform effort \nforward. I am pleased that our amendment package was accepted by the \nbill's managers and that it provides commonsense, practical solutions \nthat help further contain costs, improve value, and increase quality.\n  For example, it quickens the implementation of uniform administrative \nstandards, allowing for more efficient exchange of information among \npatients, doctors, and insurers. It provides more flexibility in \nestablishing accountable care organizations that realign financial \nincentives and help ensure that Americans receive high-quality care. It \nprovides greater incentives to insurers in the exchange to reduce \nhealth care disparities affecting underserved minority communities.\n  For all the reasons listed above, from the original text to the \nadditions added to the managers' package, this bill should and must be \npassed. It brings quality, affordable health care within the reach of \nall Americans, including more than 30 million Americans who are \ncurrently uninsured. It strengthens the Medicare Program, extending its \ninsolvency for 9 years. It helps restore fiscal order by reducing the \ndeficit by approximately $132 billion over 10 years and more than $1 \ntrillion over 20 years. It offers much needed consumer protections that \nprovide stable coverage at an affordable cost.\n  In closing, I again want to acknowledge the hard work of Senators \nBaucus, Reid, Dodd, Harkin, as well as their staffs--especially their \nstaffs--because the staff has done incredible work on this piece of \nlegislation. They have enabled us to reach this historic legislative \nmoment.\n  I have ended many speeches by noting that it is time to gather our \ncollective will and do the right thing to join this historic \nopportunity by passing health care reform. I think we may have finally \nreached that goal. We certainly can't afford to wait any longer. We \nneed to act now. We can do no less. The American people deserve no \nless.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time we have \nin our hour to the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise this morning not to talk about \nhealth care but to talk about the other critical matter that faces this \nbody before we leave this session for the holidays and that is the \nmatter of extending the debt limit of the United States. Let me start \nby saying it is imperative that we extend the debt limit. If we do not, \nthe United States would default on its debt. The consequences for this \ncountry and the global economy would be nothing short of catastrophic.\n  If you think about the problems created in world markets by the fact \nthat Dubai defaulted on $40 billion of debt, think of what it would \nmean to global markets if the United States were to default on $12 \ntrillion of debt.\n  For those who say this is Obama's fault--no. This is not Obama's \nfault. He has been in office 11 months. I remind everyone that he \nwalked into the biggest mess in 70 years--deficits and debt exploding, \njoblessness skyrocketing, economic growth plummeting. All that was \nhappening before Barack Obama became President of the United States. He \ndid not create the economic mess, he inherited it. He did not create \nthe fiscal mess, he inherited it. Those are things he had to take on as \nthe new President.\n  There were record deficits and a doubling of the national debt, there \nwas the worst recession since the Great Depression, financial market \nand housing crises, ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and an \nunsustainable long-term budget outlook with everything going in the \nwrong direction.\n  This is what was happening to deficits before President Obama took \noffice. The deficits were skyrocketing. In fact, we have never held \nPresidents responsible for the fiscal affairs during the first year of \ntheir term of office because everybody here knows they inherit a budget \nfrom the previous President for the first year. That is not Barack \nObama's responsibility, that is the responsibility of the previous \nadministration.\n  For those who say President Obama made things worse--no, he didn't \nmake\n\n[[Page S13802]]\n\nthings worse, he made things better. Yes, he added short term to the \ndeficit, about $300 billion in 2009 because of the economic recovery \npackage, but I remind people the difference the economic recovery \npackage has made. We have gone from private-sector job losses of \n749,000 jobs a month when he came in--this is January of 2009, the \nmonth he came in. Job losses had mounted to 749,000 jobs a month. Look \nat the trend. Because of the recovery package and other measures that \nwere put in place, the changes in private nonfarm payrolls have \nimproved dramatically, from losses of over 700,000 a month in January \nto losses of 18,000 last month. We now believe that, in the first \nquarter of next year, those job losses will have become job gains.\n  The same thing happened on economic growth. Economic growth was \nsharply negative when President Obama came into office. In the last \nquarter, we now know the economy actually grew at a rate of 2.2 \npercent. That is a dramatic change. The fact is President Obama made \nthings better. He inherited a disaster and he went to work to get \nAmerica back on track.\n  Let's look for a moment at the debt. This is what happened under the \nprevious administration. The gross debt of the United States \nskyrocketed, more than doubling under the previous administration. So \nthis is what the current President inherited. He did not create it. He \nwasn't the architect of it. He didn't produce these deficits and debt. \nHe inherited them.\n  It is true we are still on a course for long-term debt that is \nunsustainable. This was the cover of Newsweek on December 7, Pearl \nHarbor day. The Newsweek cover said this: ``How great powers fall; \nsteep debt, slow growth, and high spending kill empires--and America \ncould be next.''\n  When you went inside to the story, it said this:\n\n       This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the \n     resources available for the Army, Navy, and the Air Force . . \n     . If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible \n     plan to restore the Federal budget to balance over the next 5 \n     to 10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis could \n     lead to a major weakening of American power.\n\n  I don't know what could be more clear than that. Here is what has \nhappened since 2001. Again, most of this is on the shoulders, the \nresponsibility of the previous administration, because the debt \nabsolutely skyrocketed under their watch. But it is continuing to grow \nand we must face up to that.\n  What is even more alarming is the longer term outlook. On the trend \nwe are on, the debt, which will reach over 100 percent of the gross \ndomestic product by 2019, is projected to hit 400 percent of gross \ndomestic product by 2050. That is the trendline we are on. That is the \ntrendline we have been on since 2001, a trendline of massively growing \ndebt. The question is, can we face up to it? Do we have the strength, \ndo we have the will to take on the burgeoning debt?\n  This is what the National Journal wrote on November 7 of this year:\n\n       The debt problem is worse than you think. Simply put, even \n     alarmists may be underestimating the size of the (debt) \n     problem, how quickly it will become unbearable and how poorly \n     prepared our political system is to deal with it.\n\n  The reality we confront tomorrow morning is whether we will extend \nthe debt limit of the United States. We have no choice. If we fail to \npay the debts we have already accrued, the United States and other \nmarkets around the world would collapse. That is just the fact. We \ncannot permit that to happen.\n  How we got to this point is very clear to me. The previous \nadministration put forward a fiscal policy that doubled the debt of the \nUnited States and put us on track to continue doubling it every 8 \nyears. The current administration has taken action to get the economy \nmoving and growing again. Had they not taken those steps, which add to \nthe deficit in the short term, the long-term debt outlook would be even \nworse. That does not take away from the fact that we have to deal with \nthe reality that confronts us now. That reality is we are on a \ntrendline that is absolutely unsustainable.\n  To those who say if you deal with the debt, you are going to have to \ndo something about Social Security and Medicare and revenue--I say yes. \nThat is true. We are going to have to do something about all of those. \nTo those who say dealing with the debt means facing up to the hard \nreality that confronts this country and the fact that we are on a \ncourse that is unsustainable--I say yes. That is true. We are going to \nhave to make changes in the entitlement programs. We are going to have \nto make changes in the revenue system.\n  When I say that, I don't mean by that the first thing we do is raise \ntaxes. The first thing we ought to do is collect the taxes that are \nalready owed but are not being paid because of these offshore tax \nhavens and abusive tax shelters and all the rest. We can get more \nrevenue. We do not need to raise taxes to get more revenue. We need to \ncollect the revenue that is currently owed and we need to get it from \nthe people who are cheating all the rest of us by engaging in these tax \nschemes--offshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters. We even have \ncompanies now that are leasing sewer systems, buying them from European \ncities in order to depreciate them on the books in the United States to \nreduce their taxes here, then leasing those same sewer systems back to \nthe European cities that built them in the first place. That is \nhappening right now.\n  If you doubt we are losing money to offshore tax havens, Google \n``offshore tax havens'' and see how many hits you get. You get over a \nmillion. Those sites describe a life of luxury, living offshore, tax \nfree, on income received in this country, income on which taxes are \nowed in this country but not paid. That is the kind of thing that has \nto be stopped.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me talk for a minute about what Senator Gregg and I \nhave proposed: a bipartisan task force to deal with this long-term debt \nthreat. Our proposal has 35 cosponsors now. The idea is to give a group \nof our colleagues and members of the administration the responsibility \nto come up with a plan to reduce the deficits and debt. If a plan \nenjoyed a supermajority among the group of 18 who would be given the \nresponsibility to come up with such a plan--if 14 of the 18 could agree \non a plan--it would have to come here for a vote. It would come here \nfor a vote. Every Senator would retain their rights to vote up or down. \nEvery Senator would retain their rights. And it would require 60 votes \nin the Senate to pass, it would require 60 percent of the House to pass \nand the President would be able to veto it if he didn't like it.\n\n  I think it is clear that we have a real challenge facing our country \nand it is going to take some special process to deal with it. What we \nhave outlined would put everything on the table with 18 Members, 10 \nDemocrats, 2 from the administration, and 8 Republicans. All task force \nMembers would need to be currently serving in Congress or the \nadministration. If 14 of the 18 could agree, that report would have to \ncome to the Congress for a vote. The report would be submitted after \nthe 2010 election and there would be fast-track consideration in the \nSenate and the House. There would be a final vote before the 111th \nCongress adjourned.\n  To those who say that is going to shred Social Security and \nMedicare--I say no. What threatens Social Security and Medicare is our \ndoing nothing. Both of those programs are already cash negative. The \ntrustees of Medicare tell us the program will be insolvent by 2017 if \nwe do nothing. The answer can not be to do nothing. I believe this is a \nchallenge that requires us to come together now, Republicans and \nDemocrats, House, Senate, the administration, as we came together to \ndeal with fiscal crises in the past. The Social Security Commission in \nthe 1980s, the Andrews Air Force Base Summit in the 1990s--those were \nspecial procedures to deal with a special challenge and that is what is \nrequired now. We are on a course that is absolutely and utterly \nunsustainable.\n  Let me go back to the vote tomorrow, because a group of us have said \nwe are not going to vote for any long-term extension of the debt \nwithout consideration of a special process to deal with the debt, but \nwe are also prepared to extend the debt on a short-term basis. That is \nabsolutely essential. That is\n\n[[Page S13803]]\n\nthe responsible thing to do. A failure to extend the debt tomorrow \nwould send a message to markets around the globe that the United States \nis not going to pay its debt. The United States cannot renege on its \ncommitment to pay the $12 trillion of debt that has already been run \nup. Those are not future debts but debts that have already been \nincurred. Those are debts that are due now and will be due in the weeks \nto come.\n  The United States has never defaulted on its debt and it never can \nwithout grave consequences to our economy and to the world economy.\n  Let me say again as clearly as I can: for those who want to blame \nPresident Obama, that won't wash. He has been in office only 11 months. \nHe walked into the biggest mess in over 70 years--deficits and debt \nexploding, job losses skyrocketing, economic growth plummeting. \nPresident Obama didn't create that economic mess, he inherited it. He \ndid not create the fiscal mess, he inherited it.\n  Tomorrow will be a key vote for this country. Those of us who are \nconcerned about the growing debt and are willing to take it on must \nalso be responsible about making certain that the United States does \nnot default on its already accrued debts. To do otherwise would be \ndisastrous for this country.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perfect. Merry Christmas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would inquire how much time is allotted \nto me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 60 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. I have 10 minutes. I wonder if the Presiding Officer \nmight let me know when I have 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have watched this body over the last period we have \nbeen discussing health care. The body itself, the integrity of this \nbody has been challenged. I have watched as individuals have challenged \neach other's integrity as it relates to this bill. I choose not to do \nthat today.\n  I wish to say, as I do constantly in my State, that I consider it a \nprivilege to wake up each day and come to work in this body. Obviously, \nthings don't always go as one might expect, but I do consider it a \nprivilege. I thank the folks back home for allowing me to serve and to \ndeal with these important issues.\n  I don't think I will ever quite understand why this bill was put \ntogether the way it was. I certainly understand there are differences \nof opinion and differences of interest, but I don't think I will ever \nunderstand why Medicare moneys, from an insolvent program, were used to \nfund a new entitlement.\n  CBO has come out this morning clearly stating what we have been \nsaying for over 6 months. The fact is, taking Medicare savings and \nusing them to create another entitlement does not work. It takes away \nfrom the solvency of Medicare itself. It is kind of late, but I am glad \nCBO has actually come out and said today, finally, after months of \ndebate, what we have been saying from day one, that you could not take \nMedicare savings and use them to create a new entitlement without \nchallenging the solvency of Medicare itself.\n  I will never understand why that building block, a flawed building \nblock, was used to create this bill. Everybody knows it was that use of \ninappropriate funding that began this whole partisan divide. My guess \nis, we might have ended up with a bill that would stand the test of \ntime had we not utilized that basic flawed building block in the bill.\n  There has been one, though, that I have found equally problematic; \nthat is, the whole issue of creating an unfunded mandate for the State \nof Tennessee and for States across the country. The challenge to \npeople's personal integrity has been centered more around this issue \nthan anything else, as various Senators trying to protect their States \nfrom an unfunded mandate have been challenged in that regard.\n  Many people who serve in this body used to be mayors, they used to be \nGovernors, people who had to deal with budgets in their own States. \nYears ago, in a bipartisan effort, a bill was passed to ensure that we \nin Washington didn't pass laws that increased costs for cities. I was a \nmayor of a city. I was commissioner of finance for a State. In those \ncapacities, there was nothing that was more offensive than for the \nFederal Government to pass a law and send down a mandate to a city or a \nState that costs money and yet not send the money that went with it. \nThere was nothing more infuriating. We had to actually balance our \nbudgets. We didn't have the ability to borrow money from overseas and \nto continue to operate in the red.\n  Back in 1995, a law was passed called the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct. It was done to do away with the arrogance that existed up until \nthat time--and unfortunately, continues to exist--where the Federal \nGovernment would create laws that would increase costs on cities and \nStates. It was passed in a bipartisan way. As a matter of fact, 15 \nMembers from the other side of the aisle supported this law, voted for \nthis law, and put this law in place. Many of the people who made this \nbill, created this bill participated. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee voted for this law. The majority leader voted for this law. \nThe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee voted for this law. \nThe chairman of the HELP Committee who drafted a big part of this bill \nvoted for this law. What this law said was that we could not pass \nlegislation out of this body, out of Congress, that placed an unfunded \nmandate on States, on cities, and caused them to have to do things that \nraised expenses by laws we created without sending the money \nthemselves.\n  Our Governor of Tennessee is a Democrat. He is on the other side of \nthe aisle. We have worked closely on a number of economic development \nissues. I have talked with him all the way through this process. He \nactually had hoped to work with this administration on health care and \non health care legislation. He has been involved in health care all of \nhis life. He has managed our State well. He has dealt with many \nchallenging health care issues. Much has been documented about the \ntravails our State has had as it relates to Medicaid and our desire to \ntry to fix that. He has called this bill, which appears to be ready to \npass this body, the mother of unfunded mandates. He has talked about \nthe more than $750 million in cost this bill is going to cause the \nState of Tennessee to deal with at a time when they are hoping their \nState's revenues will be at 2008 levels by the year 2014.\n  Again, I will never understand why we have raided an insolvent \nentitlement to create a new entitlement, weakening Medicare. I will \nnever understand why we have done that to create this bill. I will \nnever understand why this body chose to create such a large unfunded \nmandate for States through the provisions we have put in place as it \nrelates to Medicaid, telling States they have to raise the levels at \nwhich they insure citizens across their State to 133 percent of federal \npoverty.\n  There is no question this bill violates the law put in place in 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  I talked about the fact that it is a privilege to serve in this body. \nGenerally speaking, people try to live up to the standards this body \nhas set for all of us and that citizens across the country expect us to \nlive up to. For that reason, I am going to raise a budget point of \norder. There is no question, per what CBO has said, the fact that this \nbill is going to cause cities and States to pay more for the health \ninsurance of their employees--CBO has stated that clearly. There is no \nquestion this bill is going to cause States to have to utilize dollars \nthat otherwise might be used for education or public safety.\n  I raise a point of order. Section 425(a)(2) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974 makes it out of order to consider any legislation \nthat contains an unfunded intergovernmental mandate in excess of the \nstatutory limit unless the bill provides new direct spending authority \nor includes an authorization for appropriations in an amount equal to \nor exceeding the direct cost of such mandate in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S13804]]\n\n  The pending bill includes an unfunded intergovernmental mandate in \nexcess of the annual statutory limit of $69 million within the next 5 \nyears. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the substitute \namendment pursuant to section 425(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order for \nconsideration of the pending legislation and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, to be alert because I want to raise a similar request to set \naside. But before I do that, I want to explain why I am doing this. I \nworked for 6 years to pass the Congressional Accountability Act, which \nwas signed into law by President Clinton in 1995. I worked so hard \nbecause I strongly believed there should only be one set of laws in \nthis country.\n  Prior to 1995, there were two sets of laws--one for Capitol Hill and \none for the rest of the country because Congress exempted itself. That \nis why, following on that practice of 1995, I offered an amendment \nduring the Finance Committee markup to require that Members of Congress \nand congressional staff get their employer-based health insurance \nthrough the same exchanges as our constituents. That is something for \nwhich I also heard complaints from the grassroots of Iowa during my \ntown meetings. I did offer that amendment, and it was adopted without \nobjection.\n  But then after careful consideration and examination of the bill \nSenator Reid put together--and this was done by the Congressional \nResearch Service--it was revealed that my amendment was changed under \nthis closed-door merger process. Something cute happened. Under the \nbill we now have before us, this requirement would not apply to staff \nfor committees of the Congress or leadership offices, it would apply to \nMembers and their personal staff but not leadership. That is a real \ncute thing, to give exemptions for some people on Capitol Hill but not \nfor others.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an analysis \nfrom the Congressional Research Service.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Dec. 2, 2009.\n\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Senate Finance Committee. Attention: Andrew McKechnie.\n     From: Ida Brudnick, Analyst on the Congress, Government and \n         Finance Division; Todd B. Tatelman, Legislative Attorney, \n         American Law Division.\n     Subject: Potential Statutory Interpretation of \n         1312(d)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of H.R. 3590, The Patient \n         Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       This memorandum responds to your request for a review and \n     potential statutory interpretation of 1312(d)(2)(D)(ii)(II) \n     of H.R. 3590, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act.\\1\\ Specifically, you have asked whether the definition \n     of the term ``congressional staff'' could be interpreted to \n     exclude committee staff, leadership staff, or other employees \n     of the Congress. The definition used by the bill covers ``all \n     full-time and part-time employees employed by the official \n     office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or \n     outside of Washington, DC.'' \\2\\ In addition, you have asked \n     CRS to review the language used by S. 1796, America's Healthy \n     Future Act of 2009, which was reported from the Senate \n     Finance Committee.\\3\\ S. 1796 used the term ``congressional \n     employee,'' which it defined as ``an employee whose pay is \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the \n     House of Representatives.'' \\4\\ Finally, you have requested \n     that CRS examine what, if any, other Legislative Branch \n     employees might be covered should language similar to that in \n     S. 1796 ultimately be adopted.\n       Based on our review of the financial practices of the \n     Congress with respect to payment of employees, the bill \n     language, and applicable canons of statutory construction, it \n     appears possible to argue that the definition of \n     ``congressional staff' used by 1312(d)(2)(D)(ii)(II) excludes \n     any staff not directly affiliated with a Member's individual \n     or personal office. Should this interpretation be adopted by \n     an implementing body or a court, it would appear that it \n     would exclude professional committee staff, joint committee \n     staff, some shared staff, as well as potentially those staff \n     employed by leadership offices including, but not limited to, \n     the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, \n     Minority Leader of the House, Minority Leader of the Senate, \n     as well as the Whip offices in both the House and Senate. \n     Moreover, this interpretation would arguably exclude other \n     congressional employees, for example, those employed by \n     the Office of the House Clerk, House Parliamentarian, \n     House Historian, Secretary of the Senate, Senate Legal \n     Counsel, House and Senate Legislative Counsel offices.\n\n\n               Legislative Branch Appropriations Accounts\n\n       The legislative branch appropriations acts funds the: \n     Senate; House of Representatives; Joint Items; \\5\\ Capitol \n     Police; Office of Compliance; Congressional Budget Office; \n     Architect of the Capitol, including the Capitol Visitor \n     Center; Library of Congress, including the Congressional \n     Research Service; Government Printing Office; Government \n     Accountability Office; and Open World Leadership Program.\n       Both the House and Senate portions of the annual \n     legislative branch appropriations bills contain one line item \n     that provides for salaries and expenses within Member \n     offices. The House and Senate sections contain additional \n     line items for employees of leadership offices, committees, \n     and officers.\n       In the Senate, the Senators' Official Personnel and Office \n     Expense Account provides each Senator with funds to \n     administer a personal office. It consists of an \n     administrative and clerical assistance allowance, a \n     legislative assistance allowance, and an official office \n     expense allowance. The funds may be interchanged by the \n     Senator, subject to limitations on official mail. The FY2010 \n     legislative branch appropriations act provided $422 million.\n       The Senate portion of the bill includes the following \n     additional headings: Expense Allowances and Representation; \n     Salaries, Officers, and Employees; Office of Legislative \n     Counsel; Office of Legal Counsel; Expense Allowances for \n     Secretary of Senate, Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the \n     Senate, and Secretaries for the Majority and Minority of the \n     Senate; and Contingent Expenses. The ``Contingent Expenses'' \n     account includes funding for Inquiries and Investigations; \n     Expenses of the United States Senate Caucus on International \n     Narcotics Control; Secretary of the Senate; Sergeant at Arms \n     and Doorkeeper of the Senate; Miscellaneous Items; and, \n     Official Mail Costs.\n       Staff in personal offices in the House of Representatives \n     are paid through funding provided for Members' \n     Representational Allowances (MRA). The MRA, which was \n     preceded by multiple allowances for each Member covering \n     different categories of spending, was first established in \n     1996.\\6\\ The FY2010 legislative branch appropriations act \n     provided $660.0 million for MRAs.\n       The House ``Salaries and Expenses'' account provides \n     funding under the following additional headings: House \n     Leadership Offices; Committee Employees; Salaries, Officers \n     And Employees; And Allowances And Expenses. Many of these \n     categories include multiple line items. In FY2010, the \n     ``House Leadership Offices'' heading provided funding for \n     the: Office of the Speaker; Office of the Majority Floor \n     Leader; Office of the Minority Floor Leader; Office of the \n     Majority Whip; Office of the Minority Whip; Speaker's Office \n     for Legislative Floor Activities; Republican Steering \n     Committee; Republican Conference Committee; Democratic \n     Steering and Policy Committee; Democratic Caucus; Nine \n     Minority employees; training and program development--\n     majority; training and program development--minority; \n     Cloakroom Personnel--majority; and Cloakroom Personnel--\n     minority. ``Committee Employees'' provides funding in \n     separate headings for ``Standing Committees, Special And \n     Select,'' and ``Committee on Appropriations.'' Funding for \n     ``Salaries, Officers And Employees'' is divided among \n     various financial, administrative, legal, ceremonial, and \n     security offices, including, for example, the offices of \n     the Clerk of the House, Chief Administrative Office, \n     Sergeant at Arms, Inspector General, and General Counsel.\n\n\n                   Potential Statutory Interpretation\n\n       When interpreting the meaning of legislative language, \n     courts will often use methods of statutory construction \n     commonly referred to as ``canons,'' or general principles for \n     drawing inferences about language. Perhaps the most common \n     ``canon of construction'' is the plain meaning rule, which \n     assumes that the legislative body meant what it said when it \n     adopted the language in the statute. Phrased another way, if \n     the meaning of the statutory language is ``plain,'' the court \n     will simply apply that meaning and end its inquiry.\\7\\ As the \n     United States Supreme Court stated in Connecticut National \n     Bank v. Germain:\n\n       [I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn \n     first to one, cardinal canon before all others. We have \n     stated time and again that courts must presume that a \n     legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a \n     statute what it says there . . . .\n\n[[Page S13805]]\n\n     When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first \n     canon is also the last: judicial inquiry is complete.\\8\\\n\n       Applying the plain meaning canon to the language in H.R. \n     3590, it appears possible to argue that the phrase ``official \n     office of a Member of Congress'' most naturally refers to \n     Member's personal offices and, therefore, excludes other \n     employees that a Member may utilize for other purposes. For \n     example, Members who serve as committee chairman or ranking \n     members may have staff affiliated with their service on a \n     given committee. While the Member may have control over \n     hiring, promotion, and even termination, those staff are paid \n     by the committee and not the Member. Moreover, the Member's \n     position on the committee is not commonly considered their \n     ``official office,'' as committee assignments may change \n     during a Congress and are determined by the chamber caucuses. \n     Furthermore, it is worth noting that CRS has been unable to \n     locate any previous use of the phrase ``official office of a \n     Member of Congress'' in statute or appropriations laws.\n       Alternatively, applying the plain meaning canon to the \n     language used in S. 1796, it appears possible to argue that \n     this language includes committee staff, leadership staff and \n     most other congressional employees. The language, unlike that \n     in H.R. 3590, turns on who the disbursing agent of the funds \n     is, rather than who the employer is. As a result, the \n     language in S. 1796 appears to be much broader, as most \n     ``congressional employees'' have their pay disbursed from \n     either the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief \n     Administrative Office (CAO) of the House, regardless of \n     whether they are employed in a Member's personal office, by a \n     committee, leadership official, or in another capacity by the \n     Congress. Moreover, unlike the language in H.R. 3590, similar \n     text to that in S. 1796 has been used previously to \n     categorize congressional staff for salary and benefits \n     purposes.\\9\\\n\n\n                         Other Potential Issues\n\n       The language in H.R. 3590 raises additional possible \n     concerns in light of the way that the House and Senate \n     conduct business. For example, one potential issue with \n     proposing different standards for employees in Member office \n     accounts and employees paid through other House and Senate \n     accounts arises from the use of shared staff. Although the \n     House and Senate have different rules regarding shared staff, \n     both chambers allow types of shared staffing arrangements \n     that could result in an employee being both on the payroll of \n     a Member office and another type of office.\n       In the Senate, 2 U.S.C. 61-la authorizes limited sharing of \n     staff:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, appropriated \n     funds are available for payment to an individual of pay from \n     more than one position, each of which is either in the office \n     of a Senator and the pay of which is disbursed by the \n     Secretary of the Senate or is in another office and the pay \n     of which is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate out of \n     an appropriation under the heading ``Salaries, Officers, and \n     Employees'', if the aggregate gross pay from those positions \n     does not exceed the maximum rate specified in section 61-\n     1(d)(2) of this title.\n\n       The Senate Handbook summarizes these laws, stating:\\10\\\n\n       An employee may be on the payroll of more than one \n     Senator's office or on the payroll of a Senator's office and \n     a leadership or administrative office, providing the \n     aggregate pay received does not exceed the maximum annual \n     salary for a Senator's office (2 U.S.C. 61-1a). An employee \n     can only be shared between offices which are funded through \n     the appropriations, ``Senators' Official Personnel and Office \n     Expense Account'' (Senators' personal staff), and ``Salaries, \n     Officers, and Employees''.\n\n       The House Member's Handbook, as compiled by the Committee \n     on House Administration, states the following about shared \n     employees: \\11\\\n\n       The term shared employee means an employee who is paid by \n     more than one employing authority of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n       Two or more employing authorities of the House may employ \n     an individual.\n\n       Such shared employees must work out of the office of an \n     employing authority, but are not required to work in the \n     office of each employing authority. The pay from each \n     employing authority shall reflect the duties actually \n     performed for each employing authority. The name, title, and \n     pay of such an individual will appear on each employing \n     authority's Payroll Certification. Such employees may not \n     receive pay totaling more than the highest rate of basic pay \n     in the Speaker's Pay Order applicable to the positions they \n     occupy.\n\n       Employees may not be shared between a Member or Committee \n     office and the office of an Officer of the House if the \n     employee, in the course of duties for an Officer, has access \n     to the financial information, payroll information, equipment \n     account information, or information systems of either Member, \n     Committee, or Leadership offices.\n\n       Applying the interpretation of H.R. 3590 suggested above, \n     it is possible that certain shared staff could be covered by \n     the provision, while other shared staff, even in the same \n     office, would not be covered.\n       Because the bill does not propose a standard for \n     determining coverage, it is potentially left to the \n     implementing authority to establish such a standard. The \n     implementing authority would appear to arguably have wide \n     discretion in setting such a standard. As a result, it is not \n     unreasonable to assume that an implementing authority could \n     use a majority time or similar standard in making coverage \n     determinations. In other words, shared employees would need \n     to declare whom they spent a majority of time working for. If \n     the staffer's declaration was the Member's official office, \n     they could arguably be covered. On the other hand, if the \n     majority of a staffer's time was spent on committee or \n     leadership work, they may arguably not be covered. It is \n     important to note that this is but one possible standard and \n     that unless otherwise stated in the bill, it will up to the \n     implementing authority to determine the standard.\n       The language of S. 1793 arguably avoids this problem as it \n     appears to encompass all shared employees because they all \n     receive salaries through either the CAO or Secretary of the \n     Senate.\n       Another potential issue is the scope of the disbursing \n     authority of the CAO of the House and the Secretary of the \n     Senate. The CAO has served as the disbursing officer for the \n     House of Representatives since 1995. The Secretary of the \n     Senate serves as the disbursing officer for the Senate. Both \n     of these officers are required to publish reports on \n     disbursement.\\12\\ Pursuant to the FY2010 legislative branch \n     appropriations act, the Secretary and CAO are each \n     responsible for the disbursements for two accounts included \n     as ``joint items.'' Additional disbursements by the Secretary \n     include salaries and expenses of the Joint Economic Committee \n     and Office of Congressional Accessibility Services.\\13\\ The \n     CAO serves as the disbursing officer for the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation and the Office of Attending Physician. In \n     addition, the CAO and Secretary also have disbursing \n     authority for a number of House and Senate revolving \n     funds.\\14\\ Thus, it appears possible to argue that, should \n     the language of H.R. 3590 be interpreted as suggested above, \n     these employees would be excluded from coverage. Conversely, \n     should the language from S. 1793 be utilized, it would appear \n     that employees of these committees would be covered as they \n     are paid by the CAO or Secretary of the Senate.\n       Finally, there is the issue of what, if any, other entities \n     or employees of the Legislative Branch the CAO and/or \n     Secretary of the Senate may serve as the disbursing officers. \n     Our research indicates that although the CAO and Secretary of \n     the Senate served as the disbursing officers for the U.S. \n     Capitol Police (USCP) prior to 2003, the Chief of the Capitol \n     Police currently serves as the disbursing officer for the \n     USCP.\\15\\ Moreover, it appears that other Legislative Branch \n     agencies such as the Architect of the Capitol and the \n     Congressional Budget Office each have their own disbursing \n     agents and do not use either the CAO or the Secretary of the \n     Senate. In addition, it appears that the CAO and/or Secretary \n     of the Senate may serve as the disbursing agent for some, but \n     not all, congressional commissions. Thus, some employees of \n     such commissions may be covered by the language used in S. \n     1793, however, none would appear to be covered by the \n     language used in H.R. 3590.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\1\\ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590, \n     Sec. 1312(d)(2)(D)(ii)(II), 111th Cong.

This carve-out creates a double standard and is totally\n\n[[Page S13806]]\n\nunacceptable. This amendment goes beyond just going where my original \namendment went to cover all people on Capitol Hill. The amendment I am \nasking consent for would also include the President, Vice President, \npolitical appointees, and senior-level staff of the executive branch. \nIt is only fair that if this bill becomes law, these leaders should \nthemselves be subject to the reforms that make our constituents go \nthrough the exchange.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order \nto offer amendment No. 3178 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Democratic leadership and the White \nHouse have spent months talking about accountability. With this \nobjection, the majority will not even consider an amendment to make \nsure the White House and all Members employed on Capitol Hill, not just \nthose in our personal offices, live under the same new health care \nsystem the rest of the country lives under. That sure doesn't sound \nlike accountability to me.\n  There is widespread agreement that the health care system in this \ncountry has serious problems. Costs are rising at three times the rate \nof inflation. Many Americans are uninsured. Millions more fear losing \ntheir insurance in a weak economy or because of preexisting conditions. \nDoctors are ready to close their doors over high malpractice costs and \nlower government reimbursements, and we do not do anything in this bill \nabout high malpractice costs.\n  Something has to be done, everyone seems to agree. But tomorrow the \nSenate will vote on a bill that makes a bad situation worse. It is \nunfortunate that we are voting on a bill that a significant majority--\n61 percent--of Americans oppose. The American people, providers, \nadvocacy groups as well, are simply reacting to the fact that this bill \nslid rapidly down the slippery slope to more and more government \ncontrol of health care.\n  It contains the biggest expansion of Medicaid since 1965. It creates \na long-term care insurance program called the CLASS Act that the CMS \nActuary says runs a significant risk of being unsustainable, and one of \nthe most significant Members of this body referred to it as a Ponzi \nscheme similar to what Madoff did. It imposes an unprecedented Federal \nmandate for coverage backed by the enforcement authority of the \nInternal Revenue Service. It increases the size of government by $2.5 \ntrillion when fully implemented. It creates dozens of new Federal \nbureaucracies and programs to increase the scope of the Federal role in \nhealth care. That is a lot of power over people's lives concentrated in \nthe Federal Government, and there are 1,697 delegations of authority to \nthe Secretary of HHS to do things beyond authorities specifically given \nin this legislation.\n  The excesses of this bill appear willfully ignorant of what is going \non in the rest of the economy outside of health care. These excesses \nmake it far worse than doing nothing.\n  At this point in our Nation's history, we are facing very challenging \neconomic times. We have seen the auto industry go into bankruptcy. We \nhave seen banks shutter their doors. The chart behind me shows how the \nFederal debt has increased by $1.4 trillion since inauguration. The \nchart also shows the growing amount of debt the Federal Government is \ntaking on. The amount of increased debt added just since inauguration \nputs $11,000 more of debt on each household, and that total debt now \nexceeds $12 trillion for the first time in history.\n  At the beginning of this debate, one of the key promises of health \ncare reform was that it would bring down health care costs. This needs \nto be done before health spending sinks the Federal budget and saddles \ntaxpayers. I have a chart that illustrates the upward expenditures of \nhealth care costs by $160 billion over the next decade, and that comes \nfrom this bill. The red area on this chart is the net additional \nFederal health spending according to not this Senator but the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Americans have rightly lost faith when, in the face of the current \neconomic crisis, Congress thinks this $2.5 trillion restructuring of \nthe health care system is a good idea. From rationing care to \ninfringing on the doctor-patient relationship, this government-run \nsystem will guarantee U.S. taxpayers a staggering tax burden for \ngenerations to come.\n  When the debate began last year, interested legislators of both \nparties set forth benchmarks that were at the time no-brainers and \nstill are. But this bill does not conform. Health care reform should \nlower the cost of premiums. It should reduce the deficit. Now, this \nbill does over the 10-year window, but if you look at when the program \nreally starts, 4 years from now, and look ahead 10 years at that time, \nyou will find it does not. It should bend the cost curve of health care \nthe right way, but it does not do that. The Reid bill does not do any \nof these things we set out to do at the beginning of the debate.\n  As we end this debate, I urge my colleagues to listen to the American \npeople. The Reid bill is the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, with widespread agreement that our health care system \nhas serious problems, why do we have a partisan debate?\n  There is a column from the Financial Times by a commentator, Clive \nCrook, that sheds some light on the cause of the partisanship.\n  Mr. Crook, a Brit, is sympathetic to the goals and methods of my \nfriends on the other side. But, as one who knows a system of the \nuniversal coverage our friends on the other side seek, he is sober \nabout the consequences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Crook's article entitled \n``The Honest Case for a Bungled Health Care Reform,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Dec. 20, 2009]\n\n            The Honest Case for a Bungled Healthcare Reform\n\n                            (By Clive Crook)\n\n       The US system of government has a lot in its favour, in my \n     view, but if you wanted to argue the opposite, the fiasco of \n     healthcare reform has it all.\n       The measure being fought over in the Senate--if a bill gets \n     passed, ordeal by House-Senate conference comes next--is \n     detested with equal passion by left and right. A majority of \n     the public is now opposed as well. Even its supporters do not \n     like it all that much. Yet if the system fails to spit this \n     thing up for the president's signature, the country will be \n     deemed ungovernable and the Obama administration will be \n     pronounced dead. Expect the rending of garments either way.\n       It does not matter that conservatives oppose this reform. \n     Of course they do. Conservatives are unmoved by the plight of \n     the uninsured, want to block this administration's domestic \n     initiatives regardless, and are incapable of uniting behind \n     an alternative proposal. They have nothing to offer on the \n     issue.\n       It does not matter that the loony left of the Democratic \n     party opposes this reform either. In fact, that is a plus. \n     Progressives who want to kill the most far-reaching US social \n     reform in decades because it would send more customers, \n     public subsidy in hand, to private insurance companies are as \n     stone-hearted on this matter--and as far from understanding \n     the concerns of most voters--as their hard-right enemies. \n     Their opposition is an endorsement.\n       What matters is the failure to rally the country behind an \n     initiative that, at the outset, voters strongly supported. A \n     telling instance of the administration's ineffectiveness as a \n     spokesman for its own project came just last week. Howard \n     Dean, speaking for the progressive wing of the Democratic \n     party, said the reform would do more harm than good--that \n     this was the policy the insurance companies had dreamed of. \n     White House spokesmen rushed to explain that, on the \n     contrary, the insurance companies hate the bill.\n       Think about that. At the beginning Barack Obama promised \n     people that if they liked their existing insurance \n     arrangements--which are mostly private, of course--nothing \n     would change. This entire effort is based on preserving, by \n     popular demand, a mostly private model of insurance. And here \n     is the administration endorsing the progressives' view that \n     private insurers are evil, and citing the companies' \n     opposition to the reform as an argument in its favour.\n       The White House cannot have it both ways. If progressives \n     are right about the wickedness of private insurance, they are \n     right that the whole reform is misconceived. The \n     administration cannot appease leftist opinion and also make \n     the strongest possible case for this reform to the middle of \n     the electorate. Since it cannot appease leftist opinion in \n     any case, why even try? Make a virtue of opposition from that \n     quarter. Mr Obama's reluctance to cross that line has hobbled \n     his administration from the start.\n\n[[Page S13807]]\n\n       Be that as it may, the healthcare bill in its current form \n     is a mess--and an unpopular mess to boot. Popular fears that \n     the bill will drive up insurance premiums and add to public \n     borrowing are probably justified. The measure is timid about \n     changing incentives to promote efficiency: it proposes lots \n     of experiments, but little compulsion.\n       Adverse selection is likely to be a bigger problem than the \n     reformers say: new rules would stop insurance companies \n     denying coverage to the sick, and the quid pro quo of \n     mandatory insurance may be insufficient to offset this. If \n     the insurers' risk pools deteriorate, premiums will rise. \n     Deep cuts in Medicare, the public insurance programme for the \n     elderly, are needed to balance the books, but are unlikely to \n     materialise in full. Higher taxes as well as higher premiums \n     are the likely result of this reform.\n       Would it therefore be better to abandon the effort \n     altogether and start again? One can think of simpler, better \n     blueprints, but the politics that led the country here would \n     still be the same--and so would the economic constraints. It \n     is delusional to suppose that you can significantly widen \n     access to healthcare at no net public cost. You cannot both \n     transform a system and leave its basic structure unaltered. \n     Trying to squirm around these unavoidable realities has \n     brought the effort to its current pass. Why expect things to \n     be different next time?\n       In the end, I think, everything depends on the weight one \n     attaches to achieving security of coverage as quickly as \n     possible. In my view, this is the overriding consideration. \n     Abandoning the effort now might postpone that goal for \n     another decade or more. The country should regard this as \n     unacceptable. Once the reform is law, though, the real work \n     begins. Getting a grip on costs will be even more urgent than \n     it is already--especially when you recall the broader fiscal \n     calamity that awaits the country during the next decade.\n       The honest case for reform along the lines of the Senate \n     bill is not that it fixes US healthcare; still less that, as \n     the White House blithely maintains, it alleviates the \n     country's fiscal distress. The truth is, it will create more \n     problems than it solves. But the one big thing it gets \n     right--the assurance of affordable health insurance for all \n     Americans--is of surpassing importance.\n       Enacting this reform is not the end of the healthcare \n     argument, but the beginning. If it does pass, it may well be \n     looked back on as a mistake once its financial implications \n     sink in. Yet the principle of universal coverage will have \n     been accepted, and with luck there will be no going back. The \n     price will be high, but is worth it.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to try and break through the partisan wall \nand connect with my friends on the other side.\n  Costs are rising at three times the rate of inflation.\n  Many Americans are uninsured, millions more fear losing their \ninsurance in a weak economy or because of preexisting conditions.\n  Doctors are ready to close their doors over high malpractice costs \nand low government reimbursement rates.\n  Something has to be done. Everyone agrees on that much.\n  But tomorrow, the Senate will vote on a bill that makes a bad \nsituation worse. Mr. Crook describes the state of play well:\n\n       [t]he health care bill in its current state is a mess--and \n     an unpopular mess to boot.\n\n  It is unfortunate that we are voting on a bill that a significant \nmajority--61 percent--of Americans oppose.\n  The American people, providers, and advocacy groups are simply \nreacting to the fact that this bill slid rapidly down the slippery \nslope to more and more government control of health care.\n  Mr. Crook states:\n\n       Popular fears that the bill will drive up insurance \n     premiums and add to public borrowing are probably justified. \n     The measure is timid about changing incentives to promote \n     efficiency: it proposes lots of experiments, but little \n     compulsion.\n\n  All through this process, it is as if Republicans and Democrats have \nbeen living in parallel universes. Republicans have focused on the \nelements of the policy and asked tough questions about the cost of the \nchange.\n  Mr. Clive captures that sobering reality:\n\n       Adverse selection is likely to be a bigger problem than \n     reformers say: new rules would stop insurance companies \n     denying coverage to the sick, and the quid pro quo of \n     mandatory insurance may be insufficient to offset this. If \n     the insurers' risk pools deteriorate, premiums will rise. . . \n     . Higher taxes as well as higher premiums are the likely \n     result of this reform.\n\n  Members on this side of the aisle, at each stage of the process, have \nfocused on this reality. While recognizing the worthy goal of expanding \ncoverage, we have been concerned about the effect on the currently \ninsured.\n  This bill contains the biggest expansion of Medicaid since it was \ncreated in 1965.\n  It cuts Medicare by a staggering half a trillion dollars over the \nnext decade.\n  It creates a long-term care insurance program called the CLASS Act \nthat the CMS Actuary says runs a significant risk of being \nunsustainable.\n  It imposes an unprecedented Federal mandate for coverage backed by \nthe enforcement authority of the Internal Revenue Service.\n  It increases the size of the government by $2.5 trillion when fully \nimplemented.\n  It creates dozens of new Federal bureaucracies and programs to \nincrease the scope of the Federal role in health care.\n  That is a lot of power over people's lives concentrated in the \nFederal Government.\n  And the excesses of this bill appear willfully ignorant of what is \ngoing on in the rest of the economy outside of health care.\n  The cost of these excesses make this bill far worse than doing \nnothing.\n  This summer, official scorekeepers fleshed out the size of this cost \nof achieving the other side's noble, but costly goal of expanded \ncoverage. As on who agrees with the goal of universal coverage, Mr. \nCrook acknowledges it:\n\n       It is delusional to suppose that you can significantly \n     widen access to healthcare at no net public cost. You cannot \n     both transform a system and leave its basic structure \n     unaltered. Trying to squirm around these unavoidable \n     realities has brought the effort to its current pass.\n\n  And yet, despite these cold hard facts, our Democratic friends \ncontinue to quest for the Holy Grail of expanded coverage. Mr. Cook \ncaptures that sentiment:\n\n       In the end, I think, everything depends on the weight one \n     attaches to achieving security of coverage as quickly as \n     possible. In my view, this is the overriding consideration. \n     Abandoning the effort now might postpone that goal for \n     another decade or more. The country should regard this as \n     unacceptable.\n\n  Does anyone doubt this is where our Members on the other side are \ncoming from? Some are explicit about it, like my friend, the majority \nwhip. I recognize that transparency. But to them the price--for \neveryone else, the insured, businesses, Federal and State taxpayers, \nand Medicare patients--is secondary.\n  Go back and look at the many pages in the Record and you will see two \nthemes prove my point. One is the Democratic theme. Most of the debate \nfrom those on the other side has been about what they want this bill to \ndo. They want it to expand the role of the Federal Government in health \ncare. Hence, the prideful references to past efforts, successful and \nunsuccessful, in that regard. They want it to solve all problems the \nuninsured face. They recite case after case of uninsured and \nunderinsured. The stories they tell are compelling. On our side, we see \nthe point the other side is making.\n  Go look at all those pages of debate again. You will see another \ntheme. It is the Republican theme. That theme is not about what we want \nthe bill to do for the uninsured. It is about understanding and \nexplaining what the costs and benefits of this bill are to all \nAmericans: Insured and uninsured, young, middle-aged, and elderly, \nsuburban, and rural. In this regard, Republicans reflect where the vast \nmajority of Americans are right now.\n  Mr. Crook, again, firmly where our friends on the other side are, \ncaptures the polarity of the debate:\n\n       Once the reform is law . . . the real work begins. Getting \n     a grip on costs will be even more urgent than it is already--\n     especially when you recall the broader fiscal calamity that \n     awaits the country during the next decade.\n\n  Mr. Crook is correct. At this point in our Nation's history, we are a \nNation facing very challenging economic times. We have seen the auto \nindustry go into bankruptcy. We have seen banks shutter their doors.\n  The Federal debt has increased by $1.4 trillion since inauguration. \nThis chart shows the growing amount of debt that the Federal Government \nis taking on. Just the amount of increased debt added just since the \ninauguration is $11,535 per household.\n  It now exceeds $12 trillion for the first time in history.\n  In these perilous times, Mr. Crook notes the public is extremely \nsensitive to the fiscal consequences of the bill before the Senate. And \nthat is where Republicans have focused all along. Mr. Crook describes \nthe tension between\n\n[[Page S13808]]\n\nthe goal he shares with our Democratic Members and the public's focus \non the questions Republicans have asked for almost a year now. On one \nside of that tension are the answers to Republican inquiries:\n\n       The honest case for reform along the lines of the Senate \n     bill is not that it fixes U.S. healthcare; still less that, \n     as the White House blithely maintains, it alleviates the \n     country's fiscal distress. The truth is, it will create more \n     problems than it solves.\n\n  On the other side of that tension is the goal Democratic Members \nseek. Their goal of trying to achieve ``universal coverage'' overrides \nall other considerations. As Crook puts it ``of surpassing \nimportance.''\n  And, if the other side prevails, what does it mean for the future. \nFrom Mr. Crook, who shares my Democratic friends' goals, I quote:\n\n       Enacting this reform is not the end of the healthcare \n     argument, but the beginning. If it does pass, it may well be \n     looked back on as a mistake once its financial implications \n     sink in. Yet the principle of universal coverage will have \n     been accepted, and with luck there will be no going back, The \n     price will be high, but is it worth it?\n\n  What is that price, Mr. President? To a certain extent, what we do \nknow is that it is high for everyone, but the uninsured population. To \nthe extent we don't and cannot know, it is likely to be higher.\n  From rationing care to infringing on the doctor-patient relationship, \nthis government-run system will guarantee U.S. taxpayers a staggering \ntax burden for generations to come.\n  When the debate began last year, interested legislators of both \nparties set forth benchmarks that were no-brainers. Health care reform \nshould lower the cost of premiums. It should reduce the deficit. It \nshould bend the growth curve in health care the right way.\n  How does the Reid bill measure up?\n  CBO tells us premiums rise.\n  What about health spending? As this chart here illustrates, this bill \nbends the Federal spending curve further upward by $160 billion over \nthe next decade. The red area on this chart is that net additional \nFederal health spending according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  How about deficit reduction? Americans have rightly lost faith when \nin the face of the current economic crisis, Congress thinks this $2.5 \ntrillion restructuring of the health care system is a good idea.\n  The Reid bill doesn't measure up on any of those things.\n  The unfortunate state of this partisan floor debate goes to the \ntension Mr. Crook identified:\n\n       I was raised by FDR Democrats. From a lifetime of public \n     service, I know a little bit about my Democratic friends' \n     political DNA. A big part of that political DNA is one \n     principle. It is this. Expanding health insurance trumps \n     everything else.\n\n  I respect and understand that view.\n  Where we, on our side, differ, is whether it is an absolute or \nrelative principle. Does the principle of universal coverage trump \neverything else? Does it trump cost containment? Does it trump the tax \nburden it brings with higher Federal and State taxes?\n  Does it trump the financial burden it places on small businesses and \nother employers? Does it trump the financial burden related premium \ncost increases will bring? Does it trump the negative impact it will \nhave on the Medicare Program that our seniors count on?\n  For those of us, on this side, expanding coverage is a worthy goal. \nBut it is not an absolute goal. We prefer to expand coverage through \nbetter access and affordability. But that goal of expanded coverage \nmust be balanced with other goals.\n  We view it as relative to those other goals. It is relative to \nwhether the related Federal and State tax burden is bearable. It is \nrelative to realistic cost containment reforms. It is relative to \nwhether the cost burden on employers, especially small businesses, is \nbearable. It is relative to whether the impact on Medicare services and \nsolvency is bearable.\n  The American people have tuned into this debate. They don't like the \npartisanship. They agree with all of us that reform is needed. They \nhave been telling us that expanding coverage is important, but not \nabsolute.\n  I urge the other side to make the honest case for reform to the \nAmerican people. That will lead to a bipartisan response, process, and \nproduct. Americans don't want bungled health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \ncomments of the Senator from Iowa. In fact, I would like to incorporate \nthem by reference in my comments because they were so on point on the \nissue of substance as to what this bill does not do and what it does \ndo. In both instances, he is absolutely right. The bill does not \naccomplish what we set out to do, which was cover all Americans, which \nwas to bend health care costs down, which was to let you keep your \ninsurance if you had it and not have your premiums go up. It does just \nthe opposite.\n  It is a $2.3 trillion increase in health care spending--$2.3 \ntrillion. That is how much it grows the government. Health care costs \ngo up by over $230 billion in the first 10 years. We know premiums are \ngoing up.\n  Now we have this interesting issue involving Medicare. We have heard \na lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about how Medicare is \nnot being cut, and if it is being cut, it is just being used to help a \nnew entitlement, and therefore it should be counted as part of the \nbasic effort to bring fiscal responsibility to this bill. Well, that is \nhokum, just pure unadulterated hokum. Medicare is being cut by $500 \nbillion the next 10 years, $1 trillion over the first 10 years of full \nimplementation, and $3 trillion over the first 20 years. And then the \nmoney is being spent not to make Medicare more solvent, not to make \nMedicare stronger so it does not have a huge unfunded liability, it is \nbeing spent to create this brandnew entitlement--an entitlement that is \nmassively going to expand the size of government by $2.3 trillion.\n  The American people understand this does not work. Common sense kicks \nin with the American people. They know--they know--from common sense \nthat you cannot possibly cut Medicare by $3 trillion, spend it on a new \nentitlement, and have fiscal responsibility around here and claim \nMedicare is better off for it. And they do not have to know it through \ncommon sense; all they have to do now is listen to the CBO, which has \nnow written us a letter. Let me quote from this letter because it is a \ndevastating letter. I just wish this bill was going to be on the floor \nlong enough for it to actually be open to public view and have some \nsunshine on it. It is being rushed through here just before Christmas \nso nobody can see what is actually in it. But here is what CBO says:\n\n       The key point is that the savings to the HI trust fund--\n\n  That is the Medicare trust fund--\n\n     under the [bill]--\n\n  They use the acronym for it--\n\n     would be received by the government only once, so they cannot \n     be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the \n     same time, pay for current spending on other parts of the \n     legislation or on other programs.\n\n  Exactly what this bill does: It spends the Medicare money on other \nprograms.\n  They go on to say--and this is CBO speaking, not me:\n\n       To describe the full amount of the [Medicare] trust fund--\n\n  Again, they use ``HI trust fund''--\n\n     savings as both improving the government's ability to pay \n     future Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside \n     of Medicare would essentially double-count--\n\n  I repeat: ``double count''--\n\n     a large share of those savings and thus overstate the \n     improvement in the government's fiscal position.\n\n  The simple fact is, what is happening here is a scam, a pure and \nsimple scam on the American people and especially on the seniors in \nthis country because Medicare is being cut by billions of dollars in \norder to create a new entitlement, and it is going to have a massively \nnegative effect on the fiscal health of this Nation because we know \nthat new entitlement will not be fully funded and we know Medicare has \n$35 trillion of unfunded liability out there.\n  If you are going to cut Medicare by $3 trillion, as the other side of \nthe aisle is proposing, if you are going to eliminate Medicare \nAdvantage for a large number of seniors--except those who live in \nsouthern Florida--then that money ought to be used to reduce the debt \nso that the Medicare system becomes more solvent. It is that simple in \nthe\n\n[[Page S13809]]\n\nlong run. It is not being done here. CBO has pulled the curtain back \nfrom this game and made it very clear that it is not going to be done. \nOf course, nobody is going to learn this because they are going to pass \nthis bill through here before anybody can figure that out and even \nlisten to CBO.\n  It is just an outrage the way this bill was put together. We all know \nthat. Dark of night, back rooms, deals everywhere, only a few people in \nthe room; those people who really drafted the bill, very small crowd. \nNobody else was allowed in. No cameras, no information about what was \ngoing on. And then you would bring in a Senator here and a Senator \nthere and say: What do you need from me to get your vote, and something \nwould appear in the bill, I guess. Then the bill arrived here.\n  It is not unusual around here to have earmarks in bills. If they were \nwithin the budget and the budget was reasonable, I would even ask for \nearmarks. But this goes way beyond the concept of earmarks--this bill. \nThis bill fundamentally changes policy--that has never happened around \nhere--for one part of the country versus another part of the country. \nIn other words, all of America--all American seniors--will have to live \nby massive cuts in Medicare Advantage. That is a pretty good health \ninsurance program for a lot of seniors; I think there are 11 million \nseniors on that program. All of America has to live by that policy \nexcept for three counties in southern Florida. All of America has to \nlive by an insurance situation where insurance companies are taxed at a \ncertain rate, except insurance companies in Nebraska. All of America \nhas to live by Medicaid reimbursement rates, which are going to cost \nthe States billions of dollars--New Hampshire, $120 million over 10 \nyears--except for Vermont and Massachusetts. And then there is a \nspecial exemption in here for New York and a couple of other States--\nLouisiana, $300 million. That is a total corruption of the concept of \npolicy. Policy in America is supposed to cover everyone. When the \nFederal Government acts, it is supposed to be a policy that affects \neveryone equally. You are not supposed to have little cadres of \nexceptions for those policies.\n  This bill has been called historic--historic--by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. Well, the most historic thing about this bill \nis the fundamental damage it has done to the concept of open, thorough, \nand public debate that was at the heart of the thought process of Adams \nand Madison, our Founding Fathers, when they created the checks and \nbalances system, with the Senate at the center. The Senate was supposed \nto be the place where bills come to the floor, they are open to debate, \nthere are amendments, and you have a process where things get aired and \nthere is sunshine. No sunshine here--no, not at all. This is not \nmajority rule, as conceived by our Founding Fathers in Philadelphia. \nThis is closer to the single-party state system we see in Europe--or \nhave seen in Europe. The minority is ignored, and there are no checks \nin this process on the autocratic rule of the majority. The irony, of \ncourse, is that the bill never went through the public's consideration, \nnever went through committee, and was drafted behind closed doors and \nhas been on the floor for less than 72 hours. As a result, we are \ndelivered a health care bill that has been corrupted by special \ninterests, especially on the issue of policy, that is extraordinarily \nexpensive and has a massive expansion in the Federal bureaucracy, to \nwhich, if you applied the word ``reform,'' you would have to call \nBernie Madoff ``honest.'' The terms just simply do not apply here.\n  Unfortunately, this bill in its present form, I believe, will lead to \nfundamental harm to the fiscal health of this Nation. There is no \nquestion in my mind but that if we load $2.3 trillion of cost onto our \ngovernment, expand our government in this manner, our children are \ngoing to be passed a nation where they have less opportunity than our \ngeneration had. Further, I do not think it is going to help the \nNation's people, our people relative to their health care. I think it \nwill lead to a significant contraction of the quality of health care, \nespecially for seniors but for all Americans, as we lose the \ninnovation, the energy for innovation, and the resources for \ninnovation. As a result, this bill, in my opinion, should be sent back \nto the drawing boards and should be reconsidered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the last few days, as we have dug \ninto this bill and the process by which it was written behind closed \ndoors, we have discovered the bill is chock-full of sweetheart deals.\n  When Americans voted to change Washington last year, they did not \nthink it would be politics as usual here, but unfortunately it has sunk \nto a whole new level. It is painful for me to read the editorials in \nhometown newspapers back in Texas and elsewhere around the country to \nsee what editorial opinion and other opinion leaders are saying about \nthe process by which this bill was written, but let me read a couple of \nlines from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram:\n\n       The tawdry use of earmarks to bury the doubts of \n     recalcitrant moderate Democrats was a cynical display of \n     ends-justifies-the-means horse-trading that President Barack \n     Obama campaigned against as a Senator and a candidate.\n       This was an administration that was elected on the campaign \n     slogan: ``Change You Can Believe In.''\n\n  But when David Axelrod, one of the masterminds of the campaign, one \nof the advisers to the President, was asked about that, he said:\n\n       Well, this is just the way it is. This is the way \n     Washington works.\n\n  I, for one, want to stand up and say this is not the way it should \nwork. I know Presidents campaign for office saying they are going to \nchange Washington, but the truth is the hardest fight is to keep \nWashington from changing you. Unfortunately, it seems as though that is \nwhat has happened here.\n  Rather than listening to the American people, the creators of this \nhealth care bill started with the special interests first. That is \nwhere the meetings behind closed doors started--with the pharmaceutical \nindustry, to cut a deal with them; with the insurance industry, to cut \na deal with them. The insurance industry will get $476 billion worth of \ntax credits from this bill alone, and the hospital industry, and the \nlist goes on and on.\n  Colleagues will stand up and tout the endorsement of organizations \nsuch as AARP that has backed nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts out of \nMedicare because, as it turns out, they are in the insurance business \nand they can sell more Medigap policies when they cut Medicare \nAdvantage, as this bill does.\n  In order to get the 60 votes for cloture on the motion to proceed, we \ndidn't hear high-minded and idealistic debates about what is the right \npolicy for this country when it comes to reforming our health care \nsystem. If this bill could have passed or mustered 60 votes because it \nwas such great policy and the American people were embracing it, you \nwouldn't need to make all the sweetheart deals that were made behind \nclosed doors to induce recalcitrant Senators to vote for cloture, not \nbecause they think it is the right policy but because their State got a \nspecial deal.\n  We know well about what happened in Louisiana and now in Nebraska, \nbut of course there were special deals for Vermont that included $600 \nmillion in the managers' package. We know that in California, the so-\ncalled ``Botax'' has been replaced now by another tax on tanning beds \nat the insistence of one of the businesses named Allergan out in \nCalifornia which led the lobbying campaign to defeat the cosmetic \nsurgery tax.\n  We have heard this is all about keeping insurance companies honest, \nbut the fact is there were special deals here for insurance companies \nin Nebraska--what has been coined the ``Omaha Prime Cuts,'' the carve-\nout from new fees for Mutual of Omaha and other insurance companies \ndoing business in Nebraska that no other insurance company in the \nNation is going to benefit from.\n  Then there is the so-called ``Gator Aid'' special deal for insurance \ncompanies in Florida.\n  There is a $100 million hospital deal in Connecticut--something \ncalled ``U Con.''\n  And, of course, there were deals for Montana that were slipped in the \nbill. Although, you know what, no one actually had the courage to \nmention the name of the State. You had to start to dig into it, like \nthe Louisiana deal. At\n\n[[Page S13810]]\n\nleast the Senator from Nebraska was brazen enough to actually have \nNebraska listed by name. The rest of them you have to dig out by trying \nto figure out: Who benefits from this deal and who doesn't?\n  I want to ask: What about the other States? My State, under this \nunfunded mandate in this legislation, will have to pay the State \ntaxpayers $21 billion in unfunded Medicaid liabilities over the next 10 \nyears. We didn't make a sweetheart deal to vote for bad policy because \nmy State could get some extra money, because I think that is \nunprincipled. I wouldn't do it. But what about the other States that \nvoted for the bill without getting the sweetheart money, such as \nArkansas, which faces an unfunded Medicaid mandate of $335 million; \nColorado, $624 million; California, $3.5 billion--a State that is \nalready nearly bankrupt. This is going to make their situation \nenormously worse, as Governor Schwarzenegger has acknowledged.\n  I am not saying other States should somehow get the sweetheart deals \nthat were negotiated for these other votes, but I am saying this entire \nbill is a bad deal and we need to kill it and start over, strip out all \nthe earmarks, and bring the kind of transparency the President \ncampaigned on and that I think the American people have a right to \nexpect.\n  These sweetheart deals are egregious in and of themselves. What is \nworse--and I have been on the telephone talking to constituents back in \nTexas--there are some people who paint with such a broad brush, they \nsay, Well, we think all of you are corrupt, because this verifies some \nof the most cynical suspicions that people have about government. I, \nfor one, resent it. We have many honest and honorable people who serve \nin public life, and this taints us all with a broad brush and, simply \nstated, makes me furious. I resent it. I resent those who brought us to \nthis position, because I think it sullies the reputation of the Senate.\n  In a moment I am going to offer a point of order, but let me first \nnote that one of Senator Reid's first acts as majority leader was to \npass the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Let me tell my \ncolleagues the name of that again. It is called the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act.\n  In 2007, President Obama, then Senator, said:\n\n       To earn back the trust to show people that we are working \n     for them and looking out for their interests, we have to \n     start acting like it.\n\n  Unfortunately, for the American people, Washington has not yet \nstarted to act like it.\n  This landmark ethics reform legislation required Senators to publicly \ndisclose earmarks and who requested them. Senator Grassley and I have \nboth made parliamentary inquiries about whether this provision has been \ncomplied with, which is now contained in rule LXIV of the Senate \nStanding Rules, and we found that the majority leader has so far not \ncomplied with these public disclosure rules that he himself championed. \nSince my friends on the other side of the aisle don't seem to care a \nlot about this, we have to insist that this provision be complied with. \nIn a moment I will raise a point of order about this violation of the \nSenate rules. We need to force the Members of this body to be honest \nabout who has required special favors and earmarks, tax treatments and \nbenefits in this bill.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  According to rule XLIV, paragraph 4(a) of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate states:\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S13810, December 23, 2009, the Record reads: According \nto rule LXIV, paragraph . . . . . . Senate rule LXIV . . . \nParagraph 4(a) of rule LXIV . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . rule XLIV . \n. .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n       If during the consideration of a bill or joint resolution, \n     a Senator proposes an amendment containing a congressionally \n     directed spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited \n     tariff benefit which was not included in the bill or joint \n     resolution as placed on the calendar or as reported by any \n     committee, in a committee report on such bill or joint \n     resolution, or a committee report of the Senate on a \n     companion measure, then as soon as practicable, the Senator \n     shall ensure that a list of such items (and the name of any \n     Senator who submitted a request to the Senate for each \n     respective item included in the list) is printed in the \n     Congressional Record.\n\n  I would simply inquire of the Chair: Is the Chair aware whether this \nlist of congressionally directed spending items and their Senate \nsponsors has been printed in the Congressional Record?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware if such a disclosure \nhas been made.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, under those circumstances, I raise a point \nof order that the amendment is not in order since it violates the \nprovisions of Senate rule XLIV, paragraph 4(a).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Paragraph 4(a) of rule XLIV requires that the \nSenator who proposes an amendment containing any congressionally \ndirected spending item ensure as soon as practicable that the list of \nsuch items be printed in the Congressional Record. The provision is not \nenforceable and no point of order lies.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to table the appeal of the ruling \nof the Chair and I ask that the vote occur upon the expiration of all \npostcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, last week I had a little fun with an old \nholiday classic: Clemente Clark Moore's ``The Night Before Christmas'' \nwhich you can still find on YouTube, by the way. While I meant this \nparody to bring some much needed levity to the process, the points I \nmade are very serious. For the American people, there is nothing more \nserious than the reform bill we are considering today.\n  The majority's so-called reform package will restructure one-sixth of \nour struggling economy, drive health care costs higher, force millions \noff their current plan, put health care decisions in the hands of \nbureaucrats, cut seniors' Medicare, raise taxes, and hurt small \nbusinesses and cost jobs.\n  There is nothing funny about this health care bill. Americans faced \nwith rising premiums asked for bipartisan reform to make health care \ncosts affordable. But the Democratic bill fails to give the American \npeople what they want, which is why Senator Reid has written bill after \nbill behind closed doors with no Republicans. The majority party \ndoesn't want Americans to know they are getting a lump of coal for \nChristmas until it is too late.\n  But Leader Reid has outdone himself on the latest deal he cut. His is \nChicago-style politics at its worst: a 2,700-page backroom deal written \nbehind closed doors, full of political payoffs, vampire votes in the \ndead of night, all to pass a health care bill before Christmas that the \nAmerican people don't want, that will increase health care costs, raise \ntaxes, and cut Medicare for seniors, operating under an arbitrary \ndeadline which seems designed to minimize transparency, understanding, \nand public involvement.\n  But I want the American people to know what they are getting from the \nmajority this holiday season. I don't want my good friend from Nevada \nto be known as Hurry-up-and-Reid, so let's talk about what is in this \nbill.\n  Under the majority's latest backroom deal, Americans are getting more \ntaxes. This deal imposes about $500 billion in fees and taxes on \nindividuals, families, and businesses.\n  Under the majority's latest backroom deal, Americans who own small \nbusinesses--the backbone of our economy--are getting more taxes and \ncostly regulation. For small businesses who employ a large number of \nthose currently uninsured, this bill does nothing to help make \ninsurance more affordable or accessible.\n  The bill contains a costly employer mandate which destroys job \ncreation opportunities for employers. It doesn't take a rocket \nscientist or an economist to figure out that the multiple penalties \nsmall businesses will pay for full-time workers will result in these \ncompanies forcing workers from full time to part time and discouraging \nnew hiring. Companies are going to have to think twice before hiring \nnew full-time\n\n[[Page S13811]]\n\nworkers if it is going to cost them a pretty penny, at a time when the \ncompanies are trying to pinch pennies.\n  There is also a paperwork mandate which is a new administrative \nburden on small business which, according to the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, will impose a direct $17 billion burden on \nbusinesses.\n  Unfortunately for small businesses, unlike larger businesses or \nunions, the news gets even worse. Unlike large businesses, most small \nbusinesses can only find and purchase health insurance in the private \ninsurance marketplace. That means to insure their employees, small \nbusinesses have to go to the big insurance companies on which the Reid \nbill is placing hefty new fees. Most folks don't have a problem with \nputting more fees on insurance companies. It seems to be politically \npopular, but it is economics 101 that these insurance companies are not \ngoing to suck it up and swallow all of these new fees themselves. CBO \nhas stated so explicitly. Instead, they will pass the fees on to small \nbusinesses that will have no choice but to purchase their services.\n  One of the gimmicks the majority is using to hide the cost of the \nbill is a weak tax credit that is supposed to help small businesses in \npurchasing health insurance.\n  The hitch is that small businesses will only receive the full tax \nbenefits if they have less than 10 employees. If they hire that 11th \nemployee, the tax credit is reduced. At 25 employees the tax credit is \nno longer available.\n  In addition, a small business can only get full credit if it pays its \nemployees an average of $25,000 a year or less. So no salary increase, \nno wage increases.\n  In other words, in what is already a horrible economic situation, \nwhere businesses are shuttering their doors and workers are being laid \noff, we are actually going to punish small businesses for hiring new \nemployees and paying workers more.\n  This tax credit is also a case of bait and switch. If your small \nbusiness happens to fit in the narrow qualifications, it is only \ntemporary--after 6 years the credit goes away--but the mandates and \nburdens on small businesses stay.\n  That is why the National Federation of Independent Businesses, in \ntheir strong opposition to the majority's plan, stated that it:\n\n       will not only fail to reduce and control the constantly \n     climbing healthcare costs small business owners face, but it \n     will result in new and greater costs on their businesses. \n     Reform that was supposed to be all about small business has \n     turned out to be more about big business and other late-night \n     dealmakers, all at the expense of our nation's job creators.\n\n  That is not the kind of reform small businesses can afford.\n  Under the majority's latest backroom deal, Americans are getting \nhundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to critical health care \nprograms, such as $118 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage, as well \nas cuts to hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and \nhospices.\n  When government forced through massive cuts to home health in the \nlate 1990s, the unintended consequences were costly and tragic in \nMissouri. A significant number of agencies closed, forcing patients \ninto more expensive care.\n  One example is in one county in Missouri, the county's only home \nhealth agency closed. The provider had 40 patients they served in homes \nat a cost of $400,000 a year. When those patients were cut off, 30 were \nforced into hospitals or nursing homes. The cost skyrocketed for these \npatients to a staggering $1.4 million on the government tab or a $1 \nmillion larger hit to taxpayers. We don't even know what happened to \nthe other 10 patients who lost this critical care.\n  This is not the kind of reform Americans can afford. Under the \nmajority's latest backroom deal, States are also getting hit hard. For \nexample, the majority's big plan is to expand Medicaid, but their big \nplan for paying for it is to put the burden on the States; that is, \nunless you were able to cut a backroom deal like Nebraska, which leaves \nother States holding the bag for their costs.\n  That brings me to my next point. Under the majority's latest backroom \ndeal, Americans are forced to fund a number of political payoffs. There \nare such a large number of political payoffs, which is why this bill is \nstarting to be dubbed ``cash for cloture.''\n  There is a carve-out for the insurance industry in Michigan and \nNebraska. There is an extra $300 million in Medicaid funding for \nLouisiana, now known as the ``Louisiana purchase.'' What was the \nmysterious $100 million for a ``health care facility'' turns out to be \na hospital in Connecticut.\n  Sadly, this isn't even the entire list of sweetheart deals in Reid's \nlatest backroom deal. That is not the kind of reform Americans want.\n  With Chicago politics and backroom deals such as this, it is no \nsurprise that poll after poll makes clear the American people are \nsaying no to the Democrats' proposals.\n  The latest poll released by Quinnipiac University found that American \nvoters ``mostly disapprove'' of the plan--53 to 36 percent.\n  A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, detailed in a Post article, \nfound the American public generally fearful that a revamped system \nwould bring higher costs while worsening the quality of their care.\n  The American public is absolutely right. Americans don't want this \nbill. In the classic tale called ``The Christmas Carol,'' Scrooge is \ngiven the opportunity to see the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and \nfuture. While the Democrats are trying to paint the GOP as ``Scrooge,'' \nthey would do well to look at what the Christmas future would look like \nif their bill were to pass.\n  We don't want to wake up next Christmas and have Americans paying \nmore for health care or being unable to get it or losing their jobs. \nBut under the majority's latest backroom deal, that is the future.\n  Next Christmas, we don't want to see small businesses that still \ncannot afford to offer health insurance to employees or, worse, small \nbusinesses struggling to keep their doors open because of the costly \nnew burdens in this bill. Under the majority's latest backroom deal, \nthat is the future. A year from now we don't want to hear that seniors \nhave lost access to services and care. Unfortunately, that is the \nChristmas future we face if the bill passes. Christmas future--several \nyears from now--could look even worse.\n  That is why in my ``The Night Before Christmas'' parody it was not \nfunny as much as it was scary and true when I said:\n\n       But I could not catch the holiday spirit myself; how far \n     away from common sense we've been led, our kids and our \n     grandkids have their futures to dread.\n\n  In the last year, my colleagues on this side of the aisle watched \nwith dismay as the wheels have come off Federal spending; a trillion \ndollars of taxpayer money here and a trillion dollars there. Got a \nproblem? Throw money at it. Will historians look back and say the 111th \nCongress is where the decline of American economic power began in \nearnest? I don't want that on my watch. We can reform health care \nwithout spending trillions of our children's and grandchildren's money.\n  If the majority were to bring up a bill that made health insurance \nmore affordable for small business owners to purchase for their \nemployees, that eliminated frivolous lawsuits, that emphasized wellness \nand prevention programs, they could go a long way to solving the \nproblems of the uninsured and underinsured, and they could probably get \n80 or 90 truly bipartisan votes. Instead, what they want, apparently, \nis to take over health care, at a tremendous cost to individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses, and to increase the dependency on the Federal \nGovernment. That is not a Christmas present I want, and I don't want to \ngive it to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his comments. He has \nbeen chairman of the Small Business Committee. Small business plays a \nhuge role, the biggest role, in the economy of the United States.\n  We could have, and we should have, spent the last 4 weeks talking \nabout what needed to be done with small business. It is a big issue and \nit is important. I appreciate the emphasis the Senator from Missouri \nhas put on it through the years.\n  I want to talk about the whole bill today, because a quote I ran into \nwas that ``absolute power corrupts--absolutely.''\n  The Democrats have absolute power right now. Under the biggest \nrequirement for votes, it only takes 60 in the\n\n[[Page S13812]]\n\nSenate. The Democrats have 60 votes. In the House, they have a clear \nmajority of the votes, and that is all that is required to pass a bill \nthere. They are under the impression that they won the election, so \nthey get to write the bills. Never before has that happened on a major \npiece of legislation.\n  Everyone in this country should be upset when the majority refers to \nbills like ending slavery and civil rights and Medicare and welfare \nreform and paint the Republicans as the opposition. Substantial numbers \non both sides of the aisle made those bills possible. I am pretty sure \npeople remember that it was Lincoln, a Republican, who led the fight to \nabolish slavery. Leader Mansfield gives Everett Dirksen, a Republican \nfrom Illinois, credit for the leadership that made the civil rights \nbill possible. In every instance, until now, Republicans have had a \nleadership role and both sides have substantially participated in \nmaking and voting for those laws. In politics, that is how it has to \nwork for our country to be successful.\n  Only one party, and especially one person, ``gains'' from this so-\ncalled health care reform bill. The President will be able to show how \nhe was able to accomplish something against all odds. Why against all \nodds? Because the Democrats of the Senate wrote off the 40 votes of the \nRepublicans. That is right, we were written off from the start. Oh, \nyes, we were allowed to participate to see if we couldn't be persuaded \nto take what the Democrats wanted to write and foist on America. \nAnything short of buying the whole Democratic plan and we could be and \nwould be thrown overboard because our votes aren't needed. We were \nthrown overboard with the excuse of phony time deadlines, when it was \nneeding to do just the Democratic ideas.\n  Senator Kennedy and I were able to work through an incredible number \nof bills because we recognized that both sides had good ideas and both \nsides had bad ideas. The trick was to take as many of the good ideas as \npossible and have the courage to tell some on both sides that their \nidea wasn't ready for prime time. With evenhandedness and both leaders \npromoting the surviving ideas, many of the bills were unanimous on both \nends of the building. Were there flaws in some of the bills? Yes. No \nbill is perfect. On the simplest solutions, nobody, particularly those \nwho have never been involved in that business or that area, can \ncomprehend all of the unintended consequences. But when it is both \nparties acting in concert, when problems come up, solutions are sought. \nWhen bills are done by one party--and no all-encompassing bill has been \ndone this way ever before--when the bills are done by one party, those \ninevitable flaws result in justified finger pointing.\n  You can't change such a basic part of the economy--something that \naffects every single person--by ignoring many who have experience in \nthe business and in the area and not expect major flaws. The American \npeople even recognize the flaws--already. Of course, everybody has some \nknowledge of health care, since it affects us all. When those flaws \ndevelop, and they will, in an avalanche, everybody will point to one \nparty, the Democratic party, and say why did you have to prove your \npower? Why didn't you work to get it right? Why did you have to \npolarize the issue to show you were the only ones concerned about \npeople?\n  Of course, the Republicans will be compelled to pull out the proof \nthat we warned about the flaws but were ignored, because the Democrats \nare focused on proving that they won the election. Normally, there is \nplenty of blame to go around, but not on this one.\n  The Republicans were thrown overboard. That only left the 60 votes \nneeded to pass the bill. Well, you cannot get 60 people to agree on 100 \npercent of anything. You could not get 60 people to agree on a place to \neat dinner. But all 60 had to agree. That is where you have to move \naway from legislating and into dealmaking. That is when you have to \nstart playing games like ``Let's Make a Deal'' or ``The Price is \nRight.'' I don't want to downplay how masterful the leader was. \nEveryone has to be in awe of his ability to give much to a few and none \nto many and get 100 percent to stay on what they can see from the polls \nis a sinking ship. How can a person discriminate between Members, \nbetween States? Usually, we do earmarks in appropriations bills. Now we \nare starting to do them in policy bills. Why? To buy votes. The leader \nis buying votes with taxpayer money for things the majority of the \ntaxpayers will never benefit from.\n  I don't have time to go into the way the groups have made hidden \ndeals for this bill, such as the American Medical Association and big \npharmaceuticals.\n  I don't have time to talk about how taxes will go up and premiums \nwill be up. As an accountant in the Senate, you are going to be shocked \nby the numbers--but not until it is too late. I don't have time to \nexplain to you how the Democrats are planning to spend the same money \ntwice. That is a pretty neat trick, too.\n  I don't have time to explain how the government will tell you what \nthe minimum amount of insurance is. It is more insurance than most \nAmericans have right now. If you don't find a way to buy this better \npackage, there will be fines for you to pay. If the government can \nforce you to buy insurance and force you to buy what Washington thinks \nis the best, what is next? Will they be able to tell you what kind of \ncar to buy? Remember, the government now owns a car company.\n  I hope I have time to remind you we all agree that Medicare is going \nbroke. But this bill takes almost $500 billion of Medicare money and \nuses it to do new programs--new programs outside of Medicare--that will \ngo on forever and need money forever, even after Medicare is broke. \nThey even recognize the problem and form a commission to tell us where \nto cut Medicare. That is so they can shift the blame to a commission. \nBut the difficulty is they have made special deals that take away the \ncommission's ability to make cuts--except to the benefits of seniors. \nThey are the only ones left standing. There will have to be cuts--real \ncuts.\n  They made a deal. I saw a letter from those who said they support the \nbill. For a while, they had a whole year's worth of change in their \npay. Now they have 2 months where they will be paid what they think is \nless than adequate but OK to stay in business. Evidently, they think \nthat even though the Senate turned it down, because they couldn't \nafford to pay for it, $250 billion in adjustments to what they get paid \nbecause it wasn't paid for, and we are going to come back and do that \nwithout it being paid for. It could have been paid for out of the \nMedicare money if they were using it for Medicare only.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Effects of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on the Federal Budget \nand the Balance in the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       CBO has been asked for additional information about the \n     projected effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (PPACA), incorporating the manager's amendment, on \n     the Federal budget and on the balance in the Hospital \n     Insurance (HI) trust fund, from which Medicare Part A \n     benefits are paid. Specifically, CBO has been asked whether \n     the reductions in projected Part A outlays and increases in \n     projected HI revenues under the legislation can provide \n     additional resources to pay future Medicare benefits while \n     simultaneously providing resources to pay for new programs \n     outside of Medicare.\n\n\n                      how the HI trust fund works\n\n       The HI trust fund, like other Federal trust funds, is \n     essentially an accounting mechanism. In a given year, the sum \n     of specified HI receipts and the interest that is credited on \n     the previous trust fund balance, less spending for Medicare \n     Part A benefits, represents the surplus (or deficit, if the \n     latter is greater) in the trust fund for that year. Any cash \n     generated when there is an excess of receipts over spending \n     is not retained by the trust fund; rather, it is turned over \n     to the Treasury, which provides government bonds to the trust \n     fund in exchange and uses the cash to finance the \n     government's ongoing activities. This same description \n     applies to the Social Security trust funds; those funds have \n     run cash surpluses for many years, and those surpluses have \n     reduced the government's need to borrow to fund other federal \n     activities. The HI trust fund is not currently running an \n     annual surplus.\n       The HI trust fund is part of the Federal government, so \n     transactions between the trust fund and the Treasury are \n     intragovernmental and leave no imprint on the unified budget. \n     From a unified budget perspective, any increase in revenues \n     or decrease in outlays in the HI trust fund represents cash \n     that can be used to finance\n\n[[Page S13813]]\n\n     other government activities without requiring new government \n     borrowing from the public. Similarly, any increase in outlays \n     or decrease in revenues in the HI trust fund in some future \n     year represents a draw on the government's cash in that year. \n     Thus, the resources to redeem government bonds in the HI \n     trust fund and thereby pay for Medicare benefits in some \n     future year will have to be generated from taxes, other \n     government income, or government borrowing in that year.\n       Reports on HI trust fund balances from the Medicare \n     trustees and others show the extent of prefunding of benefits \n     that theoretically is occurring in the trust fund. However, \n     because the government has used the cash from the trust fund \n     surpluses to finance other current activities rather than \n     saving the cash by running unified budget surpluses, the \n     government as a whole has not been truly prefunding Medicare \n     benefits. The nature of trust fund accounting within a \n     unified budget framework implies that trust fund balances \n     convey little information about the extent to which the \n     Federal government has prepared for future financial burdens, \n     and therefore that trust funds have important legal meaning \n     but little economic meaning.\n\n\n  the impact of the PPACA on the HI trust fund and on the budget as a \n                                 whole\n\n       Several weeks ago CBO analyzed the effect of the PPACA as \n     originally proposed on the HI trust fund (http://www.cbo.gov/\nftpdocs/107xx/doc10731/Estimated_Effects_of \n     PPACA_on_HI_TF.pdf). CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the act would reduce Part A \n     outlays by $246 billion and increase HI revenues by $69 \n     billion during the 2010-2019 period. Those changes would \n     increase the trust fund's balances sufficiently to postpone \n     exhaustion for several years beyond 2017, when the fund's \n     balance would have fallen to zero under the assumptions used \n     for CBO's March 2009 baseline projections.\n       The improvement in Medicare's finances would not be matched \n     by a corresponding improvement in the Federal government's \n     overall finances. CBO and JCT estimated that the PPACA as \n     originally proposed would add more than $300 billion ($246 \n     billion + $69 billion + interest) to the balance of the HI \n     trust fund by 2019, while reducing Federal budget deficits by \n     a total of $130 billion by 2019. Thus, the trust fund would \n     be recording additional saving of more than $300 billion \n     during the next 10 years, but the government as a whole would \n     be doing much less additional saving.\n       CBO has not undertaken a comparable quantitative analysis \n     for the PPACA incorporating the manager's amendment, but the \n     results would be qualitatively similar. The reductions in \n     projected Part A outlays and increases in projected HI \n     revenues would significantly raise balances in the HI trust \n     fund and create the appearance that significant additional \n     resources had been set aside to pay for future Medicare \n     benefits. However, the additional savings by the government \n     as a whole--which represent the true increase in the ability \n     to pay for future Medicare benefits or other programs--would \n     be a good deal smaller.\n       The key point is that the savings to the HI trust fund \n     under the PPACA would be received by the government only \n     once, so they cannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare \n     spending and, at the same time, pay for current spending on \n     other parts of the legislation or on other programs. Trust \n     fund accounting shows the magnitude of the savings within the \n     trust fund, and those savings indeed improve the solvency of \n     that fund; however, that accounting ignores the burden that \n     would be faced by the rest of the government later in \n     redeeming the bonds held by the trust fund. Unified budget \n     accounting shows that the majority of the HI trust fund \n     savings would be used to pay for other spending under the \n     PPACA and would not enhance the ability of the government to \n     redeem the bonds credited to the trust fund to pay for future \n     Medicare benefits. To describe the full amount of HI trust \n     fund savings as both improving the government's ability to \n     pay future Medicare benefits and financing new spending \n     outside of Medicare would essentially double-count a large \n     share of those savings and thus overstate the improvement in \n     the government's fiscal position.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Congressional Record a December 22 article from the Casper Star \nTribune, by nationally syndicated columnist Cal Thomas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Casper Star Tribune, Dec. 22, 2009]\n\n                               Snow Jobs\n\n                            (By Cal Thomas)\n\n       There were two snow jobs in Washington over the weekend. \n     One came from the sky as a record December snowfall blanketed \n     the city. The other came from Capitol Hill where the Senate \n     labored to cover up the real effects of its massive ``health \n     care reform'' bill.\n       All you need to know about this monstrosity is contained in \n     a paragraph from page four of the Congressional Budget \n     Office's 21-page letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid: \n     ``According to CBO and (the Joint Committee on Taxation's) \n     assessment, enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act with the manager's amendment would result in a net \n     reduction in federal budget deficits of $132 billion over the \n     2010-2019 period. In the subsequent decade, the collective \n     effect of its provisions would probably be continued \n     reductions in federal budget deficits if all of the \n     provisions continued to be fully implemented. Those estimates \n     are subject to substantial uncertainty.''\n       So uncertain are they that the CBO later noticed an error \n     in its calculations and a day later on Sunday, Dec. 20 \n     delivered another letter to Senate leaders that said: \n     ``Correcting that error has no impact on the estimated \n     effects of the legislation during the 2010-2019 period. \n     However, the correction reduces the degree to which the \n     legislation would lower federal deficits in the decade after \n     2019.''\n       The public is being asked to swallow a bill that most \n     senators haven't read, contains cost projections that are \n     substantially uncertain, and touts outcomes that can be \n     reasonably predicted to be nothing that resembles what \n     Democrats are promising.\n       Senator Ben Nelson, Nebraska Democrat and a supposedly \n     staunch pro-lifer, agreed to vote for the bill after, as the \n     Washington Post put it, he got ``abortion language'' he \n     wanted and ``also secured other favors for his home state.'' \n     That's what it's ultimately about: getting favors for your \n     home state so you can be re-elected. Re-election trumps the \n     Constitution and the will of the people, most of whom oppose \n     the Senate and House health care ``reform'' bills.\n       Even one's stand on a moral issue like abortion can be \n     compromised for the right deal. Inserting language that \n     supposedly restricts federal funding of abortion in order to \n     provide political cover to Sen. Nelson turns out to be a \n     sham. According to House Minority Leader John Boehner, whose \n     office wrote a critique of Reid's 383-page Manager's \n     Amendment, ``Everyone enrolled in these (health) plans must \n     pay a monthly abortion premium and these funds will be used \n     to pay for the elective abortion services. The Reid amendment \n     directs insurance companies to assess the cost of elective \n     abortion coverage and charge a minimum of $1 per enrollee \n     every month.''\n       Some defenders of this deal argue that federal money will \n     be magically segregated when it comes to abortion and that \n     money going to abortion providers will be for other \n     ``services.'' Even if this were true--and there is little \n     truth coming out of Washington these days--that is like \n     saying the government won't pay for the actual procedure, but \n     it will subsidize other costs, such as the electric bill and \n     the rent on the clinic's office space.\n       Republicans have done a good job highlighting the multiple \n     flaws in the Senate bill (and the similarly long House bill). \n     Most importantly for seniors, the Senate bill slashes \n     hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to pay for a \n     new-government program. It includes massive tax increases on \n     individuals businesses, which means businesses are unlikely \n     to hire workers at a time of double-digit unemployment. It \n     includes a massive new entitlement program--the CLASS Act \n     (short for Community Living Assistance and Support \n     Services)--which Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad has \n     described as ``a Ponzi scheme of the first order'' and which \n     was recently opposed by a bipartisan majority, including 11 \n     Democrats.\n       To their credit, Republicans have stood together in \n     opposition to this health care fiasco. Their pledge to voters \n     in the November 2010, election should be to repeal the \n     measure and to offer real insurance and health care reform \n     that will not include an abortion provision, new taxes, more \n     entitlements and a bigger bureaucracy.\n       Yes, it can be done.\n\n  He says:\n\n       There were two snow jobs in Washington over the weekend. \n     One came from the sky as a record December snowfall blanketed \n     the city. The other came from Capitol Hill where the Senate \n     labored to cover up the real effects of its massive ``health \n     care reform'' bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a Wall Street Journal article called ``ObamaCare's \nLongshoremen Rules.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n                     ObamaCare's Longshoremen Rules\n\n       President Obama praised the Senate yesterday for clearing a \n     60-40 procedural vote on his health plan in the dead of night \n     and ``standing up to the special interests who've prevented \n     reform for decades and who are furiously lobbying against it \n     now.'' They're furiously lobbying all right--not against \n     ObamaCare but for the sundry preferences in the Senate bill.\n       Start with the special tax carve-outs included in the \n     ``manager's amendment'' that Harry Reid dropped Saturday \n     morning. White House budget director Peter Orszag has claimed \n     that the bill's 40% excise tax on high-cost insurance plans \n     is key to reducing health costs. Yet the Senate Majority \n     Leader's new version specifically exempts ``individuals whose \n     primary work is longshore work.'' That would be the \n     longshoremen's\n\n[[Page S13814]]\n\n     union, which has negotiated very costly insurance benefits. \n     The well-connected dock workers join other union interests \n     such as miners, electrical linemen, EMTs, construction \n     workers, some farmers, fishermen, foresters, early retirees \n     and others who are absolved from this tax.\n       In other words, controlling insurance costs is enormously \n     important, unless your very costly insurance is provided by \n     an important Democratic constituency.\n       The Reid bill also gives a pass on the excise tax to the 17 \n     states with the highest health costs. This provision applied \n     to only 10 states in a prior version, but other Senators made \n     a fuss. So controlling health costs is enormously important, \n     except in the places where health costs need the most \n     control.\n       Naturally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will \n     decide how to measure ``costs'' and therefore which 17 states \n     qualify. (Prediction: Swing states that voted for Mr. Obama \n     in 2008 or have powerful Democratic Senators.)\n       These 11th-hour indulgences make a hash of Mr. Orszag's \n     cost-control theories and Mr. Obama's cost-control claims. \n     Their spin has been that wise men would convene and make \n     benevolent decisions about everyone's health care based only \n     on evidence and the public good. But as the Reid bill shows, \n     politics will always dominate when Washington is directing a \n     U.S. health industry that is larger than the economy of \n     France.\n       Or take a separate $6.7 billion annual ``fee'' on insurance \n     companies that is supposed to be divvied up by market share. \n     This beaut doesn't claim to be anything more than a revenue \n     grab, but at the behest of Michigan Senator Carl Levin \n     Democrats chose to apply it to some insurers and not others. \n     Select companies incorporated as nonprofits will be exempt, \n     even though nonprofits typically have net income exceeding \n     for-profit companies because they pay no taxes.\n       Since this new tax will merely be passed through as higher \n     premiums, the carve-outs mean that cost increases will be \n     even higher for workers whose employer contracts with a \n     nonfavored insurer. These gyrations to tax law are so complex \n     that it still isn't clear which nonprofits would qualify, but \n     the protections are sure to apply to certain insurers in \n     Michigan, Illinois and California. The poor saps stuck with \n     higher premiums everywhere else can thank Mr. Levin and \n     Senators Debbie Stabenow, Dick Durbin, Barbara Boxer and \n     Dianne Feinstein.\n       The press corps is passing this favoritism off as sausage-\n     making necessary to ``make history,'' but that's an insult to \n     sausages. What this special-interest discrimination \n     illustrates in how all health-care choices will soon be made \n     as Washington expands its political control over one-seventh \n     of the U.S. economy.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. It points out how there will be an excise tax in 17 States \nwith the highest costs, but yet we made an exception for a number of \nunions, particularly the longshoremen's union not being subject to some \nof the taxes in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from a number of contractors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 21, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our strong \n     opposition to language contained in the Manager's Amendment \n     to H.R. 3590, which excludes the construction industry from \n     the small business exemption contained in the bill. We regret \n     that this is our first opportunity to address this issue, \n     though the fact that the Manager's Amendment was made public \n     less than two days before the first vote on the matter has \n     increased the difficulty of playing a constructive role in \n     the legislative process.\n       In recognition of the negative impact that a mandate to \n     provide health insurance will have on employers, H.R. 3590 \n     exempts employers with fewer than 50 employees from the fines \n     levied on those who cannot afford to provide their employees \n     with the federal minimum standard of health insurance. \n     However, the Manager's Amendment singles out the construction \n     industry by altering the exemption so that it applies to only \n     those firms with fewer than 5 employees.\n       This narrowly focused provision is an unprecedented assault \n     on our industry, and the men and women who every day make the \n     bold decision to strike out on their own by starting a \n     business. Our members' benefit packages reflect the reality \n     of their business models, and they proudly offer the best \n     health insurance coverage that they can afford. It is \n     unreasonable to presume that small business owners can bear \n     the increased cost of these new benefits simply because \n     Congress mandates that they do so.\n       In the real world, where the rhetoric surrounding this \n     legislation will meet the stark reality of the employer \n     struggling to make payroll, this special interest carve out \n     is simply another bill to pay in an industry that, with an \n     unemployment rate exceeding 18% and more than $200 billion in \n     economic activity lost in the past year, already is \n     struggling to survive.\n       And, we would be remiss if we failed to question the \n     justification for singling out the construction industry to \n     bear such a burden. We are unaware of any data or evidence \n     that suggests that the needs and struggles of a construction \n     contractor with fewer than 50 employees are so different from \n     those of small business owners in other industries, and \n     absent such convincing evidence, we are left to assume that \n     this specific provision is merely a political payoff to \n     satisfy the desires of a small constituency.\n       As Congress moves forward in the legislative process for \n     H.R. 3590, we strongly encourage you to address this onerous \n     provision that needlessly single out small construction \n     industry employers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American \n           Institute of Architects, Associated Builders and \n           Contractors, Associated Equipment Distributors, \n           Associated General Contractors, Association of \n           Equipment Manufacturers, Independent Electrical \n           Contractors, National Association of Home Builders, \n           National Federation of Independent Business, National \n           Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association, \n           National Ready-Mixed Concrete Association, National \n           Roofing Contractors Association, National Utility \n           Contractors Association, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling \n           Contractors--National Association, Small Business & \n           Entrepreneurship Council U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. It points out how most businesses have an exclusion of 50 \nemployees or less, but they have singled out the construction industry \nwith an exemption of 5 employees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Wall Street Journal article that covers that same topic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Dec. 22, 2009].\n\n        Senate Health Bill Unfair to Construction Industry--NAHB\n\n       ``In their rush to pass massive health care reform before \n     Christmas, Senate Democrats included a last-minute provision \n     overtly targeting the construction industry, including home \n     builders,'' the National Association of Home Builders said in \n     an e-mail alert to its 200,000 members Monday. ``In order to \n     find the 60 votes needed to pass health-care reform, a \n     provision was slipped into the health-care bill to exclude \n     the construction industry from the small business health-care \n     exemption contained in the bill.''\n       Employers with more than 50 employees would be required to \n     offer insurance or pay a fine of up to $750 per employee if \n     any employee obtains federal subsidies for coverage. But the \n     builder group says the bill singles out the construction \n     industry by ``only giving construction firms an exemption \n     from the bill's employer mandates if a firm employs less than \n     five people. Every other industry is granted an exemption if \n     they have fewer than 50 employees.''\n       Many home builders are small, private organizations working \n     to survive the worst downturn in decades. More than half of \n     the NAHB's members have fewer than five employees. ``You \n     might as well take an industry that has been a cornerstone of \n     the economy and kick it while it's down,'' said Jerry Howard, \n     the Washington-based group's chief executive. ``It makes no \n     sense . . . and it's really bad public policy.''\n       The NAHB is urging its members to quickly contact their \n     senators to derail the measure. The Senate, however, is \n     marching toward a Christmas Eve vote. The Senate version \n     needs to be reconciled with a House-passed bill, but is \n     likely to form the core of any final legislation presented to \n     President Barack Obama for his signature.\n       If the Senate bill passes and goes to a conference \n     committee with the House, as expected, the House is likely to \n     do most of the reconciling. That's because Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid--after battling for weeks to get the \n     minimum number of votes needed to avert a Republican \n     filibuster--has little room to maneuver. The House passed its \n     version on Nov. 7 on a 220-215 vote.\n       President Obama hopes to sign a final bill before his State \n     of the Union address after the first of the year so he can \n     turn to other issues, in particular the economy and jobs.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Department of Labor recently reported \nthat our Nation's unemployment rate is 10 percent. In States such as \nMichigan, California, Rhode Island, and Nevada, the average rate is \nover 12 percent.\n  Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and millions more go to \nwork every day worried about keeping the job they have. Businesses of \nall sizes are struggling to keep their doors open and are finding it \nharder and harder to make ends meet.\n  Unfortunately, the policies in the Reid health care reform bill will \nonly make matters worse for America's businesses and the workers they \nemploy.\n  When I am home in Wyoming, which is nearly every weekend, my \nconstituents ask me: What does health care reform mean for me? \nUnfortunately I\n\n[[Page S13815]]\n\nhave to tell them that if the Reid bill is passed, their jobs and their \npaychecks will be in danger.\n  The bill being pushed through the Senate imposes $28 billion of new \ntaxes on businesses that will eliminate jobs and reduce wages.\n  Many business owners cannot provide health insurance. They cannot \nafford insurance for their workers or for their own families. They have \nlooked at their bottom lines and understand that they cannot afford to \nbuy insurance and continue to stay in business--health insurance simply \ncosts too much.\n  Rather than addressing the issue and enacting reforms that would \nlower health insurance costs, the majority's health care bill instead \nincrease the taxes that these businesses will have to pay.\n  These are the same businesses that are already barely making it. \nThese are the same businesses that are laying off workers to try to \nsurvive.\n  We know what the new employer taxes in the Reid bill will do, and who \nwill ultimately have to pay the price for this misguided policy. These \ntaxes will eliminate jobs and be paid for on the backs of American \nworkers.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has told us that the new job killing \ntaxes in the Reid bill will lower wages across this country by $28 \nbillion.\n  We have shed 3.5 million jobs since January of this year and the \naverage workweek is now down to 33 hours for the American worker. Yet \nthe bill before us today will actually make that situation worse.\n  The workers who will be the hardest hit by the job killing tax in the \nReid bill are those already making the lowest wages and with the fewest \njob opportunities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \nemployer mandates like those included in the Reid bill would quote \n``reduce the hiring of low-wage workers.''\n  Low-income workers are already hit hard by the current economic \nconditions. These low-income workers typically have less formal \neducation and find it even more difficult to find work. Workers without \na high school diploma have a 50 percent higher unemployment rate than \nworkers with higher education levels.\n  Harvard Professor Kate Baicker reported that an employer mandate, \nlike the one in this bill, will mean that ``workers who would lose \ntheir jobs are disproportionately likely to be high school dropouts, \nminority and women''.\n  This is in part due to the fact that many of these workers are only \nmaking minimum wage. Their employers cannot reduce their wages, so \nconsequently they will either have to reduce the number of hours these \nemployees work or simply get rid of them to make up for the costs of \nthe next tax.\n  Employer mandates and the job killing taxes that go with them are \npaid on the backs of low-income workers. The job killing taxes in this \nbill fall disproportionately on the people who struggle the most--\nputting the jobs they have at risk and making it even more difficult to \nfind a new one.\n  At a time when Americans across this country are looking for signs of \nan economic recovery, the Senate should be debating a bill that helps \nthe situation, rather than a bill that makes it worse.\n  The job killing tax in the Reid bill will also discourage employers \nfrom hiring new workers and growing their business. Any small business \nthat currently has 50 or fewer employees will do everything they can to \navoid hiring that 51st employee in order to avoid these new taxes.\n  I filed an amendment to the Reid bill that would protect businesses \nand their workers from the worst effects of the job killing tax. My \namendment would simply suspend the employer mandate any time the \nunemployment rate goes above 6 percent.\n  Between 1999 and 2008, the unemployment rate was about 5 percent. But \nwhen our economy began to struggle, we saw the unemployment rate rise \nto a point that now we are seeing more than 10 percent unemployment.\n  It seems only logical to me that if our economy is struggling and \npeople are losing their jobs, we would want to protect workers from \nhaving their wages cut and even losing their jobs because of the job \nkilling tax in the Reid bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now yield to Senator Murray from \nWashington--I suggest she be recognized to speak for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the health insurance system in our \ncountry has been broken for a very long time. For far too long, \nfamilies and businesses across my home State of Washington have been \nforced to make some tough decisions, spending nights struggling or \nwhispering after their kids go to bed about how to pay the bills and \npraying they do not get sick.\n  I am proud to say that is about to change. Over the course of months \nof work on this issue, I have noticed it is very easy for this debate \nto tip into the realm of abstractions, to focus on numbers and charts--\nto devolve into petty partisanship or ideological inflexibility. Too \noften real people get left out of this conversation--mothers and \nfathers who are scared they are going to lose their jobs; families \nscared they are going to lose their insurance; people with preexisting \nconditions who cannot get coverage and who know they are one hospital \nvisit away from bankruptcy; small business owners who cannot afford \nanother premium increase and who want to cover their employees but they \ncannot keep up with the rising costs; senior citizens who are forced to \ncut their pills in half to make them last twice as long; people who pay \ntheir premiums and like their doctors, but when they get sick they find \nout that some of the most personal choices in their lives are being \nmade by their insurance companies.\n  These are the real people who need real health insurance reform. Most \nAmericans seem to fall into one of those categories.\n  Over the past few months, I have tried to ensure that the struggles \nof people in my home State are represented in this debate. I told my \ncolleagues the stories that I have received in over 10,000 letters and \ne-mails and at roundtables and on the phone, stories told to me too \noften by men and women with tears in their eyes or a quiver in their \nvoice, people who are not looking for a handout or a free ride but who \nare pleading for a fair system--a system that works for families or \nbusinesses like theirs.\n  I shared the story of Janet from Seattle. She lost her job, lost her \ninsurance, and succumbed to cancer after being forced to wait 6 weeks \nto see a specialist after her throat began to hurt. Janet's story is \nwhy we need to reform the health insurance system.\n  I told my colleagues the story of Joseph and his wife who was denied \nan MRI after complaining of pain in her chest, and only after 3 years \nof fighting her insurance company were they able to determine she had \nbreast cancer and begin the treatment she desperately needed. Their \nstory is why we need real health insurance reform.\n  I told the story of Mark Peters from Port Townsend who owns a small \ntechnology company. He told me he is being crushed by skyrocketing \npremiums. He offers health insurance to his employees. He does the \nright thing. But he told me he just got a letter from his insurance \ncompany raising his rates by 25 percent. Mark told me his small \nbusiness cannot sustain increases such as that; no business can. But in \nour current health insurance system, small businesses are often at the \nmercy of the insurance companies. This company's story is why we need \nto reform the health insurance system.\n  I told the story of Patricia Jackson from Woodinville who has private \ninsurance but cannot keep up with the rising premiums. To provide care \nfor her family of four, Patricia told me she paid $840 a month in 2007. \nThe next year it was $900 a month, and then $1,186 a month, and again \nher rates were raised recently to a hike of $1,400 a month. That is an \nincrease of over 66 percent in just 3 years. Patricia and her family's \nstory is why we need to reform the health insurance system.\n  I told my colleagues the story of Marcelas Owens. Marcelas Owens is a \nyoung man I have thought about every single day since I actually met \nhim back in June. Marcelas is only 10 years old. He has two younger \nsiblings whom you can see in the photo with him. This is his \ngrandmother. He and his\n\n[[Page S13816]]\n\nsiblings have been through a lot. Two years ago, their mother Tifanny \nlost her life because she was uninsured. She was 27 years old. Tifanny \nwas a single mom who worked as an assistant manager in a fast food \nrestaurant. She had health care coverage through her job. But in \nSeptember of 2006, Marcelas told me that she got sick, she lost her \njob, she lost her insurance, and ultimately she lost her life. Marcelas \nand his sisters lost their mom.\n  Health insurance reform is coming too late for Tifanny. But her story \nand the story Marcelas tells me why we need to reform health insurance.\n  Real people, real stories, real needs--that is why we are here now \nand that is why we have to get this done. When we pass this bill, \nAmericans will be able to shop for coverage that meets their needs. For \nthe first time, insurance companies will have to compete for our \nbusiness, for the business of the American people.\n  When we pass this bill, we will end discrimination based on \npreexisting conditions and make it illegal to drop people when they get \nsick.\n  When we pass this bill, we are going to give tax credits to small \nbusinesses and help the self-employed afford care.\n  When we pass this bill, we are going to make preventive services \nfree, end lifetime coverage limits, and cap out-of-pocket fees. We are \ngoing to extend the life of Medicare without cutting guaranteed \nbenefits while shrinking the doughnut hole gap in drug coverage for our \nseniors.\n  When we pass this bill, people such as Mark and Patricia and Joseph \nand his wife will be helped. The memories of people such as Janet and \nTifanny will be honored. That is why we need to reform the health \ninsurance system.\n  I thank the more than 10,000 people in my home State of Washington \nwho sent me their personal health care stories. Their input has helped \nguide me as I worked on this bill and served as a constant and welcome \nreminder about who I am here to represent.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with these families and with the \nfamilies of the small business owners in their States and across the \ncountry who desperately need this reform.\n  Health insurance reform has been a long time coming. But today we \nstand closer than ever to making it a reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 18 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Franken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, we have been working on this bill for a \nlong time, and I am proud of what we are doing here. Every Senator has \nhad his or her chance to speak up and help make this a better bill or \nto make their case against the bill.\n  Unfortunately, it has been a bit rancorous, and I think that is too \nbad. There have been accusations flying back and forth. Umbrage has \nbeen taken. This place has become an umbrage factory. I even took \numbrage once, and I feel badly about that. My colleagues across the \naisle have taken great umbrage because we have accused them of using \nscare tactics.\n  May I point out that the title of the op-ed of my friend from \nOklahoma in last Wednesday's Wall Street Journal is ``The Health Bill \nIs Scary.'' Exhibit A in our case that the other side has, indeed, used \nscare tactics--the op-ed entitled ``The Health Bill Is Scary.''\n  Seriously, when you are talking about people's health, there is more \nthan enough fear to go around. Instead of scaring people, we should be \ndebating the merits of the proposal in front of us. We have heard a lot \nof stories. We all know our health care system is screwed up. We can \nall agree on that. The most important things to know about the bill are \nwhat is actually in it and will it help.\n  You see, this bill is too important for us to hide it from our \nbosses, the American people. We have a duty to let the American people \nknow exactly what we are doing on their behalf. That is why I have been \nso disappointed when my friends and colleagues have said--and I \nactually agree with them--that Americans are confused about what is in \nthis bill. They would not be so confused if everyone was being honest \nand forthright about what is in the bill.\n\n  I have heard a lot of misinformation over the last several weeks: \nsome on the airwaves and, unfortunately, some right here on the Senate \nfloor. Very early Monday morning, I heard a colleague on the floor say \nthis bill is going to add $2.5 trillion to our deficit. That is simply \nmade up. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the official \nscorekeeper of Congress, said the bill reduces the debt by $132 billion \nin the next 10 years. They estimate the bill lowers the debt by at \nleast five times that amount in the following decade.\n  CBO is like a referee, and we all agree to let the referee make the \ncall about what things will cost. It is completely possible we will \ndisagree on different calls the referee makes during the game. I do not \nalways agree with CBO. For example, I do not think they score \nprevention as saving enough. I may be wrong or I may be right, but I \naccept the CBO score because the CBO is the ref. We would not walk away \nfrom a basketball game saying we won if the other team scored more \npoints and just say: It is bad refereeing, we really won.\n  So we may not like how CBO scores certain provisions, but it is all \nwe can go by. These are the rules of the games to which we agreed. So \nif you are talking on the Senate floor, you cannot just say this bill \nwill add $2.5 trillion to the debt when it is not at all what the CBO \nsays.\n  No wonder people are confused. People who are trying to kill health \nreform are deliberately confusing Americans, and it is working. A \nrecent study found that more than half of respondents to health care \npolls say they do not know enough about the bill to give a hard \nopinion. Then opponents use the fact that people are confused as a \nreason to draw out this process.\n  The American people are confused and opponents of this bill want more \ntime to confuse them even more.\n  I have heard a colleague on this floor say this bill would not add \none day--he said ``not one day''--to the solvency of Medicare. That is \nsimply not what the nonpartisan Chief Medicare Actuary found. This is \nthe same Actuary who is often cited by opponents of the bill. He has \ndetermined that it keeps Medicare solvent for an extra 9 years.\n  Colleagues on my side are often making statements that might come \nunder the heading of overselling, saying that for most people premiums \nwill go down. It is true for many Americans, the out-of-pocket costs \nfor better, more secure health insurance will go down. But it is also \ntrue that most health care premiums will continue to go up. It is just \nthat they will go up at a slower rate than they would have if this bill \nwere not adopted. That is a really good thing.\n  This bill is going to pass. So we want people to understand what is \nhappening. We are slowing the growth and the cost of health care. I \nwant to be crystal clear because I do not want to confuse people \neither. So today I am going to try to cut through all this rhetoric and \ntell you about what is actually in the bill and how it will affect you.\n  When I first spoke on this floor on health reform, I related three \nquestions that I hear from most Minnesotans. I heard them when I was at \nthe State fair, when I spoke with tea-partyers. I heard them in \nMinneapolis and St. Paul. I heard them in Willmar--all across the \nState--and on the Iron Range.\n  First, they say health care costs too much; what are we going to do \nabout that.\n  Second, they ask: What am I going to do if I get sick or my spouse or \none of my kids get sick and then someone in my family has a preexisting \ncondition and then I lose my job? How am I going to get health \ninsurance then?\n  Third, they ask: If something bad happens to me, am I going to lose \neverything; am I going to go bankrupt?\n  Well, now that we are about to pass this bill, let me take each \nquestion and tell you how this will affect you; what this bill will do \nand what it will not do. Remember, this legislation is an important \nfirst step but not the final word.\n  First, what does this bill do about health care costing so much? \nLet's take a look at a point Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard physician, \nmakes. He points out that almost half this bill comprises programs to \ntry out different ways to lower costs and improve quality. Some have \ncriticized this as a\n\n[[Page S13817]]\n\nweakness in the bill, but I think it is a strength. Gawande makes the \npoint that when a system is as complex as ours, there is no one-time \nfix. There is not one simple solution. As much as I wish it were true, \nthe whole country probably can't be like the Mayo Clinic or \nHealthPartners or other insurance companies in my State or \nInterMountain in Utah or Geisinger in Pennsylvania. So one size may not \nfit all.\n  But these projects and pilots will generate solutions to fix the \nbiggest problems in health care, such as paying doctors fee for \nservice, which rewards volume and not value. For example, thanks to the \nefforts of Maria Cantwell and my colleague, Amy Klobuchar, and others, \nfor the first time ever we will include what is called the value index \nin the Medicare payment structure. Doctors and States that provide \nhigh-quality care at a reasonable cost will no longer be punished for \nthat. Instead, they will be rewarded for being effective partners in \ntheir patients' care.\n  The bill also calls for all health insurance companies to use a \nsingle uniform standard for claims, as we do in Minnesota now, which \nwill save our State $60 million just this year. There are lots of \nideas, and we don't know which ones yet will work the best. But the \npoint is, all the key elements are in this bill.\n  One program in the bill I am particularly proud of is the Diabetes \nPrevention Program at CDC. I worked on these provisions with my \nRepublican colleague, Dick Lugar from Indiana, who is a hero of mine. \nThe Diabetes Prevention Program is based on what we have learned in \nMinnesota and in Indiana--prediabetics can avoid becoming diabetic if \nthey get access to community services such as nutritional counseling \nand gym memberships. These are proven to cut the risk of developing \ndiabetes in half, so people can live healthier lives and their health \ncare costs less. We will replicate this program across the country.\n  We will also guarantee routine checkups and recommended preventive \ncare, such as colonoscopies and mammograms, are covered by all \ninsurance plans at no cost. No copays for preventive care.\n  I am also happy the bill requires a minimum medical loss ratio, \nsomething I have been fighting for with Senator Rockefeller. This is \ngoing to make health insurance companies put at least 85 percent of \ntheir premiums toward actual health services, not administrative costs, \nmarketing campaigns or profits or bloated CEO salaries. Advocates have \nbeen trying to get these profit restrictions in place in many States, \nbut it is usually too hard to fight these companies on a local level. \nSo while I am disappointed we don't have the public option, the minimum \nmedical loss ratio is a potent measure that will limit insurers' \nprofits and put the brakes on skyrocketing premiums.\n  Diabetes prevention, minimum medical loss ratio, incentivizing value \nover volume--these are just a few of the innovative ways this bill will \nbring down costs. All the basic ingredients for success are here. Dr. \nJohn Gruber, professor of economics at MIT, agrees. He says this about \nour bill:\n\n       It's really hard to figure out how to bend the cost curve, \n     but I can't think of a thing to try that they didn't try. \n     They really make the best effort anyone has ever made. \n     Everything is in here. I can't think of anything I'd do that \n     they are not doing in the bill.\n\n  So when two of my colleagues said 2 days ago: There is no health care \nreform in this bill, well, that is confusing.\n  The next question I hear from Minnesotans is: What if I get sick and \nlose my job, what will I do?\n  This bill reforms the insurance markets, guaranteeing that having \nhealth insurance equals security. Some of these reforms will kick in \nwhen the bill passes, others will kick in 4 years from now.\n  I wish we could do everything at once, but we are making a complex \nset of reforms and it will take time to implement them and generate the \ncost savings necessary to pay for the benefits you will receive.\n  For the Minnesotans who can't afford the coverage they have because \nthey are sick or have a preexisting condition, what will this bill do \nfor them?\n  Well, 6 months after this bill is passed, we will get rid of all \npreexisting condition exclusions for kids, and young adults will be \nable to stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 27. That is \nbig.\n  Within 90 days, families who get turned down because of preexisting \nconditions will have access to nonprofit insurance coverage designed to \ncover people who can't pay for insurance on their own. These are called \nhigh-risk pools, and many States, as well as Minnesota, have these \nplans in some form. The good thing is, this bill will invest $5 billion \nto help people afford premiums in the high-risk pools.\n  In 2014, anybody who doesn't have an affordable plan through work or \nhas been denied coverage will be able to go to a Web site and purchase \ncoverage through a new insurance marketplace called the exchange. No \none will be turned away or charged more because of their health status \nor because they happen to be a woman. It will let you compare plans and \nprices. What you pay will be based on your income. No one will pay more \nthan 10.2 percent of their income toward premiums in the exchange. \nLower income families will pay significantly less. If the coverage you \nare offered through your employer costs you more than 8 percent of your \nincome, you can go to the exchange.\n  There are millions of people who have insurance and are worried about \nlosing what they have; for instance, Minnesotans who work for small \nbusinesses that are squeezed by growing health care costs. Beginning in \n2010, this bill will give small businesses tax credits to pay up to 35 \npercent of their employees' premiums.\n  More small businesses will be able to cover more employees more \naffordably. Then, in 2014, once the exchanges are up and running, small \nbusinesses can choose to go into the exchange so they can pool their \nrisk with other small businesses.\n  These reforms will bring coverage to an additional 295,000 \nMinnesotans by 2019. There should be no confusion. This is real reform.\n  Lastly, Minnesotans ask me: Will I go bankrupt from health care \ncosts? I hear from a lot of Minnesotans who have maxed out their health \ninsurance or who are getting uncomfortably close to their annual or \nlifetime limits. These arbitrary limits let insurance companies off the \nhook and leave you holding the bill when you are sick and need help the \nmost.\n  Fifty percent of personal bankruptcies in this country are due to a \nhealth care crisis. The good news is, within 6 months of passing this \nbill, new plans will not have lifetime limits on benefits and will stop \ncompanies from imposing annual limits on needed care. When the \nexchanges are operational, the use of annual limits will be banned \nentirely.\n  I would like to ban all limits on all plans, new and existing, right \naway. But this is an example of how we have had to compromise in order \nto keep the cost of the bill down so we are being fiscally responsible \nand not adding to the debt. I wish to be very clear on that. When this \nbill is fully implemented, it will give Americans access to affordable \nhealth care so they can avoid going bankrupt when they get very sick. \nThat is very good.\n\n  There is more. We will start closing the Medicare prescription \ndoughnut hole in 2010. We will invest in home visits for new mothers, \nmore loan forgiveness for primary care providers and for doctors who \npractice in rural areas, the Public Health Investment Fund, stronger \nantifraud laws, support for people with disabilities to stay out of \nnursing homes, and funding for community health centers.\n  I said at the beginning of this debate there would be amendments that \nmake it an even better bill and there would be amendments that make it \nless to my liking and, therefore, a less good bill from my point of \nview. But I also said I would only support a bill if it makes quality \nhealth care available to tens of thousands of additional Minnesotans \nand tens of millions more Americans. We have all compromised on many \nfronts, but the bill we have before us is real reform and deserves our \nsupport.\n  The bill deserves our support because Minnesotans and Americans can't \nwait any longer. As Martin Luther King, Jr., once said: ``Of all the \nforms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and \ninhumane.'' We have the opportunity to express our humanity\n\n[[Page S13818]]\n\ntoday, to make our country healthier and more secure for generations to \ncome.\n  I would like to conclude by sharing a letter I received from John \nGoldfine in Duluth, MN. John operates a business on the shores of Lake \nSuperior and wrote to share the requests he had received to donate \nmoney to fellow community members facing financial crises because of \nhealth care costs.\n  John was asked to donate to a cancer benefit for a woman who has \nmelanoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. John was asked to donate to a cancer benefit for a woman \nwho has melanoma, to attend a spaghetti dinner for an 11-year-old with \nbrain cancer, a bake sale for a woman in need of a new kidney, and a \npancake breakfast for a burn survivor. This is what John says:\n\n       As a business owner in Duluth, these are just a few of the \n     requests that we have received these last few years. We have \n     given a donation towards these fundraisers to help people pay \n     for their medical expenses. As I travel the country and go \n     into grocery stores, restaurants and convenience stores, I \n     always take a minute to look at what is going on in the area. \n     Rare is the time that I do not see a fundraiser to help \n     someone with their health care bills and expenses. I know you \n     know how wrong this is, but I am left wondering what some of \n     your fellow Congressmen and Senators are thinking. Maybe they \n     need to go home and look at some of these community bulletin \n     boards. Every time I look at one of these I want to cry. I \n     know how hard this battle is. I know there will be more \n     compromises, but please do not leave empty handed. There are \n     so many people out there that really need some help.\n\n  I am proud I am voting for this bill to provide help for the people \nwho need it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the extra time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague. That letter \nfrom his constituent is heartfelt and should be an inspiration to all \nof us to get this job done. We have sacrificed. This is the 24th day \ndebating this bill. Some of these sessions have been early in the \nmorning and late at night, but I think the time has been well spent. \nPeople have come to the floor and spoken at great length but no one \nmore eloquently than your constituent who sent you that letter.\n  Come tomorrow morning, we will have the official vote--very early in \nthe morning. I would like to say to my colleagues from West Virginia \nand Minnesota that we have a piece of news. A lot of what has been said \non the floor has been said by others and said before, but this is a \npiece of news worth reporting. Our bill--the health care reform bill--\nhas been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the largest \nphysician organization in this country; endorsed by the American \nHospital Association, the largest organization representing our \nhospitals; it has been endorsed by the American Association of Retired \nPersons, the largest senior citizens organization, which focuses \nintensely on the future of Medicare; and today we have received the \nendorsement of what is regarded by most as the most highly respected \nmedical organization in America. If you ask most Americans whom do you \nrespect the most, it is the nurses. You know why. Because when you are \nin a hospital with someone you love or in the care of a doctor, it is \nthe nurse who is with you in those moments that make a lifetime. The \nnurses today have issued their formal endorsement of this health care \nreform bill.\n  The nurses today have Rose Gonzalez, director of government affairs \nfor the American Nurses Association, who writes:\n\n       Nurses across this country have waited decades for this \n     historic moment and the time is at hand.\n       Once again, the need for fundamental reform of the U.S. \n     health care system is critical. ANA and nurses around the \n     country are ready to work with you toward enactment of the \n     strongest possible health care reform legislation.\n\n  For all of our critics from the other side of the aisle, the simple \nfact is this: The people who are on the front line of health care, the \npeople to whom we turn every day for critical care and critical \ntreatment of the people we love, endorse this measure. They have come \nout foursquare for it. I would rather have their endorsement than any \npolitical endorsement we might find.\n  Now let me tell you how this is significant. This bill will change \nmany things. Some on the other side have criticized the bill because it \nis too big; they want a small bill. I want a bill that is large enough \nto treat the problem. It is like saying to a doctor: You can give me a \nprescription but only give me one; I can only take one prescription at \na time.\n  In this bill we address problems existing in our health care system \nthat go to the heart of the challenge that faces our Nation. We have \ngreat doctors and hospitals and nurses. But we spend more than twice as \nmuch as any other nation on Earth per person for health care in some \nareas. Many countries spend a fraction of what we spend and get much \nbetter results.\n  We know the cost of health care is getting beyond us. We know a \nfamily of four with a health insurance plan now through their employer \npays, on average, $12,000 a year for premiums. Ten years ago it was \n$6,000. It is projected to double again in just 8 years. People would \nbe working to earn $2,000 a month just to pay for health insurance. \nThat is before you take the first penny home for your family. That is \nunsustainable.\n  The first thing we do is address affordability, start bringing down \nthe increase in cost in health care. That is our first responsibility, \nand this bill does it. The second thing it does is extend the reach of \nhealth insurance protection.\n  As I stand here, one out of every six Americans has no health \ninsurance. These are not lazy, shiftless people. These are people who \ncan't afford it, who work at a place that doesn't offer it, or happen \nto be unemployed. At the end of the day, 60 percent of those people, 30 \nmillion, will have the protection of health insurance. That is \ncritically important.\n  This bill provides protections needed by the people who have health \ninsurance. How many times have you heard about a friend or a family \nmember who has to fight an insurance company for the payment for \ncritical care that the doctor has ordered, or over a prescription which \nthe doctor believes will keep a person healthy or make that person \nwell? Those battles are now going to tip to the side of the consumers \nof America. Health insurance companies will not be able to discriminate \nbased on preexisting conditions or put caps on lifetime policies or \ntell kids that at age 24 they can no longer be covered by the family \nhealth care plans. All of those things are changed in this bill, giving \nconsumers across America a fighting chance when it comes to health \ninsurance.\n  Last night I met with several of my colleagues. We talked over dinner \nabout how America is going to react to this. It is hard enough to \ndigest the contents of this bill, to expect the average American who \nhas so many other concerns to digest it may be too much to ask. But I \nasked my staff to give me a list of the things that most Americans can \nexpect to see, the changes they can expect to see on a timely basis--\nnot the long-term changes where 94 percent of people have health \ninsurance or would have a better standing to fight health insurance \ncompanies when they complain, but what will we be able to see. My staff \ncame up with a convenient top 10 list which most of us are familiar \nwith from late night television shows.\n  Within 6 months or a year after this bill is enacted into law, here \nare the top 10 things Americans will notice changing when they buy a \nnew health plan: No. 1, if you own a small business you will start \nreceiving within 6 months tax credits to help your business pay for \nhealth insurance for your employees beginning with tax year 2010. Mr. \nPresident, 144,000 small businesses in my State of Illinois will be \neligible for the small business tax credit so that small businesses can \nafford to offer health insurance for the owners of the business and for \ntheir employees. That is No. 1--and this is all within 90 days of \nenactment.\n  No. 2, we are going to create immediate options for people who can't \nget health insurance today. We estimate that 8 percent of the people in \nmy State have diabetes; 28 percent have\n\n[[Page S13819]]\n\nhigh blood pressure, and all of them could be denied coverage because \nof this so-called preexisting condition. We are going to put in place \nhigh-risk pools so these people who can't buy health insurance today \nbecause of these preexisting conditions, have an option, a place to \nturn to, to buy health insurance. That is No. 2.\n  No. 3, and this is good news for every family and every parent: \nWithin 6 months after the enactment of this bill, the parents of loved \nones--3.6 million kids in my State--will sleep better knowing that \nwhatever health insurance they have will be required to cover their \nchild regardless of any preexisting condition. Any child under the age \nof 18 with a diagnosis of diabetes or a history of cancer or asthma or \nwhatever it may be cannot be denied coverage under the family plan, \nwithin 6 months of this bill being enacted.\n  No. 4, you will no longer need to fear an insurance company dropping \nyou from coverage once you get sick. It is called rescission, and it \nmeans as soon as you need the health insurance, the health insurance \ncompanies run away and say: We are not covering you anymore. Hire a \nlawyer and fight us if you don't like that. That comes to an end within \n6 months after this bill passes.\n  No. 5, you will no longer need to worry if you get sick or get in an \naccident because you are out of town and out of the network of \nhospitals and doctors your insurance policy provides. This bill ensures \naccess to emergency care in-network and out-of-network without \nadditional cost sharing beginning 6 months after the date of enactment.\n  No. 6, you will have the freedom to choose your doctor, the person \nyou think is right for you and your family. This bill protects your \nchoice by allowing plan members to pick any participating primary care \nprovider and prohibit insurers from requiring prior authorization \nbefore a woman, for example, goes in for a gynecological examination.\n  No. 7, you will no longer fear losing your home or going bankrupt \nbecause of a bad car accident or a serious illness such as cancer. This \nbill, when it becomes law, will bar insurance companies from limiting \nlifetime benefits and severely restricting annual benefits under health \ninsurance policy.\n  No. 8, this bill will require providing preventive services and \nimmunizations without copay. Mr. President, 41 percent of the people in \nmy State have not had a colorectal cancer screening; 22 percent of \nwomen in Illinois over the age of 50 have not had a mammogram in the \npast 2 years. Health insurance reform will ensure that people can \naccess preventive services for free through the health care plans. It \nmakes sense. It is an ounce of prevention and built into the law 6 \nmonths after it passes.\n  No. 9, senior citizens are going to notice the difference within 6 \nmonths. They will have access to dramatic discounts in the purchase of \nname-brand prescription drugs under Medicare Part D beginning July 1, \n2010. Roughly 314,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Illinois hit the so-\ncalled doughnut hole, the gap in coverage. They are going to have \nprotection. It is going to be provided by this bill.\n  No. 10, seniors across America will be eligible for one free wellness \nvisit each year without charge. Think about that: the peace of mind \nwhich it brings to you and to your family to know that you have had a \ncheckup, and the doctor said you are doing fine and takes care of a \nproblem before it becomes major.\n  Those are the top 10 things to expect in the first 6 months or a \nyear, and more to follow. This is a bill worth voting for. This is a \nbill which finally puts us on record as a Nation that health care is \nnot just the privilege of the lucky and the wealthy. It is a privilege \nof living in this great Nation. It is a right that comes to all of us. \nIf we truly want to enshrine that guarantee of life, let's enshrine in \nthis bill guaranteed access to quality health care.\n  We have had a long debate. Those on the other side have been critical \nof this bill. They have never offered an alternative--not one \nsubstitute comprehensive alternative. They just can't do it, and they \nwon't. But we know we have the responsibility to do it.\n  With votes this afternoon, in just a couple of hours and again \ntomorrow morning, we are going to make this bill a bill that is passed \nby the Senate, on its way to conference with the House, and by the \nfirst of this new coming year, we will be able to offer that promise of \nquality care which the American people are asking for.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagen). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I thank you. I rise today to join \nwith my colleagues, in fact, to stand very proudly with my colleagues, \nin support of the Senate passage of groundbreaking comprehensive health \ncare reform. I have wanted to say that for decades. It has taken not \njust the better part of a year but, in fact, the better part of a \ngeneration.\n  The story of health care reform over the last 50 years has been one \nof narrow incremental change, some quite meaningful--the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, for example--but none truly comprehensive in \nthe way the Americans want to have their health care.\n  It is a history of big ideas left unrealized for lack of political \nwill, for lack of time--whatever--of leaders and lawmakers and the \nmedical profession all trying boldly yet all failing badly; failing \nfundamentally to take away the fear of so many, the terror of living \nand getting sick in America today; the terror of becoming sick in a \ncountry that holds itself out as a beacon of hope, a beacon of \nfairness, yet denies men, women, and children access to doctors and \nnurses, tests and medicines that we know will prevent illness or will \nmake them well; a country that allows people, especially low-income \npeople, but not only low-income people, however, to suffer or watch a \nbeloved family member suffer alone and outside the health care system--\nall at great cost to our national economy and our national productivity \nand our national sense of self-esteem but, even more importantly, to \nour national soul, to our moral compass, to our conscience.\n  Now in the final days of 2009 we have a profound opportunity to \ndeliver on years and years of unmet promises and to begin a new decade \nby building a strong, new foundation for the American people, for all \nof them; to wit, a more secure and reliable health care system that \nworks for virtually all Americans, where those who are uninsured \nfinally have some place to go for health care; where those with \ninsurance know that the coverage they count on and pay for will be \nthere when they need it--they will know that--and where a profit-driven \nhealth insurance industry does not play mercilessly with people's lives \nor steal their hope so that the health insurance company can have a \nvery prosperous future, a very gloomy chapter in our Nation's business \nhistory.\n  Each of us brings to this moment shared stories about the tragic and \ntrying personal experiences of our friends and neighbors back home. We \nare all motivated by this bill. We are all moved by this bill. I know \nthat West Virginia's struggles with the health care system are not \nunique in America, but they are unique to me because I represent them. \nThey are what drive me to work so hard to make things better. That \nnever changes.\n  I talked about the Bord family. The Bords are two dedicated \nschoolteachers with health insurance through their employer whose son \nSamuel had leukemia and needed treatment well beyond the onerous annual \ninsurance limits imposed upon him, without his knowledge, and, \ntherefore, his health insurance stopped producing any care for him at \nall at 8 years old. What was he to know?\n  Samuel's parents were desperate, and they feared for the worst. When \nhe hit his $1 million cap on annual insurance, my office helped his \nparents to find some more resources, but those ran out too. So the \nBords were left with two gut-wrenching suggestions: consider getting a \ndivorce so that Samuel would qualify for Medicaid, or stop taking their \nother two children to the doctor and giving them health care so they \ncould spend the money that they had been spending in part on Samuel--\ntake it all away from the other two children to help with Samuel as \nbest they could. When people are desperate, they try anything. The \nchoices are all cruel.\n\n  So you get a device or you choose one child's health care needs over \nanother's--that is not what parents want to be like. Those are the \nchoices our\n\n[[Page S13820]]\n\nNation offered to these caring, hard-working parents with a sick child. \nHow can that be? How can we allow that to be? The answer is, of course, \nthat we cannot.\n  They did everything in their power, but this fall Samuel passed away. \nThere are no words. It breaks my heart to think of what his parents \nwent through, not only the pain of watching their son fight a terrible \ndisease but also the uncertainty of paying for his treatment as best as \nthey could and then have the coverage they counted on and paid for \nsuddenly cease to exist.\n  I say to my colleagues, when do we say collectively that enough is \nenough? When do we finally step in and try to solve such an enormous \nset of problems? So much is at stake, so many people's needs and \nexpectations are so high, and so are mine and so are yours, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer. I know all too well that reform is not about \nshying away from the tough issues or the tough decisions. Reform is not \nabout reaching perfect agreements on a perfect piece of legislation. \nReform is making things better for people, as much as you can for as \nlong as you can, with as much money as you can possibly collect to pay \nfor it.\n  There are real and serious differences of opinion among us, among our \nesteemed colleagues in the House of Representatives as well--the \nSenate, the House, there are differences. Within the Senate--one side \nof the aisle, the other side--there are differences. Within the \nDemocratic Party, there are differences. We have struggled to find \nsolutions that will make a difference, that we can afford. We have had \nto negotiate and compromise.\n  Now we vote in a few short hours. It is an extraordinary moment in \nhistory. There is nothing like it that I have ever seen. We vote, I \nbelieve, to improve access to affordable and meaningful coverage; to \ncontrol runaway costs--we have to do that so the Medicare trust fund \ndoesn't run out; and to rein in the health insurance industry's \nrapacious and, to me, lugubrious practices. I don't like them, and they \ndon't like taking care of us, and they don't.\n  Am I disappointed that this legislation does not include a strong \npublic option, like the one I first introduced, to keep private \ncompanies honest? Am I disappointed it does not include a sensible \nMedicare buy-in provision that should be a right for millions of \nAmericans? Of course I am. Does that mean I turn my back and walk away \nfrom all of this because I didn't get everything I wanted? Of course \nnot. I am a public official. I represent people, I represent their \ninterests, even as they, maybe in the majority, oppose what we are \ndoing here because they know not yet entirely what is in this bill. But \nwhen they do, they will feel differently. Am I disappointed that we \nwere unable to expand Medicaid even more for our most vulnerable \nAmericans? Yes, of course I am. I live in a State where, in the average \nhospital, 85 percent of all patients are either under Medicaid or \nMedicare. As my colleagues on the Finance Committee heard me say often, \n50 percent of all babies born in West Virginia are born under Medicaid. \nThat is the way it is there for the people I represent. Yes, of course \nI am disappointed that we do not have more, but I still believe those \nare among the best and right solutions in this bill for our health care \nsystem. They are the best we can do at this particular time, and it is \na great deal that we are doing. It is an unavoidable fact that this \nbill does not do everything I had hoped for but, again, that would not \njustify turning my back on what the bill does achieve.\n  Why is it that we always seek out the negative and avoid the \npositive? It is because the negative is easier to talk about. It is \neasier to criticize than to do, than to collect people together under \nan umbrella.\n  The ultimate question cannot be what the bill does not do. It cannot \nend there because in so many ways what this bill does do is make good \non the powerful promise of meaningful reform that millions of people \nhave dreamt of, have prayed for, have fought for, for so long.\n  Passing health care reform will mean 31 million previously uninsured \nAmericans will now get health care coverage. Excuse me, 31 million \npeople--extraordinary. It is in the bill.\n  Passing health care reform will extend Medicaid so that vulnerable \npopulations can get the health care they need.\n  Passing health care reform will close, almost, the doughnut hole that \nhurts 3.4 million seniors enrolled in the Medicare prescription drug \nprogram. Mr. President, 3.4 million seniors is a lot. So we close at \nleast half the doughnut hole, and then we give people a bonus for this \ncoming year. But by closing half, we are signaling that we are going to \nclose it all. Health care now will be done each year, every year, to \nmake things better.\n  Passing health care reform will mean the elimination of preexisting \ncondition exclusions right away for our children. As soon as the \nexchanges are up and running, that will also apply to adults.\n  Passing health care reform will mean it is illegal for insurance \ncompanies to impose arbitrary limits, as they did annually on Samuel, \nor lifetime benefits, such as the Bord family faced so courageously.\n  Passing health care reform will mean insurance companies are required \nto spend more of their money--which comes from premiums we give them--\non medical care, not fancy offices and executive salaries. They will be \nrequired to achieve a medical loss ratio of 85 to 90 percent. We shall \nsee. They will have to prove it. We already have the numbers. We know \nwhere to go to get the numbers. Nobody has done it. So they can play in \ntheir shifty darkness and deprive people of things, take things away. \nPeople do not know where to go to complain, and they just get referred \nsomewhere else. This will be the very first time they are held \naccountable--and they will be held accountable. They will be held \naccountable by the law, by congressional oversight, by a ferocity of \nattention on what health insurance has done to hurt so many people and \nhow, now, they are going to behave in a very different manner whether \nthey like it or whether they don't.\n  Passing health care reform will mean family coverage must include \ndependent children up to the age of 26. That is exciting. It is also \nimmediate. But it is exciting because young people don't tend to get \nhealth insurance because they think nothing will happen to them. It \nactually doesn't work out like that, and when they get hurt, somebody \nelse has to pay. They should have their own health insurance, and so \nthey are going to get it. They will not be outside the health care \nsystem; they will be inside the health care system.\n  Passing health care reform will mean protecting the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP, which John Chafee and I wrote back in the \nmid-1990s and Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch first established through the \nHELP Committee in 1997 in a show of bipartisanship--which, frankly, I \nam nostalgic for these days--which will cover more than 14 million \nchildren by the year 2013. Today, CHIP covers 7 million, but you see it \nhas run out of its 10 years, so it has to be reauthorized. Then we add \non 2 more years, and the program will keep going on and on, and \nchildren will have health insurance forever.\n  Passing health care reform will mean guaranteed prevention and \nwellness benefits for seniors so they can get the regular checkups that \nare so important. It is a big deal. Somebody told me once that there \nare about 9 million American seniors who live alone. In West Virginia, \nit might be on the tops of hills or it might be on some dusty plain, \nbut they are basically alone, by themselves. They are aged, they have \nproblems. Does anybody check in on them? Does anybody call them? Do \nthey have a telephone? Have you eaten your food today? Do you have \nfood? Are you OK? Did you fall down? Did you break your hip? Is there \nsomebody to check? We have to do a lot better than that. Through this \nbill, we will.\n  Passing health care reform will mean we finally begin to get politics \nand lobbyists out of the business of deciding Medicare payments. That \nis very important for me because we can create new hope--perhaps our \nonly hope--for keeping Medicare stable and solvent for the long term.\n  The list goes on and on--real, meaningful, life-changing and in some \ncases lifesaving new laws and new policies that will become law. Not \nsince the creation of Medicare and Medicaid nearly 45 years ago has \nthis body or the\n\n[[Page S13821]]\n\nother body attempted to make a commitment as fundamental to our future \nin health care as we are doing here.\n  Fortunately, this commitment will not end with the passage of this \nlegislation. We will not have to wait another 15 to 20 years to take up \nthe cause of reform. Because of the intensity of the experience, the \npassion of the experience, the depth of the feeling in discussing the \nexperience as we have talked back and forth with each other, this now \nbecomes an annual commitment. We will be doing health care every single \nyear until we get it exactly right. We have not gotten here by accident \nor by chance, and we will not get all the way across the finish line \nwithout more hard work and, hopefully, good will.\n  To those on the left who are disappointed in what this bill does not \ndo--and in some cases, those folks are even calling for its demise--I \nimplore you to reconsider, to be a part of this solution even as we \nkeep working on others, which I promise you I will do, and I think you \nknow that I mean what I say when I say it. To those on the right who in \nall these years somehow have not seen fit to accept any of the various \noptions and ideas that are put on tables for comprehensive reform, I \nask you to seek the facts, find the truth, follow the facts, follow the \ntruth. There are legitimate disagreements between us about how best to \nsolve the problems plaguing our health care system and hurting our \npeople. But the status quo is unacceptable. Claims that we are rushing \nthis process or have operated in secret are absurd. Claims that we will \nhurt seniors, close hospitals, take away people's choices are reckless \nand disingenuous.\n  Our work in this institution affects people's lives every single day \nin all the work we do for good or for ill. In public life, really, \nthere is nothing neutral: you either do something that helps or you do \nsomething that hurts. We have a solemn responsibility to help our \npeople in their hour of need, and that is the reason we are here. It is \nthe only reason we are here--to achieve meaningful reform, not just in \nhealth care but in all other needs.\n  As somebody who has been involved in this debate from the very \nbeginning and fought for strong reforms in the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I know how far we have come to get here. And I, for one, am \nnot going to allow this moment and its great promise to end in \nfailure. The progress will be real. The greatly improved quality of \nlife for millions of Americans will be its measure.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Hutchison raises a point of order that the Reid substitute \namendment No. 2786 is a violation of the Constitution, the point of \norder be set aside until after all postcloture time expires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMontana if, following the postcloture time, my point of order will be \nput in the queue for the votes if I ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is my understanding.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we truly are in uncharted waters. \nThis bill has been written by the majority under a veil of secrecy. We \nare expected to vote on its final passage less than 2 days before \nfamilies across the country will be sitting down for holiday \ncelebrations. Over the last weeks, my colleagues and I have spoken \nabout some of the things we know to be problematic, ranging from \nunsustainable cuts to Medicare that will result in catastrophic \nreductions in care--make no mistake about that--to oppressive new taxes \non individuals, medical devices, prescription drugs, and insurance \ncompanies that will clearly raise costs to consumers and stifle \ninnovation, to taxes on small businesses at a time when we know our \neconomy is on the brink. We are in a recession. We are asking \nbusinesses to hire people. Yet we are forcing burdens on them, taxes on \nthem that would have the opposite effect. It would cause them not to \ntake a chance to hire someone who will have the result of new mandates \nthat go beyond all the expenses of an employee today. We have talked \nabout that for the last 3 weeks.\n  Today I wish to talk about the concerns we have been able to have \nabout 3 days to find on the constitutionality of parts of this bill. We \nhave not had too much time to consider this. Certainly, constitutional \nissues will take much thought. But we do believe some of the bill's \nprovisions do violence to our constitutional protections. Members, \nstaff, and legal experts are scrambling by the majority's decision to \ndraft a bill that we didn't have a chance to look at in detail because \nit only was released on Saturday, and we haven't had very much debate \ntime on these legal issues.\n  I commend many of my colleagues for identifying one of my biggest \nconcerns. The majority claims the commerce clause of the Constitution \ngives Congress the authority to adopt much of what it is we are looking \nat in this substitute before us. What I disagree with and what I don't \nthink has been mentioned is, the power to regulate interstate commerce \nhas not been the basis for a robust role in insurance regulation. Our \nStates have the experience, the infrastructure in place to carry out \nthis important regulatory role. In comparison, the Federal role in \nregulating private insurance has been limited. In fact, following the \ndecision by Congress to exclude Federal agencies from any antitrust \nrole in the insurance market, it is our States that have been charged \nwith providing this regulatory oversight during the last 60 years. Yet \nusurping the role of the States in regulating health insurance is \nprecisely what the substitute that has been put forward will do.\n  Creating a big role for the Federal Government in health care will \nalso usurp States, rights that have been in place for over 60 years. \nConsider, for a moment, that the commerce clause is being suggested to \nallow Congress to not only regulate a channel of commerce that \nhistorically has been addressed by States but for Congress to actually \ndirect the American people to purchase a specific product or service. \nEveryone within the sound of my voice should be alarmed that Members of \nCongress actually believe our Constitution, which enumerates and \nprotects our liberties and choices, can be perverted to require \nAmericans to purchase something they may not want and may feel they do \nnot need. Such a view is totally at odds with our Constitution. I \nbelieve strongly the individual insurance mandates in this bill are \nunconstitutional.\n  The person who has raised the point of order is also on the floor \nwith me, Senator Ensign from Nevada. He is going to cover that area. It \nis essential we address it.\n  I wish to raise another area where I think we also have transgressed \nover the Constitution. That is the trampling of the rights of our \nStates under the 10th amendment. I taught constitutional law. I have \nstudied the background of the Constitution. I have looked at many \nfacets of it. I can't say I am a constitutional scholar. I am a lawyer. \nI have taught this subject.\n  I wish to read the very clear and simple 10th amendment. The 10th \namendment has made clear the following:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively or to the people.\n\n  That is it. The beauty of our Constitution is, it is a very limiting \ndocument. That is why it is short. Everything not specifically given to \nthe Federal Government in the Constitution is reserved to the States or \nto the people. That is the beauty of our Constitution. The reason it is \nshort is because the powers were meant to be limited. What was reserved \nto the Federal Government was meant to be limited because our Founders \nknew the government closest to the people and the people should be \nresponsible for most of the laws of the country.\n  Today, in the bill we have before us, we have a State, such as my \nState of Texas and many States across the country, which have taken \nfull responsibility for creating, maintaining, and providing oversight \nfor a health insurance plan and will now have to justify changes to the \nterms of the insurance plan to the Federal bureaucrats.\n  My State of Texas has created a fully self-insured plan for State \nemployees and for our teachers so creation, administration, and \noversight will be\n\n[[Page S13822]]\n\nwithin the realm of the State. I believe it is very important, when we \nlook at the bill before us, to see that the States now are going to be \nrequired, similar to every insurance provider, to justify with the \nFederal Government changes in premiums. The States are going to have to \nnow put forward all the background, what they are doing in their self-\ninsured plans, and justify it before the States, apparently, will be \nable to go forward.\n  Of course, there is going to be a book written on the meaning of \n``justify.'' I can see it coming. What exactly does justify mean? I \ndon't think we have to go that far to write the book on what justify \nmeans because this is an encroachment on the rights of the States \nguaranteed by the 10th amendment. Not only does it walk away from the \nwords themselves of the 10th amendment but walks away from what the \nFounding Fathers intended; that is, that it is the prerogative of the \nStates to make the laws that affect the people. Even Congress, for the \nlast 60 years, has kept the Federal Government restrained pretty much--\nnot completely but pretty much--from mandates and regulation of \ninsurance plans. There are some, but it has largely been left to the \nStates. The States have provided the infrastructure for what can be \noffered in a State. But here we go. In what is supposed to be the \nreform of our health care system, we are taking away the rights, the \nprerogatives of the States, and also the expertise the States have come \nto have put together and formed through the years. The big Federal \nGovernment takeover is going to begin.\n  Let me mention a 1992 case by the Supreme Court, which stated, in New \nYork v. United States:\n\n       The Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers \n     upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.\n\n  I have asked the attorney general of Texas to use every resource at \nhis disposal to investigate the provisions in this legislation and to \nchallenge any unconstitutional attempt to limit the authority of Texas \nto carry out its regulatory responsibilities in the insurance market or \nto provide for the insurance needs of its employees and the teachers of \nTexas through the State health insurance plans. The attorney general of \nTexas has already said he is going to challenge the constitutionality \nof treating one State differently from all the other 49 and the \ntaxation of our residents in Texas because of the exemption of the \nState of Nebraska from the Medicaid responsibilities that every other \nState is going to have. Of course, every other State will pick up the \ntab for this Nebraska exemption. The attorney general of Texas is on \nit, just like the attorney general of South Carolina and probably many \nmore by the time we will end this day.\n  It is important we also stand on 10th amendment grounds for the \nStates to be able to put forward a self-insurance plan for its \nemployees without the permission of the Federal Government, and I feel-\nduty bound to question the constitutionality of this bill on 10th \namendment grounds.\n\n  Therefore, Madam President, I make a constitutional point of order \nagainst the substitute amendment on the grounds that it violates the \n10th amendment of the Constitution, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the precedents and practices of the \nSenate, the Chair has no power or authority to pass on such a point of \norder. The Chair, therefore, under the precedents of the Senate, \nsubmits the question to the Senate. Is the point of order well taken?\n  The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote on this \nquestion will occur after all postcloture time expires.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. That is my understanding. \nI very much appreciate the opportunity to bring this forward.\n  I think now that we are finally beginning to digest this bill, we are \nseeing several areas where points of order have been raised, and I hope \nsome of these will send this bill back to the drawing board, where it \nbelongs, to have health care reform that will do what we intended to do \nwhen we started; that is, bring down the cost of health care, make more \naffordable health care possible for more people in this country. If we \ncould do that, on a bipartisan basis, I think the people of America, as \nthey sit down for their holiday celebrations with their families, would \nhave been well served.\n  I implore my colleagues to look at the points of order that will be \nvoted on postcloture today and think about the consequences of passing \nthis monstrous piece of legislation that is going to alter the quality \nof life for every individual, every family, every small business in \nthis country.\n  Let's start again and do it right. Doing it fast should not be the \ngoal. Doing it right is what we should pursue. I hope my colleagues, \nbefore we finish this process, will come back with something we can all \nbe proud of and not something that is going to pass on a strictly \npartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to first compliment the Senator \nfrom Texas on her raising a different constitutional point of order. \nThere are several ways in which this bill violates the Constitution. I \nhave raised a constitutional point of order, where I believe this bill \nviolates the enumerated powers under article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, as well as the fifth amendment takings clause of the \nConstitution.\n  I see the senior Senator from Utah is in the Chamber. He is going to \ntalk about several other problematic provisions in the bill that is \nbefore us today.\n  This is the Constitution of the United States, which I hold in my \nhand. There are several other documents in here, but that is how short \nthe Constitution of the United States is--this short, concise document \nthat limits the powers of the Federal Government. Our Founders were \nafraid of a powerful central government, so they put down on paper the \npowers they granted to this body, the House of Representatives, and the \nrest of the Federal Government.\n  When each one of us comes to this floor, after we are elected, we \nraise our right hand, put our hand on the Bible, and take an oath to \ndefend and protect the Constitution of the United States. We do not \ntake an oath to reform health care or to do anything else that we may \nthink is good to do. Anything on health care or any other good \nprovision we want to enact has to fit within the limited powers that \nare listed within the Constitution of the United States.\n  That is the oath, the solemn oath, each and every Senator takes. That \nis what each and every one of us needs to think about when we are \nvoting on this constitutional point of order.\n  I wish to make a couple points very briefly in one area where I \nthink, on the individual mandate, this bill violates the U.S. \nConstitution. Nowhere, at no time, has this government, this Federal \nGovernment, ever passed a law that requires people who do nothing to \nengage in economic activity. In other words, if this bill passes and \nthen you choose not to buy health insurance, this bill requires you to \npurchase health insurance. If you do not do that, it charges you up to \n2 percent of your income. So this bill is telling you, just because you \nexist as a citizen of the United States, you must do something.\n  The United States has never, in its history, ever passed something \nsuch as this. This will dramatically expand the powers of the Federal \nGovernment, if this bill is passed, and if, God forbid, the Supreme \nCourt upholds this piece of legislation.\n  I have read a lot of articles--and I submitted several of them \nyesterday--by constitutional scholars, who believe this bill is \nunconstitutional. Even folks who believe it is constitutional, some \nfolks on the left, concede that there are legitimate arguments against \nthe bill's constitutionality. They also recognize that there is \npotential that it is unconstitutional. So this is not some wild-eyed \nradical debate. This is a legitimate debate about what this document, \nthis Constitution of the United States, actually means.\n  I am not a lawyer similar to a lot of the other Members of the \nSenate, but I understand the importance of a pretty plain reading of \nthe Constitution's text.\n\n[[Page S13823]]\n\n  Within the enumerated powers, and within the fifth amendment, there \nare limitations on what this Congress can do. The Supreme Court has \nheld that the interstate commerce clause, for instance--gives this body \ncertain power to regulate commercial activity. Even activity of an \nindividual that is intrastate in nature can be regulated if it has the \npotential to somehow substantially affect interstate commerce.\n  Unfortunately, this bill goes beyond even regulating any kind of \ncommercial activity. It goes to regulating noneconomic inactivity. It \nsays: If you choose not to do something, we are going to regulate you \nand we are going to tax you if you do not behave. This is a very \ndangerous precedent for the Congress to set. I made the point \nyesterday; others have made this point--if we could just require \ncitizens to purchase certain things, why did we need a cash-for-\nclunkers bill? The reality is we lack the power to just tell people: Go \nout and buy a car.\n  The government is allowed to provide certain incentives for people to \ndo activity that maybe they were not going to do. But Congress does not \nhave the power to actually tell citizens what to do, in that case, to \nregulate inactivity.\n  There are all kinds of things this government could tell people what \nto do if something such as this precedent is upheld today. This is \nincredibly dangerous, and the people of America need to wake up and the \npeople who are voting for this bill need to analyze the unintended \nconsequences and the massive expansion of power this bill will provide \nfor, if this bill passes, and if the Supreme Court does not strike it \ndown.\n  I am going to yield because I have listened to the senior Senator \nfrom Utah talk eloquently about the provisions that are \nunconstitutional. He is much more of a constitutional scholar than I \nwould ever dream to be. I hope everybody pays close attention to what \nhe is saying and thinks about that oath each one of us made when we \nraised our right hand to defend and uphold the Constitution. Are we \ndoing that if we vote for this bill?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my gracious colleague, and I am \ngrateful for his kind words.\n  Each Member of this body has taken an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States. Not any Constitution, not their own \npersonal Constitution, not a fake or pretend Constitution, but the real \nConstitution of the United States. That means that there will come \ntimes when politics says yes, but the Constitution says no. There will \ncome times when the grand plans and good intentions of politicians meet \nthe limits of the Constitution. I submit that this is one of those \ntimes, and the constitutional point of order raised by the Senator from \nNevada presents each of us with the choice of whether politics or the \nConstitution will win the day. I choose the Constitution and will vote \nto support the point of order.\n  America's founders gave us a written Constitution that delegates \ncertain powers to the Federal Government, separates those powers among \nthree branches, and enumerates the powers given to Congress. They did \nall of that writing, delegating, separating, and enumerating for one \noverriding reason, to set limits on Federal Government power because \nliberty cannot survive without such limits. As Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor reaffirmed in 1991 when writing the Supreme Court's opinion in \nGregory v. Ashcroft, our system of federalism and the separation of \npowers ``was adopted by the Framers to ensure the protection of our \nfundamental liberties.' '' Liberty requires limits on government power, \nit always has and it always will. The question for us today is whether \nliberty is still more important than power.\n  The Members of this body have our own, independent responsibility to \nensure that the actions we take are consistent with the Constitution we \nhave sworn to support and defend. We cannot simply assume that the \nConstitution necessarily allows us to do whatever we may want to do. \nAnd we cannot ignore this question by simply punting it to the courts. \nLitigation is likely, to be sure, which means that the courts will be \nasked to decide certain legal questions, including whether this \nlegislation is constitutional. Judges also take an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution and must exercise the powers it grants to them. \nSpeculating about how courts may decide a hypothetical case in the \nfuture, however, is no substitute for Senators making a decision about \nan actual piece of legislation today.\n  The Constitution cannot limit government if government controls the \nConstitution. If the Constitution means whatever we want it to mean, \nthen we might as well take an oath to support and defend ourselves. \nFrankly, that is what it seems like we do sometimes. But we cannot take \nthe power the Constitution provides without the limits the Constitution \nsets.\n  Turning to the legislation before us, we all want to see a higher \npercentage of Americans covered by health insurance. That is a \ndesirable goal, but my friends on the other side of the aisle would \nachieve that goal with a very blunt instrument, an order that Americans \npurchase health insurance. That is a means that the Constitution does \nnot permit. While the Constitution gives Congress power to regulate \ninterstate commerce, that power does not mean anything and everything \nwe want to mean. Those words are not infinitely malleable. I agree with \nthe 75 percent of Americans who say that this mandate to purchase \nhealth insurance is unconstitutional because Congress's power to \nregulate interstate commerce does not include telling Americans what \nthey must buy.\n  When President Franklin D. Roosevelt chose Frances Perkins as his \nSecretary of Labor, they discussed social policy legislation including \nhealth insurance. As Secretary Perkins later described it, they agreed \nthat such legislation would pose ``very severe constitutional \nproblems,'' including fundamentally altering Federal-State \nrelationships. That is why the Social Security Act uses the payroll \ntax. Even the Roosevelt administration, which oversaw the most dramatic \nexpansion of federal power in our Nation's history, would not go as far \nas the legislation before us today would go. Even they knew that the \nConstitution put certain means off limits.\n  The goal of raising the percentage of Americans with health insurance \ncould be achieved by constitutionally permissible means. My friends on \nthe other side of the aisle know as well as I do, however, that those \nmeans are politically impossible. And so they have chosen politics over \nthe Constitution, and that is why I will support the constitutional \npoint of order.\n  In 1995, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that there are indeed limits on \nthe means Congress may use to achieve its goals. The Court rejected a \nversion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that would make it \nhard to imagine any activity by individuals that Congress could not \nregulate. The legislation before us would not only regulate economic \ntransactions in which individuals choose to engage, it would require \nthat they engage in those transactions. This is the first time that \nCongress has ever ordered Americans to use their own money to purchase \na particular good or service. Crossing that line would do exactly what \nthe Supreme Court said we may not do, and would virtually eliminate \nwhatever limits remain on federal government power. That would deprive \nthe Constitution not only of its meaning, but of its function as a \nguardian of liberty. I urge my colleagues to put the Constitution ahead \nof politics and support this point of order.\n  There is a lot of talk from the majority about why passing this bill \nis the right thing to do for the American people. It is a decision of \nconscience for them. Well, let us take a closer look at these decisions \nof conscience.\n  After weeks of closed-door, clandestine negotiations, Senator Reid \nfinally emerged with a 383-page Christmas list. This bill is a dark \nexample of everything that is wrong with Washington today. Despite all \nthe promises of accountability and transparency, this bill is a grab \nbag of Chicago-style, backroom buyoffs. It is nothing more than a \nprivate game of ``Let's Make A Deal'' with the special interest groups \nfinanced by American taxpayers.\n  So who won and who lost in this game? Well, let's take a closer look. \nThe AARP issued a strong statement of support for this bill. The Reid \nbill slashes Medicare by almost a $\\1/2\\ trillion to finance additional \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S13824]]\n\nspending. So why would the Nation's largest lobbying organization, \navowed to protect the interests of seniors, support this legislation? \nTo find the answer, similar to anything else in Washington, follow the \nmoney.\n  AARP takes in more than half its $1.1 billion budget in royalty fees \nfrom health insurers and other vendors. The sale of supplementary \nMedicare policies, called Medigap plans, make up a major share of this \n$1.1 billion royalty revenue. AARP has a direct interest in selling \nmore Medigap plans. However, there is a strong competitor to Medigap \npolicies, and that happens to be the Medicare Advantage plans.\n  These private plans provide comprehensive coverage, including vision \nand dental care, at lower premiums for nearly 11 million seniors across \nthe country. Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage do not need Medigap \npolicies. So what happens when the Reid bill slashes this program by \nalmost $120 billion? That is with a ``b.''\n  Look at the Washington Post front-page story from October 27, \nquestioning whether AARP has a conflict of interest. I quote:\n\n       Democratic proposals to slash reimbursements for . . . \n     Medicare Advantage are widely expected to drive up demand for \n     private Medigap policies like the ones offered by AARP, \n     according to health-care experts, legislative aides and \n     documents.\n\n  One of the most disturbing developments in the Reid bill has been the \nperpetuation and even the doubling of the unconstitutional mandate tax \nfrom $8 billion to $15 billion. You heard me right. This \nunconstitutional mandate tax actually doubled behind closed doors. I \nhave long argued that forcing Americans to either buy a Washington-\ndefined level of coverage or face a tax penalty collected through the \nInternal Revenue Service is highly unconstitutional.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side about Republicans \ndefending the big, evil insurance companies while they are the \ndefenders of American families. The insurance mandate is a clear \nexample of this partisan hypocrisy. Let me ask one simple question. Who \nwould benefit the most from this unprecedented, unconstitutional \nmandate to purchase insurance or face a stiff penalty enforced by our \nfriends at the Internal Revenue Service?\n  The answer is pretty simple. There are two clear winners under this \ndraconian policy--and neither is the American family. The first winner \nis the Federal Government, which could easily use this authority to \nincrease the penalty--or impose similar ones--to create new streams of \nrevenue to fund more out-of-control spending.\n  Second, the insurance companies are the most direct winners under \nthis individual insurance mandate because it would force millions of \nAmericans who would not otherwise do so to become their customers. I \ncannot think of a bigger giveaway for insurance companies than the \nFederal Government ordering Americans to buy their insurance products. \nIf you do not believe me, then just look at the stock prices of the \ninsurance companies that have recently shot to their 52-week highs.\n  Jane Hamsher, the publisher of the very liberal blog Firedoglake, \nsaid the following in a recent posting:\n\n       Having to pay 2 percent of their income in annual fines for \n     refusing to comply with the IRS acting as the collection \n     agency just might wind up being the most widely hated \n     legislation of the decade. Barack Obama just might achieve \n     the bipartisan unity on health care he always wanted--\n     Democrats and Republicans are coming together to say ``kill \n     this bill.''\n\n  Now that we clearly understand the huge windfalls the Reid bill \nprovides AARP and insurance companies, let me take a moment to talk \nabout the winners and losers in the so-called abortion compromise.\n  The language to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to fund \nabortions is completely unacceptable. The new abortion provisions are \nsignificantly weaker than the amendment I introduced with Senator Ben \nNelson to ensure that the Hyde amendment, which prohibits use of \nFederal dollars for elective abortions, applies to any new Federal \nhealth programs created in this bill. The Hyde amendment has been \npublic law since 1976.\n  The so-called abortion compromise does not stop there. The Reid bill \ncreates a State opt-out charade. However, this provision does nothing \nabout one State's tax dollars paying for abortions in other States. Tax \ndollars from Nebraska can pay for abortions in California or New York.\n  This bill also creates a new public option run by the Office of \nPersonnel Management that will, for the first time, create a federally \nfunded and managed plan that will cover elective abortions.\n  When you have Senator Boxer, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, and Speaker Pelosi, the distinguished Speaker of the House \nof Representatives--two of the largest pro-abortion advocates in the \nCongress--supporting this sham so-called compromise and everyone from \nthe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to the National Right to Life \nCommittee and the Family Research Council opposing it, there is only \none clear loser, and that is the majority of Americans who believe in \nthe sanctity of life and oppose the use of Federal dollars for elective \nabortions.\n  Last, but not least, I wish to spend a couple of minutes talking \nabout the numerous special deals conferred on States in this $2.5 \ntrillion spending bill.\n  How hefty are the price tags for decisions of conscience? Here are \nsome highlights: $300 million for Louisiana, $600 million for Vermont, \n$500 million for Massachusetts, $100 million for Nebraska, and that is \njust the beginning.\n  At a recent news conference, when the authors of this legislation \nwere asked about the Nebraska earmark for Medicaid funding, the \nmajority leader simply replied:\n\n       A number of States are treated differently than other \n     States. That's what legislation is all about. That's \n     compromise.\n\n  The next logical question is pretty straightforward: Who will pay for \nthese special deals? The answer is simple: Every other State in the \nUnion will pay for these special deals, including my home State of \nUtah. All of these States that are collectively facing $200 billion in \ndeficits and are cutting jobs and educational services to survive will \nnow pay to support these special deals.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicaid expansion \nin the Reid bill creates a $26 billion unfunded mandate on our cash-\nstrapped States.\n  Coincidentally, only one State avoids this unfunded mandate; that is, \nthe State of Nebraska.\n  Of course, let's not forget about the biggest loser in this bill: the \nhard-working American taxpayer. This bill imposes over $\\1/2\\ trillion \nworth of new taxes, fees, and penalties on individuals, families, and \nbusinesses. The new fees begin in 2010, while the major coverage \nprovisions do not start until 2014. Almost $57 billion in new taxes are \ncollected before any American sees the major benefits of this bill, \nwhich are largely delayed until 2014, assuming they are benefits at \nall.\n  It is also no coincidence that through the use of these budget \ngimmicks, the majority can claim this bill reduces our national deficit \nwhen we all know these reductions will never, ever be realized.\n  Based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan \ncongressional scorekeeper, this bill would break another one of \nPresident Obama's campaign promises by increasing taxes on 42 million \nindividuals and families making less than $250,000 a year. At a time \nwhen we are struggling to fight a double-digit unemployment rate, the \nReid bill not only increases payroll taxes by nearly $87 billion but \nalso imposes $28 billion in new taxes on employers that do not provide \ngovernment-approved health plans. These new taxes will ultimately be \npaid by American workers in the form of reduced wages and lost jobs.\n  However, it is hard to say we didn't see these new taxes coming. For \nyears now, many of us have warned that the out-of-control spending in \nWashington would eventually have to be repaid on the backs of American \nfamilies. In this bill, the repayment comes in the form of stifled \neconomic growth, lost jobs, and new and increasing taxes--and they are \njust the first installment of what will be a long and painful extortion \nof taxpayers if Congress doesn't stand up and stop these terrible \nbills. According to a recent study of similar proposals by the Heritage \nFoundation, these new job-killing taxes will place approximately 5.2 \nmillion low-income workers at risk of losing their jobs or having their \nhours reduced and an additional 10.2 million workers would see lower \nwages and reduced benefits.\n\n[[Page S13825]]\n\n  Poll after poll tells us about the growing opposition against this \ntax-and-spend health care bill. The latest Rasmussen poll shows that 55 \npercent of Americans are now opposed to this bill. The CNN poll is an \neven higher 61 percent. Among senior citizens, the group most likely to \nuse the health care system, only 33 percent are in favor while 60 \npercent are opposed. Independent voters are also opposed 2 to 1. \nOpposition in certain State polls such as Nebraska is even higher at 67 \npercent.\n  So what is the majority doing to address these concerns? Nothing. In \nfact, despite the efforts by many of us here on this side of the aisle \nto express our substantive policy disagreements for months, one Senator \nrecently said the following:\n\n       They are desperate to break this President. They have \n     ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the very \n     election of President Barack Obama. The birthers, the \n     fanatics, the people running around in right-wing militia and \n     Aryan support groups, it is unbearable to them that President \n     Barack Obama should exist.\n\n  That statement is outrageous. It was made by a very dear friend of \nmine, and I know he probably didn't mean it the way it comes out, but \nit is outrageous.\n  Instead of listening to the policy concerns of a majority of \nAmericans, the other side is simply dismissing them as rants from the \nfar right. If the majority refuses to listen to what Americans are \ntelling them now, I am sure they are going to have a rude wake-up call \nlater. It should come as no surprise that this kind of arrogance and \npower has led to congressional approval ratings rivaling the most hated \ninstitutions on the planet at a dismal 22 percent and falling.\n  One of the biggest tragedies of letting this bill move forward is \nthat it will do nothing to address the fundamental issue of rising \nhealth care costs in this country. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO, this bill will actually raise our national health \ncare costs by $200 billion. The administration's own Actuary at the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, agrees with this \nassessment.\n  When this bill fails to work, Americans will no longer have anything \nin Congress to effectively address the issue of health care reform. The \nopportunity to save Medicare and Medicaid from their impending \nfinancial collapse will be lost for another generation.\n\n  The historic blizzard in Washington earlier this month was the \nperfect symbol of the anger and frustration brewing in the hearts of \nthe American people against this bill. I urge the majority once again \nto listen to the voices of the American people. Every vote for this \nbill is the 60th vote. Let me repeat that again. Every vote for this \nbill is the 60th vote. My Republican colleagues and I are united with \nthe American people in our fight against this $2.5 trillion tax-and-\nspend bill. I implore my colleagues not to do this to the American \npeople. Don't foreclose on their futures. Don't stick them with even \nmore government spending and more government intrusion.\n  We can fix health care. Many of us have been working to do just that \nfor many years. A truly bipartisan bill that would garner 75 to 80 \nvotes, which has always been the case in the past on these major pieces \nof legislation in the Senate, would be fiscally sound and provide the \nAmerican people with the fixes they are asking for in the health care \nmarketplace, and it would be easily achievable if we would just open \nour hearts and work together. Many of us are standing at the ready, and \nhave been for months, to step forward and pass meaningful health care \nreform that truly would help American families and please American \ntaxpayers. To date, we have been rebuffed by an unfailing determination \nby a few to pursue a nearly Socialist agenda.\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who do not \nbelieve in the Europeanization of America, who believe in doing truly \nbipartisan work here in the Senate, to step forward and vote against \nadvancing this bill and work with those of us on this side of the aisle \nwho are committed to making a difference to craft a health care reform \nbill they can be proud to support.\n  Having said that, I do praise my colleague and friend from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, who literally did try for months in many meetings with \nfirst the Gang of 7--I was in that and then finally decided I could not \nsupport what they were going to come up with and expressed to my \ncolleagues that I would have to in good conscience leave the \nnegotiations. He tried, but he was too restricted in what he really \ncould do, so that in the end no Republican supported what was done. We \nhad a totally Democratic bill in the HELP Committee, a totally \nDemocratic bill with the Pelosi bill in the House, and the Reid bill \nhas been done in back rooms here with the White House, with very few \neven Democrats involved, and many of the things some of my friends \nworked so hard to get in the bill were no longer in it.\n  Let me just say there are good people in this body on both sides of \nthe floor, but I have suggested in times past and I suggest it again: \nIf you can't get 75 or 80 votes for a bill that affects every American, \nthat is one-sixth of the American economy, then you know that bill is a \nlousy bill.\n  There are many on our side of the aisle who have stood ready, \nwilling, and able to try to do something in a bipartisan way. I have \nspent 33 years here, and I have participated in a bipartisan way to \nhelp bring both sides together on all kinds of health care bills that \nwork. This one would work, too, if we would just work in a bipartisan \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to make a couple of points \nregarding the constitutional point of order I raised on the individual \nmandate.\n  Some folks have said that States mandate car insurance, that is \nrequire people who drive to carry car insurance; therefore, the Federal \nGovernment can mandate the purchasing of health insurance to \nindividuals. Well, I think that should be pretty obvious that States \ncan do things that the Federal Government cannot. The Constitution \nlimits the Federal Government as to what it can do and it reserves the \npower for the States and/or the people. Senator Hutchison raised this \nexact point in her constitutional point of order relating to the 10th \namendment.\n  So this mandate of buying car insurance--comparing it to the mandate \nto buy health insurance from the Federal Government is a false \ncomparison. The Federal Government cannot mandate you to buy car \ninsurance, nor can it mandate you to buy health insurance. It is not \nwithin the enumerated powers given to this body and to this Federal \nGovernment in the Constitution.\n  This bill is a real threat to liberty because of the precedent it \nsets on the Federal Government being able to tell individuals what to \ndo.\n  I wish to quote from a couple of articles that have been written. \nThis one was written by David Rivkin and Lee Casey. I am quoting:\n\n       But Congress cannot so simply avoid the constitutional \n     limits on its power. Taxation can favor one industry or \n     course of action over another, but a ``tax'' that falls \n     exclusively on anyone who is uninsured is a penalty beyond \n     Congress's authority. If the rule were otherwise, Congress \n     could evade all constitutional limits by ``taxing'' anyone \n     who doesn't follow an order of any kind--whether to obtain \n     health-care insurance [in this case] . . . or even to eat \n     your vegetables.\n\n  It literally sets the precedent to dramatically expand the powers of \nthe Federal Government far beyond anything our Founders wrote and \nlimited this Congress to doing in the Constitution.\n  I see the Republican whip here, and I wish to yield to him because of \nhis expertise on the Constitution.\n  I want to make a real quick point reading from another article. I \ncommend this article to our colleagues by Randy Barnett and Nathaniel \nStewart and Todd Gaziano. It said:\n\n       Never in the nation's history has the commerce power been \n     used to require a person who does nothing to engage in \n     economic activity.\n\n  There are constitutional experts out there telling us this bill is \ndoing something the Federal Government has never done in its history. \nSo I go back to this United States Constitution.\n  When we take an oath to defend the Constitution, we better take that \nas a solemn oath and think about whether we are violating that oath we \nswore to uphold and defend when we are voting on this bill.\n  You must uphold this constitutional point of order. It is not just up \nto the\n\n[[Page S13826]]\n\nSupreme Court; it is up to us. We don't just say we will pass anything, \nwhether it is constitutional or not, and let the Supreme Court decide. \nThat is the oath we take. It is our responsibility to uphold and defend \nthe Constitution. We must think about that when we are passing \nsomething here. That is the reason we have this authority to bring a \nconstitutional point of order, so that this body considers whether it \nis constitutional. That is why we must consider the consequences of \ngreatly expanding the powers of the Federal Government in this bill, \nwhich are so dramatic that the threat to liberty is very real.\n  I yield the floor to the Republican whip so he can make some \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I compliment my colleague who has raised a \nmost important constitutional point. It is true, as Senators, we have \nan obligation not just to throw questions to the Supreme Court but to \nuse our best judgment as to whether we would be violating the \nConstitution by adopting them.\n  I think the point of order he raises with respect to the 10th \namendment is a very important question and should be carefully \nconsidered by our colleagues. I think you can only come to one \nconclusion. I support what he is trying to do.\n  I also want to make another point, which is that around the country \npeople are calling in and raising questions about other aspects of the \nbill, also raising similar questions--the imposition of a supermajority \nrule, for example. Can one Congress bind another in that regard? We are \nonly now learning of all of these things, and our constituents are only \nlearning of them because the most recent amendment was filed just a few \ndays ago.\n  As we read through it and begin to realize its implications, a lot of \nquestions are being raised. The question I want to raise today goes \nright to the heart of the claim that supporters have made for this \nlegislation; that is, that it reduces the Federal budget deficit. Many \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: I could not vote \nfor this bill if it did not reduce the Federal budget deficit, or at \nleast if it were not deficit neutral.\n  It turns out that from information received today from the CBO, it is \nnot deficit neutral. In fact, it adds at least $170 billion to the \ndeficit, which, of course, is very important since tomorrow we are \ngoing to be asked to increase the temporary debt ceiling. This \nlegislation will add to our Federal debt, not make the situation \nbetter, as many of our colleagues have claimed.\n  I will describe why that is so. I heard another colleague on the \nother side on a talk show this morning say that we are going to extend \nthe fiscal life of Medicare by 9 years. That is a claim that directly \nconflicts with the claim that the bill is budget neutral.\n  What both the CMS Actuary and the CBO have now said is, no; both are \nnot true. There is only one sum of money. You can either extend the \nlife of Medicare with that money, or you can buy a new entitlement \nunder the bill with that money. But you cannot do both.\n  So if that money is spent on the new entitlement, for example, it \ncannot extend the life of Medicare. It cannot show a budget surplus of \n$130 billion.\n  In effect, they are saying you can't sell the same pony twice. Here \nis exactly what the Congressional Budget Office had to say about it \nthis morning. Incidentally, we were tipped off to this by a comment \nthat was in the body of a letter from the CMS Actuary last week, or \nDecember 10, and as we read through it and tried to analyze the new \namendment that was just filed, it became clear that, in effect, that is \nprecisely what is being done by the other side.\n  I am not suggesting duplicity. What I am suggesting is that they, \ntoo, have been misled by the arcane accounting language, and until it \nbecame crystal clear with the language today, I can understand why \nthere would be confusion--but no longer. You cannot vote for this bill \nthis afternoon and claim not to have known that it both buys an \nextension of the trust fund for Medicare and claims to buy a surplus of \n$130 billion.\n  Here is what the CBO says today, December 23, which is posted on \ntheir Web site:\n\n       The key point is that the savings to the HI trust fund \n     under this bill would be received by the government only \n     once, so they cannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare \n     spending and at the same time pay for current spending on \n     other parts of the legislation.\n\n  In other words, the new entitlements that are allegedly paid for \nunder the bill. Here is the last sentence:\n\n       To describe the full amount of the HI trust fund savings as \n     both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of \n     those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  It would essentially double-count the money. That is the point \nSenator Gregg and Senator Sessions and I tried to make earlier this \nmorning.\n  This is new information, I grant you. But it is an illustration of \nwhy we should not try to force this bill to a vote before Christmas, \nwhen we haven't tried to figure out what this all means and the \nAmerican people haven't had an opportunity to react to it.\n  I quoted to you from the CBO, the nonpartisan office that tells us \nwhat the fiscal impact is. Here is what tipped us off: Richard Foster, \nthe CMS Chief Actuary, had sent a letter. This phrase caught our \nattention. He said:\n\n       In practice, the improved part A financing cannot be \n     simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays, such as \n     the coverage expansion under this bill and to extend the \n     trust fund. Despite the appearance of this result from the \n     respective accounting conventions.\n\n  Despite the fact, in other words, that it appears you can do both \nbecause of the way the government accounting is, it is only one pot of \nmoney. You cannot use it to extend the life of Medicare on one hand and \nbuy new entitlements and show a budget surplus on the other.\n  This is what happens when you try to rush a bill through like this \ntoo quickly. Many colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: \nI will not vote for a bill that is not budget neutral or creates a \nbudget deficit. Then they cannot vote for this legislation now that CBO \nhas said what it has said. Some of them won't realize that. That is why \nI came to the floor.\n  I compliment Senator Sessions for talking to the Director of the \nBudget Office last night and confirming this, asking him if he would \nput it in writing, which he did.\n  I think this is a game changer, my friends. If, now that you have \nthis knowledge, you still go forward and vote for the legislation, \nthose of you who have made the pledge not to do so will be violating \nthat pledge. You can't use the same pot of money to do two separate \nthings, as the CBO said. They describe it this way: You can't do both \nof these things. You would essentially double-count a large share of \nthat savings and thus overstate the situation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The earlier statement from CBO was that the legislation \nwould result in reducing the deficit by $132 billion, which was cited \nseveral times. Well, that was obviously before the statement that was \nissued today. In boiling it down--and the Senator is an accomplished \nlawyer--doesn't this say there is a misimpression created by that \nprevious statement and that this statement today clarifies it, making \nabsolutely clear that it is not creating a surplus or reducing the debt \nbut, in fact, increasing the debt?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is exactly right. The title of the \ndocument is ``Effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \non the Federal Budget and the Balance in the Hospital Insurance Trust \nFund.'' He starts out by saying CBO has been----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will be happy to in a moment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the CMS report, dated December 10, be printed in \nthe Record following the colloquy so that people can follow what we \nhave done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S13827]]\n\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for \n           Medicare & Medicaid Services,\n                                Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD.\n\n\n                         Office of the Actuary\n\n     Date: December 10, 2009.\n     From: Richard S. Foster, F.S.A., Chief Actuary.\n     Subject: Estimated Effects of the ``Patient Protection and \n         Affordable Care Act'' on the Year of Exhaustion for the \n         Part A Trust Fund, Part B Premiums, and Part A and Part B \n         Coinsurance Amounts.\n\n       In addition to proposals to expand health insurance \n     coverage, the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of \n     2009'' (PPACA) includes numerous provisions that would reduce \n     Medicare costs and one that would increase the Hospital \n     Insurance payroll tax rate for high-income individuals and \n     families. This memorandum describes the estimated impacts of \n     the PPACA, as proposed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid \n     on November 18, 2009, on the date of exhaustion for the \n     Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A) trust fund, on Part B \n     beneficiary premiums, and on the average level of Part A and \n     Part B beneficiary coinsurance.\n       We estimate that the aggregate net savings to the Part A \n     trust fund under the PPACA would postpone the exhaustion of \n     trust fund assets by 9 years--that is, from 2017 under \n     current law to 2026 under the proposed legislation.\n       The combination of lower Part A costs and higher tax \n     revenues results in a lower Federal deficit based on budget \n     accounting rules. However, trust fund accounting considers \n     the same lower expenditures and additional revenues as \n     extending the exhaustion date of the Part A trust fund. In \n     practice, the improved Part A financing cannot be \n     simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays (such as \n     the coverage expansions under the PPACA) and to extend the \n     trust fund, despite the appearance of this result from the \n     respective accounting conventions.\n       The estimated postponement of asset exhaustion for the Part \n     A trust fund does not reflect the relatively small impact on \n     HI payroll taxes due to economic effects of the legislation \n     or the small increase in administrative expenses under the \n     legislation. As noted in our December 10, 2009 memorandum on \n     the estimated financial and other effects of the PPACA, \n     reductions in Medicare payment updates to Part A providers, \n     based on economy-wide productivity gains, are unlikely to be \n     sustainable on a permanent annual basis. If such reductions \n     were to prove unworkable within the period 2010-2026, then \n     the actual HI savings from these provisions would be less \n     than estimated, and the postponement in the trust fund \n     exhaustion date would be reduced. \n       The Medicare expenditure reductions under the PPACA would \n     also affect the level of Part B premiums paid by enrollees \n     and the Part A and Part B beneficiary coinsurance amounts. \n     The following table presents these estimated impacts:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Coinsurance\n                                       Part B Premium    Impact (change\n                                     Impact (change in    in yearly per\n                 CY                   monthly premium    capita amount)\n                                          amount)      -----------------\n                                                         Part A   Part B\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2010...............................              $0.00       $0      $90\n2011...............................               1.80       -1       22\n2012...............................              -3.10       -4      -37\n2013...............................              -4.60       -8      -55\n2014...............................              -5.30      -13      -64\n2015...............................              -7.20      -18      -86\n2016...............................              -9.00      -23     -108\n2017...............................             -10.80      -28     -129\n2018...............................             -12.50      -34     -151\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       As indicated, Part B premiums and average coinsurance \n     payments would initially increase, reflecting higher overall \n     Part B costs under the PPACA in 2010 as a result of the \n     provision to postpone the 21.3-percent reduction in physician \n     payment rates that would be required for 2010 under current \n     law. Thereafter, there would be steadily increasing savings \n     to Part B and associated reductions in the Part B premium and \n     coinsurance averages. Similarly, the Part A savings under the \n     PPACA would result in lower beneficiary coinsurance payments \n     for inpatient hospital and skilled nursing care. As before, \n     all of these results are conditional on the continued \n     application of the productivity adjustments to the Medicare \n     ``market basket'' payment updates.\n       Expenditure reductions under Part B translate directly to \n     lower financing requirements from general revenues and \n     beneficiary premiums, since financing is re-established \n     annually to match program costs. Thus, in the case of Part B, \n     the savings under the PPACA are not needed to help pay for \n     future Part B benefit costs, and the full reduction in \n     Federal general revenues attributable to such savings can be \n     used to offset other Federal costs, such as those arising \n     under the PPACA coverage expansions.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I am now happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask my good friend from Arizona, is it not true that \nthe last statement from CBO, on the degree to which the underlying \nlegislation does or does not reduce the deficit, stated that the \nlegislation reduces the deficit by $132 billion--that is the last \nstatement after addressing the deficit--and also stating that at the \nend of the decade, the deficit will be reduced between $630 billion and \n$1.3 trillion? Isn't that the last statement from CBO addressing the \nquestion on whether this legislation reduces or increases the deficit. \nIsn't that true?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I don't know the document that my friend is \nreferring to as ``the last document.'' I think that document, dated \nDecember 23, today, is the last document.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is from a day or two ago. It is the CBO letter \ncommenting on the modification.\n  Mr. KYL. I don't know. I am not aware of that. My point is this: The \ndocument released today, in order to clarify the situation again, said \nthe key point is that you can't do both. The government only gets the \nmoney once. Therefore, they say, to describe the full amount as both \nproviding a savings to Medicare and providing a surplus essentially \ndouble-counts the money and thus overstates the improvement in the \ngovernment's position.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I will not yield now. I have a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post op-ed by Michael \nGerson, dated December 23, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2009]\n\n        For Sale: One Senator (D-Neb.); No Principles, Low Price\n\n                          (By Michael Gerson)\n\n       Sometimes there is a fine ethical line between legislative \n     maneuvering and bribery. At other times, that line is crossed \n     by a speeding, honking tractor-trailer, with outlines of \n     shapely women on mud flaps bouncing as it rumbles past.\n       Such was the case in the final hours of Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid's successful attempt to get cloture on \n     health-care reform. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, the last \n     Democratic holdout, was offered and accepted a permanent \n     exemption from his state's share of Medicaid expansion, \n     amounting to $100 million over 10 years.\n       Afterward, Reid was unapologetic. ``You'll find,'' he said, \n     ``a number of states that are treated differently than other \n     states. That's what legislating is all about.''\n       But legislating, presumably, is also about giving public \n     reasons for the expenditure of public funds. Are Cornhuskers \n     particularly sickly and fragile? Is there a malaria outbreak \n     in Grand Island? Ebola detected in Lincoln?\n       Reid didn't even attempt to offer a reason why Medicaid in \n     Nebraska should be treated differently from, say, Medicaid \n     across the Missouri River in Iowa. The majority leader bought \n     a vote with someone else's money. Does this conclusion sound \n     harsh? Listen to Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who \n     accused the Senate leadership and the administration of \n     ``backroom deals that amount to bribes'' and ``seedy Chicago \n     politics'' that ``personifies the worst of Washington.''\n       This special deal for Nebraska raises an immediate \n     question: Why doesn't every Democratic senator demand the \n     same treatment for his or her state? Eventually, they will. \n     After the Nelson deal was announced, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa \n     enthused, ``When you look at it, I thought well, God, good, \n     it is going to be the impetus for all the states to stay at \n     100 percent (coverage by the federal government). So he might \n     have done all of us a favor.'' In a single concession, Reid \n     undermined the theory of Medicaid--designed as a shared \n     burden between states and the federal government--and added \n     to future federal deficits.\n       Unless this little sweetener is stripped from the final \n     bill by a House-Senate conference committee in January, which \n     would leave Nelson with a choice. He could enrage his party \n     by blocking health reform for the sake of $100 million--\n     making the narrowness of his interests clear to everyone. Or \n     he could give in--looking not only venal but also foolish.\n       How did Nelson gain such leverage in the legislative \n     process in the first place? Because many assumed that his \n     objections to abortion coverage in the health bill were \n     serious--not a cover, but a conviction. Even though Nelson, a \n     rare pro-life Democrat, joked in an interview that he might \n     be considered a ``cheap date,'' Republican leadership \n     staffers in the Senate thought he might insist on language in \n     the health-care bill preventing public funds from going to \n     insurance plans that cover abortion on demand, as Democratic \n     Rep. Bart Stupak had done in the House.\n       Instead, Nelson caved. The ``compromise'' he accepted \n     allows states to prohibit the coverage of elective abortions \n     in their insurance exchanges. Which means that Nebraska \n     taxpayers may not be forced to subsidize insurance plans that \n     cover abortions in Nebraska. But they will certainly be \n     required to subsidize such plans in California, New York and \n     many other states.\n       In the end, Nelson not only surrendered his beliefs, he \n     also betrayed the principle of the Hyde Amendment, which \n     since 1976 has prevented the coverage of elective abortion in \n     federally funded insurance. Nelson not only violated his pro-\n     life convictions, he also may force millions of Americans to \n     violate theirs as well.\n\n[[Page S13828]]\n\n       I can respect those who are pro-life out of conviction and \n     those who are pro-choice out of conviction. It is more \n     difficult to respect politicians willing to use their deepest \n     beliefs--and the deepest beliefs of others--as bargaining \n     chips.\n       In a single evening, Nelson managed to undermine the logic \n     of Medicaid, abandon three decades of protections under the \n     Hyde Amendment and increase the public stock of cynicism. For \n     what? For the sake of legislation that greatly expands a \n     health entitlement without reforming the health system; that \n     siphons hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicare \n     instead of using that money to reform Medicare; that imposes \n     seven taxes on Americans making less than $250,000 a year, in \n     direct violation of a presidential pledge; that employs \n     Enron-style accounting methods to inflate future cost \n     savings; that pretends to tame the insurance companies while \n     making insurance companies the largest beneficiaries of \n     reform.\n       And, yes, for $100 million. It is the cheap date equivalent \n     of Taco Bell.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The leader's time is up at 6 minutes after the hour; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has 6\\1/2\\ minutes \nreserved.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask Senator Kyl this: The CBO report this morning \nessentially says you cannot count the same money twice; correct?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it doesn't say you cannot. It just says \nthat is what would happen if you attempted to apply the money both to \nthe trust fund and to the additional spending. It says it ``would \nessentially double count and thus overstate.''\n  What I am saying is that it doesn't say you can't do it, but they are \nsaying you only have one pot of money to pay for two things and, \nobviously, you cannot do that and be honest about the accounting. That \nis my interpretation of what it says.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is correct. The Senator may not know this. \nI understand that at the request of our Democratic colleagues, they \nhave returned to CBO and gotten another statement this morning, perhaps \nso they can continue to make the argument that somehow this creates a \nsurplus. But staff having examined that, I am informed that it in no \nway refutes this morning's statement that this cannot simultaneously \nfund a new program and strengthen Medicare at the same time.\n  I think it is a matter, will Senator Kyl not agree--I am not afraid \nto talk about it--if we need to slow down before we vote, so be it. \nFirst of all, is the Senator convinced, as Senator Gregg indicated this \nmorning and CBO does, that we are, in fact, passing a bill that would, \nif it passes, add to the debt approximately $170 billion, as staff has \ncalculated based on this letter, and would not reduce the debt by $132 \nbillion?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am absolutely convinced of that, yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do not think there is any dispute about it. I think \nthat is the fact. It has been exposed. The President looked us in the \neye in a joint session of Congress, did he not, and said this \nlegislation would not add one dime or one dollar to the debt of the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is my recollection that is pretty close to \nwhat the President said. I guess maybe this would not be such a big \ndeal unless you are trying to do two things with the same pot of money. \nAs long as the other side is also claiming we are actually extending \nthe life of Medicare, which I heard one of my colleagues do on \ntelevision this morning, then you cannot make this other claim. You can \nclaim one or the other but you cannot claim both. That is precisely \nwhat the head of CBO said:\n\n       To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings as \n     both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of \n     those savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To follow up on that, is it not true--and President \nObama Monday flatly stated in one press conference that it would reduce \nour deficit over 10 years by $130 billion and extend the Medicare \nProgram by 9 years, which is patently false, it would appear. I am not \nsure he understood the complexities of all this accounting, but, in \nfact, I think he misspoke at that point. Would the Senator from Arizona \nnot agree?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I obviously cannot get into the President's \nmind, but I must say that all of us had missed this point. I said \nbefore I ascribe no ill will to anybody on the other side. This is hard \nto understand. Accounting can be arcane. That is why this statement \nfrom the CMS was a little troubling to us when we first read it. They \nsaid:\n\n       Despite the appearance of this result from the respective \n     accounting conventions--\n\n  Which is a fancy way of saying accountants have their way of showing \nthings and that might have confused you--\n\n     in practice, improved party financing cannot be \n     simultaneously used to finance other Federal outlays.\n\n  You cannot use the same pot of money of $10 to buy two different $10 \nbenefits. You can buy one or the other or half of each, but you cannot \nbuy both. As the old saying goes, you cannot sell the same pony twice.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It said, did it not, in that CMS letter that was a fact \n``despite the appearance of this result from the respective accounting \nconventions''? Were they not warning us that it might appear this way \nbut it cannot be that way?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, our colleague Senator Gregg, a respected \nmember of the Budget Committee, pointed out this morning why that is \nso, and my colleague from Alabama can do that as well.\n  There are two different systems of accounting by two different parts \nof the government. The only way they can do this is by sending an IOU \nback to the Social Security trust fund, but, of course, the IOU comes \nout of the pocket of the taxpayers where we have to borrow it and it is \nstill an obligation even though it shows up on accounting books as \nobligation satisfied.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a simple question?\n  Mr. KYL. Sure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if the Senator is aware that CBO this morning at \n9:57 sent an e-mail to all relevant staff that its estimates with \nregard to budget deficit reduction still stand, still hold. CBO still \nestimates this legislation results in a $132 billion deficit reduction. \nThat was an e-mail sent today. Is the Senator aware of that e-mail?\n  Mr. KYL. I did not see that e-mail. I assume that is the same \ncommunique about which the Senator from Alabama is talking. It shows \nyou exactly why this is so confusing and why I am a little bit \nconcerned about the politicization of the CBO.\n  Last night and again this morning, we have a memo that says you \ncannot pay twice. If after that he says I still show that as a surplus, \nthen what he has to also be saying is, and therefore it does not extend \nthe life of the Social Security trust fund. As I said, you can do one \nor the other, or roughly half of each, but you cannot do both. If he is \nchoosing to say it is applied to one, then our colleagues cannot \ncontinue to say that it applies to the other.\n  Mr. President, Americans' biggest complaint about the current \nhealthcare system is the increasing cost of health insurance premiums.\n  President Obama promised that his healthcare reform bill would \naddress this problem. As he said during his campaign, ``I have made a \nsolemn pledge that I will sign a universal healthcare bill into law . . \n. that will . . . cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to \n$2,500 a year.''\n  By the President's own yardstick, this bill is a failure, since it \nactually increases premiums for many Americans and fails to restrain \ngrowths for the rest.''\n  Recently, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concluded \nthat, under this bill, those in the individual market--that is, those \nwithout employer-sponsored insurance--will face premium increases \nbetween 10 and 13 percent. That's approximately $2,100 per family by \n2016.\n  A second study, from the actuarial firm Oliver Wyman, also concluded \npremiums will rise under this legislation, thanks to burdensome new \nFederal mandates and requirements and several new taxes.\n  In the individual market, this study predicts, premiums will rise by \n$3,300 per year for family coverage and $1,500 for individuals. In my \nhome State of Arizona premiums could rise by as much as 72 percent in \nthe individual market.\n  This study also tells us that the small group market would see \npremium\n\n[[Page S13829]]\n\nincreases. Small employers purchasing new policies in the reformed \nmarket would experience premiums up to 20 percent higher in 2019 than \nthey would under current law.\n  Oliver Wyman also estimates that, if this bill is enacted, 2.9 \nmillion fewer Americans would have insurance through small-employer \npolicies.\n  So what this bill does is raise the cost of insurance for many \nAmericans and then force everyone to buy a policy--and not just any \npolicy, one that is been approved by Washington!\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle argue that many families \nwill receive government subsidies to help with the increased cost of \ninsurance brought on by new mandates, taxes, and Federal requirements.\n  There are a few problems with this argument.\n  First, not every family will qualify for such subsidies. Indeed, 14 \nmillion Americans who buy their own coverage would earn too much to get \na subsidy, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So 14 million Americans will be required, by Washington, to purchase \nunsubsidized insurance that is more expensive than they could get under \ncurrent law. And this is being called reform?\n  Second, those who do receive a subsidy may find the subsidy does not \nbegin to cover the total cost of the increase. So, those families, too, \nwill actually be worse off.\n  And, finally, the heart of this debate is a basic question: What is \nthe point of raising the price of insurance and then subsidizing a \nportion of the increase? You are still raising premiums and someone has \nto pay for subsidies.\n  Americans have asked us to lower healthcare costs, not raise them and \nthen provide subsidies to those who qualify. And they certainly don't \nwant to pay more in taxes to subsidize their own insurance--but that is \nwhat the Democrats' bill would have them do.\n  As the Wall Street Journal recently editorialized, ``The [Reid] bill \nwill increase costs, but it will then disguise those costs by \ntransferring them to taxpayers from individuals:''\n  Not surprisingly, small business associations, whose members would be \noverwhelmingly impacted by this legislation, are disappointed.\n  The Small Business Coalition for Affordable Healthcare, for one, \nopposes this bill.\n  Their name says it all. This organization believes, as all of us do \nhere in the Senate, that the status quo is not acceptable and not \nsustainable. But they disapprove of this legislation because, as they \nwrote in a letter to Congress, ``it costs too much and delivers too \nlittle.''\n  Here are just a few of the dozens of businesses represented by this \norganization: The Americans Hotel and Lodging Association; American \nBakers Association; the Independent Electrical Contractors; the \nNational Association of Convenience Stores; the National Automobile \nDealers Association; Printing Industries of America; the Society of \nAmerican Florists. The list goes on and on.\n  These businesses wrote a letter to Congress expressing disapproval of \nthe bill's huge costs and failure to bring down premiums, among other \nprovisions that hurt small businesses. They believe that increased \npremiums have a domino effect, hurting both the employer and the \nemployee, resulting in fewer jobs, depressed wages, and fewer choices.\n\n  I will share some excerpts from their letter, with regard to \nincreased premiums and costs:\n  They write:\n\n       The bill does little to make insurance more affordable and \n     the [small business] tax credit is so limited, few will be \n     able to obtain affordable insurance.\n\n  They go on:\n\n       The impact on non-group premiums is . . . devastating, as \n     they are expected to increase an average of 10-13 percent per \n     person. Those estimates, in addition to the financing \n     provisions in the bill, slam the ``savings'' door shut.\n\n  Another organization, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, has also raised major objections to this bill with regard to \nincreased premiums.\n  Here is a telling excerpt from a letter they wrote to the two Senate \nparty leaders:\n\n       H.R. 3590 fails the small business test, and, therefore, \n     fails small business. The most recent CBO study detailing the \n     effect [this bill] will have on insurance premiums reinforces \n     that, despite claims by its supporters, the bill will not \n     deliver the widely-promised help to the small business \n     community.\n\n  Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce concurs. He recently \nsaid:\n\n       The fundamental failure of the Senate bill is its failure \n     to address cost containment. We have a bill that raises taxes \n     on pretty much everything that moves in the healthcare space. \n     And successful cost containment practices that are in the \n     marketplace, like health savings accounts or flexible \n     spending accounts, are dramatically weakened in this . . . \n     Healthcare cost increases are going to crowd out the \n     compensation pool.\n\n  The majority leader recently disagreed with the notion that this bill \nincreases costs, citing a prediction by the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers that the bill before us would bring down costs.\n  This is the same council that told us unemployment would peak at 8 \npercent if only Congress would pass the stimulus. As Americans know, \nCongress passed the stimulus, and we are now at 10 percent \nunemployment.\n  Moreover, if the Council of Economic Advisors is supposed to be the \nBible of economic analysis and administration officials know best, why \nis it that on the same day the President's top economic advisor Larry \nSummers declared on This Week, ``the recession is over,'' the Council's \nchair, Christina Romer, told Meet the Press viewers that ``of course'' \nthe recession is not over? So, who should we believe on costs?\n  I submit that small business owners and their representatives have \nthe most intimate knowledge of which policies will benefit them and \nwhich stand to hurt them. They are telling us this bill will hurt them.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that this bill does not even \nguarantee that all Americans have insurance. This bill leaves 24 \nmillion Americans uninsured.\n  We are going to spend $2.5 trillion to raise the price of insurance \nfor millions of Americans and keep affordable insurance out of reach \nfor millions more.\n  There are much better ways to give access to affordable healthcare to \nall Americans.\n  We should start with serious medical liability reform, which has been \nproven in Texas, Arizona, and Missouri to bring down costs for patients \nand doctors.\n  We need to allow Americans to buy insurance across State lines. This \nis one of the most commonsense reforms out there. Why should Americans \nbe denied access to lower-cost policies just because they are being \nsold in other states?\n  We should also allow small businesses to band together to pool their \nrisk and purchase insurance at the same rates large corporations get.\n  Enacting these simple reforms would cost little, if anything, and \nwould be sure to bring down costs. That is the kind of reform Americans \nwould be sure to support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Baucus \nmotion to waive be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about the \nmotion to table the appeal by Senator Cornyn and the ruling of the \nChair that no point of order lies under rule XLIV.\n  Senator Cornyn's appeal is not about transparency and certainly not \nabout disclosure. It is about delay and obstruction. That is what the \nwhole tenor of all the Republican statements has been regarding this \nlegislation.\n  The vote is whether we create a whole new point of order even though \nSenate rules at this stage do not allow a point of order. They want to \nrewrite the rules at a whim, not for purpose of disclosure and \ntransparency but for the purpose of delay and obstruction.\n  The legislative history of the Honest Leadership and Government Act \nspecifically addresses the issue of whether a point of order lies in \nthis instance:\n\n       If rule XLIV does not expressly provide for a point of \n     order with respect to a provision, then no point of order \n     shall lie under the provision.\n\n  We open a Pandora's box if we reverse the ruling of the Chair on \nappeal. What would be the new rule? How\n\n[[Page S13830]]\n\nwould the new rules be implemented? What happens to the health care \nbill? Who decides the answers to these questions?\n  Moreover, if we overrule the Chair, we would be setting a dangerous \nprecedent that points of order lie even if not provided for in Senate \nrules, standing orders, or procedures.\n  It is clear the purpose of this is to obstruct and delay. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to table the Cornyn appeal of the ruling of the \nChair when that comes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. No, I will not. The health care votes we have held this \nweek have been procedural in nature. Each has been a party-line vote \nand much of this debate is focused on politics. But health reform is \nnot about procedure or partisanship or politics. It is about people--\npeople like the thousands who write us every day.\n  At my desk, we have a few of the letters we have picked up in the \nlast day or so. Sorry, staff has had to lift that and I didn't. This is \na few we have gotten. Look at this. They are all basically the same. \nEach of these letters right here represents a story, a tragedy, a life, \na death, but most of all, a person--a person, people who wake up every \nmorning and struggle to get health care or struggle to hold on to what \nthey have, people who lie awake every night second-guessing the \nagonizing decisions they have to make about what to sacrifice just to \nstay healthy.\n  Here is a letter that was written to Senator Bob Casey of \nPennsylvania. Listen to what this woman said:\n\n       Dear Senator Casey. In a country like the United States, we \n     shouldn't need a tip jar in an ice cream shop to raise money \n     for a kid with leukemia. Jennifer Wood.\n\n  Here is another one of those letters. This one is from a father in \nNorth Las Vegas, NV:\n\n       Can you imagine what it is like to have a doctor look you \n     in your eye when you hold your 1-year-old child and be told \n     that you will likely outlive your son?\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I am certain my story is not unique, but it is real. Stop \n     forcing Americans to use the most expensive point of service, \n     the emergency room, to get what the system won't give them. \n     Let's make all Americans equal in the eyes of health care, \n     please.\n\n  This legislation is not about the number of pages of this bill. It is \nabout the number of people--people such as the man whose letter I just \nread who was told by a doctor that he would likely outlive his son. It \nis about the number of people whom this bill will help. That is what \nthis is all about. It is about fairness. So when people are hurt or \nsick, they can go see somebody who can help them and not lie awake at \nnight wondering if they will outlive their 1-year-old son.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back that time and ask the vote start earlier.\n  I withdraw that request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that prior to each vote today there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There is now 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, stop the 2 minutes from running. I do want \nto explain. We will shortly have a series of up to seven votes. As we \nnoted in the last few days, if Members remain at their desks, the votes \ncan be concluded much earlier.\n\n\n                         Ensign Point of Order\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is now 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote on the constitutional point of order \noffered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Who yields time?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the vote sequence will be as follows: Ensign \nconstitutional point of order; Corker unfunded mandates point of order; \nBaucus motion to table the Cornyn appeal ruling of the Chair; Hutchison \nconstitutional point of order. I have been advised that a Republican \nMember will move to suspend the rules so he can offer his amendment \nunder rule XXII. He is going to be allowed 10 minutes. This will \nrequire 67 votes because it is an effort to change the rules. Following \nthat we will have adoption of the substitute amendment and cloture on \nH.R. 3590. So there is a series of seven votes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I raise a constitutional point of order \nbecause I am concerned that the health reform bill violate's Congress's \nenumerated powers under article I, section 8 and the fifth amendment \ntakings clause of the Constitution.\n  Each one of us takes an oath to defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. We do not take an oath to reform health care. We do not take an \noath to do anything else here but to defend the Constitution of these \nUnited States.\n  Health care reform needs to fit within the Constitution. The \nConstitution limits the powers we have. The Congress, the U.S. \nGovernment has never enacted anything that would regulate someone's \ninactivity in the way the individual mandate in this health care bill \nwould. Anything we have ever done, somebody actually had to have an \naction before we could tax or regulate it. In this case, if you choose \nto not do something--in other words, if you do not choose health \ninsurance--this bill will actually tax you. It will act as an onerous \ntax. So for the first time in the history of the United States this \nbill will do something the Federal Government has never done before. \nThis bill would do something that is beyond Congress's powers to \nauthorize. This bill is unconstitutional and I urge all Members to vote \nin support of the constitutional point of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, our committee and the HELP Committee have \ngiven a lot of thought to the provisions in this legislation. We also \ngave a lot of thought to the constitutionality of the provisions--how \nthey work and the interrelationship between the power of Congress and \nthe States and what States will be doing, particularly under the \ncommerce clause and the tax-and-spending powers of the Constitution.\n  It is very strongly our considered judgment, and that of many \nconstitutional scholars who have looked at these provisions--and many \narticles have been put in the Record--that clearly these provisions are \nconstitutional. The commerce clause is constitutional, the tax-and-\nspending clause, and the provisions clearly are constitutional.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nconstitutional point of order made by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nEnsign, that the amendment violates article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution, and the fifth amendment.\n  The question is, Is the point of order well taken?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 39, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 389 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n\n[[Page S13831]]\n\n\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bunning\n       \n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There is now 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to the vote on the motion to waive the point of order \nraised by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, thank you so much.\n  There is almost nothing held in lower esteem than for the Senate to \npass laws in this body that cause mayors and Governors to have \nbudgetary problems because we create unfunded mandates.\n  Many of you have been mayors and Governors, and for that reason, in \n1995, in a bipartisan way, a law was created--15 Senators on the other \nside of the aisle who are now serving supported this law--to keep us \nfrom passing unfunded mandates. CBO has stated without a doubt that \nthis bill violates that.\n  I urge Members to vote against this motion to waive that. It is \nimportant. It says everything about the way we do business here in \nWashington. Please, let's not pass another huge unfunded mandate to the \nStates at a time when they all are having budgetary problems. This \nspeaks to the essence of who we are and the arrogance many people \nperceive us to have here in Washington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This point of order calls for legislation to impose an \nobligation on States to extend their coverage on Medicaid. Under \nexisting law, on average, the Federal Government pays about 57 cents on \nthe dollar for every dollar spent under Medicaid. Under this \nlegislation, the Federal Government will pay 100 percent of that \nobligation for newly enrolled beneficiaries up through the year 2016. \nAfterward, the Federal Government will pay on average 90 percent of the \ncost of new enrollees. Therefore, I think this is a very fair deal for \nStates, and I urge my colleagues to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. President, I also ask consent that this vote and all subsequent \nvotes in this sequence be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, upon passage of the Honest Leadership and \nOpen Government Act, the majority leader said:\n\n       I believe last November Americans . . . asked us to make \n     Government honest. We have done that . . . This is the \n     toughest reform bill in the history of this body as it \n     relates to ethics and lawmaking.\n\n  This is an appeal to the ruling of the Chair that that provision of \nrule XLIV is unenforceable. Why would anybody who voted overwhelmingly \nto make this the toughest reform bill in the history of the body render \nthis rule toothless by agreeing with the attempt to set this aside and \nto waive its effect?\n  I ask my colleagues to make sure we vote for transparency, for \nhonesty, for open government. Vote no on this motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the plain text of the language in rule \nXLIV provides that no point of order lies against amendments. That is \nthe way the draftees intended it. That is the way they wrote rule XLIV. \nThat is why the Presiding Officer ruled that way on the advice of the \nParliamentarian. We should support the Chair and the Parliamentarian \nand vote for the motion to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

There is now 2 minutes, equally divided, prior \nto a vote on the constitutional point of order made by the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the 10th amendment says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution . . . are reserved to the States. . . .\n\n  In this bill, a State such as Texas and many other States that have \ntaken full responsibility for insurance plans for their employees and \nteachers will have to justify any change in those terms to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The majority claims the commerce clause gives them the power to do \nwhat is in this bill. But what they fail to mention is the power to \nregulate interstate commerce has not been the basis for a robust role \nin insurance regulation.\n  This is an encroachment of the Federal Government into a role left to \nthe States in the Constitution. The 10th amendment is being eroded by \nan activist Congress, and it is time to stop it now.\n  I urge a vote to uphold this point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the bill before us is clearly an \nappropriate exercise of the commerce clause. We further believe \nCongress has power to enact this legislation pursuant to the taxing and \nspending powers. This bill does not violate the 10th amendment because \nit is an appropriate exercise of powers delegated to the United States, \nand because our bill fundamentally gives States the choice to \nparticipate in the exchanges themselves or, if they do not choose to do \nso, to allow the Federal Government to set up the exchanges fully \nwithin the provisions as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the 10th \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the constitutional point of \norder made by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, that the \namendment violates the 10th amendment.\n  The question is, Is the point of order well taken?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

The point of order is not agreed to.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, since I have not used or yielded 10 \nminutes, I ask to be recognized for up to 10 minutes under rule XXII, \nparagraph 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                        DeMINT MOTION TO SUSPEND\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in just a moment I will move to suspend \nthe rules for the purpose of offering an amendment that would ban the \npractice of trading earmarks for votes.\n  While I want to be careful not to suggest wrongdoing by any Member, \nthere has been growing public concern that earmarks were used to buy \nvotes for this legislation. It has been argued by some that this \npractice is acceptable because it is necessary to get things done in \nthe Senate. I reject that argument, and I urge my colleagues to put an \nend to business as usual here in the Senate.\n  The House of Representatives has a rule prohibiting the use of \nearmarks to buy votes for legislation. If we were in the House \nconsidering this bill, vote trading would be a direct violation of the \nethics rules. Unfortunately, a vote-trading rule does not exist in the \nSenate.\n  During the debate on the lobbying and ethics reform bill in the 110th \nCongress, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and I offered \nan earmark reform amendment which contained the following language:\n\n       A Member may not condition the inclusion of language to \n     provide funding for a congressional earmark . . . on any vote \n     cast by another Member.\n\n  The Durbin-DeMint amendment was written to mirror Speaker Pelosi's \nearmark reforms in the House. The Durbin-DeMint amendment passed the \nSenate by a vote of 98 to 0 and was included in S. 1, the Honest \nLeadership and Open Government Act, which passed the Senate by a vote \nof 96 to 2.\n  The rule against trading votes for earmarks was in the bill when it \nleft the Senate, but then the bill moved to a closed-door negotiation. \nSomehow, at some point in those closed-door negotiations, someone \ndropped the earmark-for-vote language. I have no idea who it was, and \nwe may never know. Remember, this bill was called the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act. In any case, the vote-trading rule was dropped \nfrom the bill, which then passed the Senate and was signed by the \nPresident.\n  Just to confirm all of this, I wish to make a parliamentary inquiry \nto the Chair. Is the Chair aware of any prohibition in the Standing \nRules of the Senate such as the previously referenced rule contained in \nthe Durbin-DeMint amendment or in the Rules of the House of \nRepresentatives?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No such rule exists in the Senate.\n  Mr. DeMINT. No such rule exists.\n  I have an amendment which would correct this error. It mirrors the \nDurbin-DeMint language which passed the Senate 98 to 0, and I will read \nthe relevant parts. I quote:\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider a \n     congressionally directed spending\n\n[[Page S13833]]\n\n     item . . . if a Senator . . . has conditioned the inclusion \n     of the language . . . on any vote cast by any Senator.\n\n  This language had unanimous bipartisan support in 2007, and it should \nbe part of the rules today. This rule would provide needed \naccountability and allow any Senator to raise a point of order to \nstrike any earmark that has been used to buy votes. This point of order \ncould be waived and the ruling of the Chair could be appealed with the \nsupport of two-thirds of Senators present and voting.\n  Before I make this motion and we vote on this amendment, I wish to \nmake a few things absolutely clear. First, this rule already won a \nunanimous vote in the Senate in 2007, so it is not controversial. \nSecond, this rule only applies to earmarks used to buy votes in the \nfuture. It will not, unfortunately, apply to the earmarks in this bill. \nThird, this vote is not a trick. The amendment is written as a \n``standing order,'' so it will not increase the number of votes \nrequired to pass this legislation. It will not slow down the health \ncare bill in any way.\n  The only reason for Senators to oppose this amendment is if they want \nto use earmarks to buy votes for legislation. It is that simple. If you \nsupport business as usual, then oppose this motion. But if you want to \nstart to clean this place up and bring some integrity back to the \nlegislative process, then please support the motion.\n  Mr. President, I move to suspend the provisions of rule XXII, \nincluding germaneness requirements, for the purpose of proposing and \nconsidering my amendment No. 3297, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  It appears there is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this proposed new point of order may sound \ngood in theory, but it has many flaws, in fact, when you stop and think \nabout it. If you think the Senate is tied up in knots now, if this were \nin effect, the current situation would pale in comparison to what the \neffect of this amendment would be.\n  The amendment is written in a way to become an endless source of \ndelay. Senators could make one point of order after another under this \nprovision, pointing to different provisions or indicting the integrity \nof different Senators.\n  The amendment provides no way for determining how to rule on a point \nof order raised under it. A point of order cannot be decided without \nsolid guidance. Points of order make the most sense when they are based \non objective criteria.\n  The proposed amendment to rule XXII would ask the Chair and the \nParliamentarian to sort through purely subjective concepts such as the \nbasis for a Senator's vote or the intent behind inclusion of a \nprovision. How would the Chair be able to rule on such a point of \norder? Would the Parliamentarian have to question the chairman of a \ncommittee or a Senator who offers the amendment, under oath? Would the \nParliamentarian have to question every Senator who requested a directed \nspending item, under oath, to ensure they did not condition their \nsupport on inclusion of the item?\n  The rule may sound good in theory, but it is totally unworkable as a \npractical matter.\n  I move to table the DeMint motion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute left for those who favor the \nmotion. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina, 1 minute.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would answer the questions of the \nSenator by suggesting that Senator Durbin, who wrote the amendment, \nperhaps may wish to make a couple of comments about it because this is \nthe mirror--\n  Mr. DURBIN. Are you yielding time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, I sure will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't understand how this amendment would work. If the \nSenator happens to have a hurricane in his State and needs disaster aid \nand we put money in the bill, then would we have to question the \nSenator's motive for voting for the bill? I think it goes entirely too \nfar, and I support this effort to table.\n  Mr. DeMINT. This a DeMint-Durbin amendment. It is mirrored after \nSpeaker Pelosi's bill. They have this rule in the House. They can make \nit workable. Certainly, the integrity of this body is worth \nconsidering.\n  I would encourage my colleagues, at this point, when the public is \nlooking at us, asking for some trust and integrity, we can make this \nbill work. I ask my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the \ntabling motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the motion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the motion to \nsuspend the rules.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka).

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n39. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion to invoke cloture on the underlying bill is \nagreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we all recognize that things have \ngotten pretty tense around the Senate as we have worked three weekends \nin a row, long hours, and approach the Christmas holiday. Sometimes the \ntension has boiled over into what has been said on and off the floor, \nand the way we treat each other, and that is very regrettable.\n  Two nights ago there was an unfortunate incident that deserves \nspecial mention, though. One of our colleagues, the Senator from South \nCarolina, attacked the office of the Senate Parliamentarian. We all \nknow that the Senate Parliamentarian is a non-partisan referee. The \nOffice of the Parliamentarian does their best to enforce the rules and \nprocedures of the Senate in an impartial manner.\n  We have all come across situations when we were frustrated by the \nParliamentarian's ruling because we were hoping that a given amendment \nwas or was not germane, or that a given point of order was or was not \nwell taken. But, we have all taken comfort in the fact that whatever \nthe ruling in the instant case, the Parliamentarian was calling it \nstraight and the same ruling would apply to similar amendments by other \nSenators and similar facts in the future.\n  So, it is simply not right and not fair to attack the \nParliamentarians for doing their job. This is especially so when the \nissue is not a close call. Our colleague from South Carolina attacked \nthe Parliamentarian over a ruling relating to the difference between \namendments to the Standing Rules of the Senate and procedural changes \nadopted in less formal ways. The former requires a 2/3rds vote to \nachieve cloture; the latter is treated like any other piece of \nlegislation. The distinction is an interesting quirk of Senate rules. \nBut it is a venerable and well-established distinction. The Senate \nManual includes 70 pages of Standing Orders. The Budget Act process--\nwhich the minority used to make a point of order just today--is almost \nentirely dependent on procedures that are not part of the Standing \nRules of the Senate. In fact, in the last two Congresses, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has authored or co-sponsored at least 17 bills or \namendments that implicate the distinction. For the Parliamentarian to \nbe accused of ``redefin[ing] words,'' ``ignoring a rule'' of the \nSenate, and a ``truly historic'' and unconstitutional ``subvert[sion \nof] the principle we have operated under'' for re-stating this \nlongstanding distinction is completely unwarranted.\n  As I noted, tensions are running high and Senators are tired and, \naccording to one recent article, cranky. But I hope that the body will \ndo its best to ensure proper decorum as we proceed for the remainder of \nthe year and the remainder of the Congress. We need to treat each other \nwith respect. And we certainly need to treat the institution of the \nSenate and its hard-working employees with respect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there now be alternating \nblocks of time as follows: The first hour under the control of the \nRepublicans; further, that after the first 2 hours, then there be \nalternating blocks of 30 minutes, with the Republicans controlling the \nfirst 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there have been a lot of conversations on \nthis floor in the last couple hours. There are a lot of people who are \nfacing tough timetables tomorrow. I know of one Senator----\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, regular order. Regular order, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask consent I be given 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I would be \nhappy for those 2 minutes to come out of the Democrats' 1 hour without \nasking for regular order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know one Senator whose family is with \ntheir in-laws. The husband is from England\n\n[[Page S13835]]\n\nand the kids are over there and cannot make it for Christmas dinner \ntomorrow night. I know another person who has to get out to the West \nand there are a lot of storms out there. If they can get that early \nflight, they can make two legs and get home. If they have to go later \nin the day, they have to do three legs and they may not make it. There \nare a lot of people around here who are having a lot of problems that \nwe are all here. There is no reason to hold over the vote so I am going \nto ask unanimous consent that the vote on the passage of the bill and \nthe vote on the debt limit bill occur at 6 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, that request has not been cleared on this \nside. On behalf of my colleagues, I object. If the Senator would like \nto talk to all his colleagues about it, that would be fine, but in the \nmeantime, I would object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, then I would further ask unanimous consent \nthat the votes that are going to occur at 7 a.m. tomorrow occur at \n12:15 a.m., in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, my response would be the same and I would \nobject in the same vein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want Members to know who is keeping us here.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nreferred to by Senator Harkin take place at 2 p.m. on January 20, 2010, \nwhen we return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are objections.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this first \nblock of time on the minority side be divided equally between the \nfollowing Senators: myself, Senators Coburn, Thune, Sessions, Kyl, and \nEnsign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I ask for order on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that time not be counted against me \nuntil the floor is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will not be charged. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about this important health \ncare issue but also to talk about another vitally important issue \ndirectly connected, which is spending and debt because we will also \nhave an enormously important vote tomorrow morning on increasing the \ndebt limit. It is already over $12 trillion, but the proposal is to \nincrease it further.\n  In starting, let me refer back to a couple comments and parts of the \ndebate yesterday because I think it will provide a good segue into this \nimportant debate. First, yesterday, as we were debating health care, my \ncolleague from Louisiana, the distinguished senior Senator, Ms. \nLandrieu, was on C-SPAN's ``Washington Journal.'' In discussing the \nhealth care bill, my participation came up. She said: ``Senator Vitter \nhas not lifted a finger to pass this bill.''\n  I wish to say that is a very kind and positive and generous comment \nof the Senator and I take it as a nice Christmas overture and I accept \nit in that vein. I wish her all the best this Christmas season as well. \nIt is obviously very true, and I take it as a very positive comment.\n  I would go further. I fought hard against this bill. I fought hard \nfor alternative reforms, focused reforms, reforms focused like a laser \nbeam on real solutions in health care to real problems such as \npreexisting conditions. I would simply add, I don't think this fight is \nover by a long shot. I will continue fighting and I will continue \noffering those alternatives.\n  With regard to the bill and this enormously important issue of \nspending and debt, as I was leaving the floor to go to meetings in my \noffice after speaking yesterday, Senator Baucus took issue, apparently, \nwith some of my comments--specifically, my comments about Medicare. I \nhad suggested that this bill cuts Medicare by $467 billion, almost $\\1/\n2\\ trillion. Although I needed to go to meetings, I think Senator \nBaucus took issue with that and characterized that as actually \nextending the life of Medicare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office answered that debate far better than \nI could have. They answered that debate in the last 24 hours with their \nreport. They outline very clearly and we have been talking about it \nearlier today that, in fact, Medicare money and other pools of money \nare double counted in this analysis about the health care bill. ``The \nkey point is that the savings to the HI trust fund under the health \ncare bill would be received by the government only once so they cannot \nbe set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the same time, \npay for current spending on other parts of the legislation or on other \nprograms.''\n  The same Congressional Budget Office report says ``to describe the \nfull amount of HI trust fund savings and both improving the \nGovernment's ability to pay future Medicare benefits and financing new \nspending outside of Medicare would essentially double count a large \nshare of those savings.''\n  So this answers the Senator's comments directly. You can't have it \nboth ways. You can't say we have a bill that is paid for and also a \nbill that strengthens Medicare and extends solvency for additional \nyears. That is double counting. That is exactly what the CBO is saying. \nThe American people, in a much more basic, commonsense way, know \nbetter. They know this bill isn't paid for. They know this bill is \ngoing to expand the deficit and put us on an even worse fiscal road. \nThey know that in their gut. They know that with their common sense. Of \ncourse, that gets us to the other big vote tomorrow extending the debt \nlimit, yet again, well beyond $12 trillion.\n\n  These issues are connected. They are connected in the technical way I \njust suggested, and these issues are certainly connected in the hearts \nand minds of the American people. The American people have responded to \nthis debate because health care is so vitally important and the health \ncare issue is so personal.\n  There is even an overarching, larger reason the American people have \nresponded so much to this debate. It is because they are connecting the \ndots. They are putting this as part of a larger pattern, and they are \nconnecting the dots between bailing out and taking over insurance \ncompanies and financial companies and car companies, hiring and firing \nthe CEO from the Oval Office to potentially one-sixth of the U.S. \neconomy in health care. They are connecting those dots in terms of \nspending and debt, as well, because that has been the dominant trend \nover the last 12 months at least.\n  We have a debt limit today. It is over $12 trillion. The motion \ntomorrow suggests that is not enough. We need to go higher. The \nAmerican people are connecting the dots, particularly in the last year, \nand they are scared to death about where it leads. How did we get this \nway? How did we come to this $12 trillion-plus point? Well, in July, \n2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were given an unlimited line of credit \nfrom the Treasury that, so far, has been $400 billion, and that bill \nincreased the debt limit from $9.8 trillion to $10.6 trillion. But that \nwasn't enough. Only 3 months later, in October, 2008, came the Wall \nStreet bailouts, the $700 billion TARP that will raise the debt limit. \nThat did raise the debt limit even further, to $11.3 trillion, but we \nweren't done yet. Only a few months after that, in February of this \nyear, we passed the so-called stimulus bill. That will cost over $1 \ntrillion before it is all over, and then the debt limit was raised to \n$12.1 trillion. Then we passed an omnibus spending bill earlier this \nyear that increased spending about 8 percent over the previous fiscal \nyear.\n  This month, we passed another omnibus spending bill that increased \nspending another 12 percent on top of that. That is what is leading to \ntomorrow's debt limit vote. That is what is leading to the statement \nthat our debt limit is\n\n[[Page S13836]]\n\nnow above $12 trillion. But that is not enough. Apparently, we need to \ngo further.\n  The American people are connecting the dots. They see this trend, \nwhich has accelerated dramatically over the last 12 months, and they \nare truly scared for our collective future--for their kids' and their \ngrandkids' future. All these things I mentioned plus this health care \nbill are part of that.\n  The American people know in their gut--they may not understand all of \nthe Congressional Budget Office technicalities, but they know in their \ngut that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot count $467 billion of \nMedicare cuts as both helping pay for the other spending in the bill \nand strengthening Medicare. It is one or the other. It cannot be both. \nIt is the same thing in the health care bill with regard to Social \nSecurity--$52 billion double-counted. But you cannot have that both \nways. It is the same thing in this health care bill with regard to the \nCLASS Act--$72 billion double-counted. You can't have that both ways. \nThose factors alone put this bill out of balance, adding to the \ndeficit, adding to the debt.\n  What about the doc fix, the fix of reimbursement rates under Medicare \nto health care professionals such as doctors, which is clearly needed. \nThat was taken out of the health care bill. Why? Because that would \ncost money. It was taken out. It was just pushed down the road, the can \nwas kicked down the road. That has to be revisited by March 1 of next \nyear. If a real 10-year-or-more doc fix is passed, that will be another \n$200 billion unpaid for--more deficit and more debt.\n  The American people get it. They know in their hearts, in their gut, \nthat we are on an unsustainable course. They know all these bailouts \nand so-called stimulus acts, all these spending bills and now this \nenormous health care bill, are part of that unsustainable course, and \nthey are crying out. They are saying we must reverse course, we must \nsave our Nation. I hope we do that starting here, starting now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask consent to have 3 minutes outside of \nthe time allotted to make a point of personal privilege, and I ask \nunanimous consent for that. I would say the reason is today is my 41st \nwedding anniversary, and I was going to discuss that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Honoring My Wife on My 41st Anniversary\n\n  Mr. COBURN. In 1953, I met a young lady--actually, it was 1954--a \nyoung lady when she was 6 years of age. Her name was Carolyn. I went \nthrough grade school with this young lady. I went through junior high \nwith this young lady. I went through high school with this young lady. \nThe only serious dating relationship I ever had in my life was with \nthis young girl named Carolyn Denton. She became one of my best friends \nin high school. It just so happened that one weekend I couldn't get a \ndate, she didn't have one, and I asked her out. From that point \nforward, I fell in love with somebody I have been married to for 41 \nyears, my wife Carolyn Coburn.\n  On this day of significant votes in the Senate, and tomorrow, I \nwanted to take a moment to say how much I appreciate what she has meant \nto me the past 41 years, how much stronger she has made me as a man, \nhow she has completed every aspect of my life being my partner as we \nwalk through life, and the gift she gave me of three wonderful \ndaughters.\n  So to my wife Carolyn, in front of the body, I tell you thank you and \nhappy anniversary.\n  I would like to go to my prepared remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have spent 5 years in the Senate talking \nto my colleagues about spending. We find in front of us another \nopportunity to do the wrong thing. We have a debt limit increase. Yet, \nin those 5 years, after hundreds and hundreds of amendments the body \nhas refused to agree to that would cut spending, we are going to \nincrease the debt limit but we are not going to make any effort to cut \nthe spending.\n  I have given seven complete speeches on the floor about the \nsignificant amount of waste in the Federal Government. I will not \nrepeat those now. But that number is now annualized to $380 billion a \nyear--every year, $380 billion worth of waste. Part of it is fraud, but \na large part of it is duplication. Let me give some examples of the \nduplication because I think when Americans hear this they do not \nunderstand why.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that there are 13 Federal \nagencies that spend $3 billion to fund 207 Federal programs, 207 \ndifferent programs, to encourage student standards in the fields of \nmath and science--13 different agencies, 207 different programs. We \ncould have spent one-tenth that amount of money and had exactly the \nsame results and saved $2.7 trillion. But we will not do it.\n  Another example, according to GAO, to the tune of $30 billion, the \nFederal Government funded more than 44 job-training programs \nadministered by 9 different Federal agencies across the Federal \nbureaucracy. According to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, \nwe have 14 departments within the Federal Government and 49 independent \nagencies that operate exchange and study-abroad programs. We have 49 \nprograms instead of 1. I have tons of other examples just like that.\n  We have failed to do our job, and the easiest thing in the world is \nto spend somebody else's money. Increasing the debt limit without \nhaving a rescission to get rid of programs just like this and have one \nprogram that is effective and efficient, that has metrics on it, that \nmeasures its goals and is accountable, instead of 49 or 72 or 64 across \na large number of different agencies--we can do that, but there is no \nwill here to do that. As a consequence, what we do, instead of making \nthe Federal Government more efficient, we just raise the debt limit. I \nam not about to be a part of that anymore.\n  I know my colleagues get upset with me as I come to the floor year \nafter year talking about what we do and the fact that we do not fix the \nreal problems. I have been rather hard to get along with, by my \ncolleagues, in terms of them advancing new programs when we do not \neliminate the programs that are already doing the same thing.\n  I think at this time of Christmas, one of the things we ought to be \ndoing is telling the American public that we will change. Next year, \ninstead of creating new programs, we are going to look at all the \nprograms and consolidate them and have one that does math and science, \none that is for work-study programs abroad, not the numerous numbers we \nhave for which we have no accountability.\n  America recognizes our incompetence, but we are going to spell it \nout. In this new year that comes forward, there is not going to be a \nweek that comes by that I do not come to the floor and show another \nexample to the American people of how we are not doing our work. It \ngrieves me--not for me but for my children and everybody else's \nchildren, for my grandchildren and everybody else's grandchildren--that \nwe fail to treat the real symptoms of our debt; that is, we will not do \nthe hard work of oversight. We should be condemned for that. We are \nfailing the American people. It ought not to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of both my \ncolleagues from Louisiana and Oklahoma touching on an issue that I \nthink is becoming increasingly important to a lot of Americans.\n  I was listening this morning to one of my colleagues on the other \nside as he came down here and talked about how all the spending \nproblems and all these debt problems were all inherited from the \nprevious administration. There is sort of a Bush-phobia or something \naround here among Members on the other side because they do not want to \nown up for the decisions they have made.\n  Granted, I would be the first one to admit that when Republicans were \nin control of the Congress, we didn't do it right all the time and we \nlost our way a little bit with regard to spending.\n  But having said that, we now have--since 2006--a Democratic Congress. \nI need to remind my colleagues that the President doesn't spend a dime \nunder\n\n[[Page S13837]]\n\nour Constitution. Congress has the power of the purse. Congress \nappropriates funds. So if you look at the last several years in terms \nof appropriations, going back to the last couple of years that the \nRepublicans were in control of the Congress, the amount of spending in \nthe nondefense part of the budget was a negative 1 percent in 2007, 5 \npercent in 2006, and 8 percent in 2005. That is nondefense \ndiscretionary spending in our annual appropriations. If you go to total \ngrowth, which includes defense, you are talking about 8 percent in \n2005, 5 percent in 2006, and 2 percent in 2007--more than most people \nwould argue we needed to be spending in annual appropriations bills.\n  But the Democrats took control of the Congress after the 2006 \nelection, so they started writing the budgets. We have ownership for \nthe 2007 budget, but the Democrats have ownership for 2008, 2009, and \n2010. The 2008 budget grew at 9 percent total growth. Nondefense \ndiscretionary spending grew at 6 percent. If you look at nondefense \ndiscretionary spending in 2009, the last fiscal year, it was 12 \npercent. In this fiscal year, 2010, the estimate is that we will spend \n17 percent over the previous year. So year-over-year spending in \nnondefense discretionary appropriations here in the Congress will have \ngrown almost 30 percent in the last 2 years. That is not a problem that \nwas created by the Bush administration. That is not a problem, \nobviously, for which the Republican majority was responsible. That is \nthe Democrats, when they took control of the Congress after the 2006 \nelections, beginning in 2007. They write the budgets, they approve the \nappropriations bills. Obviously, as you can see, the numbers have gone \nup dramatically--12 percent in the 2009 budget year, and the 2010 \nestimate for which we are now funding appropriations bills--and we have \nfunded most of them now with the omnibus or with the smaller \nappropriations bills, the six bills that were passed just a week or two \nago--looking at 17 percent year-over-year spending in appropriations. \nSo that is almost 30 percent in the last 2 budget years. That is not a \nproblem the other side can hold the previous administration responsible \nfor or attack them for.\n  I will also mention that the $1 trillion approved earlier this year \nin the stimulus funding was approved on almost party lines. There were \na couple of Republicans who supported that, but for the most part that \nwas something approved by the Democratic majority. It was proposed by \nthe President of the United States. That is not spending for which the \nformer President is responsible.\n  At some point around here, people have to own up and take \nresponsibility for their own decisions. You cannot blame the past \nadministration. You cannot blame inherited problems for all the \nspending that is going on right here, right now. The last year, as I \nsaid, appropriations spending--and this year again--was by any stretch \nway above anything we have seen or should see at a time when we have an \neconomy in recession and most Americans are having to tighten their \nbudgets--12 percent nondiscretionary increase in 2009 and 17 percent \nincrease in spending in 2010.\n  With that and the stimulus spending, it brings us to where we are \ntoday, which is this massive expansion of the Federal Government--$2.5 \ntrillion in new spending for a new entitlement program. That, too, is \nnot something for which the previous administration is responsible. \nThat is something this administration, the majority here in the \nCongress, has decided they want to push through. They want to finish it \nbefore the Christmas holiday. They want to get this in the rearview \nmirror before the American people have an opportunity to see what is in \nit, particularly in the last hurried rush here over the weekend where \nwe got the 400-page amendment that included all the special last-minute \ndeals that were made to try to get that elusive 60th vote. What we have \nseen is now the $2.5 trillion in new spending is filled with all kinds \nof goodies that are going to favor individual Senators and individual \nStates.\n  The American people are starting to react.\n  The point I want to make about this is, the one thing that the \nPresident and a lot of our colleagues on the other side have been \ntalking about is how this reduces the deficit. This saves $132 billion \nover the next 10 years. Just remember that is $132 billion over 10 \nyears. If you look at what the deficit was for the month of October, if \nany of my colleagues know what the deficit was for the month of \nOctober, 1 month alone, this last October, it was $176 billion--in 1 \nmonth. They are crowing about $132 billion in savings over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  What is interesting about that $132 billion, if you take away all the \ngimmicks and you look at all the phony accounting that has been done to \nget to that number, it goes down in a real hurry.\n  For example, the SGR fix, the physician reimbursement issue is a $200 \nbillion-plus item. Let's say they are saying they got $132 billion in \nsavings over the next 10 years. But at some point you have to deal with \nthat $200 billion SGR. If you take that away, you end up with a \nnegative $68 billion already. Then you add in this CLASS Act, which \neverybody who has any sense, any actuary has absolutely denounced, \nincluding even the Washington Post. But if you look at what the CLASS \nAct does, they are using the revenues in the first early years that \ncome from the premiums paid in. That money will be spent.\n  So when it comes time to pay out benefits, there isn't going to be \nany money there. But they are showing a $72 billion savings or addition \nto their so-called savings in that first 10 years from the CLASS Act. \nThe chairman of the Budget Committee has called the CLASS Act a Ponzi \nscheme of the first order, something that Bernie Madoff would be proud \nof.\n  You take that $72 billion out, which the Congressional Budget Office \nsays is going to add huge deficits in the outyears, you take out that \n$72 billion, and you are already at a $130 billion deficit. We haven't \neven dealt with the fact that because of the way they have set this up, \nby front end loading the tax increases and back end loading spending, \nthat understates the total cost.\n  In the first 10 years, if you take those first 4 years when you have \n$56 billion of revenue coming in and only $9 billion of spending going \nout, that is another $47 billion that you could add to the deficit. So \nyou have gone from $132 billion in savings to a $177 billion deficit. \nThat is before you even get to the more important issue, which is what \nthe CBO came out with today in response to a question by the Senator \nfrom Alabama asking: How can you count money that is going to come from \nthese Medicare cuts, count that as revenue that will save and extend \nthe life of Medicare, and still spend it for a new entitlement program \non health care?\n  The CBO basically said that is double counting. In fact, I want to \nread what they said:\n\n       To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings as \n     both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a share of those \n     savings and thus overstate the improvement in the \n     government's fiscal position.\n\n  Every American knows you can't spend the same money twice. That is \nwhat this does. They are going to cut $1 trillion over 10 years, when \nfully implemented, out of Medicare, but they will spend that money on a \nnew entitlement program and still count the savings in Medicare. You \ncan't have it both ways. The American people have figured out this \nshell game.\n  When you take a $177 billion deficit after you take out all these \naccounting gimmicks, you are already running a significant deficit. \nThen when you add in the fact that what the CBO now says, what most of \nus have believed to be true and have been arguing, that you can't spend \nthe same money twice, you cannot double-count that revenue, the \nMedicare trust fund is going to take a significantly big hit. I know \nthe Senator from Alabama is going to talk more extensively about that. \nI want to point that out because we are going into a big debate about \nraising the debt limit. Everybody, now that the horse is out of the \nbarn, wants to shut the gate. But you can't spend $2.5 trillion on a \nnew entitlement program and then claim to be fiscally responsible or \nsay that you are doing something to reduce the deficit.\n  Interestingly enough, the CMS Actuary said these Medicare cuts are \nunlikely to be sustainable on a permanent basis. We all know we are not\n\n[[Page S13838]]\n\ngoing to cut $1 trillion out of Medicare over the first 10 years. That \njust doesn't happen here. All that money is going to get borrowed and \nput on the debt or they will have to raise taxes to pay for it. You \ncan't have it both ways.\n  As we get into the debate about the debt limit, it is important to \nput things into context. I want to say again that $132 billion in \nsavings, which is what they are saying they get by this health care \nreform bill with all the tax increases and the Medicare cuts, is \nsuspicious in the first place, given the fact that the SGR, the $200 \nbillion is not included, the $72 billion CLASS Act, and the $47 billion \nthat they achieve by front end loading tax increases and back end \nloading spending brings you to a $177 billion deficit in the first 10 \nyears. That does not even include the funky accounting being used with \nregard to the Medicare trust fund. We will get into this debate about \nthe debt limit, but nothing bears on that more heavily than what we do \nwith health care.\n  We need to defeat this. I hope we will still see some courage by a \nfew of my colleagues to help us take this health care bill down, to go \nback to the drawing board, to do it right and to actually put in place \nsolutions that will meaningfully reduce the cost of health care for \npeople in this country, not increase their premiums, and not add to the \ndeficit and saddle future generations with an enormous debt they don't \ndeserve. Remember, $176 billion was the deficit in the month of October \nalone. We are talking about, under their numbers, $132 billion in \nsavings over 10 years which, when you sit down and figure it out, it \njust doesn't add up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when the recession hit last fall, many \nAmericans had been living beyond their means and had to quickly scale \nback. Families all across America have been tightening their belts. \nThey have been forgoing vacations, meals in restaurants, extra \nChristmas presents, cutting back wherever they can. The government \nneeds to take a lesson from those families. It is time that Congress \nand the administration get serious about cutting spending in a \nmeaningful way. Spending during President Obama's first year in office, \nto put it charitably, has not been what most would describe as \nresponsible. Government spending grew by $705 billion in fiscal year \n2009, an increase of 24 percent. Appropriations legislation enacted \nthis year will increase spending by another 8 percent in the year 2010. \nAll of this spending, of course, has an impact on both the Federal \ndeficit and the Federal debt.\n  Let me clarify the difference between those two numbers. The deficit \nis the amount of total spending not covered by revenues in a given \nyear. The debt is the sum of all of the Nation's yearly deficits. The \n2009 deficit made history and not in a good way. It exceeded $1.4 \ntrillion in the last fiscal year. That is the highest amount in history \nand more than three times as much as the highest deficit during the \nlast administration. The budget President Obama submitted to Congress \ndoubles the deficit in 5 years and triples it in 10. It also creates \nmore debt than the combined debt under every President since George \nWashington. That seems almost impossible, but it is true.\n  The President's budget creates more debt than all of the debt ever \ncombined throughout the history of the country, from George Washington \nall the way up through George Bush, more debt under President Obama's \nbudget than all of that combined.\n  Even Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag has said that is not \nsustainable. The debt has reached an almost unimaginable sum of $12 \ntrillion. To pay the Federal Government's bills for the next 2 months, \ntomorrow we are going to consider passing a roughly $300 billion \nincrease in the allowable U.S. national debt known as the debt ceiling. \nThat means our debt ceiling, now $12.1 trillion, will be $12.4 \ntrillion. After those 2 months, we will need to add another $1.5 \ntrillion to the debt ceiling to pay for the remaining spending in the \nyear 2010.\n  Early next year our debt ceiling will be a whopping $13.9 trillion. \nOf the massive national debt, a paper by the Heritage Foundation tells \nus:\n\n       The recession and excessive spending have caused the debt \n     held by the public to grow sharply to 56 percent of the \n     economy, topping the historic average of 36 percent. To make \n     matters worse, entitlement programs will double in size over \n     the next few decades and cause the national debt to reach 320 \n     percent of the economy.\n\n  That is so obviously unsustainable that it has to be of great concern \nto us. It is like the size of a credit card being several times more \nthan our income, such that we can never pay the debt on the credit \ncard. That is even to ignore the interest payments. Let's not forget \nabout that. That is another tab we have to pick up. I have only been \ntalking about the principle. But in 2009 alone, interest payments were \n$209 billion. By the year 2019, interest payments are expected to reach \n$800 billion a year. That is just the interest on the debt.\n  How are we going to afford that? By the way, who do we pay that to? \nWe pay it to all the people we borrow money from, one of which is the \nnation of China. Chinese officials have indicated that they are very \nnervous about the amount of debt the United States is taking on.\n  In mid-March, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao voiced concerns about U.S. \nGovernment bond holdings:\n\n       We have lent huge amounts of money to the United States. Of \n     course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be \n     honest, I am a little bit worried, and I would like to . . . \n     call on the United States to honor its word and remain a \n     credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets.\n\n  What can a lender do when he or a nation becomes concerned that the \nborrower is going to have trouble paying back, when the borrower keeps \ncoming back for more and more lending? What you do is you raise the \ninterest rate to reflect the greater risk in the lending of the money. \nThat is what is going to happen to us. That greater interest rate is \ngoing to be manifest in payments that we have to make by our \nproductivity and the taxes we pay. That will decrease our standard of \nliving and create an additional obligation on the American people.\n  President Obama has acknowledged the problem. He said:\n\n       We can't keep on just borrowing from China. We have to pay \n     interest on that debt, and that means we are mortgaging our \n     children's future with more and more debt.\n\n  He is right. So why does he propose more spending and more borrowing \nand more than any other President in the history of the world?\n  It is time for words and actions to match. It is time for Congress \nand the President to start reining in this out-of-control spending and \ndebt. I stand with my colleague from Alabama in support of his \namendment to reinstate statutory spending caps. While this is not a \npanacea for solving the fiscal problems the Nation faces, it is a good \nway to start on the path to responsibility. I will bet that most of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will vote against it. It is \nwrong for them to expect Republicans to extend the debt ceiling as long \nas they are unwilling to do anything to get spending under control.\n  Americans expect us to get this spending and debt under control. When \nwe return to the Senate in January, our first item of business will be \na long-term debt ceiling extension, including consideration of the \nSessions amendment and others. After pushing the stimulus, the auto \nbailout, cash for clunkers, the massive $2.5 trillion health care bill, \nand others, I would hope our Democratic colleagues are ready to take a \nbreather from their big spending and support a more reasonable course \nso that we don't have to continue to extend the Nation's debt ceiling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for his consistent \nperformance over his entire career in the Senate of trying to maintain \nfinancial responsibility in this body, and I respect him highly on that \nand many other issues.\n  There is so much we could say at this point on the debt limit, on \nwhich we expect the vote tomorrow. I am not going to vote on a debt \nlimit increase until we accompany it with some action that will \nactually reduce the incredibly irresponsible path we are on. That is \ngoing to be one of my positions, and I think others will take the same \nview.\n  Saying we have to increase the debt--well, we have to do something\n\n[[Page S13839]]\n\nabout reckless government spending. We really do. We have to do \nsomething about it. They always say: Next year. So I say: When? I \nbelieve we should condition any increase in the debt limit on the \npassage of legislation that would renew what has expired, spending caps \non the discretionary spending accounts. I thank Senator Kyl for \nsupporting the legislation.\n  In other words, we can do that. We did it in 1990. You can see, as \nshown on this chart, the declining expenditures that resulted in those \nnumbers. We passed it in 1990. As shown on this chart, those yellow \nlines represent the deficit--up to $300 billion, and it began to \nshrink. In late 2000, 2001, we had surpluses in our accounts. It is odd \nto show a surplus, shown below the line on this chart, but we \naccomplished that.\n  President Clinton liked to claim credit for it. I have a vague memory \nthat Republicans shut the government down to contain President \nClinton's spending. But there were battles over containing spending, \nand it worked. A big key to it was the spending limits, the spending \ncaps. Those expired in 2002, and, look, we began to show the increases \nin deficits again. So I think as a condition of voting for a debt \nincrease we should have a fix of the restoring of the caps.\n  Senator Kyl made reference to the fact that under President Obama's \n10-year budget he submitted earlier this year, which was scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group, but the leaders were \npicked by the Democratic majority. What would it do to our deficit, I \nask? He has a budget for 10 years. He shows what he expects to have in \nrevenues during those 10 years and what he expects to spend. He does \nnot show, however, what is spent in the health care legislation because \nthat was not in law at the time the budget was submitted. So in truth \nit will be worse than this.\n  But let's look at this. In 2008, the debt was $5.8 trillion; in 2013 \nit doubles to $11.8 trillion; and by 2019, it triples to $17.3 \ntrillion. That is a stunning tripling of the public debt of the United \nStates of America. It is an unsustainable path. One of the most grim \nparts of the scoring of this deficit expansion is it is not getting \nbetter. In years 8, 9, 10, the deficit is going up to almost $1 \ntrillion a year; in 2019--the 10th year--going up. They are not \nprojecting during that 10 years any recession. In fact, they projected \nthat we would come out of the recession we are in now faster than we \nare coming out of it. So the numbers probably will be worse there.\n  This is not made up. This is the President's budget. It is scored by \nthis Congress's CBO, and it is the best numbers we have. It is a \nstunning development. We cannot continue. That is why people say it is \nunsustainable.\n  Senator Kyl made reference to this. I made a chart on it some time \nago. I just could not believe it. In 2009, the total interest this \ngovernment paid on the debt we owe was $170 billion. You can see, this \nchart shows the annual interest payments we make that are surging year \nafter year. It is the result of several things.\n  CBO is cautious, but they are acknowledging that interest rates are \ngoing to go up. We have virtually zero interest rates in short-term \nTreasuries today. That is not going to continue. So you have more debt \nand higher interest rates. You get surging interest payments.\n  In 2017, we have interest payments over $600 billion. It goes over, \nin 2019--1 year's interest--$799 billion. As I recall, the \nsupplementals we have used to fund the war in Iraq represented about \n$70 billion a year. A couple years ago, our highway spending was about \n$40 billion a year. Aid to education is about $100 billion a year. In \n2019, in 1 year, we will pay $799 billion, I think, at a minimum, just \nin interest. You see how huge those numbers are? It is unsustainable. \nWe cannot continue to do this.\n  The American people understand it. CNN did a poll last month. They \nasked this question of the American people:\n\n       Which of the following comes closer to your view of the \n     budget deficit--the government should run a deficit if \n     necessary when the country is in a recession and at war or \n     the government should balance the budget even when the \n     country is in a recession and is at war?\n\n  What do you favor? Sixty-seven percent say: ``Balance the budget.''\n  Well, what is Congress doing? Running the most incredible series of \ndeficits we have ever seen, tripling the national debt in 10 years--all \nin furtherance, basically, of President Obama's budget, which calls for \nthis.\n  Sure, President Bush was not as frugal and fiscally responsible as he \nshould have been. Most, however, of his debt was driven by war costs. \nBut regardless, he could have been more frugal and spent less. But the \ndeficits he had would come in at half or less than half of the deficits \nwe are going to see on average over the next 10 years. So I have to \nsay, we are losing our perspective.\n  This health care reform bill is a serious matter. We have a report \nthis morning from the Congressional Budget Office that clarifies what \nhas been pretty obvious to us for some time, but it was difficult to \nget an official accounting of how these numbers are scored or added up \nby the Congressional Budget Office.\n  But, basically, what they say is pretty simple. They are saying that \nproposals in this bill that raise the payroll tax on Medicare and \nreduce expenditures within Medicare--cutting Medicare--saves money. It \nputs more money in the pot. But it is part of the Medicare trust fund \npot. As to that savings, it is said: Well, we will just spend it over \nhere and pay for this new health care program that was just voted on \nearlier today.\n  So we are going to take this savings and increased revenue to \nMedicare, and we are going to spend it over here. This is a chart I \njust put together to try to show that. As shown on this chart, here is \nMedicare. You raise Medicare income and you cut their costs and you \ncreate an extra surplus. We have some surplus still in Medicare. If we \ndo not do something about it, Medicare will be in deficit in 2017--8 \nyears. So this transfer of money then goes to the U.S. Treasury, and: \nOh, we have extra money, let's spend it on a new health care reform \nthat has never before been passed, creating benefits for people who \nhave never received these kinds of benefits before because we want to \nbe helpful to those people, create more insured people in America.\n  But as the CBO said, you cannot count this money twice. What about \nthe people who are paying into Medicare, who have been paying into it \nfor 40 years? They have not received a dime of benefit--until they get \nto age 65--and it is their money they are putting into Medicare. They \nare not just giving it over here to the U.S. Treasury.\n  As one of them wrote me: You are taking my money. I am 67. I am just \nnow beginning to draw Medicare. You are taking my money and giving it \nto somebody else. I have never received any benefits from Medicare \nuntil now, and you are taking it from me.\n  So as a matter of the way our accounting occurs, the U.S. Treasury \ncannot take that money just free and clear. It is not extra, free \nmoney.\n  I see my colleague. I want Senator Baucus to recognize that according \nto the CBO Director--he told me last night, there are bonds issued. \nTreasury has to give a bond to Medicare, a Treasury note, an IOU. So \nwhen Medicare starts running in default--as it will within the next 15 \nyears if this bill were to pass--when Medicare starts running \ninto default, they are going to have the Treasury pay for it. So, in \neffect, this bond causes the U.S. Treasury to pay interest to Medicare.\n\n  During this first 10 years, the U.S. Treasury will pay interest to \nMedicare of $69 billion on the money they borrowed--this IOU here. \nThen, when it goes into default--as it is inevitably heading into \ndefault--the Treasury will have to pay those bonds. So it increases the \ndebt.\n  What CBO says, without any equivocation, is--it is not disputable--\nthe debt of the United States will be increased by this bill, not \ndecreased. It will not be a $132 billion surplus in reality but will be \na $170 billion deficit, just on that. Then, when you get to what \nSenator Thune talked about, other gimmicks in the bill, it makes that \neven worse.\n  You say, well, the CBO has a score that says it is a $132 billion \nsurplus. It reduces our debt $132 billion. Well, the way they are doing \nthis, and the way that accounting is done, with trust funds and \nnontrust funds in a unified\n\n[[Page S13840]]\n\ngovernment budget, they do not score this IOU because they seem to \nthink it is all one government, and so what is one is not the other, \nand it is not debt. But it is a debt, and they said it explicitly. You \ncannot count the money over here as adding to the life of Medicare and \nat the same time score this as free money to be spent over here on this \nprogram.\n  President Obama, Monday, at a press conference, said it is going to \nreduce our deficit $132 billion, and it is going to extend the life of \nMedicare by 9 years. Well, you cannot do both, as they have explicitly \nstated in the letter we got from CBO, and it is just a matter of \nabsolute fact.\n  They say:\n\n       To describe the full amount of HI trust fund savings--\n\n  Over here in Medicare--\n\n     as both improving the government's ability to pay future \n     Medicare benefits and financing new spending outside of \n     Medicare would essentially double-count a large share of \n     those savings. . . .\n\n  Well, these kinds of gimmicks and manipulations have been done \nbefore, but it is time to end it. I think the American people have \nsaid: In a time of war, in a time of recession, we need to get busy \nabout the budget--by a two-thirds vote.\n  They are right. We are going to work our way out of this recession. \nThis American economy will respond sooner or later and, hopefully, \nsooner for the people of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is that the 10 minutes on this side? And \nis there time left on this side? I ask unanimous consent to have 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I think our side has another 10 minutes or \nso, with which I would perhaps enter into a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  I would ask the Senator, on the point he made--and I give the Senator \ngreat credit for raising that question to the CBO--because I think it \nis intuitive to most people that you cannot spend money twice; that you \ncannot somehow double-count it. That is essentially what the CBO said \nin their letter. I think the Senator quoted from it.\n  They went on to say--CBO has written ``that the savings to the HI \ntrust fund . . . would be received by the government only once, so they \ncannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the \nsame time, pay for current spending on other parts of the legislation \nor on other programs.'' That is the argument we have been making all \nalong. I guess finally it dawned on the CBO, evidently, and it took the \nSenator's question, I think, to get them to respond this way.\n\n  But the way the Senator explained the interaction between government \ntrust funds, the unified budget, and the IOUs the government writes to \nitself, perhaps gives some explanation to how they came up with this \nactually achieving a savings. But the Senator made it very clear: $170 \nbillion actually to the deficit. As I mentioned earlier, the accounting \ngimmicks that have been used have understated the 10-year cost of this. \nBy the way, my staff corrected me. The off-the-top-of-my-head \ncalculation was $177 billion in deficit; it is actually $187 billion. \nSo you add that to what you mentioned, pretty soon you have what they \nare claiming is a $170 billion savings turns into a very sizable \ndeficit.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Alabama--again, I give him great \ncredit for bringing this to light, raising this issue with the CBO--\nwhat does that mean for this piece of legislation we are going to be \nvoting on tomorrow, a $2\\1/2\\ trillion expansion of the government \nfinanced through tax increases and Medicare cuts. Yet even with all \nthat, the assumption is, this is not going to meet the requirement the \nPresident set out; that is, that it doesn't add a single dime to the \ndeficit.\n  What does that mean to that commitment made by the President and to \nthis legislation's sort of fiscal situation as we move forward and to \nthese negotiations or discussions, if this passes tomorrow, with the \nHouse of Representatives?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This is a huge issue. I remember a few months ago, in a \njoint session of Congress, President Obama spoke to us. He looked out \nat the crowd and said: This bill will not add one dollar--or one dime--\nto the national debt. It was a firm commitment to all the American \npeople who were listening, all the Congressmen and Senators in that \nroom--it will not add to the debt. So what we now know is that this \nbill is going to add to the debt. There is no doubt about it. The debt \nof the United States will increase. It is a dangerous trend that \nhappens in a lot of different ways that has put us onto this course.\n  I think he recognized you shouldn't increase the debt. He recognized, \nif he is going to create an entirely new health care program over here, \nit ought to be paid for, and he promised to do that. We have Members of \nthis body, Members of the House who supported the bill, based on the \npromise it would not increase the debt. But we have now, conclusive \nproof, in any number of different ways but particularly with the CBO \nscore, that it will increase the debt. It is a decisive issue as far as \nI can see.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will further yield, in addition to this \nrevelation from the CBO, which I think does change the game and the \nwhole debate about whether this is a budget buster, which it has been \ndescribed as, in spite of the fact that our colleagues on the other \nside have been arguing it extends the life of Medicare, I think this \nstatement by the CBO certainly shreds the notion that you can have it \nboth ways; that you can double count this money; that you can spend it \ntwice. You can't do that. I think the American people get that, which \nis why they believe it will add to the deficit as well.\n  But there are other things in this bill----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would just say my understanding, having looked at \nthis at some length and given it thought, is the legislation will \nextend Medicare because it increases the Medicare tax, and that will \nbring in more money. It pretends we will slash provider payments on \nhealth care and others and save money that way. So, on paper, it \ndefinitely should extend the life of Medicare.\n  What do we do with the money? Well, the money that is saved is not \nstaying in Medicare. It is being borrowed by the U.S. Treasury to spend \non a new program, and the U.S. Treasury owes it to Medicare. We can see \nin the trends in Medicare it will not be too many years before Medicare \nis going to want that money. That is going to leave us over here, and \nthat is why we have a debt. It increases our debt, and we are going to \nhave to pay that back--our children, our grandchildren--sooner than \nthat. Hopefully, we will be around to pay some of that back.\n  So that is the problem we have. It is a misrepresentation to say this \ncreates money that can fund a program on a permanent basis. It does \nnot. It is just an internal debt situation.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator will further yield, a couple other items \nthat are being used to get us to where this argument can be made, which \nis that there are savings from this, this $132 billion savings and \ndeficit reduction the majority has talked about also includes the \ncreation of an entirely new program called this CLASS Act.\n  There were eight Democratic Senators who wrote a letter, basically, \nasking that the CLASS Act not be included in this bill, recognizing \nwhat many have; that is, that the CBO has recognized that while it may \nshow some savings in the early years, when people are paying premiums, \nit is similar to everything else. That money, when it gets spent on \nother things, isn't there to pay out benefits when the time comes to \npay out benefits. So we get this artificial $72 billion infusion of \ncash in the early years, which is being used to, again, understate the \ncost of this and to demonstrate--or to make the argument that there is, \nin fact, $132 billion in savings here or deficit reduction.\n  There is $72 billion that this CLASS Act represents in that first 10-\nyear window which, as I described earlier, our colleague on the other \nside has described it as a Ponzi scheme. But it does create an entirely \nnew program, not unlike some of the entitlement programs that already \nexist, where payments are coming in now that are being used to spend \nfor other purposes that someday, when the chickens come home to roost, \nthere is going to be another reckoning. Again, I think it is another \nexample of a program of a way\n\n[[Page S13841]]\n\nin which this financial picture, with regard to this health care bill, \nis understating its true costs and its impact on deficits in the long \nrun.\n  I would ask my colleague from Alabama, having looked at that \nparticular program, if he would agree that too is something that is \ngoing to cost us significantly in the outyears and whether that is \nsomething that ought to be included as counted toward the whole \ncalculation on deficit reduction in this legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Thune for his leadership in exposing \nthis. The way I believe this operates--and you correct me if I am \nwrong--but the way I believe it operates is it requires a certain \nnumber of premiums now, and the actuaries who score these things say \nthat in the years to come, there will be claims on those policies and \npeople will claim more and more as they get older and the years go by \nand it becomes actuarially unsound. But in the first few years, on \npaper--on paper--for the first 2 years, it looks good because you have \nmore coming in than going out. So they are scoring this short-term \nsurplus--correct me if I am wrong--they are scoring this as an asset, \nas income to the Treasury, when the contracts people have when they \nstart paying this money in protects them for years and years to come, \nand in the future they will be making more claims than are paid out.\n  That is why it is actuarially unsound and will increase the debt in \nthe long run. Would the Senator describe it that way?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I think that is exactly how it would work. Again, it \nis another gimmick, if you will; another accounting tool.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So it is dishonest. When you know a program is not \nactuarially sound and it is going to take additional Federal Government \nrevenue to honor the contracts in the years to come, to count that \ntoday as an asset is wrong. It is improper to do that. We ought not to \npropose a plan that has a Ponzi scheme-type nature to it.\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I don't disagree, and I think the American people \nagree with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this has been an interesting discussion we \nhave heard in the last 15, 20 minutes. One can do anything with \nfigures, numbers. I am not going to cite the often-used phrase that \nsome category of people can figure, another category of people can do \nsomething else. But anyway, one can do anything with numbers, anything \nwhatsoever. Frankly, this is an effort to confuse by pulling different \nfigures out from one document and then another and concocting--they can \nput a board up here. It is just an effort to confuse. One can do \nanything with numbers.\n  The real question is, What are the facts?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to first make a point, and I will yield later to \nthe Senator.\n  The Congressional Budget Office stands by its analysis. I have before \nme an e-mail sent today, dated today's date, 2:56 p.m., and let me read \nit, from the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office has been asked whether our \n     memo this morning discussing the effect of [this legislation] \n     incorporating the manager's amendment, on the federal budget \n     and on the balance in the Hospital Insurance trust fund \n     alters CBO's earlier findings about the budgetary impact of \n     the legislation. It does not. In particular, as described in \n     our December 19 and December 20 letters to Senator Reid--\n\n  Let me continue reading and, hopefully, Senators are listening to \nthis because this is a letter today, actually it is an e-mail today, at \n2:56 p.m. CBO says:\n\n       CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     estimate that the legislation would reduce federal budget \n     deficits by $132 billion during the 2010-2019 period.\n\n  Next:\n\n       CBO expects that the legislation would reduce federal \n     budget deficits during the decade beyond 2019 relative to \n     those projected under current law--with a total effect during \n     that decade that is in a broad range between one-quarter \n     percent and one-half percent of GDP.\n\n  Of course, we know that is about $650 billion to $1.3 trillion. That \nis CBO today.\n  Third:\n\n       CBO expects that the legislation would generate a reduction \n     in the federal budgetary commitment to health care during the \n     decade beyond 2019.\n\n  So what everyone says--and I might say to my good friend from \nAlabama, part of that chart he had before us today is accurate, I mean \nthe flow of Medicare and the IOUs and so forth. The part that is \ninaccurate is the increasing debt and the double accounting part. There \nis no double accounting here. There are separate accounting regimes and \nprocedures that are used for all trust funds, including Medicare. The \nMedicare trust fund issues dollars that are in surplus in the outyears, \nas the Senator said, that have been held by the trust fund--by the \ntrustees--and dollars that are used in any way the Federal Government \ndecides to spend dollars, either pursuant to legislation or maybe the \nadministration on its own may be spending some dollars in one place or \nanother.\n  This is not double accounting. Nobody has claimed there is double \naccounting. There are two different regimes and that is how--the \nSenator accurately described how the Medicare trust fund is accounted \nfor. But it is also true that under our budget rules, we have a unified \nbudget, there is one government--U.S. Government--there is Medicare and \nthe rest of the government, and under that unified budget regime, the \nCBO still reaches the same conclusion it has always reached. I would \nlike that to be on the Record.\n  The Senator has a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I would agree that--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will address the other Senator \nthrough the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that CBO's second statement is correct. I think \nthe statement they did earlier about the $132 billion surplus reducing \nthe debt over 10 years is technically accurate. But I think the \nstatement they issued early this morning that this is--to count it in \nboth places is a double count of the money, in effect.\n  My question to the Senator is, we are going to be talking about \nvoting on the debt limit tomorrow.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The debt limit is the gross debt of the country.\n  Isn't it true the passage of this health care bill will increase the \ngross debt of the country, the gross debt being both the public debt \nand the intergovernmental debt?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, that is not----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will not the bill increase the gross debt of the United \nStates?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might respond and answer the question--no; the exact \nopposite. CBO says so. CBO says it actually reduces the debt by $1 \nbillion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am asking the difference. The question is gross debt. \nDoes it reduce or increase the gross debt?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might, Mr. President, as the Senator knows, the debt \nis the accumulation of deficits, and by definition, if a deficit is \nreduced, therefore, the national debt is also reduced. That is a \nmathematical truism. If the deficit is reduced, automatically the debt \nis reduced. That is mathematics.\n  The next point I want to make, there was substantial debate today \nabout the constitutionality of this bill. As I have discussed before, \nwe have confidence that the health care plan we have crafted is an \nappropriate exercise of the commerce clause and does not violate the \n10th amendment. We further believe that ample power is available under \nthe takings and spending power, as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two articles by \nProf. Erwin Chemerinsky and Prof. Michael Dorf.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, Oct. 23, 2009]\n\n                  Health Care Reform is Constitutional\n\n                         (By Erwin Chemerinsky)\n\n       Those opposing health care reform are increasingly relying \n     on an argument that has\n\n[[Page S13842]]\n\n     no legal merit: that the health care reform legislation would \n     be unconstitutional. There is, of course, much to debate \n     about how to best reform America's health care system. But \n     there is no doubt that bills passed by House and Senate \n     committees are constitutional.\n       Some who object to the health care proposals claim that \n     they are beyond the scope of congressional powers. \n     Specifically, they argue that Congress lacks the authority to \n     compel people to purchase health insurance or pay a tax or a \n     fine.\n       Congress clearly could do this under its power pursuant to \n     Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution to regulate commerce \n     among the states. The Supreme Court has held that this \n     includes authority to regulate activities that have a \n     substantial effect on interstate commerce. In the area of \n     economic activities, ``substantial effect'' can be found \n     based on the cumulative impact of the activity across the \n     country. For example, a few years ago, the Supreme Court held \n     that Congress could use its commerce clause authority to \n     prohibit individuals from cultivating and possessing small \n     amounts of marijuana for personal medicinal use because \n     marijuana is bought and sold in interstate commerce.\n       The relationship between health care coverage and the \n     national economy is even stronger and more readily apparent. \n     In 2007, health care expenditures amounted to $2.2 trillion, \n     or $7,421 per person, and accounted for 16.2 percent of the \n     gross domestic product.\n       Ken Klukowski, writing in POLITICO, argued that ``people \n     who declined to purchase government-mandated insurance would \n     not be engaging in commercial activity, so there's no \n     interstate commerce.'' Klukowski's argument is flawed because \n     the Supreme Court never has said that the commerce power is \n     limited to regulating those who are engaged in commercial \n     activity.\n       Quite the contrary: The court has said that Congress can \n     use its commerce power to forbid hotels and restaurants from \n     discriminating based on race, even though their conduct was \n     refusing to engage in commercial activity. Likewise, the \n     court has said that Congress can regulate the growing of \n     marijuana for personal medicinal use, even if the person \n     being punished never engaged in any commercial activity.\n       Under an unbroken line of precedents stretching back 70 \n     years, Congress has the power to regulate activities that, \n     taken cumulatively, have a substantial effect on interstate \n     commerce. People not purchasing health insurance \n     unquestionably has this effect.\n       There is a substantial likelihood that everyone will need \n     medical care at some point. A person with a communicable \n     disease will be treated whether or not he or she is insured. \n     A person in an automobile accident will be rushed to the \n     hospital for treatment, whether or not he or she is insured. \n     Congress would simply be requiring everyone to be insured to \n     cover their potential costs to the system.\n       Congress also could justify this as an exercise of its \n     taxing and spending power. Congress can require the purchase \n     of health insurance and then tax those who do not do so in \n     order to pay their costs to the system. This is similar to \n     Social Security taxes, which everyone pays to cover the costs \n     of the Social Security system. Since the 1930s, the Supreme \n     Court has accorded Congress broad powers to tax and spend for \n     the general welfare and has left it to Congress to determine \n     this.\n       Nor is there any basis for arguing that an insurance \n     requirement violates individual liberties. No \n     constitutionally protected freedom is infringed. There is no \n     right to not have insurance. Most states now require \n     automobile insurance as a condition for driving.\n       Since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has consistently \n     held that a tax cannot be challenged as an impermissible take \n     of private property for public use without just compensation. \n     All taxes are a taking of private property for public use, \n     but no tax has ever been invalidated on that basis.\n       Since the late 1930s, the Supreme Court has ruled that \n     government economic regulations, including taxes, are to be \n     upheld as long as they are reasonable. Virtually all economic \n     regulations and taxes have been found to meet this standard \n     for more than 70 years. There is thus no realistic chance \n     that the mandate for health insurance would be invalidated \n     for denying due process or equal protection.\n       Those who object to the health care proposals on \n     constitutional grounds are making an argument that has no \n     basis in the law. They are invoking the rhetorical power of \n     the Constitution to support their opposition to health care \n     reform, but the law is clear that Congress constitutionally \n     has the power to do so. There is much to argue about in the \n     debate over health care reform, but constitutionality is not \n     among the hard questions to consider.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From FindLaw Legal News, Nov. 2, 2009]\n\n      The Constitutionality of Health Insurance Reform, Part II: \n                          Congressional Power\n\n                          (By Michael C. Dorf)\n\n       Although many key details remain to be negotiated, Congress \n     appears poised to enact some substantial reform of American \n     health care that will build on, rather than replace, our \n     patchwork of government, private, and non-profit insurance. \n     The bill that the President signs will likely contain, among \n     other things, an ``individual mandate'' requiring that \n     everyone obtain health insurance or face a financial penalty. \n     Would such a mandate be constitutional?\n       In my last column and an accompanying blog entry, I \n     considered and rejected the objection that an individual \n     mandate would be an unprecedented burden on liberty because \n     it would affirmatively direct conduct, rather than either \n     forbidding conduct or imposing affirmative obligations on \n     only those who engage in conduct that the government has the \n     power to forbid. As I explained, there are substantial \n     precedents for such affirmative obligations and even if there \n     were not, there is no reason in principle why an affirmative \n     duty is a greater restriction on liberty than a prohibition \n     or condition.\n       In this column, I consider a different objection to the \n     individual mandate: the claim that the federal government \n     lacks the authority under the Constitution to impose the \n     mandate or to penalize those who do not comply. As I explain, \n     this objection is also unsound as a matter of constitutional \n     law. I conclude, however, that individual members of Congress \n     ought to decide for themselves whether regulating health care \n     in the manner of the proposed bills is an appropriate job for \n     the federal government, or instead should be left to state \n     regulation or the market.\n\n\n  Is a Regulation of Health Care a Regulation of Interstate Commerce?\n\n       Under the Tenth Amendment, Congress may only enact \n     legislation that falls within one or more of its enumerated \n     powers. Most of those powers--and all of the powers that are \n     potentially relevant in the health insurance reform debate--\n     are found in Article I, Section 8. From the very earliest \n     days of the Republic, there has been controversy about the \n     scope of those powers.\n       Consider, for instance, that the Constitution does not \n     expressly grant Congress the power to charter a bank. \n     Accordingly, President George Washington asked two of his \n     Cabinet members to prepare memoranda on whether that power \n     could nonetheless be inferred from the powers that are \n     enumerated in the Constitution--including the powers to \n     regulate interstate and foreign commerce, to coin money, to \n     lay and collect taxes, to spend money for the general \n     welfare, and to enact such laws as are ``necessary and proper \n     for carrying into execution the'' specifically enumerated \n     powers.\n       Arguing for a position that would today be called ``states' \n     rights,'' Thomas Jefferson said no. The enumerated powers had \n     to be construed narrowly, he said, or else the federal \n     government would completely overshadow the states. Alexander \n     Hamilton disagreed, however. He explained that in order to \n     carry out the powers it was expressly granted, Congress must \n     have implied powers. Washington sided with Hamilton and, \n     years later, in the landmark 1819 case of McCulloch v. \n     Maryland, so did the Supreme Court.\n       At various points in American history, politicians and \n     judges have flirted with the Jeffersonian view, but for the \n     most part, the Hamiltonian position has prevailed, especially \n     with respect to laws purporting to regulate interstate \n     commerce. Thus, under the Supreme Court's 1942 decision in \n     Wickard v. Filburn, Congress can forbid a farmer from growing \n     more wheat than his federal quota allows on the theory that \n     if he does not grow wheat, he will purchase it, which will \n     affect the interstate market.\n       Likewise, in the 2005 case of Gonzales v. Raich, the Court \n     said that in the course of regulating the national illegal \n     market in marijuana, Congress could forbid the intrastate, \n     noncommercial production and consumption of medical \n     marijuana, even if it is legal under state law. The Court \n     explained that Congress legitimately worried that making an \n     exception to the general prohibition on marijuana use for \n     medical marijuana use that is authorized by state law could \n     substantially undermine the government's ability to police \n     other marijuana production, distribution, and possession.\n       That same logic applies to the individual mandate in the \n     health insurance context. As I explained in my last column, \n     the main point of the individual mandate is to ensure that \n     insurance companies cover people even though they have pre-\n     existing conditions. Without the individual mandate, however, \n     many young, healthy people would decline insurance until they \n     got sick, creating a severe adverse selection problem. Thus, \n     the individual mandate is closely connected with the \n     regulation of health insurance, just as the Court said in \n     Raich that the regulation of marijuana that is used for \n     medical purposes is closely related to the regulation of the \n     broader market for marijuana.\n       Health care is an enormous interstate business. It \n     therefore counts as interstate commerce, regulable by \n     Congress. Just as, in Raich, Congress acted constitutionally \n     by declining to exempt individual acts of noncommercial \n     intrastate marijuana possession from the Controlled \n     Substances Act, so too Congress would act constitutionally by \n     including an individual mandate within the ambit of its \n     regulation of health care.\n\n\n    Is Existence an ``Economic Activity''? That's the Wrong Question\n\n       Skeptics nonetheless point to two Supreme Court cases--the \n     1995 ruling in United States v. Lopez and the 2000 decision \n     in United States v. Morrison--as grounds for the conclusion \n     that the individual mandate would be beyond the power of \n     Congress under the Commerce Clause. In Lopez, the Court \n     invalidated a federal criminal law forbidding\n\n[[Page S13843]]\n\n     possession of a firearm near a schoolyard. In Morrison, the \n     Court rejected a federal law providing victims of gender-\n     motivated violence with a right to sue their attackers. Both \n     decisions reasoned that Congress typically cannot regulate \n     ``noneconomic'' intrastate activities on the ground that they \n     affect interstate commerce.\n       Accordingly, lawyers David Casey and Lee Rivkin, writing in \n     The Washington Post in August, concluded that Lopez and \n     Morrison make the Commerce Clause unavailable as a source of \n     congressional power for the individual mandate because a \n     human being's mere existence is not a form of economic \n     activity. Indeed, they might have added, existence is not an \n     activity at all.\n       Although the issue is not entirely free from doubt, I do \n     not think that Casey and Rivkin have correctly read the \n     precedents. In Lopez and Morrison, Congress sought to \n     prohibit activities--firearms possession near schools and \n     gender-motivated violence, respectively--that were not, \n     according to the Court, ``economic.'' In those two cases, it \n     was only by several logical inferences of the handbone-\n     connected-to-the-wristbone-wrist-\n     bone-connected-to-the-elbow-bone sort that one could move \n     from the regulated activity to an effect on commerce. For \n     example, in Lopez, the theory went as follows: Guns near \n     schools intimidate children; intimidated children have a \n     hard time concentrating on their studies; they learn less; \n     they then grow up to be less productive members of \n     society; and thus the national economy suffers. Even \n     though each link in this chain is plausible, the Lopez \n     majority reasoned that if the Court were to allow this \n     sort of inferential process, then virtually anything would \n     count as a regulation of interstate commerce. \n     Acknowledging that congressional power under the Commerce \n     Clause is very broad, the Court in Lopez and Morrison \n     nonetheless insisted that it is not infinitely broad.\n       By contrast with the laws that were invalidated in Lopez \n     and Morrison, the individual mandate is quite close to the \n     core of the Commerce Clause. Treating the mere existence of a \n     human being as the predicate of regulation in the health care \n     bills would miss the point. Whereas the Gun Free School Zones \n     Act in Lopez and the civil remedy provision of the Violence \n     Against Women Act in Morrison sought to discourage certain \n     conduct, the point of the individual mandate is to encourage \n     certain conduct. And crucially, the conduct the individual \n     mandate seeks to encourage is quintessentially economic: It \n     is the purchase of a service, namely health insurance.\n       Does Congress have the power to encourage people to engage \n     in market transactions? Of course it does. That, after all, \n     was the whole point of the law upheld in Filburn: By limiting \n     the amount of wheat that farmer Filburn could grow, the \n     government sought to encourage him to buy compensating \n     amounts on the market. As the unanimous Court explained in a \n     ruling that the more recent cases expressly reaffirm: ``The \n     stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function \n     quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions \n     thereon.''\n       In the end, then, the argument of Casey, Rivkin, and others \n     who oppose the individual mandate on Article I grounds \n     amounts to no more than the assertion that the Constitution \n     forbids Congress from using the most direct means of \n     encouraging market activity: a mandate that individuals do \n     so. But there is nothing in the text or history of the \n     Constitution to support that conclusion.\n       Indeed, the Ur-decision about Article I power, McCulloch, \n     says the exact opposite: ``Let the end be legitimate, let it \n     be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which \n     are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which \n     are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of \n     the constitution, are constitutional.''\n       As we have seen, the individual mandate is ``plainly \n     adapted'' to the undoubtedly legitimate end of regulating the \n     enormous and enormously important health-care sector of the \n     national economy. It is therefore constitutional.\n\n\n                           The Taxation Power\n\n       In light of the broad interpretation the Supreme Court has \n     given to the enumerated powers of Congress, an Act may be \n     justified on more than one constitutional ground. Thus, the \n     individual mandate could alternatively be upheld as a valid \n     exercise of the Article I power to ``lay and collect taxes, \n     duties, imposts and excises,'' as bolstered by the Sixteenth \n     Amendment's authorization of an income tax. After all, in \n     most versions of the individual mandate, Americans are not \n     literally required to purchase health insurance: Instead, \n     they are told to pay a tax from which they can be exempted if \n     they have health insurance.\n       To be sure, as Casey and Rivkin observe, a 1922 case, \n     Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co., holds that Congress may not \n     use taxation as a pretext for accomplishing a regulatory \n     objective that it could not accomplish directly. But \n     subsequent cases upholding ``occupational taxes'' on \n     businesses that Congress clearly intended to discourage, have \n     made clear that a tax that serves a revenue-raising purpose \n     is not invalid simply because it also serves a regulatory \n     purpose. And there is no doubt that the tax on uninsured \n     income earners would serve a valid revenue-raising purpose--\n     namely, to defray the costs of subsidizing health insurance \n     for those who could not otherwise afford it.\n       Thus, even if Congress lacked the power to adopt the \n     individual mandate under the Commerce Clause, the taxing \n     power would separately authorize a properly-worded tax on the \n     uninsured, despite its regulatory impact.\n\n\n      Federalism in Congress: Its Members, Too, Can Consider the \n                Constitutional Dimensions of Legislation\n\n       The foregoing analysis shows why an individual mandate \n     would be upheld against a court challenge, so long as the \n     courts faithfully apply the current Supreme Court precedents. \n     Nonetheless, members of Congress are entitled--indeed, some \n     might say they are obligated--to reach their own \n     constitutional judgment about any bill that comes before \n     them. And that is especially true when there is a question \n     about the proper role of the federal government and the \n     states.\n       In its cases involving challenges to congressional power, \n     the Supreme Court has sometimes said that the broad deference \n     given to Congress arises out of institutional concerns: \n     Except in extreme cases, the Justices lack the fact-finding \n     capacity and democratic legitimacy to make all of the fine-\n     grained judgments about what matters should be federalized \n     and what matters should be best left to the states. In the \n     words of the late constitutional law scholar Herbert \n     Wechsler, the Court relies on ``the political safeguards of \n     federalism'' to do most of the work of ensuring a \n     constitutional balance between national and state regulation.\n       Wechsler pointed to a variety of ways in which the \n     interests of the states are represented in Congress itself. \n     Chief among these are the facts that each state has two \n     Senators, and that electoral districts respect state lines. \n     In addition, as Stanford Law School Dean Larry Kramer has \n     noted in more recent scholarship, the national political \n     parties tie members of a state's congressional delegation to \n     state politicians. Taken together, these and other mechanisms \n     ensure that Congress will not simply federalize everything, \n     leaving no area of regulatory discretion to the states.\n       Wechsler's point was mostly descriptive: Congress, he said, \n     would in fact take account of state interests. But we might \n     add a normative dimension: Congress should take its \n     constitutional role seriously in matters of federalism, \n     because judges are going to be highly deferential in such \n     matters if and when federal statutes are constitutionality \n     tested.\n       Accordingly, it would be perfectly appropriate for one or \n     more members of Congress to vote against the individual \n     mandate or health care reform more broadly on the ground that \n     they think such matters should be left to state regulation or \n     to private decision makers. But it would be equally \n     appropriate for Congress to conclude otherwise and thereby \n     join the ranks of the other industrialized countries--\n     including those, like Canada and Germany, with robust \n     commitments to federalism--that have comprehensive national \n     health care systems. Properly understood, the constitutional \n     case law is no obstacle.\n\n\n                               Debt Limit\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will have to \nvote on legislation to increase the statutory limit on the United \nStates debt. The measure that will be before us will increase the limit \nby $290 billion.\n  The debt limit sets a ceiling on the amount of money the U.S. \nTreasury can borrow. If we pass this bill, then the Treasury can \ncontinue to borrow money until about February 11 of next year. If we do \nnot pass this bill, then at least two very bad things will happen:\n  First, the United States would default on the interest payments on \nthis debt for the first time in the history of this country. Second, \nthe Federal Government would be unable to borrow the money it will need \nto pay Social Security benefits that beneficiaries are entitled to \nreceive.\n  The bottom line is we have no choice. We have to approve it. The law \nlimits how much money the Treasury can borrow. One might ask: How did \nwe reach the current limit? The answer is simple and it is, frankly--I \nam trying to give a very fair answer, fair to both sides of the aisle \nand not be political about this but just be fair and explain how we got \nto where we are.\n  The financial crisis and the deep recession the new administration \ninherited has resulted in record borrowing this year. Let me be \nspecific.\n  First, the Bush administration asked for and then used authority to \nspend unprecedented sums of money to help banks, auto companies, \ninsurance firms, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac to weather the financial \ncrisis. The prior administration enacted and used these authorities \nbefore the current administration even took office. That ran up a huge \nnumber, a huge addition to our deficits and debt.\n  Second, the new administration inherited the great recession. The \nrecession has lowered revenues. To compensate for reduced revenues, the \nTreasury has had to borrow more.\n  In addition, the recession has increased the need for Federal \nspending\n\n[[Page S13844]]\n\non things such as unemployment insurance and Medicaid costs for folks \nwho can no longer afford health care. To compensate for these increased \noutlays, Treasury has had to borrow more as well.\n  Finally, to keep the recession from becoming a lot worse than it has, \nthe Obama administration had no choice but to enact a vigorous stimulus \npackage, and the Treasury had to borrow the money to make up for this \nshortfall as well.\n  Without enactment of this stimulus, the economy could have well \ndescended into a depression. We would have been in far worse economic \nshape had we not passed the stimulus legislation.\n  To cover the costs of all these measures--that is those in the Bush \nadministration and those in the Obama administration--the Treasury \nDepartment has had to borrow record amounts of money. Unfortunate as it \nis, we had to do it. Had we not, we would be in much worse shape today.\n  As a result of this unprecedented borrowing, the Treasury is about to \nreach the current limit. It is clear that we have no choice but to \nraise the ceiling on the debt the Treasury can borrow.\n  We have spent the money. We have to raise the debt limit so bills can \nbe paid. If we do not, the United States will default on its interest \npayments for the first time in its 220-year history. We cannot let that \nhappen. We will not be able to pay all the monthly Social Security \nbenefits to which people are entitled. That would be unthinkable.\n  It is true we have to work harder to reduce these deficits--we have \nno choice--also, therefore, to reduce our national debt, certainly as a \npercent of gross domestic product. We have no choice. The point is we \nare beginning to reach a crisis in the accumulation of deficits and \ntherefore debt. That is clear. We must as a country, as a Congress, \nworking with the President, reduce those deficits in national debt. \nHowever, we have to pay our bills. If we do not pay our bills, we \ndefault. That would cause catastrophic consequences.\n  To prevent those catastrophic consequences--that is, other countries \nhaving less confidence in the government, less confidence in the \nability of the United States to pay its debt, less confidence in the \nU.S. dollar--we must increase the Treasury's borrowing limit and, for a \nshort period of time, I think it is appropriate and prudent.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation. There is no way \naround it. It is a necessity. We simply have no choice. We have to pay \nour debts, but in the future, let's work harder to get our deficits \nunder control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am not a member of the Finance Committee \nand do not have the responsibility Senator Baucus does in dealing with \nthese debt ceiling issues. But let me corroborate what he has been \nsaying. Someone once drew the analogy that this is like going out to \ndinner, ordering a good meal, and then refusing to pay the bill at the \nend of it. We have a meal in front of us--tragically a meal that got \ntoo large because, frankly, the previous administration accumulated a \ndebt without ever asking the American people to pay for it, including \nthe war in Iraq and other items that left us in a hole larger than \ncreated by all administrations combined over 225 years of our history--\na remarkable achievement. It is not just the deficit of one \nadministration but all 43 Presidents combined had never accumulated \nwhat one administration did in 8 years.\n  I commend my colleague from Montana. This is no easy task. It is a \npainful vote for anyone to cast, but it is obviously critical. This is \nmore than just a vote in this Chamber. It goes to the very stability of \nthe global economy.\n  We have to meet our obligations. I, for one, am certainly glad to \ncast a vote. I do not think it is a difficult vote. It is a hard vote \nconsidering what is at stake. But the implications of refusing to \nsupport this would be catastrophic to our country.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, 10 minutes short of 12 hours from now, we are going to \ncast our final vote on the national health care proposal. I have some \nclosing remarks on this historic debate.\n  Before I do so, I wish to thank once again our staffs who have been \ninvolved in all of this. I know my dear friend and colleague from Iowa \nwill talk about this more specifically. I have already announced the \nnames of the majority staff who have made a contribution to this \neffort.\n  I think it is fairly clear that tomorrow morning at 7 a.m., when we \ncast our votes on this proposal, this is going to be a very divided \nChamber. Sadly, we are going to end up on a very partisan vote. I \nsuspect something along the lines of 60-40, although obviously we need \nless than 60 votes to pass the bill at this point. But I suspect the \nvote will be something like that. I regret that deeply. It saddens me \nwe have come to that moment. But it is what it is.\n  While last evening I mentioned the members of the staff who are part \nof the majority staff who made such a contribution--and I thank them \nonce again for their efforts--I want to also mention the minority staff \nwho served their Members well and admirably in this effort, certainly \nduring the markup of our bill in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee that Senator Kennedy chaired for so many years, that \nI had the honor of taking over for him during his period of illness, \nand is now chaired by my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  The Senator from Wyoming, Mike Enzi, is the ranking minority member \nof that committee. We ultimately had a divided, partisan vote in that \ncommittee. But as my colleagues have heard me say over and over again \nduring these days and weeks of debate, a good part of our bill, even \nthough it ended up with a partisan vote, included 161 amendments \noffered by the minority in that markup session. More than half of all \nthe amendments considered were offered by the Republicans on that \ncommittee, on my committee at the time that were adopted almost \nunanimously in most cases.\n\n  I wish to mention the minority staff tonight who made that possible. \nThey strengthened our bill and made it a stronger one. Beginning with \nFrank Macchiarola, Chuck Clapton, Katy Barr, Todd Spangler, Hayden \nRhudy, Keith Flanagan, Amy Muhlberg. They work for Senator Enzi.\n  Liz Wroe and Jeff Gonzales work for Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  Jay Khosla, Patty DeLoatsche--I may have mispronounced that last \nname; I apologize if I did--along with Paul Williams of Senator Hatch's \nstaff made a significant contribution to the bill.\n  While, again, there was division on a partisan basis, I thank them \nfor their efforts. They put in long hours as well.\n  On that note, let me say before getting to the substance of my \nremarks, I chair the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \nCommittee. We have been working diligently. In fact, today my good \nfriend and colleague from Alabama, Richard Shelby, and I spent about an \nhour or so together and then about five or six members, Republicans and \nDemocrats on that committee, spent another hour together, as we have \nevery day almost over the last several weeks trying to fashion a bill \non financial services reform that we hope to present to our colleagues \non our return in January and February that will deal with the \ncatastrophe that has occurred economically in our Nation.\n  My hope is as a Chamber--I know my colleagues have heard me say \nthis--I arrived in this Chamber as an employee of the Senate about 50 \nyears ago. I sat on these steps right over here. Lyndon Johnson sat in \nthe Presiding Officer chair. John Kennedy was the President of the \nUnited States. I was a Senate page and listened to the all-night \ndebates in the early 1960s on civil rights and got to witness history. \nI got to watch the Members of this Chamber, some of the historic \nfigures--Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, Everett Dirksen--remarkable \npeople who served here. Barry Goldwater, of course. We served together \nin this Chamber for a period of time when I arrived in the Senate.\n  Thirty-five years ago on January 3 of next month, I arrived as a 30-\nyear-old Member of the House of Representatives, and 6 years later I \narrived here as a freshman Senator 30 years ago. Going back to the \nsixties, I had a lot to do with this Chamber and watched it over the \nyears.\n  The best moments occur when we work together. This has been a bitter \nand difficult battle over the last number of months. But as someone who\n\n[[Page S13845]]\n\ntakes great pride in having been part of this Chamber, as my father was \nbefore me, for more than a quarter of the life of our country, I want \nto see us once again return to the days when we have our partisan \ndebates, which we should because it has built the country.\n  Partisanship--there is nothing wrong with that. It is our ability to \nact civilly with each other. I have been deeply disturbed by some of \nthe debate I have heard, usually from newer Members, usually those who \nhave been here 1, 2, 3 years, who do not have an appreciation of what \nthis Chamber means and how we work together.\n  While we have our differences, the ability to walk away from \ndifferences and forge those relationships over the next day is \ncritically important. It is always the newest Members who fail to \nunderstand how the Senate has worked for more than two centuries. We \nneed to get back to that sense of civility once again.\n  I hope when we return in January to deal with new issues that we will \nget back to that comity that is important. Not the disagreements. The \ndisagreements are important, but the ability to deal with each other \nand forge the kind of proposals that serve all of our constituents and \nserve all of our country is going to be critically important.\n  I wanted to share that thought with my colleagues this evening as \nsomeone who now at the ripe old age of 65 has spent well more than half \nof my life deeply involved in this institution. It saddens me when we \nend up being divided and engaged in the ad hominem arguments that I \nthink ridicule the institution, belittle and demean the contributions \nthat each and every Member wants to make.\n  Even though we have had very strong disagreements, I never once in my \nlife in this Chamber ever questioned the patriotic intentions of any \nMember. We may have strong disagreements on how to best achieve that \nmore perfect Union, but the idea you challenge another's patriotism, \nhonesty, their integrity, does a great disservice to this institution, \nin my view.\n  Again, I regret sometimes the newer Members who fail to understand \nthe importance of maintaining that which our Founders envisioned when \nthey created this institution.\n  This evening I rise to express once and for all and lastly in this \ndebate my strong support for this bill, our Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act of 2009. In a little over a week, this decade, the \nfirst decade of the 21st century will come to a close, and it has been \na turbulent one for our country. We have been tested by the acts of God \nand the acts of evil men in this decade. We have entered two wars and \nhave been through a profound recession, almost a depression. Our \nfinancial markets have failed. Middle-class families have lost their \nfooting. The American dream is fading for far too many of our families \nin this Nation.\n  We wear these 10 years heavily. We have seen deep division in our \ncountry, bitter debates within the walls of this Chamber in which all \nof us are so proud to serve.\n  We do not have the luxury of tackling only those challenges that can \nbe solved easily. But as Thomas Paine wrote:\n\n       The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\n\n\n  Those words come from a pamphlet called ``The American Crisis.'' It \nwas published 233 years ago this very week at another very uncertain \nmoment in American history. That pamphlet begins with these words:\n\n       These are times that try men's souls; the summer soldier \n     and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from \n     the service of his country; but he that stands it now, \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  GEN George Washington, outmanned, outgunned, and sensing that morale \nwas flagging in light of recent setbacks, ordered that this pamphlet \nand these words be read to his deeply troubled and impoverished troops. \nAnd on Christmas Eve, 1776, he gathered his officers at McKonkey's \nFerry to plan the crossing of the Delaware.\n  This body has been in session on Christmas Eve only once since 1963--\nand we will tomorrow--when in the wake of President Kennedy's \nassassination, the Senate met to consider a bill to fund our operations \nin Vietnam. We will be in session tomorrow morning, embroiled again in \ntimes that certainly try men's souls. Like GEN George Washington, we \nhave an opportunity to meet history's gaze, to steel ourselves to the \ndifficult work of making our Union more perfect.\n  The journey we complete tomorrow has been a long and difficult one. \nBut I, for one, would not trade it for anything. We who will have the \nprivilege to cast our votes at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning for health care \nreform will never cast a more important vote in our Senate careers. \nHistory will judge harshly those who have chosen to shrink from this \nmoment, but those of us who stand up to make this country more secure, \nto make our Union more perfect, we will never forget this Christmas \nEve. For this Christmas Eve, we have given an incredible gift. We have \nbeen granted a rare opportunity to deliver an enormous victory for the \nAmerican people for generations to come. We have a chance to alleviate \ntremendous burdens of anxiety and fear and suffering, to make our \ncountry stronger and healthier, to deliver the leadership our \nconstituents have demanded--and rightfully so--and the real and \nmeaningful change they voted for 13 months ago. So in the last week of \na decade in which so much has been asked of the American people, that \nis what history now asks of us in this Chamber.\n  Over the past weeks and months, I have come to this floor to talk \nabout what this bill will do for the citizens of my State and my \ncountry. I have talked about how reform will guarantee every American \nwill have access to quality, affordable care when they need it, from \nthe doctor they choose. I have talked about how reform will reduce our \nnational deficit by finally getting health care costs under control. I \nhave talked, as others have, about what reform will do for small \nbusinesses--giving them access to health insurance exchanges where they \ncan find the best deals for their workers and a tax credit to help them \npay for it. And I have talked, as others have, about how reform will \nhelp our older citizens, our seniors, by strengthening Medicare and \nclosing the so-called doughnut hole for prescription drugs and creating \na new, voluntary program to pay for long-term care. I, along with \nothers, have talked about how reform will help doctors and health care \nproviders spend more time caring for their patients, which they want to \ndo, and less time fighting with insurance company bureaucrats. I and so \nmany others have talked about how reform will finally make insurance \naccessible and affordable for the 350,000 residents of my State and the \n31 million people across our Nation who today don't have it, whether it \nis because they can't afford it or because they have been denied \ncoverage due to a preexisting condition. I have also talked, along with \nmy colleagues, about how reform will finally make insurance a buyer's \nmarket, ending a wide variety of abusive insurance industry practices \nand empowering consumers to make smart decisions.\n  As has been said so many times, this bill is far from perfect, and we \nall know that. It represents not the end but, as my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa has said so many times, the beginning of our work. \nLong after all of us have left this Chamber, however we depart, those \nwho come after us will work on our product. They will make it better, \nthey will make it stronger, they will find our shortcomings in this \nbill, they will add to it, and they will subtract from it. But they can \nnever engage in those efforts if we do not do the job I am confident we \nwill do tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve, and that is to \nrenew the American dream, revive our middle class, and rebuild the \nfoundation upon which future generations will stand.\n  I am very proud of this legislation, with all its shortcomings. I am \nproud to have had a role in bringing it to a vote--an accidental role, \nas all of us know. I wouldn't be standing here talking about it in this \ncontext, other than as a Member of this Chamber, were it not for the \ntragic death of my great friend and colleague from Massachusetts.\n  President Teddy Roosevelt famously said:\n\n       It is not the critic who counts; not the man [or woman] who \n     points out how the strong man stumbles, or whether the doer \n     of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to \n     the man who [or woman] is actually in the arena, whose face \n     is marred by dust\n\n[[Page S13846]]\n\n     and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs; who \n     comes short again and again, because there is no effort \n     without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive \n     to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions; who spends himself [or herself] in a worthy cause; \n     who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high \n     achievement, and who at the worst, if he [or she] fails, at \n     least fails while daring greatly, so that his [or her] place \n     shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither \n     know victory nor defeat.\n\n  So we happy few, the 60 of us who stand in the arena today, who have \nfought and argued and compromised and organized so that we might cast \nthis historic vote at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve, we would not trade this \nopportunity for anything.\n  This last year has proven that progress is not easy. Tomorrow, we \nwill prove that it is not impossible. May the next decade in our \ncountry's history be shaped by that spirit--by the promise of a \nbrighter tomorrow, by the unshakable desire to rise to the challenges \nthat fate places in our path, by the quest to make our great Nation a \nmore perfect one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremainder of the time used on the bill today be for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first of all, before he leaves the \nfloor, I want to thank my dear friend, my colleague, my classmate from \n1975, for all his great leadership on this bill. We were all saddened \nby the fact that our leader, Senator Kennedy, could not be with us over \nthe last year to guide and direct and to see the fulfillment of his \nlifetime dream of health care reform. It fell upon Chris Dodd's \nshoulders to take it through. Madam President, he did it superbly. He \nkept our committee together.\n  Again, I just want to say that Senator Dodd bent over backward, \nextended every consideration to the other side to amend and to be \ninvolved in the shaping of this bill. As my friend said, we adopted 161 \nof their amendments out of 220 or so they offered. Not all of them were \naccepted. Not all of the Democratic amendments were accepted, by the \nway, in the committee. So I thought Senator Dodd went the extra mile to \naccommodate the other side. He did. I am just sorry that not one \nRepublican saw fit to support the bill when it came out of the \ncommittee, but so be it. Because of Senator Dodd's dedication and his \nleadership, we have a great bill here today.\n  I have been watching the debate, and most of the things people are \ntalking about are items that were in the bill Senator Dodd crafted, \nthings that are going to make a big difference in people's lives. I \nwill talk about a few of those in my formal remarks--things such as \ndoing away with preexisting conditions; stopping rescissions, where \nthey cut off your policy when you get sick; keeping kids on their \nparents' policies longer, and all of the things we fought so hard for \nregarding prevention and wellness. All of that is in our bill. It is in \nthe bill Senator Dodd brought forward out of our committee. So I am \nproud to have him not only as a friend but as our great leader on this \nhealth care bill. Tomorrow morning, when we finally pass it, it will be \nin no small part because of the great leadership of Senator Dodd. So I \nwanted to thank him on the floor before he leaves to go home to be with \nhis two great kids and his wonderful wife.\n\n  Appreciate it very much, Chris.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Iowa, and we couldn't have done \nit without him as well. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Madam President, I also want to thank my good friend from Illinois, \nSenator Burris, for allowing me to go first here, in front of him.\n  You know, I was kind of feeling bad for myself because I didn't know \nif I was going to make Christmas Eve with my wife and family for the \nfirst time in 41 years. But I think, because of moving up the vote to 7 \na.m., I might be able to do that.\n  But I just found out that today is Senator Burris's 48th wedding \nanniversary. Congratulations, Senator Burris. So he is here today and \nhis lovely wife is out in Illinois, but he sent her flowers today. I am \nsure she appreciated that, but she would much rather be with Roland on \nthis day. My goodness, 48 years--in this day and age, it is hard to \nfind people married that long. So I congratulate Senator Burris, who is \na great friend of mine personally and a valuable Member of the Senate. \nI think it shows what people are giving up here to make sure they are \nhere to get health reform passed. Senator Burris gave up being with his \nspouse of 48 years. That is quite a sacrifice.\n  Thank you very much, Senator Burris.\n  Madam President, as we approach the final vote, again I wish to thank \nboth Senator Dodd and Senator Baucus for a masterful job of shepherding \nthis legislation through the Finance and HELP Committees.\n  There is no way we would be here today without the great work of our \nmajority leader. To put it in Biblical terms, Leader Reid has the \npatience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon, and the stamina of Sampson. \nSenator Reid is on the verge of achieving what majority leaders going \nback nearly a century have failed to accomplish. Make no mistake about \nit, when this final vote is cast tomorrow morning, Majority Leader Reid \nwill have earned his place in the Senate's history.\n  As we approach the final vote, we have reached a momentous crossroad, \njust as Senators did in 1935 when they passed the Social Security Act \nand in 1965 when they created Medicare. Each of those bills marked a \ngiant step forward for the American people. Each was stridently opposed \nby defenders of the status quo. But in the end, a critical mass of \nSenators rose to the historic occasion. They voted their hopes, not \ntheir fears. As we know now, in retrospect, they passed laws that \ntransformed America in profoundly positive ways.\n  The Senate has now arrived at another one of those rare historic \ncrossroads. This time, we are going to pass comprehensive health \nreform--a great goal that has eluded Congresses and Presidents going \nback to Theodore Roosevelt.\n  I make no bones about my enthusiasm for the reforms in this great \nbill. Is it perfect? Is it what I would write if I could dictate \neverything? No. There have been genuine compromises made, and that is \nthe art of legislating.\n  There are a lot of things not in this bill for which I fought very \nhard, such as a public option or getting a Medicare buy-in at age 55. \nBut I understand the art of compromise. Beyond that, this bill will be \nthe biggest expansion of health coverage since the creation of \nMedicare.\n  It cracks down on abusive practices by health insurance companies, \nabuses that currently leave most Americans one serious illness away \nfrom bankruptcy. It includes an array of provisions, including wellness \nand prevention and public health. Our aim in this bill is to change our \ncurrent sick care system to a true health care system that keeps people \nout of the hospital in the first place.\n  Madam President, I was struck by something that the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator McConnell, said early Monday morning prior to \nthe first critical cloture vote. Addressing Democratic Senators, the \nminority leader turned and faced us and said: It's not too late, it's \nnot too late. All it takes is one, just one. Gesturing to this side of \nthe aisle, he said: One can stop this bill; one can stop it, for every \nsingle one will own it.\n  He was talking about Democrats. I say to the minority leader, we \nDemocrats are proud to own this bill. Just as we are proud of our \nownership of Social Security and Medicare and the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and so many other reforms, progressive reforms, \nthat have made America the great Nation we are today.\n  For the record, let me point out exactly what it is that Democrats \nwill ``own'' by passing this bill. We will own the fact that this bill \nis fully paid for. Indeed, this bill will reduce the Federal debt by \n$132 billion in the first decade and by at least $650 billion in the \nsecond decade. We will own the fact that some 30 million additional \nAmericans will in coming years have access to quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  Let me mention just a few of the things in the bill that Democrats \nwill own next year as soon as President\n\n[[Page S13847]]\n\nObama signs this into law. We will own the fact that next year \ninsurance companies will be required to cover the preexisting \nconditions of children. We will own that. Think about that. There will \nbe a program to extend coverage to uninsured Americans with preexisting \nconditions later.\n  We will own the fact that this bill provides immediate support to \nhealth coverage for early retirees. We will own the fact that this bill \nwill immediately shrink the size of the doughnut hole by raising the \nceiling on the initial coverage period by $500 next year.\n  We will own the immediate guarantee of this bill of 50 percent price \ndiscounts on brand-name drugs and biologics purchased by low- and \nmiddle-income Medicare beneficiaries who are in the doughnut hole. We \nwill own the fact that this bill will provide tax credits to small \nbusinesses to make employees' coverage more affordable. Tax credits of \nup to 35 percent of the cost of premiums will be available to small \nbusinesses next year.\n  In addition, we will own the fact that this bill requires health \ninsurance companies to allow children to stay on their family's \npolicies until age 26. Democrats will own the fact that this bill \nprohibits health insurers from imposing lifetime limits on the benefits \nconsumers believe they are paying for and will tightly restrict the use \nof any annual limits.\n  Let me mention one other extremely important thing that, in the \nminority leader's word, Democrats will own. Our bill, immediately, will \nstop insurers from the devastating practice of rescinding or cancelling \nhealth insurance coverage when a policyholder is seriously ill.\n  All of those things I mention will happen right away, Madam \nPresident, as soon as the bill is signed into law. Taken together, this \nis a breathtaking catalog of reforms that will benefit the American \npeople immediately. So, we Democrats are very proud, I say to the \nminority leader, to own these reforms.\n  We had hoped that our Republican colleagues would also be proud to \nown them. But let's remember William F. Buckley's conservative model. \nHe is sort of the father of the conservative movement in America. He \nsaid the role of conservatives is ``to stand athwart history yelling \n`stop'.'' That is exactly what our Republican colleagues have been \ndoing by filibustering and trying to kill health care. They are \n``athwart history, yelling 'stop'.'' My friends on the Republican side \nwill be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of reform, and the \nwrong side of progress.\n  I have been saying this bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, is like a starter home. It is not the mansion of our dreams. \nIt doesn't have every bell and whistle we would all like, but it has a \nsolid foundation giving every American access to quality, affordable \ncoverage. It has an excellent protective roof which will shelter \nAmericans from the worst abuses of the health insurance companies, and \nthis starter home has plenty of room for additions and improvements.\n  We Democratic Senators are proud to own this starter home. We are \nproud of the fact that this starter home is fully paid for. It is a \nstarter home without a mortgage.\n  Indeed, as I said earlier, this bill will reduce the Federal deficit \nby $132 billion in the first decade and by at least $650 billion in the \nsecond decade. So, Madam President, even at this late date before the \nvote tomorrow morning, I say to our Republican colleagues, Democrats \nare proud to own this legislation and this starter home. We are proud \nto own the many reforms and benefits in this bill and we would be very \npleased to share ownership with as many of our Republican colleagues \nwho care to join us.\n  With all due respect to William F. Buckley, it is not written in \nstone that conservatives have to say no to history. I urge every \nSenator to say yes.\n  This bill has many authors. But in a very real sense this is Senator \nTed Kennedy's bill. Our late beloved colleague would be so proud to see \nthe Senate on the cusp of passing landmark health care reform. For \ndecades, from his first days in the Senate, this was his highest \npriority and fondest win. As his friends on both sides of the aisle \nknow, his great dream was of an America where quality affordable care \nis a right not a privilege for every citizen.\n  Today, we are on the verge of making that dream a reality. So often \nSenator Kennedy talked about the moral imperative of health reform. Too \noften in the debates of recent weeks we have lost sense of this moral \nimperative. We have heard speeches. We have had charts, back and forth \nand back and forth on some of the small stuff; who wins, who loses, \nbecause of this or that minor provision in the bill.\n  Today, on the eve of this historic vote, we should refocus on the big \nstuff, the moral imperative that drove Senator Kennedy. With this bill \nwe will get rid of the shameful dividing line that has excluded \nmillions of Americans for too long. For too long, tens of millions of \nAmericans have been on the wrong side of that divide, without health \ninsurance, without regular medical care for their children, just one \nserious illness away from bankruptcy. With this landmark legislation we \nerase that shameful divide within our American family. With this bill \nwe say for every American, for every member of our American family, \naccess to quality affordable care will be a right, not a privilege. It \nis a monumental achievement.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to vote yes on this bill.\n  Now, Madam President, a lot has been said about those of us who have \nbeen the leadership on this bill: Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, Senator \nDodd, myself, and so many others. It is important to etch in history in \nour Congressional Record the names of those individuals on our staffs, \nwho have done so much to get us to this point. I said earlier there is \nan old saying that Senators are a constitutional impediment to the \nsmooth functioning of staff. We kind of laugh at that, but we know \nthere is great truth to that. Were it not for the staff who spent so \nmany hours and so much time away from their families that we would not \nbe here.\n  I was talking with Senator Reid's office. Kate Leone did a \nmagnificent job. Carolyn Gluck, Jacqueline Lampert, Bruce King, David \nKrone, Rodell Molineaux, and Randy DeValk.\n  Senator Dodd's staff: Jim Fenton, Tamar Magarik Haro, Monica Feit, \nBrian DeAngelis.\n  Senator Baucus's staff: Liz Fowler, Bill Dauster, Russ Sullivan, John \nSullivan, Scott Mulhauser, Kelly Whitener, Cathy Koch, Yvette Fontenot, \nDavid Schwartz, Neleen Eisinger, Chris Dawe.\n  On our HELP committee: Michael Myers, our great staff director, who \nfor more than a decade has led this staff and for almost 20 years has \nworked for Senator Kennedy. We are all sorry that Senator Kennedy could \nnot be here for this. I can say honestly that Mike Myers carries on the \ntorch as his staff director. He did a magnificent job of getting us \nthrough this. And David Bowen--David Bowen, if there is one person who \nknows more about what is in this bill than anyone else, it is David \nBowen. I have never asked him about anything in this bill that he \ndidn't know where it was and what it does. He has been at every \nmeeting, I don't care how early in the morning, how late at night. I \nknow he has been apart from his family and his children. I wish David \nthe best in terms of being with his family tomorrow and over Christmas. \nDavid Bowen has done such a magnificent job of guiding and directing \nthis bill and making sure it was all put together.\n  Connie Garner, who worked so hard, so hard; Portia Wu, John \nMcDonough, Topher Spiro, Stacey Sachs, Tom Kraus, Terri Roney, Craig \nMartinez, Taryn Morrissey, Andrea Harris, Sara Selgrade, Dan Stevens, \nCaroline Fichtenberg, Lory Yudin, Evan Griffis.\n  Now I want to mention one other person who has been on my staff but \nnow is on the HELP Committee staff, Jenelle Krishnamoorthy. I have for \nmany years been advocating that we have to change our focus in America \nfrom a sick care society to a health care society. I mentioned that \nearlier. This bill contains more for wellness and prevention and public \nhealth than any bill ever passed by Congress--ever passed--and it is \nnot talked about much, you don't hear too much debate about it. But it \nis significant that we are going to change this paradigm. We are going \nto start putting more up front, keeping people healthy in the first \nplace.\n  One person who has done more than anyone else to make this happen is\n\n[[Page S13848]]\n\nJenelle Krishnamoorthy. I want to thank her for just focusing laser-\nlike the last couple of years or so on this and making sure it became a \nbig part of our health care reform bill.\n  On my personal staff, Jim Whitmire, Beth Stein, Jenny Wing, Rosemary \nGutierrez, and Lee Perselay. Let me mention Lee. Lee does all my work \non disability issues. As many people know, it is my name on the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. Nineteen years ago we passed that. Lee \nPerselay does all my work on the disability issue.\n  There is another part of the bill not too many talk about, but it is \nso profoundly important to people with disabilities. In this bill there \nis a provision that will have the Federal Government give a 6 percent \nincrease in the amount of money that the Federal Government gives to a \nState for Medicaid, 6 percent increase for a State that will enact \nlegislation to put in place the provisions of the Olmstead decision by \nthe Supreme Court over 10 years ago; that is, that every person with a \ndisability has a right to a least restrictive environment. That means \nliving in their own communities and their own homes with personal \nassistant services, support so they can live at home rather than going \nto a nursing home.\n  This has been a dream of the disability community since we passed the \nAmericans With Disability Act in 1990. We have never been able to get \nit done. Now we have it in this bill. It is not talked about much, \ndidn't hear much about it. But this will have more of a profound effect \non people with disabilities than any other single thing in this bill or \nanything that we have done, literally, since 1990. Now people with \ndisabilities can live at home and live in their own communities and the \nState will get money from the Federal Government to enable them to do \nthat. Lee Perselay.\n  Lee Perselay; thank you very much, Lee.\n  Kate Cyrul of my staff, Dan Goldberg, and the Senate legislative \ncounsel. A special thanks to Bill Baird, along with Stacy Kern-Scheerer \nand Ruth Ernst, who was present throughout the entire HELP Committee, \nand they have gone above and beyond.\n  To all the floor staff here, too, we forget about all they have \ndone--Mike Spahn and Anne Wall and Stacy Rich and Tim Mitchell and \nTricia Engle and Lula Davis, wonderful floor staff working with us to \nget us to this point, where we have a final vote on this tomorrow \nmorning.\n  I wished to particularly mention these individuals. In many ways, \nthey are the unsung heroes and heroines of what we have done. They can \nbe content in knowing, as they go through life, they did a big thing \nhere. They did something so important to help transform our society. I, \npersonally, thank each and every one of them and wish them the best of \nthe holiday season, Christmas, New Year. We will come back next year, \nand we will start implementing this bill. As the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, we will start looking at building those additions and those \nexpansions.\n  I yield the floor and thank my friend from Illinois for letting me \ngo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, the Senate has long been a forum for great \ndebate.\n  This institution is equipped to handle the most difficult questions \nour Nation faces.\n  Since we took up the issue of health care reform, the debate has been \nfierce, and our differences of opinion have played out in dramatic \nfashion on the national stage.\n  Over the last several months, I have said time and again that this \nhealth reform bill must accomplish the three distinct goals of a public \noption in order to win my support:\n  It must create real competition in the health care system.\n  It must provide significant cost savings to the American people.\n  And it must restore accountability to the insurance industry.\n  For months I have told my colleagues that I would not be able to \nsupport a final bill that fails to meet these three goals.\n  I believe they are the keys to comprehensive health reform in \nAmerica, and without them, our legislation would be ineffective and \nincomplete.\n  I expressed my concerns about the compromise bill, and I asked tough \nquestions.\n  I have reviewed the CBO score and the final legislative language as \nsoon as it became available.\n  I believe the way forward is clear.\n  This bill is not perfect. It does not include everything I had hoped \nfor.\n  But I am convinced that it can meet the three goals of a public \noption.\n  I believe it represents a monumental step forward--a strong \nfoundation we can improve upon in the months and years to come.\n  This is not the end of health care reform in America--it is the \nbeginning.\n  That is why we need to take the next step in this process. Although \nthis is not the bill I had hoped I might be voting on, I am confident \nenough to pass this legislation on to the next step.\n  Let us send the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to a \nconference committee, where it will be merged with the House bill.\n  There, I have every hope that the conferees will have the opportunity \nto strengthen some of these provisions and make this legislation \nbetter.\n  We must not let the perfect stand in the way of the good. While it is \nnot everything I had hoped it would be, it is far more than we have \nnow.\n  And while this bill will not satisfy many of us, it would be a \nmistake to overlook all the good it will do for tens of millions of \nAmericans.\n  So let me explain exactly why I am convinced that this bill will \nsatisfy the three goals of a public option:\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the \nexchanges that will be created under this legislation will dramatically \nenhance competition in the insurance market.\n  This will drive premiums down, allowing consumers to shop around for \nthe plan that is best for them, their family, or their small business.\n  CBO projections show that this would force providers to compete for \nthe first time in many years, reducing costs and bringing everyone's \npremiums under control.\n  As a result, many more people would be able to get better coverage \nfor less money.\n  This bill will enhance the choices that are available for individuals \nand small businesses.\n  Everyone will have the choice to keep their current insurance \ncoverage if they are happy with it, but if they are not, they will have \nreal options for the first time in many years.\n  This bill will give consumers the tools they need to hold insurance \ncompanies accountable.\n  It includes strong consumer protections--many of which take effect \nimmediately--and it contains significant insurance reforms designed to \nput ordinary folks back in the driver's seat.\n  This bill will eliminate annual and lifetime caps on coverage, \nprohibit companies from dropping patients who get sick, and prevent \ndiscrimination against people who have preexisting conditions.\n  It will also require insurance providers to cover essential health \nbenefits and recommended preventive care, so more people can get the \ntreatment they need.\n  Based on these provisions, it is quite clear that this measure will \nprovide immediate and lasting improvements in the health care system \nfor everyone in this country.\n  It will extend quality coverage to 31 million Americans who are \ncurrently uninsured, and increase access to preventive care.\n  This will reduce emergency room visits, allow more people to treat \npreventable and chronic diseases, and help to bring health care costs \nunder control.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects that this \nlegislation will cut the deficit by more than $130 billion in just the \nfirst decade, and will save nearly $1 trillion over the next several \ndecades.\n  That is why I am confident that this bill will meet the three goals \nof a public option: competition, cost savings, and accountability.\n  It may not be the legislation I would have written at the beginning \nof this process, but after nearly a century of debate about health care \nreform, under\n\n[[Page S13849]]\n\nthe leadership of 11 Presidents and countless Members of Congress, this \nlegislation represents a strong consensus.\n  So it is time to take the next step in this process--to send this \nbill to conference and keep building upon this foundation.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but it contains a number of fundamentally \ngood components.\n  Most importantly, it will ensure that 94 percent of Americans can get \nthe health coverage they need.\n  After decades of inaction, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct is a monumental step in the right direction.\n  There were many competing ideas that gave rise to this bill.\n  There were many voices, inside this Chamber and outside of it, \nshouting to be heard on these issues.\n  There were concessions and compromises.\n  But, out of a century of dissent--out of decades of discussion and \ndebate--we have arrived at a basis for comprehensive reform.\n  It is time to put aside our differences and move forward as one \nCongress, and one Nation.\n  There is much work left to do on this and a host of other issues. But \nin the messy process of debate and compromise, along the path that has \nled us to this point, this body has reaffirmed the enduring truth of \nthe motto inscribed in this Chamber, just above the Vice President's \nchair: ``E pluribus unum.'' It is there, Madam President, right over \nyour head. It means ``Out of many, one.''\n  For our entire history, it has been the creed that binds us to one \nanother and to our common identity as Americans. It is the principle \nthat drives us to assemble in this august Chamber to debate the \ntoughest issues we will ever face.\n  Although we come from every section of this country, from many \nStates, we are one country, and together, we can create a health care \nsystem that will be worthy of the people we represent.\n  It is time to make good on the promise of the last century and move \nforward with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  Let's take the next step, and send this bill to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n            medicare geographic inequities in reimbursement\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the legislation \npending before the Senate today, which will ensure that 31 million \nAmericans will finally have access to affordable, quality health \ncoverage, which will crack down on outrageous abuses by the insurance \nindustry, and which will, at long last, put prevention and wellness at \nthe heart of our health care system. I rise today, however, to signal \nthat there is an area of this legislation that remains of concern and \nthat I will be working to fix as we head to conference; namely, \nprovisions to rectify the geographic inequities in the low Medicare \nreimbursement rates.\n  Across the country, Americans pay equal premiums to support Medicare. \nYet there is a substantial geographic disparity in physician \nreimbursement levels in the Medicare Part B Program. The degree of this \ndisparity is unjustified and inherently unfair--and it is having an \nincreasingly negative impact on the number of providers that are \naccepting Medicare and magnifying the workforce shortage problem--\nespecially in rural areas. The unfairness in this disparity in \nreimbursement rates is compounded by the fact that the States with the \nlowest reimbursement rates are often those that deliver the highest \nquality of care. The system must change and reward the quality of \nservice delivered instead of the volume of care served.\n  I see that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, is here on the \nfloor. He and I have often discussed this issue, as his State is also \none that provides outstanding care and yet suffers from unduly low \nreimbursement rates. I wonder if my distinguished colleague shares my \nview that this is something we must continue to work on before this \nbill is finalized?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my distinguished colleague for raising this \nissue, which has also been a concern of mine. I agree with him that my \nState consistently lags behind other States on Medicare reimbursement \nand per capita spending. I strongly believe that a fundamental way to \nachieve the goal of more efficiency in Medicare is to realign the \nMedicare payment system to reward health care providers for the quality \nof care they deliver, not simply the quantity of services they provide. \nMedicare is spending over one-third more for each Medicare beneficiary \nin some States compared to Oregon, to Iowa, or to the home State of my \ngood friends from Minnesota, Senators Klobuchar and Franken, who are \nalso here on the floor with us today.\n  The simple fact is, this antiquated payment formula penalizes rural \nproviders and penalizes medical efficiency, and I know in Oregon it has \nforced many physicians to stop accepting Medicare patients or limit the \nnumber of Medicare patients they serve, and that is why I feel so \nstrongly that we must fix it once and for all in the final health \nreform bill. I wonder if the Senators from Minnesota have had a similar \nexperience in their state.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I want to thank you, Senator Merkley and Senator \nHarkin, for your work on is issue. I have observed the same problems \nwith Medicare reimbursement in my home State. We represent States and \nregions that have demonstrated true leadership in lowering costs to \nMedicare while increasing the quality of care patients receive. The \nhigh-efficiency areas we represent are known for utilizing integrated \nhealth delivery systems and innovative quality measures to provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with better value. Research shows that these \nefficient delivery practices can save the Medicare Program upwards of \n$100 billion a year while also providing beneficiaries better access to \nthe care they need. Unfortunately, the current Medicare payment \nstructure penalizes those who provide efficient care while rewarding \nthose who order unnecessary tests and services. It is critical that \nthis is addressed in conference, and it will be-a-priority as we move \nforward through this process.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Senator Harkin, for your leadership, and also \nthanks to my other colleagues for working on this issue. I agree with \nall that has been said, and I would like to reiterate that our States \nhave some of the best health care in the country. And it just doesn't \nmake sense that under the current Medicare reimbursement system, the \ngood care in our States gets punished and the less effective, more \nexpensive care gets rewarded. The result is that we are not providing \nhealth care in this country; we are providing sick care. We need \nincentives for providers for high-value care, and the best way to do \nthis is through Medicare payment reform.\n  These geographic disparities in Medicare payments are unfair, and \nthey are not good for patient care. We are forcing excellent providers \nout of business because reimbursement rates are low and they just can't \nmake ends meet. This is counterproductive to the goal that I know we \nall share--to increase access to high-quality health care for all \nAmericans. It is a top priority for me that in conference we make some \nchanges so high quality care that is provided at a reasonable cost will \nno longer be punished. Instead, we need to make sure that the bill \nrewards providers for being effective partners in their patients' care. \nI appreciate the opportunity to share these concerns and discuss these \nissues with my colleagues.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I couldn't agree with my colleagues more. It is long past \ntime to take action to fix this system. I appreciate the commitment of \nthe Senator from Oregon and the Senators from Minnesota to fixing this \nproblem once and for all.\n\n\n                      definition of full time work\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friends, the \nSenator from Iowa and Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, and the Senator from Montana and Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, in a conversation about how ``full time'' is defined \nin the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and clarify any \nmisunderstandings about how the legislation resolves the potential for \nexclusion of certain work group such as flight crews and rail workers \ndue to the definition of ``full time'' work and the unique way their \nwork hours are calculated.\n  Is it the Senators' understanding that the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act resolves a potential\n\n[[Page S13850]]\n\nproblem of excluding from employer incentives to provide coverage for \nemployees who work in professions that use unique calculations for \nhours worked, such as flight crews and rail workers? And that it does \nthis by indicating that the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Labor, shall prescribe such regulations, rules, and \nguidance as may be necessary to determine the hours of service of an \nemployee, including rules for employees who are not compensated on an \nhourly basis?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the Senator is correct. The Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act is designed to expand access to high quality and \naffordable health coverage for all workers. Because of the nature of \nwork, some industries uniquely calculate total daily and monthly \nworking time to determine full-time schedules. That is why this \nlegislation gives the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \nLabor discretion to establish rules and regulations for the hours of \nservice for workers outside of standard hours. This provision is meant \nto be construed broadly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would concur with my friend, the Senator of Iowa, in \nhis understanding of the act. This provision is meant to be construed \nbroadly, and to expand access to high quality and affordable health \ncoverage for all workers.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Of particular concern to me are groups such as pilots \nand flight attendants, cabin crews who, under ``full time'' contracts, \n``work'' on average only 70 hours per month due to the unique way their \nhours are calculated. For obvious safety reasons, a pilot is limited, \nthrough Federal regulations, to flying 100 hours per month, or 1,200 \nhours annually, even though he or she contributes many more hours of \nservice outside of the time spent flying planes. This unusual work \nschedule, however, raises the potential that a pilot might not be \nconsidered a full-time employee for purposes of this legislation under \na rule that defined full time status as simply ``working'' upwards of \n30 or 40 hours per week. The same is true of other flight-crew \nemployees.\n  Additionally, railroad hours-of-service employees, who work by the \nmile or by the day, could also find it difficult to meet the definition \nof full-time employee under a strict ``hours worked'' standard. Many \ntrain and engine service railroad employees are paid by the mile and or \nby the day or paid for time available to work, and are not paid by the \nhour. Although these workers are undoubtedly full-time employees within \ntheir profession, the annual or weekly hours they are calculated to \nwork might not satisfy a narrow minimum hour component that did not \ntake into account a more flexible hours of service concept for certain \ntypes of jobs.\n  Currently all flight and cabin crew members employed by Part 121 \ncommercial air carriers and train and engine service railroad employees \npaid by the mile or by the day are full-time employees and receive the \nsame benefits afforded other full-time workers. Is it the Senators' \nunderstanding that this bill is intended to allow these working groups \nto be encompassed in the definition of ``full-time employee'' for \npurposes of the employer incentives to provide quality health care \ncoverage?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, that is my understanding, that the Secretaries of \nHealth and Human Services and Labor will establish standards to govern \nworkers in these industries so they are fully entitled to the \nprotections under this bill. It is not the intent of Congress to \nexclude or prevent workers with unique work schedules from the benefits \nunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or from incentives \nfor employers to provide these workers with quality healthcare \ncoverage.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Again, I am pleased to concur with the Senator from Iowa \nin his understanding. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \nLabor will establish standards to govern workers in these industries so \nthey are fully entitled to the protections under this bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senators from \nIowa and Montana for their time and clarification on this issue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act offers \ncommunity health workers some overdue recognition, and more \nimportantly, authorizes grants to help support and expand their work.\n  Community health workers are from the communities they serve. From \nrural small towns to the urban inner city, community health workers \nreach out to underserved communities in ways that the current health \ncare system cannot, providing culturally and linguistically appropriate \nhealth information in a more familiar and welcoming manner. Their work \nhelps to bridge the healthcare gap and diminish disparities.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than in the community-based doula \nprogram. Community-based doulas support pregnant women during the \nmonths of pregnancy, birth, and the immediate post-partum period. They \nprovide parent education, logistical and emotional support. They help \nnew mothers make better lifestyle choices and deliver healthier babies. \nWhat makes these programs work is the culturally sensitive mentoring \nwithin the community.\n  In Chicago, the community-doula model has made a big difference in \nthe lives of these young moms and their babies. The Chicago Health \nConnection came up with this model. They trained mentors from the \ncommunity to work with at-risk moms, many of whom didn't know where \nelse to turn. These mentors spend time in the neighborhood, finding and \nbefriending pregnant women who need help.\n  With the guidance of the doula, the Chicago Health Connection found \nthat more young mothers were going to their prenatal care appointments, \nmaking better lifestyle choices, and--not surprisingly--delivering \nhealthier babies. The doulas stay with the moms through the early \nmonths, encouraging breastfeeding, cuddling, and interactive play.\n  Bina Holland is a community-based doula at the Easter Seals \nChildren's Development Center in Rockford, IL. Bina has had a powerful \nimpact on one of her clients--a 14 year old girl who was 5 months \npregnant and severely underweight. Bina taught her about healthy \nnutrition habits to strengthen her body to carry a baby. Bina also \nencouraged the young woman to visit her doctor regularly and to openly \ntalk with the doctor about the health status of the baby.\n  The girl delivered her baby early at 2.5 lbs, and Bina was there to \nexplain the health benefits of breastfeeding. The young mom agreed to \nnurse her child, and each week the mother monitored the baby's growth. \nThe child was nursed to health, and the mother successfully graduated \nfrom the doula program. Thanks to Bina.\n  Community-based doulas are a powerful resource for maternal and child \nhealth, and the model is effective. In communities that have employed \nit, outcomes include better prenatal care, higher birth weight, higher \nbreastfeeding rates, better parenting skills, fewer preterm births and \nc-section deliveries, and delays in subsequent pregnancy for teenages.\n  With Chicago Health Connection's success, they took on the challenge \nof working with other communities to build their own community-based \ndoula program. Today, they have transformed into Health Connect One, a \ntraining organization for communities nationwide interested in starting \ntheir own community based doula programs. The need is everywhere, and \nthese women are working hard to make these important services available \neverywhere for all moms.\n  I am encouraged by the language in Section 5313 of the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, Grants to Promote the Community \nHealth Workforce and want to ensure that the definition of community \nhealth worker includes community-based doulas. The Federal Government \ncurrently funds community-based doula programs through the Maternal and \nChild Health Bureau's Special Projects of Regional and National \nSignificance. Expanding the definition of community health workers in \nthe reform bill will give these evidence-based programs greater support \nto meet the needs of families in underserved communities.\n  Community-based doula programs are a proven example of the health \noutcomes that education, prevention and health literacy can bring. With \ngrants to promote the community health\n\n[[Page S13851]]\n\nworkforce, doulas will continue to promote positive health behaviors in \npregnant women and improve the lives of families nationwide.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for the comprehensive health \nreform bill being considered in the U.S. Senate, but I will also work \nto improve its flaws. There is much that is good about this \nlegislation. It will, over the course of 10 years, help ensure that \nnearly every American has access to good and affordable health \ninsurance. It will put Medicaid and Medicare spending on a more \nsustainable and stable path. It will increase access to home and \ncommunity-based long term care services, increase our medical \nworkforce, and end some of the worst abuses by the private insurance. \nBut there are serious deficiencies--like the failure to establish a \npublic health insurance option--that we know of, and there will be \nundoubtedly be some gaps in the bill that we will discover during \nimplementation. The commitment that is made with this legislation is \nongoing, and will require diligent oversight and improvements in the \nyears to come.\n  I am pleased that many of the priorities I laid out at the start of \nthis process have been addressed in this bill. The bill includes \nprovisions I fought for that help make sure Wisconsin is treated \nfairly. Those provisions include fixes to a flawed Medicare formula \nthat denies our state fair reimbursement, financial incentives for the \nkind of low-cost, high-value care practiced in Wisconsin, and hundreds \nof millions of dollars in additional Medicaid assistance for Wisconsin \nto account for the State's leadership in expanding coverage to its \ncitizens. But I also recognize that this bill does not do as much as I \nwould like to reform our current health care system, and I will work to \ntry to make sure the final version fixes these flaws.\n  I receive countless letters and emails and phone calls from my \nconstituents on health care reform. Some of the most heartbreaking \nletters I receive are from people who are sick or caring for a sick \nloved one and do not have health insurance. Some of these people are \nrecently laid off due to the recession, and have lost their health \ninsurance. Some people had health insurance, but were dropped from \ntheir coverage because they became sick and actually needed health \ncare. And some people were denied health insurance altogether, either \nbecause it was priced out of their reach, or because they had a \npreexisting condition. In far too many cases, these people have been \nforced to declare bankruptcy because of their medical bills. Two thirds \nof all personal bankruptcy cases in the United States are due to \nmedical debt, and over 80 percent of those individuals had health \ninsurance. And in the most egregious cases, sick children in Wisconsin \nand around the country have reached lifetime limits on care that are \nset by an insurance bureaucrat, and are denied coverage for further \nmedical treatment.\n  Because of this bill, lifetime and annual limits on coverage will be \nprohibited. Premiums cannot increase due to medical needs or illness. \nInsurers cannot charge women more than men for the same insurance \npolicy. Restricting or denying coverage based on preexisting conditions \nis prohibited for all Americans, beginning with children effective 6 \nmonths after final passage of this bill. A recent study found that 36 \npercent of currently uninsured adults were unable to get health \ninsurance because of a preexisting condition. Preexisting conditions \ncan be anything from serious, chronic diseases like diabetes or cancer \nto medical episodes like acne or even pregnancy. In nine States, being \na victim of domestic violence can be a preexisting condition. This bill \nwill end these consumer abuses.\n  People will be guaranteed the ability to renew their health insurance \nyear after year. If a claim is denied, policy holders have a guaranteed \nright to appeal. And group insurers are required to spend at least 85 \npercent of every premium dollar on actual health care; if they are \nfound to be spending less, they are required to refund the difference \nto the customer. This policy, along with others, will require an \nunprecedented level of transparency in the sale of health insurance \npolicies.\n  One of the strongest points of this bill for me, and perhaps one of \nthe most underappreciated, is the commitment made to realign Medicare \nspending to reward our doctors and hospitals for the quality of care \nthey provide to their patients, rather than the quantity of care. \nMoving to a value-based system is one of the single most effective ways \nto reduce health care spending and improve the quality of care. \nWisconsin is a national leader in value-based delivery of health care. \nIf every health care provider operated like those in Wisconsin, over \n$100 billion a year in taxpayer dollars could be saved. Just last year, \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly 30 percent of \nMedicare spending could be avoided by integrating and coordinating \ncare, in the manner of high-value providers.\n  As a result of this bill, Medicare reimbursement for certain health \ncare providers will be based, in part, on the quality of care they \ndeliver to their patients. Health providers will now have the \nopportunity to voluntarily join together as Accountable Care \nOrganizations to coordinate the care they deliver to their patients, \nand to share in the savings they generate for Medicare. They will be \ngiven numerous opportunities and incentives to change the way they \ndeliver health care, and will, for the first time, be penalized for \ndelivering low-quality care. For example, if a hospital demonstrates \nhigh rates of readmissions or hospital acquired infections, they will \nreceive less reimbursement from Medicare. Not only will patients \nreceive smarter care from their physicians, these policies will help \nensure that taxpayer dollars are going to pay for the value of care \nMedicare patients receive, as opposed to the volume of care.\n  In addition to these positive changes to the way Medicare pays for \nhealth care, there is language to finally address the historic inequity \nin Medicare reimbursement that Wisconsin and other rural States have \nfaced. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Chuck Grassley in the Senate \nFinance Committee, this bill includes language that will increase \nMedicare reimbursement for Wisconsin physicians and directs the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to analyze and adjust the \ncurrent formula to ensure more accurate payments for rural providers in \nthe future. Fixing the flawed Medicare formula so that Wisconsin \nreceives its fair share of Medicare reimbursements has long been a \npriority of mine.\n  I am pleased that this bill more fairly reimburses Wisconsin for the \nleadership my state has demonstrated in extending coverage to low-\nincome residents through BadgerCare, our State Medicaid program. I was \nconcerned that the Senate Finance Committee bill would have denied \nWisconsin much-deserved Medicaid dollars, and I worked hard to try to \nensure the bill before the Senate fixed this problem. As a result, \nrelative to the bill that the Senate Finance Committee reported, this \nbill will bring hundreds of millions more in Medicaid assistance back \nto Wisconsin. I appreciate the willingness of my fellow Wisconsin \nSenator, Herb Kohl, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Max \nBaucus, and Senator Reid in working with me to ensure that Wisconsin's \ninvestment is acknowledged in this legislation.\n  I am also pleased by the attention to long-term care reform in this \nbill. Modern medicine has turned fatal diseases into chronic diseases, \nand enabled individuals to live much longer. These are tremendous \naccomplishments. But the reality is that these individuals need even \nmore assistance because of medical advancements--from their families, \ncommunities, and government.\n  Long-term care reform is inextricably linked to overall health \nreform, and one cannot truly succeed without the other. While this bill \ndoes not include a comprehensive strategy to reform our long-term care \nsystem as I had hoped, it does include a number of critical building \nblocks to assist reform efforts in the future. One of these critical \npieces is the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or \nCLASS Act. The CLASS Act would create an optional insurance program to \nhelp pay for home care and other assistance for adults who become \ndisabled. Those choosing to participate would pay monthly premiums into \nan insurance trust, and after 5 years, could access a cash benefit if \nthey become disabled and need assistance.\n  Another critical component of this bill is the attention paid to \nexpanding\n\n[[Page S13852]]\n\nhome and community-based care options. Again, Wisconsin has been a \nnational leader in increasing access to home and community-based care, \nbeginning with the Community Options Program almost 30 years ago. As a \nState Senator, I worked to help expand Wisconsin's Community Options \nProgram, known as COP, which provided flexible, consumer-oriented and \nconsumer-directed long-term care services in community-based settings, \nenabling thousands of people needing long-term care to remain in their \nown homes rather than going to a nursing home. Over time, the COP \nprogram turned into Wisconsin's FamilyCare program, which is our newest \nState entitlement program for low-income and disabled adults to receive \nnecessary care, supports, and services in their homes and communities.\n  The progressive vision that is the driving force behind Family Care \nis also the driving force behind the long-term care provisions in this \nbill. This bill will establish the Community First Choice Option, which \ngives States the option to create a new Medicaid benefit through which \nStates could offer community-based attendant services and supports to \nMedicaid beneficiaries with disabilities who would otherwise require \nthe level of care offered in a hospital, nursing facility, or \nintermediate care facility.\n  This bill also removes barriers to expanding home and community-based \nservices; protects recipients of home and community-based services from \nspousal impoverishment; and increases appropriations by $40 million to \nhelp fund Aging and Disability Resource Centers.\n  And finally, as a result of Senator Reid's amendment, the bill \nprovides new financial incentives for States to shift Medicaid \nbeneficiaries out of nursing homes and into home and community-based \nservices.\n  Over 10 million Americans are currently in need of long-term care, \nand that number is expected to rise to 15 million in the next 10 years. \nThese individuals struggle to remain independent with limited \nassistance. Policies like those included in this bill, which increase \noptions for home and community-based care so that nursing homes are not \nthe only choice, are smart changes that will benefit consumers of long-\nterm care and save taxpayers money.\n  One of my most important priorities for the bill was that it be \nfiscally responsible. Based on the most current projections, the \nCongressional Budget Office expects this legislation to reduce the \ndeficit by $132 billion by 2019 and roughly $1 trillion by 2029. While \nthe bill does not go as far as I would like to rein in health care \nspending, the $871 billion price tag on the bill is fully offset and \nwill not add a penny to the deficit.\n  Deficit reduction is achieved through a number of policies, three of \nwhich are included in legislation I introduced to bring down the \ndeficit, the Control Spending Now Act. These policies, which make \nprescription drugs more affordable and require wealthy individuals to \npay their fair share of Medicare premiums, generate $24.6 billion in \nsavings.\n  For all the positive aspects of this bill, I am deeply disappointed \nby the lack of a public option. I have been fighting all year for a \nstrong public option to compete with the insurance industry and bring \nhealth care costs down. I continued that fight during recent \nnegotiations, and I refused to sign onto a deal to drop the public \noption from the Senate bill.\n  Removing the public option from the Senate bill is the wrong move. I \nam concerned that without a public option, there will be no true \ncompetition for the insurance industry. We have included mechanisms to \nprotect against egregious year-to-year increases in private insurance \npremiums from this point on, but we have no mechanism to force \ninsurance companies to decrease premiums as they are set today. A \nstrong public health insurance option would provide a powerful \nincentive for less responsible insurers to re-evaluate their own cost-\nsharing and benefit plans to ensure they are an attractive option for \nconsumers.\n  The public option would give consumers a strong voice in the \nmarketplace. If the private market was not meeting their needs, they \nwould have an alternative. Competition is how we can reduce our health \ncare costs, but there is no real competition in the private market. \nPrivate insurers compete to generate the most profit, and the best \nreturn on investment for their shareholders. There is at most a \nsecondary motivation to compete to give the best value to consumers. A \npublic option serves as an outside factor to force private insurers to \nconsider more than just shareholder interests.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the public option in \nthe bill that was brought to the floor could save up to $25 billion. \nThe CBO's analysis of Senator Reid's amendment, which strikes the \npublic option and replaces it with multi-state plans, says the \nfollowing about the new policy:\n\n       Whether insurers would be interested in offering such plans \n     is unclear, and establishing a nationwide plan comprising \n     only of nonprofit insurers might be particularly difficult. \n     Even if such plans were arranged, the insurers offering them \n     would probably have participated in the insurance exchanges \n     anyway, so the inclusion of this provision did not have a \n     significant effect on the estimates of federal costs or \n     enrollment in the exchanges.\n\n  Removing the public option gives up a huge opportunity to reduce \ncosts for American families and the government, and I will work to try \nto ensure the final bill fixes this serious mistake.\n  I also am concerned about the excise tax on high cost health plans. \nUnder this bill, health insurers will be taxed on the value of any \nhealth care plan sold that is valued above $8,500 for an individual and \n$23,000 for a family. Improvements have been made to this policy during \nSenate consideration, and the thresholds for the tax, along with \nexemptions for high-risk professions, have been expanded. But I have \nheard from so many in my State who have traded wage increases for solid \nhealth insurance benefits in the past years. I have heard from teachers \nand laborers and union members who are worried they may lose the health \nbenefits they have fought for, and can't reclaim the wages they have \nalready lost. While this policy is often referred to as the \n``Cadillac'' health care tax, they will be the first to tell you that \nthey hardly live the Cadillac lifestyle. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate and the House to consider the real-life impact that this policy \ncould have on working Americans and their families.\n  I am concerned about the cuts to home health and hospice providers \nunder this bill. Home health and hospice providers offer a truly \nvaluable service to our communities. But under this bill, their \nreimbursements will be drastically cut and I am concerned that access \nwill decrease as a result. Improvements have been made under Senator \nReid's amendment, but we must do better for home health and hospice \nproviders.\n  I am disappointed that the bill does not permit the safe importation \nof prescription drugs, which would reduce health care spending for \nconsumers and the Federal Government. I will keep fighting to enact \nthis common-sense reform.\n  Lastly, I oppose the sweetheart deals that some Senators and interest \ngroups apparently cut. These deals weaken the bill by subsidizing \nStates or interest groups at taxpayer expense. They are unjustified, \nand they should be eliminated.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct is a fundamental first step toward providing all Americans with \naffordable, quality health care. The health care system is complex, and \nthat is why this Senate and two of its committees, including the Senate \nFinance Committee of which I am a member, have taken the better part of \nthis past year crafting this legislation. I believe several provisions \nof this bill are transformational for American health care and will \nbegin to move America toward more competition, choice, and quality.\n  The first provision is in the managers' amendment, and it is called \nfree choice vouchers. This section creates something that has never \nexisted before in the American health care system: a concrete way for \nmiddle-income Americans who cannot afford their health care to actually \npush back against the insurance lobby and force insurance companies to \ncompete for their business in the insurance exchanges. Unlike today, \nwhere if a hard-working, middle-class American can't afford just the \none health insurance policy available to him at his job, with\n\n[[Page S13853]]\n\nthis new provision, there will be a different health care marketplace, \nwith free enterprise choices that can actually drive down costs for the \nmiddle class while ensuring those choices are of good quality. And in \nthat new marketplace, a worker who cannot afford his employer's health \nplan can get a tax-free voucher for the same amount the employer \ncontributes under the health plan and use that voucher to buy a more \naffordable plan in the insurance exchange.\n  I have been an advocate for consumer empowerment and choice my entire \ncareer in public service. Exchanges are a new pathway to creating a \ncompetitive marketplace for the first time for health care in this \ncountry. Massachusetts led the way, opening the door to showing Federal \nlegislators the potential for insurance exchanges when Massachusetts \nenacted its own health reform law. Many other States lead the way with \ninnovation in health care, including States like Oregon and Vermont. \nThat is why I have authored and championed in the Senate Finance \nCommittee section 1332, the waiver for State innovation. If States \nthink they can do health reform better than under this bill, and they \ncover the same number of people with the same comprehensive coverage, \nthey can get a waiver exempting them from the legislation and still get \nthe Federal money that would have been provided under the bill. To me, \nthis provision is a safety valve, if certain provisions in this bill \nwill not work as intended in a given State. This provision will give \nStates a way to tailor health reform to best meet the needs of their \ncitizens. I intend to work with Senator Sanders and other colleagues to \nmake sure that State waivers will be available even sooner than they \nare under the current bill.\n  The waiver for State innovation and free choice vouchers will improve \nthe number of choices in the bill, for states, for employers and for \nemployees. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will also \nincrease quality of care, particularly in the Medicare Program. I \nworked in the Finance Committee to increase bonus payments to high \nquality plans in the Medicare Advantage Program. In Oregon, Medicare \nAdvantage is a lifeline given the low traditional Medicare \nreimbursement rates in the State. This amendment will reward the high \nquality plans that exist in Oregon, but will also encourage other plans \nacross the country to increase the quality of the care they provide. By \nboosting payments to the highest quality plans--the four and five star \nplans--the Federal Government will be incentivizing plans that provide \npreventive care, manage chronic diseases well, and have high levels of \nconsumer satisfaction.\n  Another provision that will add quality to the Medicare Program is \nIndependence at Home, IAH, section 3024 of the bill, that I won \napproval for in the Finance Committee. This provision stems from \nlegislation that I introduced with 11 other Members on both sides of \nthe aisle. As the name indicates, the Independence at Home program will \nprovide a way for seniors with chronic medical conditions to get \nmedical treatment at home. The IAH program is based on a house call \nteam approach that has proven successful in reducing costs and \nimproving the quality of care for high cost patients with multiple \nchronic illnesses, patients who account for 66 percent--85 percent of \nMedicare spending. The Independence at Home program requires providers \nto achieve minimum savings on health care provided to the highest cost \nMedicare beneficiaries as a condition of participating in the program.\n  Providing care at home makes sense, and is the right direction for \nthe future of health care delivery. But there is another aspect of the \nfuture of health care that I think holds much promise: personalized \nmedicine. I won approval in the Finance Committee, along with Senator \nCarper, for including section 3113 in the bill. This provision will \nincrease access to innovative molecular diagnostic tests that provide \nthe foundation for the application of personalized medicine for \nindividuals suffering from life threatening diseases such as cancer and \nheart disease. These tests hold the promise of getting patients the \nright type of chemotherapy for their specific case of cancer. \nPersonalized medicine is the future, and I am thrilled that the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act takes steps to move toward 21st \ncentury medicine.\n  I have spent the better part of my career trying to make the health \ncare marketplace more competitive and trying to improve the quality of \ncare for all Americans. I take many lessons from my home State of \nOregon, and have tried to apply the innovation that Oregon is known for \nas an example for how other States can provide higher quality care at a \nlower cost. Through free choice vouchers, State waivers, Medicare \nAdvantage bonus payments, Independence at Home, and personalized \nmedicine, I believe this bill improves competition, choice and quality \nacross the entire country.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill will extend \nbasic health care to more than 30 million Americans who were previously \nunable to afford the costs associated with seeing a medical \nprofessional. Not since former President Harry S. Truman enrolled as \nMedicare's first participant in July of 1965 has our health care system \nundergone such a complete overhaul. The reform brought about by this \nbill is needed and long overdue. For too long millions of Americans \nhave struggled to see health professionals while health insurance \nproviders have raised premiums and executives have reaped multimillion-\ndollar bonuses. That is no longer the case. This bill also ensures that \nHawaii, a State long ahead of the curve in terms of providing health \ninsurance and affordable access to medical professionals, maintains its \nhigh level of health care while expanding the reach of existing Federal \nprograms. The State Prepaid Health Care Act of 1975 ensures that every \nemployee in Hawaii working at least 20 hours a week receive health \ninsurance from their employer. Hawaii received an exemption to ensure \nHawaii's employer mandated health care law would not be rolled back. \nThe health care reform bill also includes tremendous cost savings and \nsubsidy incentives for the State. Hawaii is one of two States in the \ncountry who are not permanently enrolled in the Federal \ndisproportionate share hospital, DSH, program which reimburses \nhospitals that care for the uninsured. Currently Hawaii's temporary \nenrollment expires in 2012 but the new bill will make DSH permanent \nresulting in more than $100 million for Hawaii's health care industry \nover the next 10 years. I am also pleased that we were able to include \nthe reauthorization of the Wakefield Pediatric-Emergency Medical \nServices for Children program, at the suggestion of my two colleagues \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Kent Conrad and Senator Byron Dorgan. This \nprogram works to ensure that emergency rooms across the country are \nequipped with the resources necessary to treat young children. A \ncivilized, democratic society like ours should help maintain the health \nand welfare of all our citizens. No one should be denied medical care \nor lose coverage because they can't afford to pay to see a medical \nprofessional. Like that July afternoon in 1965 when President Lyndon \nJohnson signed Medicare into law I am especially pleased to see that \nour great Nation once again has recognized and worked to meet the basic \nneeds of our citizens.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at a handful of moments, Members of the \nU.S. Senate have faced choices that could fairly be described as \nhistoric. Each of these choices was between progress--sometimes \nincomplete progress--and an intolerable status quo. In our finest \nhours, we have overcome fear and doubt and stood for the principle that \nour Nation, though great, could aspire to do better. When our ambition \nhas weakened, we have taken the timid path. That is an easier journey \nand less laden with fear or political peril, but it has not served our \nown time well or passed the test of history.\n  We have come to another of those times. We can vote, now, to address \ndecades of frustration and anguish over a health care system most \nAmericans know is broken. Or we can destroy the hopes of millions of \nAmericans whose modest ambition is not a perfect system, but an \nimproved one. We cannot vote to end every problem in health care; this \nbill will not do that. But we can make life safer, more secure, less \ncostly, for most Americans, because we can give them a better health \ncare system.\n  Briefly, here is some of what this legislation will accomplish:\n\n[[Page S13854]]\n\n  People with preexisting conditions who are currently left out of the \nsystem will be able to get access to health care in the future. Within \n6 months of enactment, this legislation will allow those not covered at \nwork and who are unable to find insurance in the individual market \nbecause of preexisting conditions to buy a plan that will remain in \nplace if they get sick. And it will offer free preventive services and \nimmunizations.\n  This bill has provisions to help strengthen Medicare by giving \nseniors access to important preventive services that they may otherwise \nnot be able to afford. And also for seniors, this bill reduces the \nMedicare doughnut hole, a gap in prescription drug coverage that I hope \nwe are able to eventually close altogether.\n  After 2014, new plans will be barred from imposing annual limits on \ncoverage, and sliding tax credits will be available to make insurance \nmore affordable for those earning below $88,000 for a family of four, \nor earning below $43,000 for an individual. The credits that will be \noffered to make coverage more affordable will bring millions of \nAmericans under the umbrella of health insurance, an important \nimprovement for those families now without insurance and a step toward \nreducing burdens and inefficiencies that make health care more \nexpensive for all of us. State-based exchanges will offer those seeking \nindividual coverage both the purchasing power of belonging to a larger \ngroup, and a transparent marketplace in which benefits are standardized \nand costs are clear.\n  The bill also helps small businesses that are struggling to get a \nhandle on ever-increasing health care insurance costs. Beginning in \n2010, small businesses will receive a tax credit of up to 35 percent of \ntheir costs for insuring their employees and their employees' families. \nIn 2014 and beyond, the tax credit can be as much as 50 percent of an \nemployer's costs for covering employees. These credits will encourage \nthese employers, which are the backbone of our economy, to provide \nhealth care insurance coverage.\n  The bill also includes some major insurance company reforms. \nBeginning in 2011, plans that do not spend a high percentage of their \nrevenue for patient care--85 percent of revenue for large-group \nprograms, and 80 percent in the individual and small-group market--will \nhave to provide rebates to their enrollees.\n  One of the benefits of this new requirement on insurance companies is \nreversing the troublesome trend that has seen more and more of our \nhealth care dollars spent on administration. Since 1970, the number of \nadministrative positions in our health care system has increased by \nnearly 3,000 percent, far outstripping the growth in the number of \nphysicians over the same period. It is long past time to ensure that we \nare spending precious health care dollars on care and not on paperwork \nand bureaucracy. Hospitals will become more transparent as well--every \nhospital in the Nation will publish a list of standard charges for the \nitems and services it provides.\n  The bill includes incentives to boost the availability of primary \ncare, including financial incentives under Medicare to increase the \nnumber of primary care physicians. And it also promotes standardizing \nhealth information technology in an effort to reduce costly \nadministrative overhead.\n  This is not everything I hoped for. But it is what we can get done. \nIt is what we should do.\n  The minority has offered no alternatives, just apocalyptic rhetoric. \nSome of them stood before rallies, leading chants about socialism. They \nclaimed it is a big government takeover. ``Kill the bill'' was their \nslogan. Before television cameras our efforts to produce reform were \ncompared to the activities of financial fraudsters like Bernie Madoff.\n  For those familiar with the facts, these notions are rightly seen as \nfalsehoods. One of these falsehoods--the notion that health care reform \nwould mean ``death panels'' voting to end the lives of senior \ncitizens--has just been named by an independent fact-checking \norganization its ``Lie of the Year.'' That's quite a distinction. When \ndiscussing the scare tactics being used by opponents of health reform, \nthe policy director of AARP said, ``The opponents of health reform have \ntargeted (seniors) and have . . . misrepresented the facts, and have \nconsciously tried to scare seniors who depend on health care. So no \nsurprise that they feel anxious, because they're hearing messages every \nday designed to scare the bejesus out of them.''\n  The extreme rhetoric of the minority is a repeat of similar rhetoric \nwhich was used when Social Security and Medicare were being considered \nby the Congress.\n  In 1935, as Social Security was being debated, one Republican warned \nthe program would ``enslave workers,'' and another declared ``the lash \nof the dictator will be felt'' if it passed. Three decades later, as \nthe Congress debated the Medicare Program, one Republican Member of \nCongress said, ``Let me tell you here and now, it is socialized \nmedicine.'' A future Republican President of the United States warned \nthat if Medicare passed, ``you and I are going to spend our sunset \nyears telling our children and our children's children what it was like \nin America when men were free.''\n  Incredibly, the same Republican Party that once equated Medicare with \nsocialism would now have the public believe they are defending Medicare \nfrom the threat of socialism. The mental gymnastics this requires is \nbreathtaking. If this bill is such a threat to seniors, why does AARP \nsupport its passage? If it will destroy our health care system, why do \nso many of the groups that know health care first-hand, from the \nAmerican Medical Association to the American Heart Association to the \nAmerican Cancer Society, and dozens of others support passage of this \nbill? If this bill will explode the deficit, why does the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office tell us it will reduce the deficit by $132 \nbillion over the first decade after enactment, and up to $1.3 trillion \nin the second?\n  Are all these organizations, the nonpartisan CBO, independent fact-\ncheckers, scores of economists and health care experts--are they all \nengaged in a conspiracy to engineer a socialist government takeover of \nmedicine? I am afraid that some of our Republican colleagues have \nlatched onto any argument at hand to justify their opposition to health \ncare reform.\n  Let me ask one final question: What do opponents say to our \nconstituents who speak to us every day of their belief that the time \nfor health reform has come? That today is not the time? The man from \nKalamazoo, MI, who went bankrupt because his health insurance would not \ncover $40,000 in costs for a life-saving heart operation--will they \ntell him this is not the time? The woman from Jackson, Michigan, who \nspent months fighting to get coverage because insurance companies \nconsidered her pregnancy a preexisting condition--will they tell her \nthis is not the time? The worried mother who wrote my office to say, \n``We will lose too many bright young people--if something is not \ndone''--will they tell her this is not the time?\n  No, this is the time. Now is the time to embrace the same call of \nhistory that led our predecessors to ignore the apocalyptic rhetoric \nand establish Social Security and Medicare. We must pass this bill, so \nthat generations after us do not look back on a broken health care \nsystem and say, ``Here was another lost moment when it could all have \nchanged.'' We must pass this bill. Now is the time. Just as we are \nploughing the roads of record snow to get to work, our work now is to \nplough through the endless filibusters to get our job done.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Baucus, Senator Dodd, and myself, I \nsubmit this statement under the spirit of rule XLIV of the Standing \nRules of the Senate. We hereby certify that, to the best of our \nknowledge and belief, the managers' amendment to the substitute \namendment to H.R. 3590 does not contain any congressionally directed \nspending item as defined in rule XLIV.\n  Rule XLIV defines a congressionally directed spending item as ``a \nprovision or report language included primarily at the request of a \nSenator providing, authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending \nauthority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, \nor other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific \nState, locality or Congressional district, other than through a \nstatutory\n\n[[Page S13855]]\n\nor administrative formula-driven or competitive award process.'' To the \nbest of our belief, no item meets this definition. There are numerous \nitems that affect one or more States or localities differently than \nothers, but none of these meet the definition because of one or more of \nthe following reasons--(A) no specific amount is associated with the \nprovision, (B) the provision involves distribution through ``a \nstatutory . . . formula-driven . . . or competitive award process'' or \n(C) the criteria are such that more than one State or locality will or \nmay benefit. It is quite common in legislation for formulas and \nprograms to make adjustments to affect State- or locality-specific \nneeds.\n  The rule defines a ``limited tax benefit'' as ``any revenue provision \nthat (A) provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or \npreference to a particular beneficiary or limited group of \nbeneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and (B) contains \neligibility criteria that are not uniform in application with respect \nto potential beneficiaries of such provision.''\n  Section 10905 provides exceptions to the annual fee on health \ninsurance providers for certain insurers. One of these exceptions is \nprovided to any entity that meets the following criteria--a mutual \ninsurance company with market share in a State for 2008 between 40 \npercent and 60 percent and whose medical loss ratio for all markets--\nindividual, small group and large group--in 2008 was 90 percent or \nhigher. The performance-based exception is available if the entity has \nan average medical loss ratio for years after 2011 for the previous 3 \nyears for all markets of 89 percent or higher--prior year for 2012 fee \nand prior two years for 2013 fee. It may be argued that this provision \ncould be considered a ``limited tax benefit'' as defined in rule XLIV; \nat the same time, the Joint Committee of Taxation has indicated that \nthe universe of potential beneficiaries depends in part on how \n``medical loss ratio'' is ultimately determined under the statute. In \nthe interest of transparency, the provision was included at the request \nof Senator Ben Nelson so that nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield of \nNebraska would not be excluded from the exemption of nonprofit insurers \nfrom the fee. In keeping with the spirit of rule XLIV, Senator Nelson \nhas provided Senator Baucus with a certification that neither he nor \nhis family has a financial interest in the provision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from Senator Nelson of Nebraska dated December 21, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2009.\n     Chairman Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: \n     Consistent with the provisions of Rule XLIV of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, I am submitting this letter with regard \n     to Section 10905 of Senate Amendment 3276.\n       Section 10905 of the amendment creates a limited exemption \n     from the annual fee on health insurance providers established \n     by Section 9010 of Amendment No. 2786 to H.R. 3590, the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009. The \n     exemption from the fee is created for certain non-profit \n     insurers with a high medical loss ratio. Among other \n     exemptions provided for under this section, an exemption from \n     the fee is available to any entity which is a non-profit \n     mutual insurance company with market share in a State for \n     2008 between 40% and 60% and whose medical loss ratio for all \n     markets (individual, small group, and large group) in 2008 \n     was 90% or higher. The exception is available only if the \n     entity has an average medical loss ratio for years after 2011 \n     for the previous three years for all markets of 89% or higher \n     (prior year for 2012 fee and prior two years for 2013 fee).\n       This provision could be considered a ``limited tax \n     benefit'' as defined in Rule XLIV, and I anticipate that Blue \n     Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska may benefit from this \n     provision, provided that that they maintain the high medical \n     loss ratio called for under the provision. My purpose for \n     requesting this provision was so that Nebraska's sole non-\n     profit insurer would not be excluded from the exceptions to \n     the insurance fee as set forth in Section 10905.\n       Consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of Rule \n     XLIV, neither I nor my immediate family have any pecuniary \n     interest in this item.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               E. Benjamin Nelson.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we finish this session, there are many \npeople who have worked to get us to this point. From the staff in the \nSenate to the Capitol Police, many employees have given their time to \nmake sure that the Senate could complete its work on health care.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize the work of the employees of \nthe Government Printing Office, GPO. Each day, the GPO works with the \nSecretary of the Senate to meet the needs of the Senate and we \nappreciate their efforts. Nearly all of the documents we have used for \nthe health care debate have been printed and delivered by the employees \nof the GPO.\n  This past weekend, when the heavy snow blanketed the city and shut \ndown most government agencies and operations, the men and women of the \nGPO came to work and remained at their posts. Some GPO employees spent \nthe night to ensure that the Senate was able to get the documents we \nneeded. Their performance throughout the health care debate was \ncommendable and I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking the GPO for a job well done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as we approach the vote tomorrow morning, I \nknow a lot of people are calling it a historic vote. In some contexts, \nI guess it is. However, many of us are concerned it is a historic \nmistake rather than a history-making opportunity.\n  We have had a lot of debate about whether this legislation is the \nright or wrong way to improve health care for all Americans. We have \nhad hours and hours, in fact, days and weeks of committee hearings and \nmeetings with good bipartisan discussion on options and ways to \naccomplish this. But now, apparently, we have a mandate by the majority \ndemanding we have a final vote in the Senate before Christmas.\n  While we debate this, let me say I believe we need to hear more from \nthe people who are going to be most affected, the American people, \nbecause the final details of this bill were not crafted in front of the \nAmerican public. I think most people in America know the President \npledged that this legislation would be crafted around a table that is \npublic, where, in fact, he said C-SPAN cameras could be present--in his \nwords: So people could see the deals people were making and who was \nworking for the American people and who was cutting deals.\n  The C-SPAN camera was not present, the table was not open, the room \nwas closed, and the bill was negotiated in secret. But we are starting \nto find out what the deals were, and the deals are outraging the \nAmerican people as they see specific exemptions from certain burdens in \nthe bill being given to certain States in order to get the votes from \nthe Senators for those States.\n  We heard about different proposals dealing with the State of \nLouisiana, the State of Florida, the State of Connecticut, the State of \nNebraska, and the list is growing as we have an opportunity to deeply \ndelve into the bill and determine exactly what is in it.\n  But we will not have time to know all the details of these deals. We \nwill not have time to even know all the details of how the bill works \nbecause this 2,700-page bill, 400 pages of which were only disclosed \nlast Saturday, will be voted on at 7 o'clock in the morning.\n  Three days ago, I asked Idahoans who, similar to most Americans--in \nfact, all Americans--want health care reform, to sign a petition on the \nInternet asking the Senate to:\n\n       . . . defeat H.R. 3590 . . . because we need reform that \n     will lower costs while increasing quality . . . and keeping \n     health care decisions between a patient and their doctor.\n\n  The response to this request has been remarkable. In fact, I suspect \nthat, as I am speaking, we have already gotten over 20,000 signatures \non the petition on the Internet. I asked people to go to my Internet \nsite, mikecrapo.com, and simply sign the petition. Here is a partial \nstack. We are still printing out the rest of the names of the people \nwho signed the petition, but somewhere between 19,000 and 20,000--and \ngrowing--people signed the petition.\n  Here is the remarkable thing about it. When I asked the people of \nIdaho to sign this petition, I asked them to do two things. I asked \nthem, first, to go to the Web site and sign the petition. Then, second, \nI asked them to contact everyone within their circle of influence--\npeople on their Christmas card list, people on their e-mail contacts\n\n[[Page S13856]]\n\nlist, people on their Facebook, their Facebook friends, everyone who is \nwithin their circle of influence--and ask them to also sign the \npetition and, if they didn't live in Idaho, to contact their Senator \nand encourage their Senator to oppose this legislation, if they agreed \nwith me that it is not the path our Nation should follow.\n  Remarkably, more than half the people who have so far signed the \npetition did not get that information from me. They got the request or \nencouragement to sign the petition from the friend or relative. A huge \nproportion of them do not live in Idaho. In fact, we have had people \nfrom all over America, in every one of the 50 States, sign this \npetition.\n  Why is this happening? By the way, the number is growing. It is \nhappening because the more Americans know about this bill, the more \nthey know it is not the path they want us to take for health care \nreform. Health care is personal, private, and a sensitive matter among \nindividuals and their doctors and their family. This bill makes health \ncare a public policy decision controlled by a government bureaucracy. \nAmericans don't want that kind of government control over our health \ncare economy. Yet instead Americans see an administration and a \ncongressional majority forcing this bill down their throats in a rush \nto pass it before public opposition legitimately overwhelms this \nwrongheaded monstrosity. Thousands are signing this petition because \nthey desperately want Congress to listen, but they know that their \ncollective voice has been ignored. The petition is one way they can \nmake themselves heard in hopes that this Congress will pass needed and \nsensible reform but not this bill.\n  In fact, another point about this petition is in addition to getting \non the Web site and signing the petition, I have individuals calling my \noffices and saying: Thank you for giving us an avenue to try to reach \nout to the Senate and tell the Senate to stop. I think thousands of \nIdahoans and people from all over America are eager to have an avenue \nto speak out, and we need to stop and listen. I thank the thousands of \nIdahoans and Americans across the country for being willing to get \ninvolved as citizens and petition their government to respect our \nrights and to honor our values and to reform health care sensibly. The \nnational polls indicate people oppose this bill. They want commonsense, \nlower cost action that will reduce the cost of premiums and doctor \nvisits.\n  This legislation instead raises taxes on the middle class, increases \npremium costs for many people now carrying insurance, cuts senior \nprograms, and fails to lower health care costs. Simply put, there has \nnot been a piece of legislation this decade that has come forward to \nmeet more opposition than this health care reform bill. The more \nIdahoans and Americans know about the bill, the more they dislike it. \nHealth care is a personal, private, and sensitive matter, and this bill \ngoes the opposite direction. But the majority is moving full steam \nahead in hope that they can pass it before the public can understand \nwhat it is and register their opposition. If we will take the time, we \ncan improve the health care system--without the tax increases, without \nthe massive increase in the growth of government, without the \nporkbarrel spending and the sweetheart deals, without the Medicare cuts \nand the unconstitutional burdens on State governments this bill \npresents.\n  Among the steps many of us are trying to see enacted are things such \nas allowing insurance companies to compete across State lines, allowing \nsmall businesses to band together to negotiate group rates for \ninsurance, requiring pricing disclosures from health care providers to \npromote a competitive, consumer-driven health care market, and offering \nincentives for patients and the private sector to create wellness \nprograms and other efficiencies in health care delivery. In fact, when \na bill similar to this was presented as the Republican alternative in \nthe House, with the provisions the House Republicans proposed, it was \nscored, contrary to the bill we will be voting on, by CBO that it would \nactually reduce the cost of health care in America by significant \npercentages. Yet we are now continuing to plow full steam ahead with a \nvote at 7 o'clock in the morning on a bill that will increase the cost \nof health care.\n  The petition I brought forward asks Congress to listen. It registers \nthe fears of many Americans that they are being ignored by the \nadministration and by the majority in Congress. I am going to continue \nto aggressively push for their wishes on the floor of the Senate.\n  I wish to take an opportunity now to go ahead and get into a little \nbit more of the detail we do know about this bill. Why do I say it is \nthe wrong direction for America? To start, let's ask what Americans \nwant in health care reform. If you asked most Americans--and there have \nactually been a number of polls that have shown this--do they want \nhealth care reform, they say yes. When they are asked what they mean by \nthat and what they want, the overwhelming answer is that they want to \nstop the skyrocketing increases in the cost of their health care \ninsurance, they want to control the skyrocketing increases in the cost \nof medical care. They also say they want to see increased access for \nthose who don't now have access to quality insurance, both because they \nare compassionate and want to see that kind of health care for everyone \nand because they know they are paying for it in their insurance \npremiums, for those who have insurance, and in their taxes, those who \npay taxes. They want to assure that we continue to have the highest \nquality of health care possible. That is what we are supposed to be \ndoing. That is what this bill should be working on. That is the \nobjective we should be achieving.\n  Yet what are we achieving? In an earlier discussion of the House \nbill, I believe the Wall Street Journal said it was the worst bill \never. We now have a different bill in the Senate, but it is still falls \ninto the same category. Why? Because it drives up the cost of health \ncare. It raises taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. It cuts \nMedicare by hundreds of billions of dollars. It grows the government by \n$2.5 trillion. It forces the needy uninsured not into a program where \nmost of them can get insurance but into a failing and less robust \nmedical system, Medicaid. It imposes damaging unfunded mandates on our \nState governments that are already sharing the burden of Medicaid and \nfacing difficult troubled economic times. It means increased taxes not \njust at the Federal level but at the State level with unfunded \nmandates. It leaves millions of Americans uninsured, and it establishes \nmassive government controls over our health care economy.\n  Let me go through a few of those to give more specifics. First, I \ndon't think most Americans, when they talk about health care reform, \nthink that means we need to grow the size of our government by $2.5 \ntrillion. Although there is some smoke and mirrors in the way this bill \nis put together, because the first 4 years of its costs are not started \nuntil 4 years into the bill, so when you try to count the first 10 \nyears, you only see a smaller number, when you take the first true 10 \nyears of spending in this bill, it increases the cost of this \ngovernment's health care expenditures by $2.5 trillion. As we can see \non this chart, look at the first 4 years. The spending is basically \ndeferred. Why would that happen? I will explain that when I talk about \ndeficit issues. But what it does is hide the true cost of the bill. If \nyou measure the true cost of the bill in the first full 10 years of \nspending, it is $2.5 trillion rather than the $1.2 trillion it would be \nif you counted it otherwise.\n  What we see is a massive growth of the Federal Government. That is \nnot what people were asking for and, frankly, it makes them kind of do \na doubletake when you explain to them that we are increasing the size \nof our government by such massive amounts with health care reform. \nThose proposing that we adopt this bill often say: Our objective and \nwhat the American people want is to drive the cost curve down. I often \nask, what cost curve are they talking about? If they are talking about \nthe cost of health care or the cost of health care premiums, they are \ngoing up. If they are talking about the size of the Federal Government \nand the level of Federal Government spending, that is going up.\n  There is one that they talk about. It is called the deficit. That is \nwhether we are spending more than we are taxing and cutting. They argue \nthat the deficit is going down. There is only one way you can argue \nthat this bill does not increase the deficit, and that is if\n\n[[Page S13857]]\n\nyou assume that we don't have nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion of Medicare cuts, \nthat we don't have $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of taxes in the first year and \n$1.28 trillion of taxes in the first full 10 years of implementation \nand that we don't have several budget gimmicks.\n  What are the gimmicks? The first and biggest is the one I showed on \nthe previous chart. They don't count the first 4 years of spending. \nThey stop the spending and don't let it start happening for 4 years so \nthat we have 10 years of taxes, 10 years of Medicare cuts, and 6 years \nof spending. When you balance that out, you can claim it doesn't \nincrease the deficit because you don't have a full 10 years of \nspending.\n  There are other budget gimmicks. We have something called the SGR \nfix, the adjustments in compensation rates for physicians that we all \nknow on both sides we must do. We must keep the physician compensation \ncomparable and moving up with inflation. That is going to cost $245 \nbillion, approximately, over the next 10 years. That $245 billion cost \nto reform and adjust the Medicare compensation system is absent from \nthe bill. Why? Because they are going to do it in a separate bill and \nprobably not pay for it; in other words, not have offsets. We will see \nwhether they have offsets, but it is not in this bill. If it were, it \nwould drive the deficit numbers by $245 billion in the wrong direction.\n  There are other types of gimmicks. For example, there is double \ncounting of the Medicare cuts. The CBO came out with a report today \nthat said that if you cut Medicare by $465 billion, claiming that you \nare going to use that $465 billion to help make the financial situation \nfor Medicare more stable, you can't then take that same $465 billion \nand use it to establish a massive new government program, yet a third \nmajor government health care entitlement system. You can't spend it on \na new one and claim you are saving one that is already facing fiscal \ncollapse. It is these kinds of budget gimmicks that make many of us \nobject to the bill. If you didn't have those budget gimmicks, if you \ndidn't have those tax increases, if you didn't have those Medicare \ncuts, there is no way you could say this bill is deficit neutral.\n  One of the things CBO does report--I want to move to the question of \nthe cost of insurance--is that the premiums in the individual market \nwill go up, not down. What does that mean? CBO breaks the insurance \nmarket into three categories: the individual market, the small group \nmarket, and the large group market. The individual market is the one \nthat is primarily there for small businesses that don't have a large or \na small group opportunity or individuals who don't get their insurance \nthrough their employer. It represents about 17 percent or almost 1 in 5 \nof all insured people in the country. Their insurance rates under this \nbill--17 percent of all Americans--are going to go up. The amount by \nwhich they will go up is about 10 to 13 percent, according to CBO.\n  The next group is the small group market. They represent about \nanother 13 percent. Again, CBO says under this bill their rates are \ngoing to go up, not quite as badly, between 1 and 3 percent, but up, \nnot down.\n  That brings us to the large group market. The large group market \nactually fares a little better. This is the remaining 70 percent of \nthose insured in the United States. Basically, the CBO report says that \nfor them there is a chance theirs may go down by a percent or two, but \nbasically, it could be stable, a zero-percent change as well. Because \nindividuals in the large group market, those who get their insurance \nfrom larger employers, have less liability of a harmful impact because \nthey have that large group that can continue to negotiate to control \ntheir health care costs.\n  So what do we see? Even under the best scenario--and there have been \nnine or ten studies of this and the CBO report is the one that is the \nmost favorable toward the bill; most of the other reports have said \nthat the rates are going to go up for everybody--but even if we take \nCBO's numbers, 30 percent of the people will see their insurance rates \ngo up, not down. The other 70 percent can expect basically the status \nquo; in other words, not any change at all, maybe a slight decrease.\n  Is that what Americans were asking for robust health care reform \nsystem? No. Americans are asking for true, solid, significant control \nof the cost of their premiums and their health care costs.\n  I wish to move next to the question of taxes. This bill increases \ntaxes by about $\\1/2\\ trillion. The President has pledged he wouldn't \nsign a bill that involved tax increases on the middle class. He defined \nthe middle class to be people who as individuals make less than \n$200,000 a year or as a family or a couple making less than $250,000 a \nyear. Here is the President's pledge:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. No family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase.\n\n  He was pushed on this pledge and he clarified it. He said not your \nincome taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not \nany of your taxes. You will not see any of your taxes increase one \nsingle dime.\n  That is the President's pledge. But what do we have? In the first 10 \nyears, $493 billion in new taxes. The question is: Do those taxes all \nfall on the so-called wealthy, those making more than $250,000? Well, \nCBO and the Joint Tax Committee have analyzed it, and the answer is \nclearly no.\n  But before I get to that, let's see what the taxes do in the first \nfull 10 years of implementation. Remember, the first 4 years are kind \nof a slow start with the spending, but if you compare the taxes and the \nspending, count the total amount of taxes starting on the day when the \nspending kicks into gear, it is not $493 billion, or whatever the \nnumber was, it is $1.28 trillion in new taxes. That is not what the \nAmerican people are asking for.\n  The next question you might ask yourself is: OK, how much of those \ntaxes are going to be paid by people who the President pledged would \nnot be hit? Well, the Joint Tax Committee has analyzed the bill, and by \n2019--and the reason they use the year 2019 is that is the end of the \nfirst full 10 years of implementation--by the year 2019, at least 73 \nmillion American households earning below $200,000 will face a tax \nincrease. That is not just people making $200,000, that is everybody \nwho pays taxes who makes any kind of income less than $200,000 in \nAmerica. Seventy-three million--not individuals--households will pay \ntaxes under this bill.\n  One of the things that is interesting, in response to this argument, \nsome of my colleagues on the other side have said: Wait a minute. That \nis not true. This bill is actually a tax cut. Wait a minute, you have \nme saying this bill increases taxes and someone on the other side \nsaying this bill cuts taxes. How could that be?\n  Well, there is a subsidy in this bill for those who are at lower \nincome categories and are provided government dollars or subsidies in \norder to purchase insurance--the ones who are fortunate enough not to \nhave been pushed into the Medicaid system. That subsidy is about $400 \nbillion or $500 billion in the bill, and it is administered by the IRS, \nso it is claimed to be a tax cut. If you offset that subsidy against \ntax increases in other parts of the bill, then you can say: Well, there \nis a tax cut in this bill.\n  First of all, that is not what the President said. The President did \nnot say: I will not increase your taxes more than I will cut somebody \nelse's taxes. That is not what he said. What he said was: Your taxes \nwill not go up if you are making under $250,000 as a couple or $200,000 \nas an individual.\n  But even if you accept that argument, 73 percent or $288 billion of \nthis tax subsidy goes to taxpayers who do not pay any taxes. Their \nincome levels are so low they do not hit the thresholds for incurring a \ntax liability. They get a pure, straightforward subsidy. The \nCongressional Budget Office acknowledges this and scores it as Federal \nspending, not as tax relief.\n  But either way you want to look at it, let's say you agree it is tax \ncuts and agree to offset it--which I think is wrong--you still come up \nwith 42 million American households earning less than $200,000 a year \nwho will face a net tax increase, and the tax increases are not small \nfor these families.\n  The bill grows the Federal Government. It pushes up every cost curve \nyou could think of. It increases taxes. It increases the cost of health \ninsurance. It increases the cost of health care.\n  What does it do to Medicare? It cuts Medicare by $465 billion in the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S13858]]\n\nyear and, again, if you want to look at the first full 10 years, by \n$953 billion in Medicare cuts. Basically, what we have here in this \npart of the bill is an absolute transfer--an absolute transfer--from \nAmerica's senior citizens right over to the new government entitlement \nprogram and a redistribution of that wealth to other people.\n  Senior citizens who have throughout their life paid the Medicare tax, \nthe Medicare payroll tax, will now see the Medicare they thought they \nwere going to get cut. What kinds of cuts are we talking about that we \nmay be dealing with here? The biggest one is Medicare Advantage--$120 \nbillion of cuts.\n  About one in four American seniors has Medicare Advantage insurance. \nThis is insurance that was provided in a contract relationship with the \nprivate sector. In other words, it was an experiment to see if we could \nlet the private sector deliver Medicare and how they would do at it. \nThey found they can actually, through the Medicare Advantage Program, \nincrease the benefits seniors get.\n  This is probably the most popular part of the Medicare Program. It is \ngrowing rapidly. The reason it is growing rapidly is because it \nprovides better coverage. Those in the Medicare Advantage Program are \ngoing to see their benefits cut.\n  Another pledge the President made was: If you like what you have, you \ncan keep it. Well, not if you have Medicare Advantage. It is also not \ntrue about a lot of people who have their insurance through their \nemployers these days because that is going to be lost to millions of \nAmericans too.\n  But in addition to the Medicare Advantage cuts, you are going to see \nhospital reimbursements, skilled nursing facilities, home health \nagencies, hospice, and others cuts to the tune of $465 billion in the \nfirst 10 years. The experts have all told us, what that is going to do \nis to make impossible for many health care providers in these \ncategories to keep their doors open, or it will cause them to reduce \nthe amount and quality of services they provide.\n  So senior citizens are going to see their Medicare, particularly \ntheir Medicare Advantage, benefits cut and their access to care \nrestricted and reduced under this bill.\n  In summary, there has been a lot of talk again about how Americans \nwant health care reform. But we need to do it in a smart and sensible \nway. Many have argued there are no alternatives being put forward by \nour side. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, that is simply not \ntrue. In fact, the alternative that was put forward in the House and \nthe alternative many of us have been talking about here have been \nscored to actually achieve the results Americans are asking for.\n  We do not need to rush this bill through in a claim that we are \nmaking history but in a way that will be a huge historical mistake. The \nAmerican people, in huge numbers, are asking us to slow down and stop \nit and start working together in ways that do not create a government \ntakeover of health care, that do not drive up the size and reach of the \nFederal Government, that do not drive up taxes but instead provide the \nright kind of approaches to medical savings, that do not slash Medicare \nbenefits to our seniors, that do not put massive burdens on our States, \nand that do not force the neediest of our uninsured into a failing \nhealth care system, Medicaid.\n  We are simply going to have to be back at this in the future if we do \nnot get it right now. Only then we will be facing much worse fiscal \ncircumstances and very difficult problems with sustaining the fiscal \nstability of the two programs we are now dealing with trying to \nsustain: Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to the people who signed this \npetition--people all across this Nation in every one of the 50 States--\nwho are saying: Wait. Do not do this now. Do some sensible reform, but \ndo not make this mistake.\n  I encourage all my colleagues, as we are literally on the eve of the \nvote that will determine whether this bill makes it through the Senate, \nto step back and take a deep breath and evaluate whether it will not be \nbetter for all of America for us to move a little slower and start \ntrying to build a bipartisan solution that can have true benefits for \nthe American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk from the majority \nabout why passing this bill is the right thing to do for the American \npeople. It is a decision of conscience for them. Well, let us a take a \ncloser look at these decisions of conscience.\n  After weeks of closed-door clandestine negotiations, Senator Reid \nfinally emerged with a 383-page Christmas list. This bill is a dark \nexample of everything that is wrong with Washington today. Despite all \nthe promises of accountability and transparency, this bill is a grab \nbag of Chicago-style, backroom buy-offs. It is nothing more than the \nDemocratic leadership's own private game of ``Let's Make A Deal'' with \nspecial interest groups financed by American taxpayers.\n  So who won and who lost in this game? Well let us take a closer look.\n  AARP issued a strong statement of support for this bill. The Reid \nbill slashes Medicare by almost $\\1/2\\ trillion to finance additional \ngovernment spending. So, why would the Nation's largest lobbying \norganization, avowed to protect the interests of seniors, support this \nlegislation? To find the answer, like anything else in Washington, just \nfollow the money.\n  AARP takes in more than half of its $1.1 billion budget in royalty \nfees from health insurers and other vendors. The sale of supplementary \nMedicare policies, called Medigap plans, make up a major share of this \nroyalty revenue. AARP has a direct interest in selling more Medigap \nplans. However, there is a strong competitor to Medigap policies--\nMedicare Advantage plans.\n  These private plans provide comprehensive coverage, including vision \nand dental care, at lower premiums for nearly 11 million seniors across \nthe country. Seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage do not need Medigap \npolicies. So what happens when the Reid bill slashes this program by \nalmost $120 billion? Just look at the Washington Post front-page story \nfrom October 27 questioning whether AARP has a conflict of interest:\n\n       Democratic proposals to slash reimbursements for . . . \n     Medicare Advantage are widely expected to drive up demand for \n     private Medigap policies like the ones offered by AARP, \n     according to health-care experts, legislative aides and \n     documents.\n\n  One of the most disturbing developments in the Reid bill has been the \nperpetuation and even doubling of the unconstitutional individual \nmandate tax from $8 billion to $15 billion. You heard me right--this \nunconstitutional mandate tax actually doubled behind closed doors. I \nhave long argued that forcing Americans to either buy a Washington-\ndefined level of coverage or face a tax penalty collected through the \nInternal Revenue Service is highly unconstitutional.\n  We hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side about Republicans \ndefending the big, evil insurance companies while Democrats are the \ndefenders of American families. The insurance mandate is a clear \nexample of this partisan hypocrisy. Let me ask one simple question: Who \nwould benefit the most from this unprecedented mandate to purchase \ninsurance or face a stiff penalty enforced by our friends at the \nInternal Revenue Service?\n  The answer is simple. There are two clear winners under this \nDraconian policy--and neither is the American family. The first winner \nis the Federal Government, which could easily use this authority to \nincrease the penalty, or impose similar ones, to create new streams of \nrevenue to fund more out-of-control spending. Second, the insurance \ncompanies are the most direct winners under this individual insurance \nmandate because it would force millions of Americans who would not \notherwise do so to become their customers. I cannot think of a bigger \ngiveaway for insurance companies than the Federal Government ordering \nAmericans to buy their products. If you do not believe me then just \nlook at the stock prices of the insurance companies that have recently \nshot to their 52-week highs.\n  Jane Hamsher, the publisher of the very liberal blog Firedoglake, \nsaid the following in a recent posting: ``Having to pay 2 percent of \ntheir income in annual fines for refusing to comply--with the IRS \nacting as the collection agency--just might wind up being the most \nwidely hated legislation of the decade. Barack Obama just might achieve \nthe\n\n[[Page S13859]]\n\nbipartisan unity on health care he always wanted--Democrats and \nRepublicans are coming together to say kill this bill.' ''\n  Now that we clearly understand the huge windfalls the Reid bill \nprovides AARP and insurance companies, let me take a moment to talk \nabout the winners and losers in the so-called abortion compromise. The \nlanguage to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to fund elective \nabortions is completely unacceptable. The new abortion provisions are \nsignificantly weaker than the amendment I introduced with Senator Ben \nNelson to ensure that the Hyde amendment, which prohibits use of \nfederal dollars for elective abortions, applies to any new federal \nhealth programs created in this bill. The Hyde amendment has been \npublic law since 1976.\n  The so-called abortion compromise does not stop there. The Reid bill \ncreates a State opt-out charade. However, this provision does nothing \nabout one state's tax dollars from paying for abortions in other \nstates. Tax dollars from Nebraska can pay for abortions in California \nor New York. This bill also creates a new public option run by the \nOffice of Personnel Management, OPM, that will, for the first time, \ncreate a federally funded and managed plan that will cover elective \nabortions.\n  When you have Senator Boxer and Speaker Pelosi, two of the largest \npro-choice advocates in the Congress, supporting this sham so-called \ncompromise and everyone from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to \nthe National Right to Life Committee and the Family Research Council \nopposing it, there is only one clear loser--the majority of Americans \nwho believe in the sanctity of life and oppose the use of federal \ndollars for elective abortions.\n  Last but not least, I would like to spend a couple of minutes to talk \nabout the numerous special deals conferred on States in this $2.5 \ntrillion spending bill. How hefty are the pricetags for decisions of \nconscience? Here are some highlights: $300 million for Louisiana; $600 \nmillion for Vermont; $500 million for Massachusetts; $100 million for \nNebraska.\n  At a recent news conference, when the authors of this legislation \nwere asked about the Nebraska earmark for Medicaid funding, the \nmajority leader simply replied, ``A number of states are treated \ndifferently than other states. That's what legislation is all about. \nThat's compromise.''\n  The next logical question is pretty straightforward--Who will pay for \nthese special deals? The answer is simple. Every other State in the \nUnion, including Utah, who are collectively facing $200 billion in \ndeficits and are cutting jobs and educational services to survive, will \nnow pay to support these special deals.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicaid expansion \nin the Reid bill creates a $26 billion unfunded mandate on our cash-\nstrapped States. Coincidentally, only one state avoids this unfunded \nmandate--Nebraska.\n  Of course, let us not forget about the biggest loser in this bill--\nthe hard-working American taxpayer. This bill imposes over a $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion worth of new taxes, fees, and penalties on individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses. The new fees begin in 2010, while the major \ncoverage provisions do not start until 2014. Almost $57 billion in new \ntaxes are collected before any American sees the major benefits of this \nbill, which are largely delayed until 2014. It is also no coincidence \nthat through the use of these budget gimmicks the majority can claim \nthis bill reduces our national deficit when we all know these \nreductions will never be realized.\n  Based on data from the Joint Committee on Taxation--the nonpartisan \ncongressional scorekeeper--this bill would break another one of \nPresident Obama's campaign promises by increasing taxes on 42 million \nindividuals and families making less than $250,000 a year.\n  At a time, when we are struggling to fight a double-digit \nunemployment rate, the Reid bill not only increases payroll taxes by \nnearly $87 billion but also imposes $28 billion in new taxes on \nemployers that do not provide government-approved health plans. These \nnew taxes will ultimately be paid by American workers in the form of \nreduced wages and lost jobs.\n  However, it is hard to say we didn't see these new taxes coming. For \nyears now, many of us have warned that the out-of-control spending in \nWashington will eventually have to be repaid on the backs of American \nfamilies. In this bill, the repayment comes in the form of stifled \neconomic growth, lost jobs, and new and increasing taxes--and they are \njust the first installment of what will be a long and painful extortion \nof taxpayers if Congress doesn't stand up and stop these terrible \nbills.\n  According to a recent study of similar proposals by the Heritage \nFoundation, these new job-killing taxes will place approximately 5.2 \nmillion low income workers at risk of losing their jobs or having their \nhours reduced and an additional 10.2 million workers could see lower \nwages and reduced benefits.\n  Poll after poll tells us about the growing opposition against this \ntax-and-spend health care bill. The latest Rasmussen poll shows that 55 \npercent of Americans are now opposed to this bill. The CNN poll has it \neven higher at 61 percent. Among senior citizens, the group most likely \nto use the health care system, only 33 percent are in favor while 60 \npercent are opposed. Independent voters are also opposed almost 2 to 1. \nOpposition in certain state polls, like Nebraska, is even higher at 67 \npercent.\n  So what is the majority doing to address these concerns? Nothing. In \nfact, despite the efforts by many of us here on this side of the aisle \nto express our substantive policy disagreements for months, one Senator \nrecently said the following: ``They are desperate to break this \npresident. They have ardent supporters who are nearly hysterical at the \nvery election of President Barack Obama. The birthers, the fanatics, \nthe people running around in right-wing militia and Aryan support \ngroups, it is unbearable to them that President Barack Obama should \nexist.''\n  This statement is outrageous. Instead of listening to the policy \nconcerns of a majority of Americans, the other side is simply \ndismissing them as rants from the far right. If the majority refuses to \nlisten to what Americans are telling them now--I am sure they will have \na rude wake-up call waiting for them later. It should come as no \nsurprise to anyone that this kind of arrogance of power has led to \ncongressional approval ratings rivaling the most hated institutions on \nthe planet at a dismal 22 percent and falling.\n  One of the biggest tragedies of letting this bill move forward is \nthat it will do nothing to address the fundamental issue of rising \nhealth care costs in this country. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this bill will actually raise our national health care \ncosts by $200 billion. The administration's own actuary at the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, agrees with this assessment. \nWhen this bill fails to work, Americans will no longer have any faith \nin Congress to effectively address the issue of health care reform. The \nopportunity to save Medicare and Medicaid from their impending \nfinancial collapse will be lost for another generation.\n  The historic blizzard in Washington earlier this month was a perfect \nsymbol of the anger and frustration brewing in the hearts of the \nAmerican people against this bill. I urge the majority once again to \nlisten to the voices of the American people. Every vote for this bill \nis the 60th vote. Let me repeat that again--every vote for this bill is \nthe 60th vote. My Republican colleagues and I are united with the \nAmerican people in our fight against this $2.5 trillion tax-and-spend \nbill. I implore my colleagues not to do this to the American people. \nDon't foreclose on their futures. Don't stick them with even more \ngovernment spending and government intrusion.\n  We can fix health care. Many of us have been working to do just that \nfor many years. A truly bipartisan bill that would garner 75 to 80 \nvotes in the Senate, would be fiscally sound and provide the American \npeople with the fixes they are asking for in the health care \nmarketplace is easily achievable. Many of us are standing at the ready, \nand have been for months, to step forward and pass meaningful health \ncare reform that truly would help American families and please American \ntaxpayers. To date, we have been rebuffed by an unfailing determination \nby a few to pursue a nearly Socialist agenda. I would ask my colleagues \non the other\n\n[[Page S13860]]\n\nside of the aisle who do not believe in the Europeanization of America, \nwho believe in doing truly bipartisan work here in the Senate, to step \nforward, vote against advancing this bill and work with those of us on \nthis side of the aisle who are committed to making a difference to \ncraft a health care reform bill they can be proud to support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is truly my honor to be here on this \nhistoric evening and speak in support of the bill which we will vote on \nearly tomorrow morning, Christmas Eve morning. It is an honor because \nanyone who looks at this country knows the problems we have, and that \ntwo problems caused by the health care system are at the top of the \nlist. One represents a more conservative point of view and one \nrepresents a more liberal point of view. But I am proud to say the bill \nwe will pass tomorrow morning, God willing, deals with both.\n  The more conservative issue is controlling costs. The health care \nsystem costs this country a whole lot of money. By and large, we get \ngood health care--not everybody but most people. But it is so \nexpensive, and that has been documented.\n  What does that mean? It means small businesses cannot grow and \nactually have less money to pay for wages. It means our large \nbusinesses are less competitive globally. We have seen that in the auto \nindustry. It means individuals often have to pay a fortune for health \ncare. It means our government runs deficits that are perilous to the \neconomy. Health care costs are more the cause of our deficits than \nanything else.\n  On the other hand, we run a real problem because many people are not \ncovered or covered adequately. The heartwrenching stories told by our \nfine leader--and I cannot give him enough kudos for the job he has done \nhere; and I will talk about that in a minute--but the people who are \nnot covered or covered poorly suffer in many ways. They become not only \nless happy citizens--that is most important--but less productive \ncitizens. The heartwrenching stories of people who do not have coverage \nfor them or their children we all know about. It also, by the way, \nincreases costs because when people delay coverage, when they are ill, \nit inevitably costs more.\n  This bill addresses both. I wish to, in my brief amount of time \nhere--and I do not know how much time I have--address both. I wish to \ntalk on the cost side first.\n  Why do health care costs go up so much more than any other product? \nTwo main reasons. First, we do not have perfect knowledge, as the \neconomists would say. We basically do not know what we are buying. When \nwe go to the doctor, and the doctor says: You need this test, we do not \nknow if we need it. Is the doctor genuinely prescribing a test we need \nor is there some element that he makes enough money on this test that \nwhy not? can't hurt because we do not need it?\n  In my family, my relatives have all had prostate cancer, and I watch \nvery carefully. But when I go to the doctor and he says I need this \nkind of a test or this kind of a scan, I say: Of course. If it were a \ncar or a house, I might investigate to see if I needed it.\n  The second reason costs are so expensive is because fundamentally \nhealth care deals with God's most precious gift to us, which is life. \nWho would not beg, borrow, or steal to find $100,000--who would not \ngive their right arm if we were told our husband, our wife, our mother, \nour farther, our son, or our daughter was ill and $100,000 would give \nthem a 25-percent greater chance of living better, of healing? We would \ndo it. But because most of us do not have that $100,000, we buy \ninsurance. That is the reason there is health care insurance. It is not \nbecause it is health care; it is because it is so vital and so \nexpensive. So we are willing to pay $5,000 a year, so that, God forbid, \nif that time comes when we need that $100,000 to cover a loved one, it \nis there because we have insurance.\n  So when I go to the doctor and he says I need this special test, \nspecial scan, special procedure, not only do I not know whether I need \nit--because the training is difficult; and you can go online, but you \ncannot really figure these things out--but, second, I am not paying for \nit. You put those things together, and the costs go through the roof. \nWe have tried in this bill to finally get a handle on the costs. Most \nother countries have. In America, we haven't. We must. I believe very \ndeeply in covering everybody, but unless we get a handle on the costs, \nwe will not be able to afford to cover everybody. Even if we cover them \ntoday, we will run out of money in 5 years. We do it in four ways, and \nI am going to be very brief about them because my time is somewhat \nlimited.\n\n  First, we deal with efficiencies. There is one form. If there is IT, \nas we put in the stimulus bill--information technology--we can save \nhundreds of billions of dollars. Just one form. You go to a doctor's \noffice, there is a nurse, a doctor, and there are four people filling \nout forms. If you had one form, you wouldn't need that.\n  Second, prevention. Early intervention and prevention saves billions, \nand in this bill that is what we encourage, early intervention and \nprevention. Right now, amazingly enough, if you get diabetes in the \nlater stages, Medicare or private insurance will pay for dialysis. God \nforbid someone needs a leg amputation, one of those serious retina \noperations, they pay. They don't pay for the early stages. They don't \npay for the nutrition therapy, the exercise therapy that could arrest \ndiabetes in the early stages. We do that.\n  The third thing we try to do in this bill is provide competition in \nthe insurance industry, and we do provide competition in the exchanges. \nWe do put some limits on the insurance companies with the medical loss \nratio provisions that Senator Rockefeller, Senator Franken, and Senator \nNelson helped craft. If we could have had a public option, it would \nhave created more competition. That is one of my great regrets, that we \ndon't. I worked hard for it, but we don't. Nonetheless, we still get \nsome limitation on insurance companies and create more competition.\n  The fourth is the hardest: fee for service. The fee-for-service \nsystem is what drives up the costs. This bill, more than any other \nprovision ever passed in America, begins to grapple with that most \ndifficult issue.\n  You do those four things, and you will bring costs down.\n  It is no wonder that CBO has said that in the first 10 years, we save \n$127 billion, even though we are covering 31 million more people, and \nin the second decade, we are going to save over $1 trillion. I forget \nthe number. I think it is $1.3 trillion. We are doing whoever becomes \nPresident in 2020 a huge favor because with the cost-control provisions \nin this bill, should they become law, we will get a great handle on \ncosts. It will take a while, but it will do the job. On the other side, \nwe don't cover everybody, but 94 percent of all people will be covered, \nso it is an amazing feat to both cover many more people and reduce \ncosts, and that is what this bill does.\n  I wish to say, for my home State of New York, there are lots of good \nthings in this bill. We have 800,000 seniors who would be cut from \nMedicare who will not be because of provisions we were able to get in \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Graduate medical education, intermediate medical education--a \nlifeblood for jobs in New York because training doctors is probably our \nsecond biggest industry in New York City--is not cut even though it was \nproposed to be cut. Money for neighborhood national health services and \ncommunity health centers will provide physicians in inner cities and in \nrural areas where they don't have health care. They will get really \ngood health care.\n  This bill is far from perfect. Had I written it, I would have written \nit a different way. Had Senator Cantwell or Senator Casey or Senator \nKlobuchar written it, they would have written it differently from me. \nBut if every one of us in this Senate insisted that the bill had to be \nwritten exactly our way, we would have 100 bills, each with 1 vote, and \nno progress. So great progress has been made, and this is a proud \nmoment.\n  There are many people I wish to thank.\n  My staff--I do want to mention Meghan Taira, Katie Beirne, and all of \nthe others who worked so hard; Jeff Hamond, who worked so hard and so \ndiligently on this bill.\n  I thank Max Baucus. He soldiered on and on when things looked bleak \nand\n\n[[Page S13861]]\n\npursued his dream of a bipartisan bill, which would have been a better \nproduct. It wasn't to be but not because of lack of his efforts.\n  Thanks go to Senator Dodd and Senator Harkin on the HELP Committee \nand my colleagues on the Finance Committee, but at the top of the list \nis just one person, and I was proud to be one of his lieutenants on \nthis, and that is Harry Reid. I was up close. What an amazing job that \nman did, modestly, without complaining, without looking to what was \ngood for him. He had a mission, a job: get us 60 votes on this very \ndifficult, complicated proposal. And he did it. He will never get the \ncredit he deserves because he is such a modest man, but I wanted to \nshare that with my colleagues and with the country as I am sure others \nhave done before.\n  So this bill is a very good bill on both sides of the ledger. It will \nreduce costs rather significantly and in a smart way, without hurting \npatient care. It gets rid of the fraud and the waste and the abuse and \nduplication. At the same time, it will cover many more people.\n  This is a very fine day for this country, this Senate, and Leader \nReid. Tomorrow morning, I will be very proud to vote for this piece of \nlegislation, certainly one of the most important I have ever voted on \nin my 35 years as a legislator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to be out on the floor \ntonight with my colleagues.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his comments and his work in \nthe Finance Committee. He literally did work night and day in that \ncommittee and then worked with Leader Reid on trying to get consensus \nwithin our caucus on this legislation. So I appreciate his strong, \nactive support in making reform.\n  I, too, wish to add my congratulations tonight because we are here to \ntalk about controlling health care costs and what we are going to do to \nhelp the American people. I too wish to thank my colleagues, Senator \nBaucus and Senator Reid, for their active leadership, as well as \nSenator Dodd and Senator Harkin.\n  I add my thanks to the whole Finance Committee staff. I don't think \npeople realize they have worked from January until December, many \nweekends as well as during the week, many late nights as well as early \nmornings, and they deserve a lot of credit for the details behind this \nlegislation and making sure the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed.\n  I wish to thank my staff, all of my staff but in particular Mark \nIozzi, who worked on this legislation, as did the rest of the Finance \nCommittee members of the staff, for about the last 11\\1/2\\ months. I \nwas glad to send him off on a plane today to reach his family, and \nhopefully he will be watching the vote tomorrow morning by television. \nIt should be a proud moment for him.\n  I also wish to add a particular thanks to President Obama. I wish to \nsay to the President that he started this year with the dedication that \nthis was going to be a year where we got health care reform. He stated \nthat at the beginning of his Presidency and held steady to that during \nthe very raucous debate that happened in the early months regarding the \nbudget and whether we would have the money to do health care reform. He \nremained committed as we went home over the summer and many things \nhappened at town meetings. He came back and was determined that we \nwould forge ahead. He, as we got legislation out of the Finance \nCommittee and had to combine bills, remained active and intent about \nthis legislation.\n  It reminds me of a saying my father used to make to me because he was \na Navy man and always came up with nautical terms to kind of describe \nthe direction in which he would want his children to go. The \nPresident's actions on health care policy for this year remind me of \nthe saying ``steady as she goes'' because that is what the President \nhas done for the last many months--steady as she goes so that we can \nget health care reform.\n  So I wish to add my thanks and congratulations to him and to his \nadministration and to the many members of that administration who were \ndown here on the Hill, including Mr. Messina, who made many frequent \nvisits, I think, to Members to talk about some of the details.\n  I am glad I am following my colleague from Idaho, from the Northwest, \nwho spoke earlier, because I think it shows you can be from the same \nregion of the country and have the very same interests but look at this \nlegislation differently--not that I don't share some of his concerns, \nand I am going to fight to make changes and add to the legislation as \nit continues to move into conference and in the years after its \nimplementation. I think the Senator has brought up some good points \nthat we need to follow up on.\n\n  Controlling health care costs in general is what is driving us to \ntake action tomorrow morning on Christmas Eve. We know we have already \nseen a 120-percent increase in insurance premiums for the last 10 \nyears; that is, from 1999 to 2009, we have seen a 120-percent increase \nfor Americans and their premium costs. That is something the American \npeople can't afford. And when my colleague from Idaho talks about the \nincrease we are going to see in the next 10 years, he is right. \nInsurance premiums are going to go up again. This debate is about what \nwe are going to do to try to control those costs, whether this \nlegislation we are discussing today will have an impact in reducing \nthose costs so that maybe premiums aren't going to go up another 120 \npercent in the next 10 years and make insurance even more unaffordable \nfor the American people.\n  We know there are organizations that have done multiple studies. We \nknow there is at least $700 billion in waste each year in our health \ncare system. That is according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \nWe know that is the kind of money that, if we are smarter about our \nhealth care choices, we can reduce the costs of health care and improve \nthe system.\n  Part of this is reforming Medicare and the cost of Medicare because \nMedicare dollars are one in every five health care dollars today. The \nmore expensive Medicare is, the end result is the more expensive \ninsurance is in general. So it is very important for us to reform the \nMedicare system, to have provider reform, which this legislation has, \nand to change the system.\n  But we also have to deal with the cost of the uninsured because we \nknow that Americans right now who don't have insurance and who go to \nthe emergency room are adding something like $43 billion a year in \nhigher premium costs. That is $1,000 for each family in their premium \nincreases.\n  I know we can do nothing and have these same costs on the backs of \nthe American people or we can try to change the system, as we are with \nthis legislation, to improve the quality of care and access and to \nlower the costs for Americans. That is why one of the main reforms I \nfought for in this legislation was about paying for value, not for \nvolume; that is, to change the fee-for-service system that rewards \nphysicians for how many procedures they do or how many patients they \nhave seen a day but not for the value of the system. So I know that \nbecause of the change we have in this legislation, we are going to \nreward physicians, starting several years from now--something that has \nworked in my State and many States in the Pacific Northwest that are \nmore efficient at lowering the costs--by increasing efficiency and \nthereby rewarding those States with better Medicare payments.\n  What it actually means for individuals is that they are going to get \nshorter waiting times, they are going to get better access to doctors, \nthey are going to get more coordinated care, and they are going to get \nbetter outcomes. Why? Because that is what we are going to incent in \nthese reforms. That is the kind of system that is working in many parts \nof the country that are cost-effective, that yield better results for \nindividual patients at lower cost.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, \nbecause it was her legislation that she introduced early this year that \nreally catalyzed this effort to focus on many of the things done at the \nMayo Clinic and things that had been done in Minnesota and things we \nhad done in Washington State that said: Let's change this process and \nsave dollars for everybody in America by getting off the fee-for-\nservice systems and going to a system that will be more cost-effective. \nSo I wish to thank her and her\n\n[[Page S13862]]\n\nState for that leadership and to thank those in my State who have \nperformed the same way on efficiency to deliver this kind of health \ncare reform.\n  A second cost control of this legislation that I supported that I \nthink will do well for many people in this country is in the area of \nlong-term care reform.\n  Some people may know that my colleague, Senator Harkin, was on the \nfloor and was talking about long-term care in the insurance sector, but \npart of what we are doing in this bill is also to incent States to move \noff of nursing home care and on to community-based care.\n  Home care juxtaposed to nursing home care is 70 percent cheaper and \nbetter meets the needs of individuals. I say that because my State \nimplemented this policy to focus on long-term, community-based care \ndecades ago. The end result is that kind of care has been more cost-\neffective, less expensive, personalized care, and individuals get to \nstay in their communities.\n  I do not know any senior in America who would choose to go to a \nnursing home over staying in their home or in their community. But they \nhave had very little choice up until now on this legislation to be able \nto do that because we continue to incentivize nursing home care.\n  There are some who need nursing home care because they need a higher \nlevel of delivery of care, and those people will still go to those \nfacilities. But we will save a lot in our Federal budget, as we look at \nour Medicare and Medicaid budgets, for the future if we simply take \nthis one action. This bill alone would be worth passing just for this \none provision because of how much money it is going to save the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Basic Health Plan. Many of my colleagues may have heard me talk \nabout the Basic Health Plan as a basis of this legislation that we \nadded in this country. Many people across the country may not \nunderstand the Basic Health Plan because they do not have something \nsimilar to the Basic Health Plan in their States.\n  Nearly 20 years ago, the Washington State Legislature passed the \nBasic Health Plan because it allowed States to negotiate for lower \nrates. Essentially, it is a public-private partnership. Some people \ncall it a public option. Some people call it a public plan. I call it \ncost-effective health care delivery. It is cost-effective because we \nhave proven for 20 years that we get 35 to 40 percent lower rates for \nindividuals by grouping into this kind of plan and having the State \nnegotiate the rates. We have been able to have that plan now for 20 \nyears.\n  This provision of allowing States to do something similar to the \nBasic Health Plan is a provision we added in the Finance Committee that \nnow will allow every State in America to take money they would get \ninstead for tax credits and use that money in the delivery of \nnegotiated rates for their States. This will allow 70 percent of the \nuninsured to have full coverage.\n  What does that mean from a cost-effective perspective? Let's take an \nexample. If this legislation is not passed and we have the current \nsystem in America, an individual in 2016 trying to get access to the \nindividual market would have to pay over $5,850, and the individual \nwould pay everything. The government would be paying nothing; that is, \nif this bill does not pass. That is what would happen.\n  Let's look at what will happen if, in fact, this bill does pass. You \nwill have the option of going into the exchange. The estimates are by \nCBO that you will be able to reduce from where we normally would be, \nabout 11 percent, the cost of health care. In that exchange, an \nindividual who would be covered at 200 percent of poverty would end up \npaying $1,200, and the Federal Government would end up paying $4,000. \nAlready somebody is coming out ahead. They say that sounds good. That \nsounds like a better deal than me being able to afford this current \nrate. That would be $5,850. It means I would be uninsured.\n  The Basic Health Plan has been in operation for 20 years, driving \ndown costs through negotiated rates, as I said, by 35 and 40 percent, \nand it is a far different picture for the individual.\n  In our State, the individual only pays $400--$400--versus $1,200. \nLook at the government. The government rate adds to that, $3,700, but \nit is cheaper. Why? Because the State has negotiated with insurers and \ndriven down the cost. That is what is missing in the exchange.\n  While some of my colleagues, I know, think the exchange is going to \ndeliver great clout through the Office of Personnel Management, I hope \nthey are right. I am anxious to see the results of that. But I am \nunapologetic about the fact that I know the State of Washington has \ndelivered these kinds of savings through negotiated rates and that many \nStates in our country have been the most cost-effective tools for \ndelivering new and efficient health care models, while we at the \nFederal level still struggle to try to drive those policies.\n  I know this legislation has cost controls. I know my colleague from \nIdaho is very concerned about this, and he is right to be concerned. We \nwill be judged by how much we are going to drive down the costs. But \nthe American people should understand that rates are going to go up \nanother 120 percent in the next 10 years if we do nothing. So this \nlegislation is about bending the cost curve. It is about looking at the \nprojected growth, looking at general inflation, and trying to drive \nhealth care costs somewhere below what they would be on an annual \nbasis. That is our objective.\n  We are going to have a challenge in monitoring this legislation, but \nthat is why I am going to fight and cheerlead for the Basic Health Plan \nand hope that every State in the country takes the option of delivering \nhealth care through that kind of negotiated public plan that will allow \nthem to drive down insurance costs.\n  I hope we can expand the Basic Health Plan in conference to an even \nmore robust plan that would cover more people. It does not make sense \nto me to continue to subsidize expensive insurance by giving Federal \ntax credits when I know the bill to the Federal Government and to the \nindividual taxpayer can be cheaper by implementing negotiated rates.\n  While we have not been able to fully implement that at the Federal \nlevel, let's not hold States back. Let States do what they have done \nbest for the last several decades; that is, innovate--innovate more \nquickly, more effectively, not without a Federal partnership but in a \npartnership with the Federal Government and in a partnership with a \npublic-private mechanism that I think has been cost-effective for the \nlast 20 years.\n  Tomorrow, I will be voting in support of this legislation because I \nbelieve in the innovation this legislation enables. I know when we \npassed the Basic Health Plan in the mid eighties people said the same \nthing. There were concerns about whether we were going to be able to \nimplement the cost-effectiveness. In fact, at that time, it was said \nthat some stakeholders believed it would be an entitlement. Others saw \nit as essentially a cost-containment measure that would reduce \nuncompensated care. Some others thought it would demonstrate the \nviability of government-subsidized health care. Advocates wanted to \nimplement something quickly so they could develop constituencies.\n  All these things are similar arguments to what we are hearing today \nand what this debate has been about. But I know that what happened \nafter 20 years of us putting a plan in place is that hundreds of \nthousands of Washingtonians got more affordable health care. It has \nbeen a plan that has worked effectively. No one has tried to dismantle \nthe program from a political perspective. I think working together with \nthe Federal Government we can show more cost containment for the \nAmerican public.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to speak for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor in support of the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is an honor to follow my \nfriend from Washington, Senator Cantwell, who has been such a leader on \nthe Finance Committee in focusing on the very issue that is key in my \nState; that is, cost reform, delivery system reform, because for too \nlong the people in cost-efficient States, such as Minnesota,\n\n[[Page S13863]]\n\nWashington, and Wisconsin, have been seeing other States not quite \noffering that kind of quality care we would like to see all over the \ncountry.\n  I think it always shocks people. If you go to a hotel and you say you \nwant to get a room, usually if you spend more money you have a bigger \nroom and you have a better view. That is not true with health care.\n  Time and again, we see studies across this country--academic, \nbipartisan studies--showing, in fact, some of the highest quality \nhealth care comes with some of the lowest costs.\n  As the Senator from Washington talked about how we can save that $700 \nbillion year that is wasted in our system, a lot of it comes not at the \ncost of care but actually at getting better care, because if you reduce \nunnecessary waste, if you stop having people running around to 20 \ndifferent specialists who are giving them conflicting advice and not \nconferring and not knowing about the medications they are taking, when \nyou have those disorganized systems, they not only cost too much money \nfor everyone, they also give worse care. That is why the Mayo model, an \nintegrated care model with one primary care doctor working with a team \nof specialists is a model we would like to see all across this country.\n\n  We cannot simply keep pushing our problems to another day. Rising \nhealth care costs are unsustainable, busting the budget of families and \nbusinesses alike. If we do not act, these costs are going to break the \nbacks of the American people.\n  This country spends $2.4 trillion on health care alone. That is $1 \nout of every $6 in the American economy. It is projected to be 20 \npercent of our whole economy in 2020 if we do not act. Despite spending \n1\\1/2\\ times more per person on health care than any other country, we \nall know there are many problems in our health care system.\n  Wages simply do not keep pace with premiums. Peoples' wages have been \nstagnant or maybe gone up a little, gone down some or they lost their \njobs, but health care costs continue to skyrocket.\n  I always tell the people in my State there are three numbers we need \nto remember--6, 12, and 24. Ten years ago, the average American family \nwas spending $6,000 a year on their health care. Now they are spending \n$12,000, with many people spending a lot more. What will they be \nspending in 10 years if we do not act? Mr. President, $24,000, up to \n$36,000 a year on their health care premiums.\n  When I go around my State, I hear these stories all the time. Granite \nGear, a little backpack company up in Two Harbors, MN, makes backpacks \nfor our soldiers. They have done well. They built their business. The \nguy in charge of it said he would not have started that business if he \nknew then what he knows now; that is, for his family of four, a small \nlittle business in Two Harbors, MN, he is spending $24,000 a year on \nhis health care.\n  I have heard from doctors at Gunderson Lutheran in La Crescent, MN. \nThey told me the story of how at one of their hospitals in their region \nthey had three patients in a 1-month period come into the emergency \nroom with severe stomach problems. They had ruptured appendixes. Do you \nknow what they said as to why it got to that point? For two of them, \nthey worked at small businesses and they were afraid it was going to \nblow up the premiums for health care coverage for that little company. \nThe third one could not afford the copays. They waited and waited and \nwaited. They got a doctor and that doctor was the emergency room, some \nof the most expensive care in this country.\n  I heard from a mom in Bemidji, MN, who has a daughter named Micki. \nThe mom's name is Sheryl. She wrote me a letter. She said:\n\n       I just got off the phone with my daughter Micki. At first, \n     I couldn't understand her because she was sobbing so hard. \n     Her husband had just been told by his boss that they wouldn't \n     be carrying health insurance on their employees any longer. \n     They are a small company and it was costing them $13,000 a \n     month. For her, this is a matter of life and death. She has \n     cystic fibrosis. Her medications can run anywhere from $7,000 \n     to $13,000 a month. Because it is a preexisting condition, \n     the insurance companies won't touch her unless it is under a \n     group plan like the one her husband just lost.\n\n  She went on to say in her letter:\n\n       You need to stand and be my voice, be Micki's voice. Micki \n     is a fighter but she can't keep fighting a system that is so \n     against her. Micki has already lived longer than any of her \n     doctors expected. We need you to be her voice.\n\n  That is why this bill is so important. The status quo is simply not \nsustainable, not for families, not for small businesses, not for big \nbusinesses that are trying to compete internationally against other \ncompanies and countries that have more efficient health care systems.\n  Despite claims from my friends on the other side of the aisle, we \nhave spent months debating this issue. The C-SPAN viewers know what I \nam talking about. If you look at the input the Republicans have had on \nthis bill, you can see that over 160 amendments were accepted in the \nHELP Committee. Dozens of bipartisan meetings and roundtable \ndiscussions were held in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  They have engaged across this country--so many people, sadly--in a \ncampaign of misinformation. I know a lot of people in Minnesota and \nacross the country are left trying to wade through all the ads, \nmisinformation, and scare tactics to find out what this bill is about. \nWell, this bill is not perfect, as so many of my colleagues have said. \nWe will work to make changes and work forward. I would like to see more \ncost reform in this bill. But what we do with this bill is a beginning \nnot an end. We work to reduce cost, we work to expand coverage and \nincrease choice and competition for American consumers.\n  First, and very important to me and to my mother--who is 82 years \nold--this bill protects Medicare and our seniors. Medicare is one of \nthe most valued social programs our country has produced in the last \nhalf century. Yet it is also a program in dire need of reform if it is \nto survive on sound financial footing and continue to provide the fine \nmedical care our seniors have come to expect.\n  By 2011, the first baby boomers will enter the Medicare system. \nWithout action, if we sit and put our heads in the sand, it will go in \nthe red by 2017. So think of people such as my mom--82 years old. She \nwants to live well into her 90s and beyond. Think of people who are 55 \nand who want to be on Medicare when they are 65. It is going to go in \nthe red by 2017 if we don't do something to make sure it is on strong \nfinancial footing.\n  With this bill, we start to do that. We extend Medicare solvency by \n10 years. I am encouraged that my legislation can create a value index, \nwhich the Senator from Washington discussed, as part of the formula \nthat is used to determine Medicare's fee schedule. That was included in \nthe Senate's bill. This indexing will help reduce unnecessary \nprocedures because those who produce more volume will also need to \nimprove care or the increased volume will negatively impact fees. \nDoctors will have a financial incentive to maximize the quality and the \nvalue of their services instead of just the quantity.\n  My favorite story along these lines is not from Minnesota but from \nGeisinger, PA. They were trying to figure out: How do we best treat \ndiabetes. We are not happy with the results. They realized with the \nroutine cases, those were the people they wanted someone to see more \noften, to check in on them. So they had them assigned to nurses and the \nmore difficult cases to the endocrinologists. The endocrinologists \nwould review the nurses' work and make sure there was proper followup \nif there had to be adjustments. At the end of year, they had much \nhappier patients. The quality of care went way up, and they saved $200 \nper month per patient.\n  What does our system in America do now? What does the Medicare system \ndo? It punishes them for that good work. So that is what we are talking \nabout, actually getting that higher quality. You can save money if you \nhave the right incentives in place.\n  With this legislation, we also stop paying for care that doesn't \nresult in quality patient outcomes. Who wants to go into the hospital \nto be treated and get sick from something else during that \nhospitalization? When you have to go back again, that is called a \nhospital readmission. In 1 year, hospital readmissions cost Medicare \n$17.4 billion. A 2007 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission found\n\n[[Page S13864]]\n\nMedicare paid an average of $7,200 per readmission that was likely \npreventable. This practice must stop. This isn't good care for \npatients, and it is not a good investment for taxpayers.\n  The bill also establishes an independent, 15-member Medicare \nCommission tasked with presenting Congress with comprehensive proposals \nto reduce health care costs and improve quality of care for Medicare \nbenefits. The current Medicare payment policies are not working well \nfor patients, doctors, and hospitals. We have to control costs and we \nhave to get that high-quality care we see in Minnesota throughout the \ncountry.\n  In this bill, we also work to stop fraud and abuse. Law enforcement \nauthorities estimate that Medicare fraud costs taxpayers more than $60 \nbillion every year--$60 billion going to con men, $60 billion going to \nstorefronts that say they are a doctor's office, when all that is \nbehind it is a bunch of fraudsters and rip-off artists who are getting \nchecks meant to go to providers of care to our seniors--$60 billion a \nyear. Finally, we have a bill that puts the tools in place--enhanced \ncriminal penalties--that allows for direct deposit of those payments \nfrom the government to those providers, so we don't have people ripping \nus off with an antiquated system of bad and false checks. With this \nchange, we put a stop to criminals running phony businesses to steal \nMedicare checks from our seniors.\n  We are also working to help our seniors with the cost of their \nprescription drugs. Millions of Americans depend on prescription drugs \nto help them manage chronic disease or other illnesses. But drug prices \ncontinue to skyrocket. That is why I voted for reimportation, to allow \nthese safe drugs to come in from places such as Canada. We are not \nafraid of getting our medications from Canada. Canadians come to shop \nand to vacation and to fish in Minnesota, and we go to Canada to shop \nand to work and to fish. We don't have a problem with their drugs. \nSadly, that proposal did not pass the Senate, but I will continue to \nadvocate for that.\n  What does this bill do so far? What it does is to help fill that \ndoughnut hole, that point where seniors who had been getting help with \npaying for their prescription drugs stop getting that help. That \ndoughnut hole is now filled.\n  This legislation provides relief for our small businesses. Right now, \nsmall businesses pay 20 percent more than large businesses for the cost \nof care. In a recent national survey, nearly three-quarters of small \nbusinesses that did not offer benefits cited high premiums as a reason. \nBeginning in 2011, with this legislation, small businesses will be \neligible for tax credits worth up to 35 percent of their contribution \nto their employees' health insurance plans. In 2014, these tax credits \nwill even increase more.\n  This legislation, as we all know, also creates insurance exchanges \nknown as small business health option programs--or SHOP programs--where \nsmall businesses can finally pool their numbers and do what big \nbusinesses do--negotiate for better rates for their insurance.\n  Beginning with the passage of this bill--and this is one of my \nfavorite parts--kids can't be denied coverage due to preexisting \nconditions. So if your son or daughter gets sick, an insurance company \ncan't look at you and say: I am sorry your kid got sick, you don't have \nany insurance.\n  Look at the story I just read with Micki, the woman whose husband \nlost her insurance. She has cystic fibrosis, and she is not sure if she \nis going to be able to get insurance. This puts an end to that and for \nkids it does it the minute the bill gets signed into law.\n  Insurance companies will be barred from limiting the total benefits \nAmericans can use over the course of a year or over their lifetime. \nAffordable insurance coverage options will also be made immediately \navailable through a high-risk pool for Americans who have been \nuninsured and have been denied coverage because they have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  With this bill, insurance companies immediately must fully cover \nregular checkups and tests that help prevent illness, such as \nmammograms or eye and foot exams for diabetics.\n  In addition, children would continue to be eligible for family \ncoverage through the age of 26.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, is here. Maybe he has \nfour children who will soon be 26. I know many people are glad this \nbill has contained in it a provision that says you can keep your kids \non your insurance until they are 26.\n  We know this bill isn't perfect, no big piece of legislation ever is. \nThere is still work that needs to be done in conference committee. \nThere are still negotiations that will take place. There are still \nthings that need to be fixed. We know this is only the beginning of \nreform, not the end, but we must keep looking to the future. For too \nlong, health care costs have been spiraling out of control. That is why \nwe can't afford to hold off any longer on reforming health care.\n  I am going to close by reading something Vicki Kennedy--Ted Kennedy's \nwidow--wrote for the Washington Post. This is what she wrote this \nweekend:\n\n       The bill before Congress will finally deliver on the urgent \n     need of all Americans. It would make their lives better and \n     do so much good for this country. That, in the end, must be \n     the test of reform. That was always the test for Ted Kennedy. \n     He's not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through \n     our fingers. So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the \n     work of his life, the work of generations, to allow the vote \n     to go forward and to pass health-care reform now. As Ted \n     always said, ``When it's finally done, the people will wonder \n     what took so long.''\n\n  After all the work and debate that has gone into this bill over the \npast year, we are finally having the votes the American people deserve. \nTomorrow morning, Christmas Eve, will be the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Klobuchar, for the outline of the bill and the \nimportant priorities we are here to debate. This is the last night, the \nlast couple of hours, before we vote on the bill tomorrow morning, and \nI wish to do two things. One is to highlight, in very brief fashion, \nsome of the main benefits of this bill to the American people--and \nespecially to our families--and then to speak of one particular family \nfrom Pennsylvania who I will talk about in a moment.\n  By way of overview, what we tried to do in this bill, and I believe \nwe have accomplished it, is not only to meet the goals President Obama \nset forth in the early part of this year as he assumed the Presidency \nand began to make health care reform a priority, but I also believe we \nare trying to meet the goals and the objectives of the American people. \nI think we have reached that point.\n  This legislation to reform health care will, first, not only be \ndeficit neutral, but over the first 10 years of the bill it will save \n$132 billion--reduce the deficit $132 billion.\n  Something we haven't talked enough about, although we have had a lot \nof important debates, but in terms of covering those who don't have any \ncoverage today, this bill will cover 31 million Americans. We know, for \nexample, the Medicaid Program, which is more than 40 years old, covers \n61 million Americans, and Medicare covers 45 million. So in this one \npiece of legislation, not after 10 or 20 or 30 years but once it is \nfully implemented over the next couple years, it will cover 31 million \nAmericans. That will not only be beneficial to those individuals and \ntheir families, but I would argue it is good for our economy. They will \nbe more productive workers and our economy will be stronger because we \ncovered them.\n  The bill extends Medicare solvency. That is something we hear a lot \nabout. We have heard a lot of discussion about Medicare but what about \nmaking sure it is solvent. Our bill does that.\n  Prescription drugs. A lot of families have benefited from our \nprescription drug program, but then they fall into a time period where \nthey are paying the whole freight. It has been referred to as the \n``doughnut hole,'' but that doesn't capture the gravity of the problem \nfor a family and for an individual, older citizen. When they fall into \nthat so-called doughnut hole, they are in big trouble because they have \nto carry the\n\n[[Page S13865]]\n\nwhole burden. They have to pay for those prescription drugs all by \nthemselves. This bill addresses that, something that has gone \nunaddressed for a number of years.\n  The number of children in our country who are covered by the \nchildren's health insurance and other initiatives has grown, \nthankfully. We will be growing from 7 million kids covered under the \nprior legislation to 14 million under the children's health insurance. \nBut a lot of those children who don't have the benefit of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program might be caught in the preexisting \ncondition problem. Their ability to have coverage will be limited \nbecause they have a preexisting condition. What our bill does is to say \nthat upon passage of this bill, within months of the passage of this \nbill, in 2010, children will be fully protected in this sense: Any kind \nof act by an insurance company to deny them coverage because of a \npreexisting condition will be illegal in 2010.\n  We also, over a number of years, will make it illegal for an \ninsurance company to deny someone coverage due to a preexisting \ncondition for adults. For those who are discriminated against, even \nbefore the bill is implemented, we provide a high-risk pool for them.\n  We protect consumers in other ways. I was holding a copy of the first \nhalf of the bill here. Sometimes bills get real complicated, and I know \nour colleagues on the other side have complained about the size of the \nbill. But to get it right, you have to put in a lot of detail. On page \n78 of the bill, it is very clear. On page 78, the bill deals directly \nwith the preexisting condition problem. Millions of Americans have been \ndenied coverage over the last couple of years because of this one \nproblem--millions of Americans. Here is what it says, very simply, on \npage 78:\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage may not impose \n     any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such a \n     plan or coverage.\n\n  It is not long or complicated. It is one sentence--one sentence that, \nat long last, provides the kind of protection insurance companies have \nrefused to provide to adults and children, and the protection for \nchildren goes into effect within a matter of months after enactment.\n  Let me make two more points, and then I wish to talk about an \nindividual and her family. The Children's Health Insurance Program, as \nI said, has been extended. But what happened in the earlier versions of \nthe bill was the full funding of it would cut off in 2013. In the bill, \nwe now have added to that. So now the children's health insurance \nfunding will be extended 2 more years. So at least through the end of \nSeptember 2015, the Children's Health Insurance Program is fully \nfunded.\n  We need to do more than that. We will have to get to that as we move \nforward, but we have extended it 2 more years.\n  We also have done some things in this bill that didn't get a lot of \nattention.\n  When we were in the early stages of this bill way back in the summer, \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Dodd \nand I and others included provisions in the bill long before it was \namended in the original bill we put before our committee this summer.\n  For example, mandating prevention and screenings for children. No. 2, \nensuring pediatric benefits as well as pediatric input into the \nformation of benefits; vision and oral health care for children, and, \nfinally, in this section, strengthening the pediatric workforce. If we \nare going to give children the kind of expert help they have a right to \nexpect and we have a right to expect for their care, we have got to \nmake sure we have the workforce, the high-skilled work force, the \ndoctors, who are, in fact, pediatricians; so all kinds of benefits for \nour children and for our families.\n  But this isn't just a debate about policy and the provisions of the \nbill. That is, obviously, part of what we are here to do. What we are \nhere to do is meet the needs of real families in America. I have met a \nnumber of them in Pennsylvania, and every Member here, whether they are \nfor or against the bill, whether they are trying to kill the bill on \nthe other side or whether they are trying to support and pass the bill \non this side, could tell a story. Each of those Senators could tell a \nstory about many families in their State.\n  One story is to remain an inspiration for me from day one, going way \nback in February when I received a letter. This woman in Pennsylvania \nwho wrote to me remains an inspiration. Her name is Trisha Urban, from \nBerks County, PA, right near Reading and the eastern side of our State. \nShe wrote this letter. I will quote major portions of the letter. She \ntalked about herself and her husband. She said her husband had to leave \nhis job for 1 year to complete an internship requirement to complete \nhis doctorate in psychology. ``The internship was unpaid and we could \nnot afford COBRA.'' She goes on to say that because of preexisting \nconditions neither her husband's health issues nor her pregnancy--\nTrisha talked about her pregnancy in the letter--``nor my pregnancy \nwould be covered under private insurance. I worked four part-time jobs \nand was not eligible for any health benefits. We ended up with a \nsecond-rate insurance plan through my husband's university.\n  ``When medical bills started to add up, the health insurance company \ndecided to drop our coverage,'' stating that the internship didn't \nqualify us for benefits. It didn't stop there for a second. So within \nthe space of two sentences, she has highlighted at least two, if not \nthree, of the major problems we have heard so much about: the \npreexisting condition problem that I pointed to in the bill and we have \nheard about from so many others, and also dropping of coverage, \narbitrary actions by an insurance company to drop coverage when they \nbelieve it is in their best interests and not in the interests of the \nfamily.\n  Let me pick up with the letter. I am quoting here again from the \nletter from Trisha Urban:\n\n       We are left with close to $100,000 worth of medical bills. \n     Concerned with the upcoming financial responsibility of the \n     birth of our daughter and the burden of current medical \n     expenses, my husband missed his last doctor's appointment \n     less than one month ago.\n\n  Less than 1 month from February of 2009.\n  Here is her story, the tragic part of her story, in addition to all \nof the problems she had with her health insurance company and all of \nthe challenges she and her husband faced getting coverage for her \nfamily, her husband's heart condition and in her coverage, as well as \nher pregnancy, she talks about that night in early 2009 when she was \nready to deliver her daughter. She said:\n\n       My water broke the night before. We were anxiously awaiting \n     the birth of our first child. A half hour later, two \n     ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were \n     assessing the health of my baby and me the paramedic from the \n     other ambulance told me that my husband could not be revived.\n\n  Here's Trisha Urban, having lived through all of those difficulties \nwith her own insurance and her problems with insurance and worrying \nabout her pregnancy and worrying about her husband. She walks up to her \ndriveway the exact day that her baby was born and she finds her husband \ndead in the driveway.\n  The chart depicts the headline from the Reading Eagle dated February \nof this year: ``Tilden Township Woman Tends to Baby Born Hours After \nHer Husband's Death.''\n  I will cite a few facts from the story:\n\n       Just after noon, Thursday, Trisha A. Urban's husband, \n     Andrew D. Urban, died. Less than nine hours later, she gave \n     birth to their first child, Cora Catherine.\n\n  Because of that tragedy and maybe only because of that tragedy I met \nTrisha Urban months after she wrote a letter to me, and I met her \ndaughter. They came down to hear the President's speech to a joint \nsession of Congress. I held her daughter Cora. I probably never would \nhave met that beautiful child were it not for this tragedy, were it not \nfor this story.\n  I am not sure what I would do if I were in her case. I am not sure if \nI would have remained so saddened by it and so frustrated by what the \ninsurance companies did to her or didn't do for her. Anyone would \nunderstand that, if she or I or anyone else who suffers that tragedy \nwould look within themselves and suffer alone with their family. \nPatricia Urban didn't do that. She didn't just tell us about the \nproblems she had with her insurance company; she didn't just tell us \nabout the tragic death of her husband; she did more than that. She \nwrote to me.\n\n[[Page S13866]]\n\n  For those who say, well, we don't need to do anything about this \nhealth insurance problem, I would ask them to listen to Trisha Urban. \nShe said at the end of her letter:\n\n       I am a working class American and do not have the money or \n     the insight to legally fight the health insurance company. We \n     had no life insurance. I will probably lose my home, my car, \n     and everything we worked so hard to accumulate in our life \n     will be gone in an instant.\n\n  But then she says this:\n\n       If my story is heard, if legislation can be changed to help \n     other uninsured Americans in a similar situation, I am \n     willing to pay the price of losing everything. I'm asking you \n     to share my story with others in Congress and I'm willing to \n     speak on behalf of my husband so that his death will not be \n     in vain.\n\n  So says Trisha Urban in this letter. She challenged me with that \nletter, or at least I took it as a kind of challenge I wanted to \naccept. I think she challenges all of us. If Trisha Urban, who lived \nthrough all of those problems with the health insurance company, denied \ncoverage because of preexisting condition, dropped coverage, medical \nbills going through the roof, and then the ultimate tragedy, the death \nof her husband, if she can endure all that and still stand up and say, \nI am willing to pay the price of losing everything I need, I am going \nto do that to try to help pass a health care bill--if she can do that, \nthe least we can do is to do what a lot of us have tried to do over \nmany months, which is to work on this, to debate it, and to fight hard \nto pass it. So tomorrow morning in the early hours of the morning, when \nit might still be dark out, it is my hope and prayer there will be a \nlittle light in that darkness in the early morning tomorrow when we \npass this bill, and we can say that we did our best.\n\n  I know we are not done yet to get this bill out of the Senate. I know \nwe are not done yet. We can at least say we did our best, that we tried \nas best we could to be responsive to, to answer the plea for help and \nthe invocation of hope that Trisha Urban has in her letter.\n  I have remained ever inspired by her courage, by her willingness to \nspeak up, and by her willingness to be a witness not just to what has \nbeen going wrong with our system and not just giving testimony about \nher husband's death but the way Trisha Urban has been a witness to the \nhope and the promise of change that will come with this bill. I know \ntomorrow morning isn't the end of the road. But tomorrow morning is at \nleast the beginning of the end of a lot of these tragedies and a lot of \nthese stories.\n  So on Trisha's behalf as we say on behalf of so many others, we need \nto get this legislation passed tomorrow morning and to move forward in \na positive new direction in terms of what happens to our health care \nsystem.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish today to discuss the Native \nAmerican apology resolution that was recently passed as part of the \nfiscal year 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n  I believe that it is well known to most Members of this body that the \noriginal inhabitants of the lands that now constitute the United \nStates, the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of America, occupied \nand exercised sovereignty over more than 550 million acres of land \nprior to the first European contact.\n  In the early days of our history, well before our Nation was formed, \nthe native people fought alongside our soldiers in the Revolutionary \nWar. The Indian tribes enabled the survival of General George \nWashington and his troops during the harsh winter at Valley Forge by \nproviding food to the troops.\n  A few years later, as our Founding Fathers were engaged in the \nchallenge of forming a new nation, they drew upon the democratic model \nof government that they learned from the Six Nations of the Iroquois \nConfederacy. There they found the well-institutionalized practice of \nthe fundamental principles of freedom of speech and a system of \ngovernmental checks and balances provided through the separation of \ngovernmental powers.\n  In our early days as a nation, we entered into treaties with Native \nAmericans pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution that \nrecognize them as sovereigns. But later, we abandoned the path of an \nhonorable course of dealings, and turned to war. Thousands lost their \nlives through these battles and horrific massacres. The native \npopulation everywhere was decimated.\n  Forced marches to relocate the native people from their traditional \nhomelands to areas west of the Mississippi in the dead of winter cost \nthousands of more lives. Few Americans know that there was not one \nTrail of Tears--but many.\n  The treaties could have signaled a return to a course of honorable \ndealings with the native people had the United States not proceeded to \nbreak provisions in every single one of the treaties that were ratified \nby the United States Senate.\n  Amazingly, notwithstanding these appalling deeds, the native people \nof the United States have always been and continue to be staunchly \npatriotic and loyal to this country. They have volunteered to serve in \nthe defense of our Nation in every military action and war in which we \nhave been engaged and on a per capita basis, more Native Americans have \nput themselves in harm's way and given their lives to protect the \nUnited States than any other ethnic group of Americans. They have made \nthe greatest sacrifice, but their contributions do not end there.\n  We know that the native people of the United States have made \nsignificant contributions to our society in every walk of life, in \nevery profession, in medicine and agriculture and as stewards of the \nlands and resources we all hold dear. There have been great men and \nwomen who have led their native nations out of war, poverty, and \ndespair. Throughout the generations, they have shown us the true \nmeaning of courage in the face of the greatest odds, and the quiet \nstrength to persevere.\n  This provision signifies a new day, brings a message of hope, and \nprovides a foundation for the future.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Brownback for his \nleadership on this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13866-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13866-S13867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LEGISLATIVE WORK OF COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has been an extraordinary year in the \nhistory of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Thanks to the members \nand their work through 87 hearings and 33 business meetings this year \nwe have been productive. Here are some of the legislative highlights:\n  We have considered and reported to the Senate several important \nlegislative initiatives: We successfully considered and reported to the \nSenate the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act that President Obama \nsigned into law in May. We reported the important Patent Reform Act, \nwhich can help our economic recovery and lead to additional American \njobs. We reported significant cyber security legislation, including the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act.\n  We also reported the Improving Assistance to Domestic Violence \nVictims Act; Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act; the Crime \nVictims Fund Preservation Act; and the Performance Rights Act. We \nreported the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act; the PACT Act on \ncigarette smuggling; and the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics \nAct, to end anticompetitive pay-for-delay schemes in the drug industry.\n  Mindful of the end of the year deadlines, we worked hard to report \nwith bipartisan support the USA PATRIOT Act Sunset Extension Act and \nthe Satellite Television Modernization Act.\n\n[[Page S13867]]\n\n  We reported the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nReauthorization Act just last week. And after many working sessions, we \nwere finally able to report the historic Free Flow of Information Act \nto establish a qualified privilege in Federal law for journalists to \nprotect their confidential sources and the public's right to know.\n  Through the course of the year Senators on this Committee contributed \nto enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Matthew Shepard and \nJames Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act, the OPEN FOIA Act, the Human Rights Enforcement Act, the \nWebcasters Settlement Act, an extension of the EB-5 program for three \nyears, an end to the ``widow penalty'' in immigration law, the Judicial \nSurvivors Protection Act, the Reserve Officers Modernization Act, the \ncharter for the Military Officers Association of America, as well as \nlegislation to keep the Patent Office on a financial footing, and \nlegislation to clarify statutory time periods for litigation. We worked \nto include in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provisions to \nprovide needed funding to state and local law enforcement and to \nprotect privacy as we improve healthcare information technology.\n  Many of us worked for Senate passage of the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act.\n  Within the health insurance reform legislation being passed by the \nSenate this week are provisions we worked on to improve our anti-fraud \nefforts and to provide recourse for those harmed by health services.\n  I thank the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for their \ncontributions and cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13867-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13867-S13869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JUDICIAL AND EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been calling on the Republican \nleadership to end the delays and obstruction of judicial nominations \nand join with us to make progress in filling some of the many vacancies \non Federal circuit and district courts. I have done so repeatedly for \nmost of the year, and several times over this last month. Regrettably, \nas we head into the winter recess and the end of the first session of \nthe 111th Congress, Republican obstruction is setting a new low for the \nSenate in our consideration of judicial nominations.\n  The Senate has been allowed to confirm only one judicial nominee all \nmonth. It is now December 23. By this date in President Bush's first \nyear in office, the Senate with a Democratic majority confirmed 10 \nnominations just in December to reach a total of 28 confirmed Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees in the first session of the 107th \nCongress. That is 10 times as many nominations as the Senate has \nconsidered and confirmed this month. During the first year of President \nBush's tumultuous administration, with the Senate majority changing in \nthe middle of the year and Democrats then in the majority, we worked \nfrom July through December to confirm 28 judicial nominees. That was, \nof course, the year of the September 11 attacks and the anthrax attacks \nin the Senate, but we continued our work. The Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 6 judicial nominees by voice vote in December 2001, a total of \n10 judicial nominees that month, a total of 28 in the last 6 months of \nthat year, and 100 in the 17 months I served as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee during President Bush's first term.\n  By contrast, thus far this month, with 12 judicial nominees now \navailable to the Senate for final consideration, Senate Republicans \nhave only allowed a vote on Judge Jacqueline Nguyen to the Central \nDistrict of California. She was confirmed unanimously after been \ndelayed 6 weeks. They have even refused to consider the nomination of \nBeverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, despite strong \nsupport from her home state Senators, both Republicans. Instead of \nacting of her nomination, which has been awaiting final action since \nSeptember 10, and that of Judge Greenaway of New Jersey, who has been \nnominated to the Third Circuit and was reported on October 1, they \ninsist on delaying debate on that nomination for at least a month. I \nhope we will be able to turn to that nomination when the Senate returns \nin late January.\n  The refusal by the Republican minority to enter into customary time \nagreements to consider non-controversial nominees has led us to fall \nwell short of the confirmations achieved in the first years of other \nPresidents. On the eve of the end of the session, the Senate has \nconfirmed little more than one-third as many of President Obama's \ncircuit and district court nominees as it confirmed of President George \nW. Bush's--28--or of President Clinton's--27--in their first years. In \nfact, President Obama is on pace to have the fewest judicial nominees \nconfirmed by a President in his first year since President Eisenhower, \nwho only made nine nominations in 1953. Of course, all nine were \nconfirmed. The total this year stands to be the fewest confirmed in any \nPresident's first year in more than 50 years, and the fewest in any \nyear since the Republican majority confirmed only 17 in the 1996 \nsession, a Presidential election year.\n  The unprecedented obstruction we have seen by Senate Republicans on \nissue after issue--over 100 filibusters this year alone, by some \ncalculations, which have affected 70 percent of all Senate action--have \nground Senate consideration of judicial nominations to a crawl. Instead \nof time agreements and the will of the majority, the Senate is faced \nwith filibusters, and anonymous and Republican leadership holds. Those \nwho just a short time ago said that a majority vote is all that should \nbe needed to confirm a nomination, and that filibusters of nominations \nare unconstitutional, have hypocritically reversed themselves and now \nemploy any delaying tactic they can.\n  Judicial nominees have been and are available for consideration. This \nlack of Senate action is attributable to Senate Republicans and no one \nelse. The President has reached across the aisle to consult and has \nmade quality nominations. We have held the hearings, and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has favorably reported 12 judicial nominees to the \nSenate on which action has not been permitted. There are now more \njudicial nominations stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar--12--than \nthe number that have been confirmed all year. One has been ready for \nSenate consideration for more than 13 weeks, another more than 10 \nweeks, and the list goes on. Nor are these controversial nominees. \nEight of the 12 were reported from the Judiciary Committee without a \nsingle dissenting vote. The majority leader and all Democratic Senators \nhave been ready to proceed. The Republican Senate leadership is not. It \nhas stalled and delayed and obstructed.\n  Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has reached out and across \nthe aisle to work with Republican Senators in making his judicial \nnominations. The nomination of Judge Hamilton, which the Republican \nleadership filibustered, was supported by the most senior Republican in \nthe U.S. Senate, my respected friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar. Other \nexamples are the nominees to vacancies in Alabama supported by Senators \nSessions and Shelby, in South Dakota supported by Senator Thune, and in \nFlorida, supported by Senators Martinez and LaMieux. Still others are \nthe President's nomination to the Eleventh Circuit from Georgia, \nsupported by Senators Isakson and Chambliss, which the Senate will not \nconsider until the end of January because of Republican objection, and \nhis nomination to the Sixth Circuit from Tennessee, supported by \nSenator Alexander.\n  Last week we held a confirmation hearing for two more well-respected \nand well-qualified nominees that were the result of President Obama's \neffort to reach out and consult with home state Senators from both \nsides of the aisle, Judge James Wynn and Judge Albert Diaz. Judge Wynn \nand Judge Diaz have been nominated to fill two longstanding vacancies \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Both are from \nNorth Carolina. Senator Burr and Senator Hagan worked with each other \nand with the White House on these nominations. I thank them both for \ntheir testimony before the committee last week in strong support of \nthese nominees.\n  These nominations are just the most recent examples of this President \nreaching out to home State Senators from both parties to consult before \nmaking nominations. Just as I worked\n\n[[Page S13868]]\n\nlast year to end a decade-long impasse on the Sixth Circuit with the \nconfirmations of Judge Helene White and Ray Kethledge of Michigan, I \nwill work to see that these nominations from North Carolina are \nconsidered fairly and confirmed expeditiously. With the support of the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina, a Republican, and the determined \nefforts of Senator Hagan, a Democrat, North Carolina will finally have \nthe representation on the Fourth Circuit that it deserves.\n  Instead of praising the President for consulting with Republican \nSenators, the Republican leadership has doubled back on what they \ndemanded when a Republican was in the White House. No more do they talk \nabout each nominee being entitled to an up-or-down vote. That position \nis abandoned and forgotten. Instead, they now seek to filibuster and \ndelay judicial nominations. They have also walked back from their \nposition at the start of this Congress, when they threatened to \nfilibuster nominees on which home state Senators were not consulted. We \nsaw with Judge Hamilton that they filibustered a nominee supported by \nSenator Lugar.\n  When President Bush worked with Senators across the aisle, I praised \nhim and expedited consideration of his nominees. When President Obama \nreaches across the aisle, the Senate Republican leadership delays and \nobstructs his qualified nominees. It is clear that the Republican \nleadership has returned to their practices in the 1990s, which resulted \nin more than doubling circuit court vacancies, and led to the pocket \nfilibuster of more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees. The crisis \nthey created eventually led even to public criticism of their actions \nby Chief Justice Rehnquist during those years.\n  The Republican obstruction and delay in considering well-qualified \nnoncontroversial nominees comes at a tremendous cost to the ability of \nour Federal courts to provide justice for all Americans. We have seen a \ntremendous spike in judicial vacancies. Although there have been nearly \n110 judicial vacancies this year on our Federal circuit and district \ncourts around the country, only 10 vacancies have been filled. That is \nwrong. The American people deserve better.\n  In only 5 months of President Bush's first year in office when I \nserved as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and with a Democratic \nSenate majority, we confirmed 28 judicial nominees. During 17 months of \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office, we confirmed 100 of his \njudicial nominees. Although two Republicans chaired the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and Senate Republicans held the Senate majority for \nmore than half of President Bush's time in office, more judges \nnominated by President Bush were confirmed by the Senate Democratic \nmajority and when I served as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. \nDuring President Bush's last year in office, we had reduced judicial \nvacancies to as low as 34, even though it was a Presidential election \nyear. When President Bush left office, we had reduced vacancies in 9 of \nthe 13 circuits since President Clinton left office.\n  As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked and are being \nleft unfilled. We will start 2010 with the highest number of vacancies \non article III courts since 1994, when the vacancies created by the \nlast comprehensive judgeship bill were still being filled. While it has \nbeen nearly 20 years since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, \njudicial vacancies are nearing record levels, with 97 current vacancies \nand another 23 already announced. If we had proceeded on the judgeship \nbill recommended by the Judicial Conference to address the growing \nburden on our Federal judiciary, as we did in 1984 and 1990, in order \nto provide the resources the courts need, current vacancies would stand \nat 160 today. That is the true measure of how far behind we have \nfallen. I know we can do better. Justice should not be delayed or \ndenied to any American because of overburdened courts and the lack of \nFederal judges.\n  I, again, urge the Republican minority to allow Senate action on the \n12 judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar before the end of \nthe session. We have now wasted weeks having to seek time agreements in \norder to consider even nominations that were reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously and confirmed unanimously by the Senate when \nfinally allowed to be considered. The 12 judicial nominees are Beverly \nMartin of Georgia, nominated to the Eleventh Circuit; Joseph Greenaway \nof New Jersey, nominated to the Third Circuit; Edward Chen, nominated \nto the District Court for the Northern District of California; Dolly \nGee, nominated to the District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia; Richard Seeborg, nominated to the District Court for the \nNorthern District of California, Barbara Keenan of Virginia, nominated \nto the Fourth Circuit; Jane Stranch of Tennessee, nominated to the \nSixth Circuit; Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania, nominated to the Third \nCircuit; Louis Butler, nominated to the District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Wisconsin; Denny Chin of New York, nominated to the Second \nCircuit; Rosanna Malouf Peterson, nominated to the District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Washington; and William Conley, nominated to \nthe District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.\n  At the end of the Senate's 2001 session, only four judicial \nnominations were left on the Senate Executive Calendar, all of which \nwere confirmed soon after the Senate returned in 2002. At the end of \nthe first session of Congress during President Clinton's first term, \njust one judicial nominee was left on the Senate Executive Calendar. At \nthe end of the President George H.W. Bush's first year in office, a \nDemocratic Senate majority left just two judicial nominations pending \non the Senate Executive Calendar. At the end of the first year of \nPresident Reagan's first term--a year in which the Senate confirmed 41 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees--not a single \njudicial nomination was left on the Senate Executive Calendar.\n  In stark contrast, there are now 12 judicial nominees on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar, and unless there is a burst of cooperation from \nRepublicans, they will remain on the calendar awaiting Senate \nconsideration beyond the end of this session and into next year. That \nis a significant change from our history and tradition of confirming \njudicial nominations that have been reported favorably by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee by the end of a session.\n  The record of obstruction of the Senate Republicans is just as \ndisappointing when we consider the executive nominations that have been \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. There are currently an incredible \n20 executive nominations that have been reported favorably by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, \nincluding nominations for Assistant Attorneys General to run three of \nthe 11 divisions at the Department of Justice. Each of these \nnominations has been pending 4 months or longer. An editorial in \ntoday's Washington Post entitled ``Nominees in Limbo'' and subtitled \n``The Senate should do its job before taking a vacation'' describes the \nRepublican obstruction of the nomination of Dawn Johnson to head the \nOffice of Legal Counsel, which has been stalled on the Senate Executive \nCalendar since March, as ``[p]erhaps the greatest nominations \ntravesty.'' The editorial concludes: ``[T]he president should be given \ndeference in choosing executive-branch officials who share his views. \nMs. Johnsen is highly qualified and should be confirmed. At the very \nleast, senators should have the decency to give her an up-or-down \nvote.''\n  Senate Democrats treated President Bush's first nominations for these \nsame posts quite differently than Senate Republicans are now treating \nPresident Obama's nominees. We promptly reported the President's \nnominees to head the Office of Legal Counsel, the Office of Legal \nPolicy, and the Tax Division, and they each received Senate \nconsideration in a matter of days or weeks after they were reported by \nthe committee. We still have heard no explanation for the five months \nof Republican obstruction of the nomination of Chris Schroeder to head \nthe Office of Legal Policy after his nomination was reported by the \ncommittee in July by voice vote without dissent. The Washington Post \neditorial rightfully calls for Mr. Schroeder's confirmation as well as \nfor the confirmation of the long-pending nomination of Mary Smith to \nrun the Tax Division.\n  As with the judicial nominations, the Republicans have employed new \nstandards of demanding a supermajority and\n\n[[Page S13869]]\n\nfloor time and delays to consider even nominations that could be \nconfirmed easily, grinding our progress to a halt. I hope that the \nRepublican Senators and leadership will relent and end the year by \nmaking progress on these important nominations to put us on a better \npath for the next session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13869-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE TORTURE VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the U.S. Supreme Court recently granted \ncertiorari in a case involving the Torture Victim Protection Act of \n1991, TVPA, a law I supported from the earliest days following its \nintroduction by Senator Specter in the summer of 1986. Senator Specter \nand I worked for years to see this historic human rights bill become \nlaw in 1991. Yet today I am concerned that the TVPA's crucial role in \nprotecting human rights may be weakened or even rendered meaningless. \nThe Supreme Court case, Samantar v. Yousuf, may decide the fate of this \nlandmark law.\n  The TVPA provides a Federal cause of action against any individual \nwho subjects any person to torture or extrajudicial killing. This cause \nof action is available where the individual acts under actual or \napparent authority, or under color of law of any foreign nation. \nCongress passed the TVPA in response to widespread use of official \ntorture and summary executions that took place around the world, \ndespite the universal consensus condemning such practices. Congress \nrecognized that neither Federal nor international law was strong enough \nto curb such egregious human rights abuses. We enacted the TVPA to \nensure accountability for those who commit atrocious violations of \nhuman rights.\n  The case currently before the Supreme Court, Samantar v. Yousuf, \nraises the question of whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, \nFSIA, allows an action filed under the TVPA to be brought against a \nformer government official of a foreign country who is now living in \nthe United States. The answer is clear in the TVPA and its legislative \nhistory. The answer is yes. Congress expressly intended the TVPA to \napply against former government officials. In enacting the TVPA, \nCongress made it explicit that the FSIA would almost never provide a \ndefense to such persons. They can be sued under the TVPA to recoup \ndamages caused by their torturous actions.\n  The Senate clearly stated its intention to ensure that the TVPA \noperated in concert with existing law, specifically taking into account \nthe FSIA, the Alien Tort Claims Act, and the United Nations Convention \nAgainst Torture, which the United States signed in 1988. This point was \ndiscussed extensively as we drafted and refined the legislation. The \noperation of the TVPA was considered in a hearing held by the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs in June \n1990. The committee was not oblivious to the concerns raised at the \ntime by the executive branch regarding sovereign immunity. We were \ncognizant of the role of the executive to manage foreign policy. We \naddressed each of these concerns in turn, but we were not persuaded \nthat they outweighed the importance of creating a private cause of \naction under the TVPA. The full Congress agreed when it enacted the \nTVPA in March 1992.\n  The TVPA was drafted, in part, in response to gaps in two existing \nlaws: the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Convention Against Torture. In \ndeciding whether the Alien Tort Claims Act could be used by victims of \ntorture committed abroad, one Federal judge expressed concern that \nseparation of powers principles required an explicit grant by Congress \nof a private right of action for lawsuits that affect foreign \nrelations. The Alien Tort Claims Act did not have such an explicit \ngrant. Congress responded by enacting the TVPA with an unambiguous \nbasis for a cause of action.\n  Similarly, the United States signature on the Convention Against \nTorture was an important and symbolic step in the prevention of \ntorture, but the Convention fell short of the TVPA in at least two \nimportant respects. First, the Convention required that signatories \nopen their courts to suits for damages caused by torture in their own \ncountries. That policy was welcome but insufficient. The TVPA allows \ntorture victims to sue their abuser without returning to the country of \nabuse. Congress took this step because it believed that governments \nthat had allowed torture to occur within their jurisdiction would not \nnecessarily provide meaningful redress to victims. Furthermore, torture \nvictims who escaped from the country of abuse would not eagerly return \nto that country to file suit. Congress designed the TVPA specifically \nto respond to that situation by opening U.S. courts to these cases and \nproviding a civil cause of action here in the United States for torture \ncommitted abroad.\n  Second, by creating a Federal cause of action in our own courts, \nCongress ensured that torturers would no longer have a safe haven in \nthe United States. The legislation served notice to individuals engaged \nin human rights violations that their actions were anathema to American \nvalues and they would not find shelter from accountability here.\n  Congress explicitly drafted the TVPA to strengthen and expand the \nscope of action that victims of torture could take in our courts, but \nCongress was nonetheless conscious of the bill's limits. The TVPA was \nnot meant to override traditional diplomatic immunities or the FSIA's \ngrant of immunity to foreign governments. The act struck a balance. It \nprotected well established notions of sovereign and diplomatic \nimmunities for current political actors without creating a safe haven \nfor the perpetrators of horrible acts after they left their official \npositions and settled in, or fled to, the United States.\n  For example, Congress carefully created the cause of action against \nan ``individual'' to ensure that foreign states or their entities could \nnot be sued under the act under any circumstances. Similarly, we \ndiscussed at length the fact that the legislation would not permit a \nsuit against a former leader of a country merely because an isolated \nact of torture occurred somewhere in that country. But Congress neither \nintended nor imagined that the FSIA would provide former officials with \na defense to a lawsuit brought under the TVPA. Such an interpretation \nwould undermine the purpose of the law. The TVPA was not intended to \ncover the torturous acts of private individuals. To the contrary, in \norder for a defendant to be liable under the TVPA, the torture must \nhave been taken ``under actual or apparent authority or under the color \nof law of a foreign nation.'' The Judiciary Committee explicitly stated \nin its report on the bill that, ``the FSIA should normally provide no \ndefense to an action taken under the TVPA against a former official.''\n  I hope that the Supreme Court studies this definitive and \ncomprehensive history as it considers the case of Samantar v. Yousuf. \nCongress clearly intended the TVPA to extend to former officials of \nforeign countries if they choose to come to the United States after \nleaving their positions of authority. Congress also stated that the \nFSIA does not extend immunity to such individuals. Claims that a suit \nbrought against a former official would undermine the FSIA and endanger \nforeign relations are simply inaccurate. Congress properly weighed the \nforeign policy concerns when it passed the TVPA. The Supreme Court \nshould not overrule the well-considered judgment of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13869-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13869-S13870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DETERIORATING SITUATION IN NEPAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the years, both during and since the \nend of the monarchy in Nepal, I have urged the Nepal Army to respect \nhuman rights and cooperate with civilian judicial authorities in \ninvestigations of its members who abuse human rights. I spoke on this \nsubject a few days ago in relation to the horrific case of Maina \nSunuwar, a 15-year-old Nepali girl who was tortured to death by Nepal \nArmy officers who then sought to cover up the crime.\n  I have also, similarly, urged the Maoists to stop committing acts of \nviolence and extortion against civilians, respect human rights, and \nwork to improve the lives of the Nepali people through the political \nprocess. The fact that the Maoists laid down their arms and entered \ninto a peace agreement gave the Nepali people the first chance in \nNepal's history to build a democratic government that is responsive to \ntheir needs.\n\n[[Page S13870]]\n\n  It is therefore disheartening that the Maoists continue to engage in \ntactics that serve little purpose but to make the lives of the Nepali \npeople, already difficult, even harder. They have just staged their \nlatest general strike, which for the past 3 days crippled Nepal's \neconomy.\n  For 3 days, Nepal, already a poor country, neither imported nor \nexported goods through its land entry points, causing a significant \nloss of revenue. Tourism, one of Nepal's most important sources of \nincome for hotels, shops, transport, restaurants, and guide services, \nhas been damaged. The garment industry, also among Nepal's largest, was \nbrought to a halt. And there is the risk that foreign companies will \ndecide that Nepal is still too unstable, and look elsewhere to invest.\n  What possible good does this kind of protest do? It angers and hurts \nthe very people whose interests the Maoists claim to serve. In fact, it \nhurts poor people the most, because they and their children do not have \nsavings, and go hungry. And it can hardly make other political parties \nmore likely to accede to the Maoists' demands.\n  The latest news is that the Maoist leaders have threatened an \nindefinite national strike unless the government puts in place within a \nmonth a unity government headed by the Maoists. This kind of ultimatum, \nwhich has no place in a democracy, would be disturbing enough if it \nwere not for the fact that the Maoists headed a coalition government \nlast year after winning national elections, only to leave the \ngovernment in May when it failed to replace the then army chief of \nstaff.\n  I also felt that Nepal needed a new army chief who was not tainted by \npast abuses, but for the Maoists to quit the government and then accuse \nthe President of forcing them to do so when their demands were not met, \nwas irresponsible. Today, in fact, Nepal has a new army chief. Time \nwill tell if he is the right person for the job.\n  As an observer of developments in Nepal, I have been encouraged by \nthe positive steps the country has taken since the events that led to \nthe end of the monarchy. But the desires that led to that courageous \ndemonstration of popular will remain unfulfilled. The institutions of \ndemocracy are barely functioning and the political situation continues \nto deteriorate. Only 5 months remain until the deadline for drafting a \nnew constitution, and growing distrust between the political parties \nthreatens to derail the peace process. Indeed, the political parties \nhave often seemed more concerned with promoting their own interests \nthan with addressing the needs of the Nepali people. The army has yet \nto reform. Thousands of Maoist ex-combatants need to be demobilized and \ntrained for jobs in the civilian workplace. Unless the political \nparties take decisive steps to work together to address these issues, \nthe situation will go from bad to worse, and at some point the Nepali \npeople may again take matters into their own hands.\n  In the meantime, the periodic economic shutdowns and acts of violence \nand intimidation perpetrated by the Young Communist League, cause one \nto question whether the Maoist leaders understand or accept the \nresponsibilities that are inherent in a democracy. Rather than \norchestrating acts of collective punishment to try to force a result, \nthe Maoists need to earn the public's trust and respect. There is also \nthe responsibility to exercise power in a manner that strengthens, not \nerodes, popular support. So far, the Maoists have failed to demonstrate \na capacity for either.\n  The Communist Party of Nepal--Maoist--today remains a designated \nforeign terrorist organization under U.S. law. I am among those who \nwould like to see that designation lifted, as I believe the U.S. could, \nthrough technical assistance and exchange programs, help the Maoist \nleaders to better understand the benefits of working constructively \nwithin the democratic process on behalf of the Nepali people. But the \nfact remains that having engaged in acts that got them onto the list in \nthe first place, they need to demonstrate that they have abandoned \nthose tactics and are accountable to the people. Organizing harmful \nstrikes that serve no logical or legitimate purpose, encouraging acts \nof violence, refusing to punish its own members who committed \natrocities, and making threats, are not consistent with a responsible \npolitical organization.\n  Mr. President, poverty and injustice have been a fact of life in \nNepal for centuries. Three and a half years ago the Nepali people rose \nup against a corrupt, abusive monarchy and demanded something better. \nThey are still waiting, but they will not wait forever. Like Nepal's \nother political parties, the Maoists will be judged by what they \ndeliver.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13870-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13870-S13871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FATE OF HMONG REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a worrisome \nhumanitarian situation that is developing in Thailand, which could \ncause problems for our relations with the Thai military.\n  Thailand and the United States are longtime friends and allies, and \nour Armed Forces have developed a cooperative relationship. Many Thai \nmilitary officers have been trained in the United States, and Thai \nsoldiers have participated in joint U.S.-Thai training exercises such \nas Operation Cobra Gold. I expect this relationship to continue. But I \nam very concerned, as I know are other Senators, that the Thai \nGovernment may be on the verge of deporting roughly 4,000 ethnic Hmong \nback to Laos where many fear persecution.\n  Thailand has a long history of generosity towards refugees from \nBurma, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It is a history to be proud of. But \nthe Thai Government, which insists that the Hmong are economic migrants \nwho should be repatriated, has reportedly deployed additional troops to \nPhetchabun province where most of the Hmong are in camps. There is a \ngrowing concern that the Thai military may expel the Hmong before the \nend of the year. There is also concern that a group of 158 Hmong in \nNongkhai province, who have been screened and granted United Nations \nrefugee status, could be sent back to Laos. I understand that the \nUnited States and several countries have told the U.N. High \nCommissioner for Refugees and the Thai Government they are prepared to \nconsider this group of refugees for resettlement. Potential \nresettlement countries should be given an opportunity to interview \nthese individuals in Thailand.\n  It may be that some of the 4,000 Hmong are economic migrants. It is \nalso likely that some are refugees who have a credible fear of \npersecution if they were returned to Laos. I am aware that many Hmong \nfought alongside the U.S. military during the Vietnam war. The U.N. \nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, working with Thai authorities, needs to \ndetermine who has a legitimate claim for asylum and who does not, in \naccordance with long-standing principles of refugee law and practice. \nNo one with a valid claim should be returned to Laos except on a \nvoluntary basis. The United States, and other countries, can help \nresettle those who do have valid claims but need access and the \nopportunity to consider relevant cases.\n  I mention this because I cannot overstate the consternation it would \ncause here if the Thai Government were to forcibly return the Hmong to \nLaos in violation of international practice and requirements. The image \nof Laotian refugees including many who the United Nations and the Thai \nGovernment itself have stated are in need of protection being rounded \nup by Thai soldiers and sent back against their will during the \nChristmas season, and the possible violence that could result, is very \nworrisome. On December 17 I joined other Senators in a letter to the \nThai Prime Minister about this, and I will ask that a copy be printed \nin the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  As chairman of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee which \nfunds international assistance programs, I have supported U.S. military \ntraining programs and other assistance to the Thai military. We share \ncommon interests and want to continue to work together. But after the \ndeplorable forced repatriation to China of Uighur refugees by Cambodian \nauthorities last week, we expect better of the Thai Government. Should \nthe Hmong be treated similarly it could badly damage the Thai \nmilitary's reputation, and put our military collaboration at risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe\n\n[[Page S13871]]\n\nDecember 17, 2009 letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2009.\n     Mr. Abhisit Vejjajiva,\n     Prime Minister, Kingdom of Thailand, Wisconsin Ave, N.W., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Prime Minister, We are writing to express our \n     concern regarding reports of a possible repatriation to Laos \n     of Lao Ilmong from the Huay Nam Khao camp and Nong Khai \n     detention center in Thailand. While we recognize that the \n     Kingdom of Thailand is burdened by the large number of \n     refugees it hosts on its territory, we encourage you to not \n     take steps to repatriate any individuals to Laos at this \n     time. Thailand is a strong ally of the U.S., and the \n     cooperation between our governments, including a history of \n     working together on Laotian and Burmese refugee issues, is \n     greatly valued.\n       We understand that your government has conducted screenings \n     in the Phetchabun camp in fluay Nam Khao to identify and \n     separate refugees meriting protection from those migrating \n     for primarily economic reasons. We remain concerned, however, \n     regarding the lack of transparency in this screening process, \n     and the absence of a civilian entity to lead it. In July of \n     this year, a group of Senators sent a letter to General \n     Songkitti Jaggabatara requesting more information about the \n     criteria and methods used in screening Laotian Hmong in the \n     Phetchabun camp, but a response to this inquiry has not yet \n     been received.\n       We acknowledge the difficulty that this issue has posed for \n     both your country as well as the inhabitants of the camps. \n     However, we believe that the lack of transparency in the \n     screening and repatriation process only exacerbates these \n     difficulties and heightens international concern regarding \n     these populations. A process that adheres to the core tenets \n     of the refugee convention, and is conducted by an independent \n     third party organization, could resolve much of this concern \n     by helping to ensure that the Lao Hmong are able to provide a \n     full and accurate account that can serve as the basis for an \n     appropriate status determination.\n       Before repatriating any individuals to Laos, we strongly \n     urge your government to work with an independent third-party \n     organization to conduct a transparent screening process \n     consistent with international standards. Once such a process \n     is in place. we hope that any Hmong determined to have \n     refugee status will be provided opportunities for third \n     country resettlement. This includes the individuals at the \n     Nong Khai center, who have already been screened by the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. For those who \n     are not judged to require protection, we encourage you to \n     work with international organizations and the governments of \n     the U.S. and Laos to establish a repatriation process that \n     includes effective third party monitoring.\n       We also understand that Assistant Secretary of State Eric \n     Schwartz will be visiting Thailand in the very near future. \n     We hope that the U.S. and Thailand can work closely to find a \n     solution that alleviates the burden of this situation on \n     Thailand, as well as the concerns about the repatriation of \n     those in need of protection, and we would be happy to consult \n     with you on this process.\n       We appreciate your efforts to ensure a transparent process \n     and just resolution to this issue. The Kingdom of Thailand \n     remains a close ally of the United States and we look forward \n     to working with your government to strengthen this important \n     relationship.\n           Sincerely,\n         Russell D.

BILLINGS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I express my deep appreciation to a \ngreat Utahn and friend, Provo City Mayor Lewis K. Billings, whose \ntenure as mayor will soon come to an end. It has been my distinct \npleasure to work with Mayor Billings over the past 12 years.\n  Nestled at the base of the Rocky Mountains, Provo was founded by \nrugged pioneers in 1849 and is one of the oldest cities in the West. \nToday, Provo is one of largest cities in the State of Utah. Mayor \nBillings and his beautiful wife Patti are longtime residents of Provo \nand raised eight wonderful children there.\n  Mayor Billings was elected Provo City Mayor in November 1997, after \ncompleting 3 years as chief administrative officer and director of \ncommunity and government relations for the city of Provo. He and I \nshare many of the same conservative values and principles and his \nservice as mayor is a strong reflection of his dedication to those \nideals. Mayor Billings will long be remembered for focusing on \neffective public safety and law enforcement, fiscal responsibility, \neconomic development and job creation, neighborhood and downtown \nrevitalization, the arts, emergency readiness, and a host of other \nlocal, regional, and national public policy issues. During his tenure, \nProvo City has consistently received national recognition for low crime \nrates, high quality of life, and positive business development.\n  Mayor Billings has accomplished a great deal during his tenure as \nMayor of Provo. His dedicated public service and determination to shape \nProvo into the wonderful city it is today will be remembered for years \nto come. I ask my colleagues to join me and the citizens of the great \nState of Utah in thanking Mayor Billings for his many years of \ndedicated service. We all appreciate his efforts and service, but none \nso more than me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13871-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13871-S13872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUN OWNERS SUPPORT GUN SAFETY LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the debate surrounding gun legislation is \noften an acrimonious one, creating the perception that Americans are \nhopelessly divided on this policy issue. After listening to the \npositions of the National Rifle Association, NRA, a person could \nconclude that progress toward a national consensus on sensible gun \nlegislation is a long way off. This perception, however, is just that: \nmerely a perception. In reality, Americans of all political stripes \nshare much common ground when it comes to issues of gun safety, and I \nam hopeful that this consensus will produce tangible legislative \nresults.\n  In a recent poll conducted by well-known pollster Frank Luntz, NRA \nmembers and non-NRA gun owners expressed strong support for a number of \nproposed gun safety laws. These gun-owning Americans did not see a \ncontradiction between supporting legislative efforts to reduce gun \nviolence and their right to bear arms. Specifically, 85 percent of non-\nNRA gun owners and 69 percent of NRA gun owners supported closing the \n``gun show loophole'' by requiring all gun sellers at gun shows to \nconduct a Brady criminal background check on prospective purchasers. In \naddition, 86 percent of non-NRA gun owners and 82 percent of NRA \nmembers favored a proposal to prevent individuals listed on a terrorist \nwatch list from purchasing firearms. Seventy-four percent of non-NRA \ngun owners and 69 percent of NRA members also agreed with this \nstatement: ``the federal government should not restrict the police's \nability to access, use, and share data that helps them enforce federal, \nstate, and local gun laws.''\n  At first glance, these polling numbers may not seem very surprising. \nAfter all, these gun safety proposals are founded on common sense and \nare crafted to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and \nterrorists. Unfortunately though, the NRA leadership continues to \noppose three Federal gun safety bills that, according to the recent \npoll, their own members support: the Gun Show Background Check Act, S. \n843, which would close the ``gun show loophole;'' the Denying Firearms \nand Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, S. 1317, which would \nprevent individuals listed on terrorist watch lists from purchasing a \ngun; and the Preserving Records of Terrorist and Criminal Transactions \nAct, S. 2820, which would improve the ability of law enforcement \nagencies to prevent gun violence by increasing the amount of time gun \nbackground check records are kept.\n  I support these sensible gun safety measures, and as the polling \nindicates, so do a majority of American gun owners, including NRA \nmembers. The NRA is not only out of touch with mainstream America, they \nalso are out of touch with their own members. It is time to set aside \nthe false claims that too often cloud the debate surrounding gun \nsafety. There is an overwhelming consensus in America: the time to pass \ncommonsense gun safety legislation is now.\n\n[[Page S13872]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13872-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, as our Nation begins its \neconomic recovery, our unemployment numbers still remain far too high. \nToo many Americans are unable to find work, which only slows the pace \nof our emergence from recession. As part of my continuing effort to \nsupport tailored, fiscally responsible methods to getting our economy \nback on track, I am proud to discuss a bipartisan bill that I \nintroduced this week with several of my Senate colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The bill is the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 2009, which \nis cosponsored by Senator Schumer, Senator Lieberman, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Collins, and Senator Gillibrand. If enacted, \nthis legislation would immediately allow increased lending for small \nbusinesses to the tune of billions of dollars. It would do so in a safe \nand fiscally responsible way, without calling on the Federal Government \nto spend a dime. And best of all, it could lead to large-scale job \ncreation in my home State of Colorado and around the country. For these \nreasons, I hope that our Senate colleagues join us in urging swift \npassage of this common-sense legislation.\n  Small businesses are the engine of our Nation's economy. In the last \n15 years, small businesses have generated nearly two-thirds of all new \njobs created in the United States, and they currently employ more than \nhalf of the American workforce.\n  However, small businesses continue to struggle accessing credit, as \nlarge banks have significantly cut back on Main Street lending. \nAccording to a recent Treasury Department report, the 22 banks that \nhave received the most funding through the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, TARP, cut their collective small business loan balances by \n$11.6 billion from April through October of this year.\n  America's community banks, which by-and-large did not receive Federal \nbailout funds, are doing all they can to fill the Main Street credit \nvacuum created by these large financial institutions. While this \nlegislation I have authored is aimed at helping credit unions ramp up \ntheir small business lending, I have also joined with many of my \ncolleagues this year in support of a number of initiatives that will \nhelp community banks increase lending to small businesses.\n  The Small Business Lending Enhancement Act will further these efforts \nto free up credit for small business. Under current statute, credit \nunions are required to limit member business lending to 12.25 percent \nof the credit union's total assets. This bill would raise that cap to \n25 percent of total assets, and increase the minimum business loans \nsubject to the cap from $50,000 to $250,000. These provisions would \nincrease the amount that credit unions already offering business loans \ncould provide to small businesses, while also encouraging more credit \nunions to enter the business loan market. Under current law, many \ncredit unions find it difficult to start member business lending \nprograms because the cost of meeting high regulatory and staffing \nrequirements is too expensive relative to the cap. Raising the member \nbusiness lending cap would make it easier for credit unions to recover \ncosts, and therefore would increase the number of credit unions able to \nstart small business loan programs.\n  The Credit Union National Association estimates that these sensible \nreforms would increase small business lending by $10 billion within the \nfirst year of their enactment, including an increase of nearly $200 \nmillion in my home State of Colorado. This new access to credit would \nlikely produce more than 100,000 new jobs nationwide within the first \nyear of the bill's enactment. That is the sort of pro-business, pro-\njobs policy that we need.\n  Mr. President, these simple statutory changes would not increase \nFederal outlays one cent, but they would dramatically increase the \namount of private capital available to small businesses to help make \npayroll, buy inventory, and expand and innovate. Moreover, these \nproposed statutory changes are safe and fully supported by the National \nCredit Union Administration, the independent Federal regulator with \noversight of our Nation's credit unions. To further ensure the safety \nand soundness of credit unions, this bill requires the NCUA to submit a \nsemiannual report to Congress on the status of credit union member \nbusiness lending, including any recommendations for legislative \nchanges. In sum, this is a responsibly drafted bill that could help \nspur much-needed economic growth and job production.\n  Mr. President, we have to do all we can to responsibly unlock credit \nmarkets for small businesses in Colorado and throughout the country. I \nbelieve this legislation is an important piece of that effort. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nquickly pass the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act, and allow our \nnation's small businesses to again set our country on a path toward job \ngrowth and further prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13872-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13872-S13873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as the Senate moves forward toward \nending the debate on health care reform and recessing until the New \nYear, we leave some important legislation unfinished, including \nlegislation that would extend a number of tax provisions that are set \nto expire on December 31 of this year. The House has already acted to \nextend a number of these expiring tax provisions, and I urge my \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to work with Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley to take up this legislation immediately when we \ncome back from recess.\n  As part of this effort, I urge my colleagues to extend tax \nprovisions, some of which are set to expire this year, that were \nenacted by Congress to aid the recovery of the gulf coast after the \n2005 hurricane season. Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf coast and \nrecovery efforts to date have been delayed because of a continuing \nshortage of skilled construction workers, limited financing, and \nsustained increases in construction and insurance costs. These \nchallenges have been compounded by the current economic crisis.\n  By extending a number of the tax provisions that were enacted as part \nof the Gulf Opportunity Zone legislation that Congress passed in 2005, \na number of important projects, including low-income housing projects, \nwill have adequate time to overcome development challenges, and create \nmore opportunities for displaced residents looking to return after the \n2005 storms. This will result in more jobs and a faster recovery for \nthe gulf coast. If Congress fails to act to extend the tax provisions \nof the GO Zone legislation, including the placed-in-service provision \nof the GO Zone low-income housing tax credit, at least 77 low-income \nhousing projects in the Gulf Coast are at risk of not being completed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I wrote \nrequesting an extension of the placed-in-service provision of the GO \nZone low-income housing tax credit be included in any tax extenders \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chair, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     to request your support for extending the placed-in-service \n     date for affordable housing developments in the Gulf \n     Opportunity Zone.\n       As you know, GO Zone low income housing tax credits have \n     been vital in our effort to restoring the number of \n     affordable housing units along the Gulf Coast. Tough economic \n     conditions, however, have prevented many of these projects \n     from moving forward at the pace necessary to meet the placed-\n     in-service deadline of January 1, 2011.\n       Together this bipartisan group of Gulf Coast senators has \n     been working to extend this deadline for two years, to allow \n     77 low income housing projects in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     Alabama to move forward and creating more than 13,000 \n     construction-related jobs. This legislation would not \n     allocate any new credits--it would merely provide additional \n     time to take full advantage of the credits that were issued \n     in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricanes.\n       Extending the place-in-service deadline is critical to \n     improving the availability of affordable housing along the \n     Gulf Coast. FEMA estimates that the 2005 storms destroyed or \n     heavily damaged 82,000 rental\n\n[[Page S13873]]\n\n     units, of which 54,000 served low-income populations. During \n     his August 27 visit to New Orleans, HUD Secretary Shaun \n     Donovan emphasized the need to revitalize this housing and \n     highlighted the importance of a placed-in-service extension.\n       With an extension, developers will be able to attract \n     investors to their proposed developments, have adequate time \n     to overcome financial barriers triggered by the current \n     economic crisis, and create more opportunities for residents \n     displaced by the 2005 hurricanes to return home. Without an \n     extension, more than 6,000 units are unlikely to be \n     completed. The loss of more than $1 billion in economic \n     activity--to the construction industry, suppliers, \n     professionals, developers and others--would be a major blow \n     to our states and the region.\n       Your initiative in helping the Gulf Coast to recover has \n     been invaluable. It is our hope that the Senate Finance \n     Committee will continue this leadership by including a \n     placed-in-service extension in a tax extenders bill or other \n     legislation this year. We appreciate your consideration of \n     this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary L. Landrieu,\n       United States Senator.\n     David B. Vitter,\n       United States Senator.\n     Roger F.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about those \nNebraskans who will be overseas, in harm's way, this Christmas.\n  The job our young men and women in uniform do to protect our safety \nevery day is magnificent. I have met with many of these young service \nmen and women throughout my years of public service, and I know they \nrepresent the very best of America. During my time as Governor, it was \ntruly an honor to command Nebraska's National Guard forces. They serve \nour country with immense valor, at the risk of their own lives. To \nthem, we are all deeply grateful.\n  Christmas in wartime has always been a difficult time for troops and \ntheir families. The contrast is very great between Americans at home \ncelebrating holiday cheer, and those on the front lines going about \ntheir regular day of danger. It is a contrast that we should be mindful \nof this season. I, and many of my fellow Nebraskans, will pause \ntomorrow to give thanks for the sacrifice of our troops, and pray that \nthey get home safely. Their mission is just, and they are the most \ncapable military in the world. Their presence is missed at this time \nmore than any other but our pride, in them and their friends, is even \ngreater than our sorrow at their absence.\n  So to those Nebraskans who are in harm's way this Christmas, and to \nall American forces, those who serve abroad to protect us here at home, \nI truly thank you. I hope it will be, in some small measure, a comfort \non Christmas, to know that so many of your friends, family, and fellow \nAmericans are safe and secure due to your service, and praying for you.\n  So today, as always, I wish you all a safe return, and a very Merry \nChristmas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13873-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICAN HIKERS DETAINED BY IRAN\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

This is \ndeeply troubling and incredibly difficult for their families.\n  I recently spoke to the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations on \nbehalf of the hikers to reiterate my call for their release. I also \nasked that they be able to call their families and continue to be \nvisited by Swiss consular officials.\n  During this holiday season, Americans from all walks of life are \ncelebrating and renewing ties of family, friendship, and good will.\n  The extended absence of these young Americans from their families is \nparticularly painful during such a festive time.

Mr. Presdient, this month, the U.S. Army Special \nOperations Command, USASOC, celebrates 20 years of service to the Army \nand Nation. Having been at war for over one-third of that time, the men \nand women of USASOC continue to make great contributions worldwide with \nan operations tempo that has never been greater. USASOC remains \ncommitted to maintaining the world's finest ground special operations \nforce. Its personnel take quiet professional pride in executing each \nmission with excellence, honor and valor.\n  I am proud that USASOC's headquarters are in North Carolina. USASOC \nCommander LTG John Mulholland has done a tremendous job in training, \norganizing, and equipping Army Special Forces units, capable of \nconducting global Special Operations missions. Army Special Forces \nunits perform a variety of missions, including special reconnaissance, \npsychological, civil affairs, unconventional warfare, foreign internal \ndefense, direct action, counterterrorism, and counterinsurgency.\n  The principle units that make up today's USASOC include the John F. \nKennedy Special Warfare Center and School, U.S. Army Special Forces \nCommand, 75th Ranger Regiment, 160th Special Operations Aviation \nRegiment, 3rd and 7th Special Forces Group, 4th Psychological \nOperations Group, 95th Civil Affairs Brigade and the 528th Sustainment \nBrigade.\n  Since its inception on December 1, 1989, the pace of USASOC's \noperations has been extraordinary; operating around the world, often \nbehind-the-lines, in some of the most remote and hostile regions on the \nplanet.\n  At more than 27,000 personnel, USASOC is only 5 percent of the U.S. \nArmy. However, USASOC is the largest of the service components that \nmake up U.S. Special Operations Command, USSOCOM, and provides \napproximately 70 percent of the special operations personnel in Central \nCommand's theater and approximately 63 percent of America's total \noverseas military commitments. USASOC provides trained and ready Army \nspecial operations forces to support the Geographic Combatant \nCommanders, GCC, the Theater Special Operations Commands, TSOC, and \nAmbassadors throughout the world.\n  Today the operations tempo for Army Special Operations has never been \ngreater, and is unlikely to decrease in the near future. USASOC \ncurrently has soldiers deployed on 103 Missions in 56 countries around \nthe world, and is operating across the spectrum of operations.\n  Currently 222 of the Army's 228 Continental United States-based \nSpecial Forces operational detachments ``A''--ODA--are committed to \nsupporting operations worldwide, either deployed or preparing for \ndeployment. USASOC's ability to manage the high operations tempo is \ndirectly attributable to the caliber of its personnel. The range of \nskills within USASOC is embraced by a spectrum of Army unconventional \nunits.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the great \ncontributions of USASOC units currently in theater, particularly the \n3rd and 7th Special Forces Groups in Afghanistan, the 95th Civil \nAffairs Brigade and the 4th Psychological Operations Group in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  President Obama has stated in his agenda for defense, ``We must build \nup our special operations forces, civil affairs, information operations \nand other units and capabilities.'' The demand for special operations \npersonnel, skills and training remain high. Faced with often desperate, \nunconventional enemies, our approaches for defeating them involve \nunwavering commitment combined with unique unconventional skills.\n  USASOC's expertise ensures the Army's special operations forces can \nexecute the most lethal, highly complex and sensitive special \noperations,\n\n[[Page S13874]]\n\nwage unconventional warfare, conduct high risk helicopter operations, \nor prosecute civil military and influence operations.\n  For those in today's USASOC, the pace is fast, the challenges great, \nbut morale and job satisfaction have seldom been greater. The command's \nmotto, ``Without Equal'', captures the spirit of its personnel and \ntheir commitment to maintaining the world's finest ground special \noperations force.\n  The command's missions, however, have not come without a sizable cost \nin lives lost. In the 8 years since the start of Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, 244 of USASOC's personnel have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice. Their names are cast in bronze on a wall \nin USASOC's Memorial Plaza at Fort Bragg, NC.\n  In closing, the performance and contributions of Army Special \nOperations Forces in the Central Command theater of operations and \naround the world have been nothing short of magnificent. Whether in \nIraq and Afghanistan, the Philippines, Trans-Sahara Africa or wherever \nfriends and partners find themselves challenged by the forces of \ndisintegration, oppression and extremism, Army Special Operators from \nacross the Command's formations are unquestionably among America's most \nrelevant answer to the threats our Nation faces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13874-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM PITCOCK\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the career of Jim \nPitcock, a valuable staff member and more importantly a valuable part \nof the Arkansas community. Jim has been faithful and selfless in his \nservice to the State of Arkansas, and his contributions will be sorely \nmissed by me, my staff, and the many Arkansans who have had the great \nfortune of working with this wonderful public servant.\n  Jim has served on my staff from the very first day of my tenure as a \nMember of the U.S. Senate. His knowledge of the State of Arkansas and \ngovernment has guided some of my most important decisions and for that \nI will be forever grateful. His wise, steady council is always held in \nhigh esteem. Jim has served several roles on my staff. His most recent \nrole as senior caseworker has benefitted the people of Arkansas by \nassisting individuals, businesses and organizations that are \nexperiencing difficulties with Federal agencies. Jim's leadership has \nset an expectation of excellence in constituent services.\n  Prior his work in the U.S. Senate, Jim was already a legend in \nArkansas. He served as news director at Channel 7 in Little Rock for \nmore than 30 years. During this time, Jim established an unprecedented \nsystem of archiving news coverage for historical purposes. Jim has \nwitnessed and archived news from Governors Faubus to Huckabee and \nPresidents Johnson to Clinton. He also provided critical coverage of \nmajor events in our State, such as the Damascus missile explosion, the \nCuban refugee crisis and the great Arkansas Texas shootout football \ngame of 1969. Following his departure from television, I was privileged \nto have Jim join my staff in the Arkansas attorney general's office in \n2001 serving as the public information officer.\n  After so many years of faithful service to the people of Arkansas, \nJim Pitcock has made a decision to retire from the Senate and his \npresence will be missed. He will continue to be a friend and adviser to \nme and I wish him all the best of luck as he begins this new chapter in \nhis life.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the \noutstanding career and service of Jim Pitcock to the U.S. Senate and \nthe State of Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13874-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13874-S13875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THREE SISTERS SCENIC BIKEWAY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, too many of our communities are \nhemorrhaging jobs. That is especially true in rural areas, where \nindustries have suffered and companies have had to let lots of people \ngo. In Oregon, for example, changes in forest policy have hit rural \ncommunities particularly hard in recent years. I am constantly working \nto find solutions that will help those communities not just survive but \nthrive.\n  It is indisputable that many rural communities and small towns in \nOregon contain some of the most beautiful scenery in America. When I \nlook at their future, I see that the scenic beauty and solitude of \nbeautiful places like Sisters, OR, which sits in the shadow of the \nCascade Mountains, can be a big engine to drive the economy. \nInvestments in amenities like parks and scenic bikeways can be valuable \nfor communities because they aren't fleeting. They build infrastructure \nthat lasts for generations. The beauty of nature, especially out in the \ncountryside, attracts tourists--particularly bicyclists.\n  The League of American Bicyclists estimates that biking contributes \n$133 billion per year to our national economy, provides 1.1 million \njobs, and generates $17.7 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes. \nThey estimate that another $46.9 billion is spent on meals, \ntransportation, lodging, gifts, and entertainment during bike trips and \ntours.\n  Savvy entrepreneurs in Oregon have come together to capitalize on the \nbenefits that being a destination for bicyclists can bring to a \ncommunity. Cycle Oregon--called ``the best bike ride in America''--\nattracted 2,200 people from 44 States and 11 foreign countries to its \n2008 ride, which took hardy bicyclists through some of Oregon's most \nbeautiful sites. But it is not just Oregon entrepreneurs who have \nfigured this out. It is a nationwide phenomenon. Bloomington, Indiana's \n``Hilly 100 ride,'' for example, draws 5,000 riders and over $1 million \nin lodging and food sales. And in Iowa, the week-long Register's Annual \nGreat Bicycle Ride Across Iowa has become so popular that last year, \nthey had to turn people away after more than 9,000 applied to cycle \nacross the State.\n  It is often through outdoor events like bike races that you will find \na CEO or company leader visiting Central Oregon on a vacation and \nhaving the brainstorm that it would make a great place to locate a new \nenterprise. Many high-tech companies, for example, are locating in \nplaces with unique, scenic beauty to set them apart from their \ncompetition in the big cities and to give them an added bonus to \nattract the talent they need to succeed.\n  I thought there must be a way to tap the full recreation potential of \ncentral Oregon and create a model that could be replicated in other \nparts of the country. So, 2 years ago I asked recreation leaders in \nDeschutes County to look at how recreation could add value to its \nrecreation assets, creating the strongest possible engine for economic \ndevelopment.\n  Since then, the Sisters area has decided that much of its economy is \ntied to broadening the set of recreation experiences they can offer to \nvisitors. They have developed many miles of new, spectacular mountain \nbike trails in the cascade foothills of Peterson Ridge as part of that \neffort. They see the development of a better cycling route to Bend as a \nvital addition to the menu of recreation opportunities in the area.\n  Community and business leaders from across Deschutes County have \nworked for the past two years on ideas like those developed in Sisters. \nThey came together recently to formally launch an effort to create the \nThree Sisters Scenic Bikeway--a scenic bike route connecting each of \nthe cities in that county, via cycling-friendly routes that take you \npast spectacular scenery.\n  Government officials are pitching in too. The Oregon Department of \nTransportation and the U.S. Forest Service are working together to \nimplement the committee's vision of a paved bike path connecting Bend \nto Sunriver. The Forest Service is about halfway through their decision \nmaking process on a paved path from Sunriver out to Lava Lands Visitors \nCenter, and ODOT is pursuing a variety of funding options to get the \nwork done while crews are still working on the major reconstruction of \nHighway 97 nearby.\n  As we rebuild our country's infrastructure and seek new ways to \ncreate jobs, we would do well to follow the lesson of Deschutes County \nand The Three Sisters Scenic Bikeway. It was an idea that was first \nproposed by concerned members of the community. It answers local needs \nand they have a lot of confidence it will work. And as representatives \nof those communities, my colleagues and I have the ability to help \nwater the seeds of those ideas when government can help out.\n\n[[Page S13875]]\n\n  This kind of collaborative effort by local groups can be the kind of \nnational model other struggling rural communities should consider as \nthey work to rebuild their infrastructure and economies. Cities across \nAmerica are realizing that investing in outdoor recreation options like \nbikeways is an affordable way to significantly improve their quality of \nlife and, in the process, improve their competitiveness to attract new \nbusinesses and jobs.\n  It is time to remember that our infrastructure can't just be focused \non ways to bring more cars onto our already stressed roads. Fixing \nhighways and bridges is critically important, but for better health, \nrelaxation, and the economic benefits they can bring, bikeways can also \nbe part of the solution to fix our infrastructure and help revive \nstruggling communities back home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13875-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13875-S13878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RESPONSE TO SLATE ARTICLE BY JACOB WEISBERG\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address an article \nwritten by Jacob Weisberg for Slate magazine on December 12, 2009. This \narticle is entitled, ``Are Republicans Serious About Fixing Health \nCare? No, and here's the proof.'' In this article, Mr. Weisberg \nunfairly and misleadingly takes aim at my position in the current \nhealth reform debate.\n  The author reports that I have criticized the Reid bill for creating \nan ``indefensible new entitlement'' and that it ``expands the deficit, \nthreatens Medicare, and does too little to restrain health care \ninflation.''\n  I don't dispute Mr. Weisberg attributing these criticisms of the Reid \nbill to me. But, Mr. Weisberg can't dispute these serious shortcomings \nof the Reid bill that I and other Members on this side of the aisle \nhave been discussing on the Senate floor for the past weeks. In fact, \nboth the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and the \nindependent Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, Chief Actuary \nhave confirmed that the Reid bill would not only establish this \nindefensible new entitlement, but also represent the largest expansion \nof government-run health care in history. But let me go through each \ncriticism of the Reid bill that Mr. Weisberg has correctly reported.\n  The Reid bill will expand the deficit. Mr. Weisberg identifies the \n10-year CBO score of the bill to be $848 billion, but that is comprised \nof 10 years of Medicare cuts and tax increases and only 6 years of \noutlays. So if he were intellectually honest, Mr. Weisberg would have \nused the cost of 10 years of outlays, which budget analysts assume to \nbe closer to $2.5 trillion. But the use of budget gimmickry does not \nend there when supporters of the Reid bill claim that it is deficit \nneutral.\n  One of the biggest problems in Medicare that we have to address in \nCongress every year is the Medicare physician payment formula or the \nsustainable growth rate, SGR. Comprehensively fixing the SGR costs well \nover $200 billion. Only providing a two-month temporary patch for the \nproblem will result in a more than 20-percent drop in Medicare \nphysician payments beginning in March of next year. To me and many \nother Members of Congress, health care reform includes fixing the SGR \nso that physicians can be assured of not facing drastic Medicare \npayment cuts year after year and so that beneficiaries can be assured \nof having access to physicians. But there is no SGR fix in the Reid \nbill. Do the math and you will see why. A comprehensive SGR fix of over \n$200 billion would wipe away the $132 billion in budgetary savings that \nthe Reid bill is currently reported to have.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office noted that the estimated \ncost of repealing the SGR and replacing it with a permanent freeze \nwould be about $207 billion once physician-administered drugs were \nremoved from the calculation of the SGR formula. That was done in the \nphysician rule that CMS finalized on October 30, 2009. However, \naccording to CBO, the removal of those drugs from the SGR formula will \nincrease Medicare's spending for physician services, as well as federal \nspending under TRICARE by $78 billion over the 2010-2019 period. The \nnet impact on the budget would be close to $300 billion over 10 years, \nnone of which is reflected in the Reid bill.\n  And let's take a look at what is in the bill. I certainly hope Mr. \nWeisberg did when he wrote his article. A good portion of the budgetary \nsavings in the Reid bill is from the CLASS Act. This program apparently \nproduces budgetary savings during the first 10 years, but only because \nno benefits pay out for the first 5 years. This makes the revenues \noutpace the program's outlays. But CBO has stated that outlays will \noutpace revenues after the first 10 years. This means that the CLASS \nact will result in deficit spending over the long run. In fact, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, a Democrat, called the CLASS Act a \nmassive government ponzi scheme. So this casts serious doubt on those \nwho tout that the Reid bill is deficit neutral or saves money.\n  The Reid bill also threatens Medicare. I don't think Mr. Weisberg can \nargue that close to $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts won't jeopardize \nbeneficiary access to care. Even the White House's own Chief Actuary \nconfirmed that the Reid bill jeopardizes beneficiary access to care. He \nraised concerns in particular about two categories of these Medicare \ncuts. First, the Chief Actuary warned about the permanent productivity \nadjustments to annual payment updates. Under the Reid bill, these \nproductivity adjustments automatically cut annual Medicare payment \nupdates based on productivity measures of the entire economy. Referring \nto these cuts, he wrote that ``the estimated savings . . . may be \nunrealistic.'' In his analysis of these provisions, Medicare's own \nChief Actuary stated, ``it is doubtful that many could improve their \nown productivity to the degree achieved by the economy at large,'' and \nthat they ``are not aware of any empirical evidence demonstrating the \nmedical community's ability to achieve productivity improvements equal \nto those of the overall economy.'' In fact, the Chief Actuary's \nconclusion is that it would be difficult for providers to even remain \nprofitable over time as Medicare payments fail to keep up with the \ncosts of caring for beneficiaries. Ultimately, the Chief Actuary's \nconclusion is that providers who rely on Medicare might end their \nparticipation in Medicare, ``possibly jeopardizing access to care for \nbeneficiaries.''\n  The Chief Actuary even has numbers to back up these statements. His \noffice ran simulations of the effects of these drastic and permanent \ncuts. And based on these simulations, the Chief Actuary found that \nduring the first 10 years, `` 20 percent of Medicare Part A providers \nwould become unprofitable as a result of the productivity \nadjustments.'' That's one out of five hospitals, nursing homes and \nhospices. It is for this reason that the Chief Actuary found, \n``reductions in payment updates based on economy-wide productivity \ngains, are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent annual basis.''\n  The second category of Medicare cuts that the Chief Actuary raised \nconcerns about would be imposed by the new Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard created in the Reid bill. This is the new body of unelected \nofficials that would have broad authority to make even further cuts in \nMedicare. These additional cuts in Medicare would be driven by \narbitrary cost growth targets. This board would have the authority to \nimpose further automatic Medicare cuts even absent any Congressional \naction. The Chief Actuary gave a reality check to this proposal. He \nshowed how tall an order the Reid bill's target for health care cost \ngrowth actually is. According to the HHS Chief Actuary, limiting cost \ngrowth to a level below medical price inflation ``would represent an \nexceedingly difficult challenge.'' He pointed out in this analysis that \nMedicare cost growth was below this target in only 4 of the last 25 \nyears.\n  The HHS Chief Actuary also pointed out that the backroom deals that \ncarved out certain types of providers would complicate this board's \nefforts to cut Medicare cost growth. According to the analysis, ``[t]he \nnecessary savings would have to be achieved primarily through changes \naffecting physician services, Medicare Advantage payments and Part D.'' \nSo providers like hospitals will escape from this board's cuts at the \nexpenses of doctors, seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans and \nseniors who will pay higher premiums for their Medicare drug coverage. \nIf we surveyed the nation's seniors, I doubt very much they would say \nthat raising their premiums for Medicare drug coverage or limiting \npreventive benefits in Medicare Advantage is\n\n[[Page S13876]]\n\nwhat they would call health care reform.\n  And this board is guaranteed to have to impose these additional \nMedicare cuts. According to the Chief Actuary's analysis of the \nMedicare cuts in the Reid bill, even though the Medicare cuts already \nin the Reid bill are ``quite substantial'' they ``would not be \nsufficient to meet the growth rate targets.'' So this means the board \nwill be required by law to impose even more Medicare cuts in addition \nto the massive Medicare cuts already in the Reid bill. And this will \nmake it even harder for our seniors to find providers who will treat \nthem.\n  Not only does the Reid bill ``[do] too little to restrain health care \ninflation,'' it actually increases health care inflation. According to \nthe HHS Chief Actuary, the Reid bill would bend the health care cost \ncurve the wrong way. Over the next 10 years, the Administration's own \nActuary stated that ``total national health expenditures under this \nbill would increase by an estimated total of $234 billion.'' As a \nresult of that increase, health care would then be projected to grow \nfrom 17 percent to 20.9 percent of the gross domestic product in 2019. \nSo using the Reid bill to curb health care cost growth would be like \nputting out a fire with gasoline.\n  The Chief Actuary also found that a good portion of the increase in \nnational health expenditures would be caused by the so-called fees in \nthis bill on medical devices, on prescription drugs and on health \ninsurance premiums. He stated, that these ``fees would be passed \nthrough to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device \nprices and higher insurance premiums.'' This would result in, ``an \nassociated increase of approximately 11 billion dollars per year in \noverall national health expenditures.''\n  Higher premiums from the Reid bill are no trifling matter. In fact, \none estimate concluded that the Senate bill would increase premiums by \nabout 50 percent on average for individuals without employer-based \ncoverage, and more than 20 percent for small businesses. And even the \nCongressional Budget Office's more conservative analysis predicts that \npremiums will increase 10 to 13 percent for 14 million Americans as a \nresult of the Reid bill.\n  But that is where my agreement with Mr. Weisberg ends. He then \nproceeds to lob several troubling and incorrect claims at me in his \nattempt to portray me as ``incoherent.''\n  Mr. Weisberg distorts what I said in response to a constituent's \nquestion at a town hall meeting in Iowa last August when he accuses me \nof playing the ``age card.'' This is what Mr. Weisberg claims that I \nsaid: ``There is some fear, because in the House bill, there is \ncounseling at the end of life. And from that standpoint, you have every \nright to fear ``\n  But this is what was actually said at that meeting:\n\n       Question from Iowan: ``Thank you, Senator Grassley, for \n     coming. The Democrats tell us all the time that it's a right \n     of every American to have health care. Yet it seems this \n     Obama plan will systematically deny those rights to certain \n     groups like the elderly. And I, as a person in my 60's I'm \n     getting very concerned about the health care that I might be \n     able to have if this bill passes. . . .\n       Iowan Restating the Question: ``Ok . . . [the question] \n     involves limited coverage because of a person's background \n     and age, race, physical condition such as that. Basically it \n     was on the lady's age.''\n       Senator Grassley: ``\"[V]ery recently in things that we've \n     been talking about in our negotiations has been just exactly \n     what you brought up. I won't name people in Congress or \n     people in Washington, but there's some people that think that \n     it's a terrible problem that Grandma's laying in the hospital \n     bed with tubes in her, and think that there ought to be some \n     government policy that enters into that. I'm just on the \n     opposite. I think that's a family and a religious and or \n     ethical thing that needs to be dealt with and there's some \n     fear because in the House bill there's counseling for end of \n     life. And from that standpoint, you have every right to fear. \n     You shouldn't have counseling at the end of life. You ought \n     to have counseling 20 years before you're going to die. You \n     ought to plan these things out. And, you know, I don't have \n     any problem with things like living wills, but they ought to \n     be done within the family. We should not have a government \n     program that determines you're going to pull the plug on \n     Grandma. Thank you all very much for coming.''\n\n  Mr. Weisberg is not the first who has taken what I said during this \nexchange and twisted it to attempt to portray me as a fearmongerer. And \nunfortunately he probably won't be the last. What's even more \nunfortunate is that Mr. Weisberg and those like him fail to see the \nlegitimate cause for concern when you have a combination of the \nexpanded role of government in health care generally plus funding for \nadvance care planning consultations alongside cost containment \nproposals. Some commentators took my comments and twisted them and even \nquoted me as saying the House health care reform bill would establish \ndeath panels, and this was blatantly incorrect. As you can see from \nwhat was said at the town meeting, I said no such thing. As I said \nthen, putting end-of-life consultations alongside cost containment and \ngovernment-run health care causes legitimate concern.\n  And to address another point that Mr. Weisberg makes, a provision \nthat provided for the option of advance care planning was in a bill I \nsupported. In 2003, Congress enacted a narrow provision to offer \ncoverage for hospice consultation services for Medicare beneficiaries \nwho have been diagnosed as terminally ill. Under this provision, this \nconsultation would be covered only when provided by a health care \nprovider with expertise in end-of-life issues such as a hospice \nphysician. The covered services include a pain and care management \nevaluation, counseling about hospice care and other optional services \nsuch as advice on advance care planning. This provision was designed to \nassure that advice on advance care planning in this context is only \noffered by qualified professionals and done in an appropriate manner.\n  In his article, Mr. Weisberg misses the point. The core of this issue \nis when it comes to advance care planning, what role, if any, the \ngovernment should play. When the government attempts to influence these \nsensitive decisions, it raises the possibility that the government's \ninterests may be different and potentially incompatible with the \npatient's interests.\n  When provisions to increase the government role in advance care \nplanning are included alongside cost containment provisions, it raises \nthe concern that the purpose for the proposal is to save money rather \nthan to ensure appropriate care at the end of life. And that is in fact \nwhat has already happened. This idea of encouraging living wills was \noriginally proposed by the Carter administration in 1977 as an option \nto produce both federal and system-wide savings in health expenditures. \nMore recently, the Urban Institute published a paper in July 2009 that \nidentified proposals like advance care planning consultations as a way \nto help cut costs to offset spending for health care reform. Compassion \nand Choices, formerly known as the Hemlock Society, has also advocated \nfor the inclusion of advance care planning consultations in health care \nreform legislation. Minimizing such an important issue or trying to \nturn it into an amusing story as Mr. Weisberg has done debases the \nimportant discussion that needs to occur on this sensitive and personal \nissue.\n  Mr. Weisberg then criticizes Medicare Part D, which I championed, in \nhis attempt to question my opposition to the Reid bill. In 2003, \nMedicare was 37 years old and functioning a lot like it had on day one. \nIt emphasized treatment, not prevention, not disease management. It was \na horse-and-buggy version of health care compared with the kind of \ncoverage that other Americans received through their employers. Then, \nas now, employer-based health plans often covered prescription drugs. \nEmployers realized it was cost-effective to pay for a relatively cheap \ncholesterol-lowering drug if it meant avoiding a triple bypass down the \nroad. But Medicare beneficiaries were stuck in 1965 when prescription \ndrugs were less vital than they are today. And because Medicare didn't \ncover prescription drugs, they often were forced to forgo medications, \npay out of pocket, try to find an affordable supplemental policy, or \ntake a bus to Canada to get their medicines.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike agreed Medicare beneficiaries \ndeserved 21st century health care coverage, including prescription drug \ncoverage. However, there were still differences on how much the \ngovernment could afford to spend on providing this new benefit. In May \nof 2002, Republicans put forth a $350 billion proposal to provide \ncomprehensive drug coverage to America's\n\n[[Page S13877]]\n\nseniors. The Democrats thought this was insufficient and put forth \ntheir own proposal totaling close to $600 billion. At the end of the \nday, the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution included a $400 billion \nreserve fund for the creation of the drug benefit.\n  While there was bipartisan support for the drug benefit, Democrats \nnevertheless continued to argue that Congress should be spending more. \nFor example, former Senator Bob Graham of Florida said, ``Some would \nargue that this budget includes $400 billion for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. They know full well that $400 billion is \ninadequate to provide an affordable, comprehensive, universal \nprescription drug benefit for America's seniors.'' The late Senator \nEdward Kennedy stated, ``This budget has far less funding than is \nnecessary to provide a meaningful prescription drug benefit for all \nseniors.'' And Senator Tom Harkin stated, ``We need a budget that is \nbalanced, that takes the approach that we need to reduce the debt to \ntake care of the baby boomers and provide for a decent drug benefit for \nthe elderly. Clearly, the $400 billion proposed for prescription drugs \nand other medical reforms is far too low for that purpose.'' Congress \neventually passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \nModernization Act of 2003, Medicare Modernization Act, Public Law 108-\n173, on a bipartisan basis and created the drug benefit that year. In \ncontrast to the process we are witnessing this year on health care \nreform, the final conference report from the MMA passed the Senate with \nthe support of 11 Democrats and one Independent. And yet I can't help \nbut think that if the Democrats had their way on the total amount of \nspending almost twice as much on the drug benefit, then far more than \nthis responsible bipartisan amount would have been spent. And certainly \ndespite the criticism that the new drug benefit is often subjected to \nfrom the left, not even the most staunch opponents of Part D have \nproposed repealing the drug benefit for our Nation's seniors.\n  Now in addition to the bipartisan support for the creation of the \nbenefit, the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries also like their \nprescription drug coverage. Survey after survey consistently shows that \nthe benefit enjoys broad support from beneficiaries. According to \nMedicare Today, 88 percent of Part D enrollees are satisfied with the \nprogram. And the program has come in $239 billion under budget. When \nwas the last time you could say that about a government program? \nFurthermore, the fact that Medicare beneficiaries are able to obtain \ntheir prescription drugs and afford them means fewer hospitalization \nand emergency room visits when diseases like diabetes, heart disease, \nand pulmonary disease are properly managed with modern prescription \ndrug therapy.\n  How is adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare different from \nthe current health care debate?\n  Medicare was already 37 years old when Congress added prescription \ndrug coverage. The Medicare structure was well-established. Congress \nworked in a bipartisan way to set aside the funding to improve the \nprogram and do so without disrupting the parts that already worked for \ntens of millions of people. Don't forget that 76 senators voted in \nfavor of the Senate bill for the drug benefit including 35 Democrats \nand one Independent. We certainly can't say the same for the current \nhealth care reform effort in the Senate.\n  One key difference is the fact that the prescription drug benefit is \npurely voluntary, unlike the mandatory system of insurance coverage for \neveryone proposed in the current health reform bills that is backed up \nwith the imposition of stiff fines on those who don't comply. Under the \nMedicare benefit, seniors who don't need prescription coverage or who \ndon't see it is a good value for the premium don't have to get it. The \ndrug benefit is provided and administered by private entities, which \ncompete for beneficiaries' business. And this competition between plans \nhas kept the overall cost of the program down.\n  And let's not forget what we were trying to do back in 2003 compared \nto what is happening in Congress now. Back in 2003, we were operating \non a budget surplus, and there was bipartisan support to address a need \nby creating the Medicare drug benefit. The Medicare Modernization Act \nmet this need.\n  The situation is totally different in 2009. We are now operating on \nrecord budget deficits. So the goal of any health reform legislation \nshould be to bend the cost curve. But as the HHS Chief Actuary has \nestablished, the Reid bill fails to do so.\n  In response to those who say the drug benefit only added to \nMedicare's expenses, the Medicare Modernization Act also expanded \ncoverage of preventive services to emphasize less expensive prevention \nover more costly treatment. The law created a specific process for \noverall program review if general revenue spending exceeded a specified \nthreshold. And it took the politically bold step of introducing the \nconcept of income testing into Medicare, with higher income people \npaying larger Part B premiums beginning in 2007.\n  Also, Mr. Weisberg makes several additional points about Medicare \nPart D that are simply wrong. For example, he states that the \ngovernment prohibition from negotiating drug prices with manufacturers \nonly raises the Medicare Part D pricetag. CBO, the Chief Actuary, and \nnoted economists have all found the exact opposite to be true. The \nChief Actuary stated that ``direct price negotiation by the Secretary \nwould be unlikely to achieve prescription drug discounts of greater \nmagnitude that those negotiated by Medicare prescription drug plans \nresponding to competitive forces.'' And CBO has concluded that ``the \nSecretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of \ncovered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by \nPDPs under current law.'' Even the Washington Post editorial page has \nstated that ``governments are notoriously bad at setting prices, and \nthe U.S. government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the medical \nrealm.'' What's more, the idea of private negotiation on drug costs \noriginated with none other than President Bill Clinton. Under President \nClinton's plan, he proposed that ``[p]rices would be determined through \nnegotiations between the private benefit administrators and drug \nmanufacturers.'' President Clinton's plan was introduced on April 4, \n2000 as S. 2342 by the late Senator Moynihan by request.\n  Mr. Weisberg also uses incorrect data to compare the 10-year cost of \nMedicare Part D and the Reid bill. Medicare Part D costs do not \n``dwarf'' the Reid bill costs as Mr. Weisberg claims because the true \n10-year cost of the Reid bill, as acknowledged by supporters of the \nbill on the Senate floor, is $2.5 trillion and not the $848 billion \nfigure that he uses.\n  So attempting to portray me as being ``incoherent'' for opposing the \nReid bill even though I championed the Medicare Modernization Act is \nabsolute nonsense.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act did not impose a $2\\1/2\\ trillion tab \non Americans. It did not kill jobs with taxes and fees that go into \neffect 4 years before the reforms kick in. It did not kill jobs and \nlower wages with an employer mandate. It did not impose a half a \ntrillion in higher taxes on premiums, on medical devices, on \nprescription drugs, and more. It did not jeopardize access to care with \nmassive Medicare cuts. It did not impose higher health care costs. And \nit did not raise health premiums for millions of Americans like the \nReid bill will do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe December 12, 2009, Slate article by Jacob Weisberg.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Slate, Dec. 12, 2009]\n\n           Are Republicans Serious About Fixing Health Care?\n\n                          (By Jacob Weisberg)\n\n       Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the top Republican on the \n     Senate finance committee, has emerged as one of the harshest \n     critics of what the right likes to call ``Obamacare.'' After \n     spending the first half of the year working with Democrats to \n     find a bipartisan compromise, Grassley has spent the second \n     half trying to prevent one. He attacks the bill now being \n     debated on the Senate floor as an indefensible new \n     entitlement. He complains that it expands the deficit, \n     threatens Medicare, and does too little to restrain health \n     care inflation. At a town hall meeting in August, the 76-\n     year-old Iowan played the age card. ``There is some fear, \n     because in the House bill, there is counseling for end of \n     life. And from that standpoint, you have every right to \n     fear,'' he told an audience in John Wayne's hometown of \n     Winterset.\n\n[[Page S13878]]\n\n       One might credit the sincerity, if not the validity, of \n     such concerns were it not for an inconvenient bit of history. \n     Not so long ago, when Republicans controlled the Senate, \n     Grassley was the chief architect of a bill that actually did \n     most of the bad things he now accuses the Democrats of \n     wanting. As chairman of the finance committee, Grassley \n     championed the legislation that created a prescription-drug \n     benefit under Medicare. The contrast between what he and his \n     colleagues said during that debate in 2003 and what they're \n     saying in 2009 exposes the disingenuousness of their current \n     complaints.\n       Today the Medicare prescription-drug debate is remembered \n     mainly for the political shenanigans Republicans used to get \n     their bill through. Bush officials lied about the numbers and \n     threatened to fire Medicare's chief actuary if he shared \n     honest cost estimates with Congress. House Republicans cut \n     off C-SPAN and kept the roll call open for three hours--as \n     opposed to the requisite 15 minutes--while cajoling the last \n     few votes they needed for passage. Former Majority Leader Tom \n     DeLay was admonished by the House ethics committee for \n     winning the eleventh-hour support of Nick Smith, a Michigan \n     Republican, by threatening to vaporize Smith's son in an \n     upcoming election. It's worth remembering these moments \n     when Republicans criticize Democratic Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid for his hardball tactics.\n       The real significance of that episode, however, is not \n     their bad manners, but what Republicans ordered the last time \n     health care was on the menu. Their bill, which stands as the \n     biggest expansion of government's role in health care since \n     the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, created an \n     entitlement for seniors to purchase low-cost drug coverage. \n     Grassleycare, also known as Medicare Part D, employs a \n     complicated structure of deductibles, co-pays, and coverage \n     limits. Thanks to something called the ``doughnut hole,'' \n     drug coverage disappears when out-of-pocket costs reach \n     $2,400, returning only when they hit $3,850. Simply stated, \n     the bill cost a fortune, wasn't paid for, is complicated as \n     hell, and doesn't do all that much--though it does include \n     coverage for end-of life-counseling, or what Grassley now \n     calls ``pulling the plug on grandma.''\n       In their 2009 report to Congress, the Medicare trustees \n     estimate the 10-year cost of Medicare D as high as $1.2 \n     trillion. That figure--just for prescription-drug coverage \n     that people over 65 still have to pay a lot of money for--\n     dwarfs the $848 billion cost of the Senate bill. The Medicare \n     D price tag continues to escalate because the bill explicitly \n     bars the government from using its market power to negotiate \n     drug prices with manufacturers or establishing a formulary \n     with approved medications.\n       And unlike the Democratic bills, which won't add to the \n     deficit, the bill George W. Bush signed was financed entirely \n     through deficit spending. While Grassley and his colleagues \n     accuse Democrats of harming Medicare through cost cuts, it is \n     their bill that has done the most to hasten Medicare's coming \n     insolvency. Between now and 2083, Medicare D's unfunded \n     obligations amount to $7.2 trillion according to the \n     trustees. Numbers like these prompted former Comptroller \n     General David M. Walker to call it ``. . . probably the most \n     fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the \n     1960s.''\n       Grassley is not alone in his incoherence. Of 28 current \n     Republican senators who were in the Senate back in 2003, 24 \n     voted for the Medicare prescription-drug benefit. Of 122 \n     Republicans still in the House, 108 voted for it. There is \n     not space here to fully review this hall of shame, which \n     includes Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, \n     Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, and Orrin Hatch of Utah, among \n     many others. Here is Kansas Republican Sam Brownback in 2003: \n     ``The passage of the Medicare bill fulfills a promise that we \n     made to my parents'' generation and keeps a promise to my \n     kids' generation.'' Here is Brownback in 2009: ``This hugely \n     expensive bill will not lower costs and will not cover all \n     uninsured.''Here is Jon Kyl of Arizona: ``As a member of the \n     bipartisan team that crafted the Part D legislation, I am \n     committed to ensuring its successful implementation. I will \n     fight attempts to erode Part D coverage.'' Kyl now calls \n     Harry Reid's legislation: ``a trillion-dollar bill that \n     raises premiums, increases taxes, and raids Medicare.''\n       The explanation for this vast collective flip-flop is--have \n     you guessed?--politics. Medicare recipients are much more \n     likely to vote Republican than the uninsured who would \n     benefit most from the Democratic bills. In 2003, Karl Rove \n     was pushing the traditional liberal tactic of solidifying \n     senior support with a big new federal benefit, don't worry \n     about how to pay for it. Today, GOP incumbents are more \n     worried about fending off primary challenges from the right, \n     like the one Grassley may face in 2010, or being called \n     traitors by Rush Limbaugh. But what happened the last time \n     they were in charge gives the lie to their claim that they \n     object to expanding government. They only object to expanding \n     government in a way that doesn't help them get re-elected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13878-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13878-S13879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as the first session of the 111th \nCongress comes to a close, I believe it is important to correct the \nrecord regarding the Senate's processing of judicial nominations. \nDespite the statements of some of my Democrat colleagues to the \ncontrary, the fact is we have been moving nominees at a fair and \nreasonable pace. The Judiciary Committee has held hearings for every \none of President Obama's circuit court nominees and all of his district \ncourt nominees that are ripe for a hearing. At this point in President \nBush's administration, 30 nominees had yet to even receive a hearing. \nAs the numbers bear out, President Obama's nominees have fared far \nbetter.\n  Allegations that Republicans are delaying confirmation votes ring \nhollow. Democrats control 60 votes in the Senate and set the agenda for \nthe floor. If my Democrat colleagues are dissatisfied with the pace of \nnominations, I suggest that they look to their leader. On Tuesday, the \nmajority and minority leaders announced that we will vote on Judge \nBeverly Martin's nomination to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals on \nJanuary 20. As I have said many times before, Republicans have been \nready and willing to proceed to a roll call vote on this nomination for \nmonths. I do not know the majority leader's reasons for not calling up \nthe nomination sooner. Indeed, I do not claim to know the majority \nleader's reasons for not calling up a number of nominations. Perhaps in \nsome cases it is because my Democrat colleagues do not want to have a \ndebate on the merits and expose to the American people just what types \nof individuals the President has nominated to serve on the Federal \nbench and in crucial positions at the Justice Department. Or perhaps, \nand I sincerely hope that this is not the case, Democrats have been \npurposefully delaying nominees in order to create the illusion that \nRepublicans are obstructing.\n  It bears mention that the average time from nomination to \nconfirmation for nominees to the Circuit Courts of Appeal under \nPresident Bush was 350 days. And that was just the average. The \nmajority of President Bush's first nominees to the circuit courts \nwaited years for confirmation votes and some of them never even \nreceived a hearing, despite being highly qualified, outstanding \nnominees.\n  It has been suggested by some that roll call votes should not be \nrequired for judicial nominees, as if this is something that has never \nbeen done before. In fact, rollcall votes and time agreements for \nnoncontroversial judicial nominees became routine in 2001, at the \ninsistence of Chairman Leahy and former Majority Leader Daschle. During \nthe Bush administration, of the 327 article III judges confirmed by the \nSenate, 59 percent were by rollcall vote. The vast majority of those--\n86 percent--were consensus, noncontroversial nominees who were \nunanimously approved. In short, in 2001 the Democrats adopted a new \nstandard: a presumption that all lifetime appointments receive a formal \nrecorded vote. There is no reason that presumption should change now \nsimply because a Democrat is in the White House. Notwithstanding that \nnew standard, I would be remiss if I did not point out that four of the \nlast five judicial nominees that we have confirmed have been confirmed \nwithout rollcall votes.\n  Over the past month, the Senate has been consumed in a debate on a \nhealthcare bill that would create an enormous entitlement program, the \nlikes of which we have never before seen in this country. Tomorrow \nmorning, the Senate will proceed to a vote on this monumental piece of \nlegislation. It can hardly be said that it has been ``business as \nusual'' in the Senate. While Senators have been focused on health care, \nas they should be, Democrats have seen fit to slip through lifetime \nappointments to the Federal judiciary. Just last week, Chairman Leahy \nscheduled a hearing for two Fourth Circuit nominees in the middle of \nthis historic debate. Both Judge Diaz and Judge Wynn were nominated by \nthe President on November 4, 2009. This is a quick turnaround for any \ncircuit court nominee, and it is especially quick for a nominee to the \nFourth Circuit. During the 110th Congress, despite the 33 percent \nvacancy rate and overwhelming need for judges, four nominees to that \ncourt were needlessly delayed: Mr. Steve Matthews, Judge Robert Conrad, \nJudge Glen Conrad, and Mr. Rod Rosenstein.\n  President Bush nominated Steve Matthews on September 6, 2007, to the \nsame seat on the Fourth Circuit for\n\n[[Page S13879]]\n\nwhich Judge Diaz has been nominated. Mr. Matthews had the support of \nhis home state senators and received an ABA rating of Substantial \nMajority Qualified. He was a graduate of Yale Law School and had a \ndistinguished career in private practice in South Carolina. Despite his \nexemplary qualifications, Mr. Matthews waited 485 days for a hearing \nthat never came. His nomination was returned on January 2, 2009.\n  Another of President Bush's nominees, Chief Judge Robert Conrad, was \nnominated to the seat for which Judge Wynn is now nominated. He had the \nsupport of his home state senators and received an ABA rating of \nUnanimous Well-Qualified. Further, Judge Conrad met Chairman Leahy's \nstandard for a noncontroversial, consensus nominee because he \npreviously received bipartisan approval by the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate when he was confirmed by voice vote to be a U.S. Attorney in \nNorth Carolina and later to the District Court for the Western District \nof North Carolina. On October 2, 2007, Senators Burr and Dole sent a \nletter to Senator Leahy requesting a hearing for Judge Conrad, and they \nspoke on his behalf at a press conference on June 19 that featured a \nnumber of Judge Conrad's friends and colleagues who had traveled all \nthe way from North Carolina to show their support for his nomination. \nThat request was ignored. On April 15, 2008, Senators Burr, Dole, \nGraham, and DeMint sent a letter to Senator Leahy asking for a hearing \nfor Judge Conrad and Mr. Matthews. Despite overwhelming support and \nexceptional qualifications, Judge Conrad, who was nominated on July 17, \n2007, waited 585 days for a hearing that never came. His nomination was \nreturned on January 2, 2009.\n  Judge Glen Conrad also had the support of his home State Senators--\nincluding Democrat Senator Jim Webb--and received an ABA rating of \nMajority Well-Qualified. He too met Chairman Leahy's standard because \nhe was confirmed to the District Court for the Western District of \nVirginia by a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 89-0 in September 2003. \nDespite his extensive qualifications, Judge Conrad, who was nominated \non May 8, 2008, waited 240 days for a hearing that never came. His \nnomination was returned on January 2, 2009.\n  Earlier this year, we confirmed Judge Andre Davis to the ``Maryland'' \nseat on the Fourth Circuit. A brief history of that seat bears mention. \nPresident Bush nominated Rod Rosenstein to fill this vacancy on \nNovember 15, 2007. The ABA rated Mr. Rosenstein Unanimous Well \nQualified, and in 2005, he was confirmed by a noncontroversial voice \nvote to be the United States attorney for the District of Maryland. \nPrior to his service as U.S. attorney, he held several positions in the \nDepartment of Justice under both Republican and Democrat \nadministrations. Despite his stellar qualifications, Mr. Rosenstein \nwaited 414 days for a hearing that never came. His nomination was \nreturned on January 2, 2009. The reason given by his home state \nsenators for why his nomination was blocked was that he was ``doing a \ngood job as the U.S. attorney in Maryland and that's where we need \nhim.'' I think that a 2008 Washington Post editorial painted a more \naccurate picture: ``blocking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing . . \n. would elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit, and it \nwould unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of this question \nagree is well qualified for a judgeship.''\n  It was only when President Obama nominated Judge Davis to this seat \nthat we heard Democrats' outrage over the fact that the seat had been \nvacant for 9 years. Ironically, however, Judge Davis fared far better \nthan President Bush's nominees to the Fourth Circuit. He received a \nhearing a mere 27 days after his nomination, a committee vote just 36 \ndays later, and, finally, confirmation earlier this year. There are \nother examples of Democrats' unreasonable delay and obstruction but I \nwill not detail them here. Suffice it to say that Democrats are now \ncapitalizing on their eight years of obstruction by seeking to pack the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  It has been said that the overall federal judiciary vacancy rate is \nhigher than it was when President Bush was in office and therefore we \nneed to confirm more judicial nominees. But, as the story of the Fourth \nCircuit obstructionism illustrates, that is a specious argument. During \nthe Bush administration, Democrats held up qualified judicial \nnominees--for years in some cases--denying them an up-or-down vote even \nthough the majority of Senators were ready and willing to confirm them. \nAnd, in any event, the need to fill vacancies should not undercut the \nresponsibility of the Senate to properly vet these lifetime \nappointments. As the minority party, we have a duty and a right to ask \nthe important questions that may not be asked by those who agree with \nthe President's point of view.\n  In that regard, we can only process nominees that we have before us. \nPresident Obama has nominated only 12 circuit court nominees, all of \nwhom have had hearings; there are currently 20 circuit court vacancies. \nSimilarly, President Obama has nominated only 19 district court \nnominees, all but 6 of whom have had hearings; there are currently 78 \ndistrict court vacancies. These numbers stand in stark contrast to the \n65 nominees President Bush put forth during his first year in office.\n  I have said many times that I do not wish to engage in a back and \nforth on this issue but I will not stand by while some in this body \nattempt to rewrite history in their favor. Facts are stubborn things \nand despite the statements by some to the contrary, they cannot alter \nthe state of the facts and the evidence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13879-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13879-S13881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NOMINATION HOLDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to \nobject to proceeding to the nominations of Lael Brainard to be Under \nSecretary of the Treasury, Michael Mundaca to be an Assistant Secretary \nof the Treasury, Mary Miller to be an Assistant Secretary of the \nTreasury, and Charles Collyns to be an Assistant Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  My support for the final confirmation of these nominees will rest on \nthe response to concerns I have with respect to Internal Revenue Code \nsection 6707A. A letter outlining these concerns was sent to both \nSecretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman on December 22, 2009, and I \nask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary,\n     U.S. Department of Treasury, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Douglas Shulman, Commissioner,\n     Internal Revenue Service, Constitution Avenue, NW, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman: I am \n     writing to express my disappointment with actions taken by \n     both the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to Internal \n     Revenue Code (IRC) sections 382 and 6707A.\n       On November 18, 2008, I wrote to then Secretary Paulson \n     regarding Notice 2008-83, which changed the rules governing \n     the deductibility of losses under IRC section 382(h). The \n     facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of that \n     Notice raised concerns about the independence and merits of \n     the decision.\n       Treasury's most recent guidance on this same issue, Notice \n     2010-2, raises the same concerns. Accordingly, I request that \n     you provide the Finance Committee with all records relating \n     to communications pertaining to the issuance of Notice 2010-2 \n     between Treasury officials, Citigroup, Inc., or other \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) participants and/or \n     their representatives. Please also provide a timeline for, \n     and documentation of, Treasury and IRS discussions and \n     approvals for Notice 2010-2 as well as any discussions about \n     the impact this notice would have on the tax gap. In \n     cooperating with the Committee's review, no documents, \n     records, data, or other information related to these matters, \n     either directly or indirectly, shall be destroyed, modified, \n     removed, or otherwise made inaccessible to the Committee.\n       I understand that Treasury believes that Notice 2010-2 was \n     justified, in part, because it would help protect the \n     government's interest in Citigroup, Inc. Yet, it appears that \n     Notice 2010-2 may generate billions of dollars of tax savings \n     for Citigroup, Inc. Please provide documentation of any \n     discussions of impact on the tax gap resulting from Notice \n     2010-2.\n       The quick and immediate relief provided to Citigroup, Inc. \n     stands in stark contrast to Treasury and IRS's position on \n     providing relief to small business owners who have been \n     assessed penalties under IRC section 6707A. As you know, \n     Chairman Baucus and I have been working throughout this year \n     with our counterparts in the House of Representatives\n\n[[Page S13880]]\n\n     to provide relief that can only be accomplished through \n     legislation and we expect that legislation to be enacted very \n     soon. As a supporter of closing the tax gap, I very much \n     appreciate the IRS's difficult position with respect to \n     protecting the government's interest in collecting taxes and \n     penalties due and appreciate the IRS's moratorium on \n     collection enforcement activity.\n       However, according to Commissioner Shulman's letter to \n     Chairman Baucus dated July 17, 2009, 72% of section 6707A \n     penalty assessments were imposed on small businesses and \n     small business owners. The penalty is clearly being assessed \n     disproportionately on small businesses compared to larger \n     taxpayers. In addition, the placement of liens on these \n     taxpayers, even though they are not yet being enforced, is a \n     significant threat to their operations. Many small businesses \n     use business assets or mortgage personal residences to secure \n     lines of credit for the businesses. Imposing liens has \n     significant negative implications for a small business that \n     has limited access to capital.\n       I discussed this issue with Commissioner Shulman last \n     month. I understand my staff has also discussed this again \n     with IRS staff since then but that the IRS insists that \n     placement of liens is necessary to protect the government's \n     interest. I am troubled and frustrated by this position. It \n     is inconsistent with the administration's publicly expressed \n     concern about the difficulties facing small businesses in \n     accessing capital.\n       I am also concerned that there is a disconnect between what \n     Treasury and IRS staff in Washington, DC think is happening \n     and what is actually happening in the field. For example, \n     when my staff discussed with your staff the issue of IRC \n     section 6723 being used to justify the placement of liens, \n     your staff denied this was happening. Yet, after providing \n     the name of a specific taxpayer who was subject to such a \n     lien, my staff was informed that there may be a systemic \n     issue in either the Automated Lien System or the Integrated \n     Collection System.\n       My staff has also informed me that some of the assessments \n     and liens are the result of Treasury and IRS regulations and \n     procedures, such as the decision to disallow disclosures on \n     amended returns and the decision to pursue 6707A assessments \n     while other examination issues remain unresolved. Until \n     Treasury regulations and IRS procedures can be revised to \n     clear up the confusion, I request that IRS remove all liens \n     on small businesses resulting from 6707A assessments unless \n     there is a known risk that the taxpayer will evade payment of \n     the penalties. Since the pending legislation will \n     significantly reduce the 6707A assessment amount, liens may \n     no longer be necessary.\n       As a supporter of closing the tax gap, I very much \n     appreciate the IRS's difficult position with respect to \n     protecting the government's interest in collecting taxes and \n     penalties. If the IRS believes that removal of a lien would \n     result in the IRS being unable to collect the penalty amount \n     as revised by the pending legislation, please provide a \n     description of these situations. However, I ask you to \n     consider using your discretion as was done for big financial \n     corporate TARP participants who will benefit from Notice \n     2010-2.\n       I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Please \n     contact my staff with any questions or concerns.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                   Chuck Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to explain my position on the \nnomination of Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for \nInternational Affairs. I voted against Dr. Brainard in the Finance \nCommittee, and I want the record to show that I am opposed to her \nnomination in the full Senate.\n  Dr. Brainard was nominated on March 23 of this year, and the Finance \nCommittee's routine vetting began shortly after that. For the past 9 \nmonths Dr. Brainard has given evasive, incomplete, and inconsistent \nanswers to questions asked by the Committee minority and majority. I \nhave said this before, but every nominee who passes through the Finance \nCommittee has been treated the same for the nearly 9 years I have been \neither chairman or ranking member. Dr. Brainard was treated in a manner \nconsistent with how past nominees have been treated, but she did not \nrespond in a consistent manner. On November 18, the Finance Committee \nreleased a memo covering three basic issues that arose during the \nvetting of Dr. Brainard. The nominee had a chance to review and make \ncomments on this memo before it was released.\n  The first issue covered in the memo involves responses to questions \non the Finance Committee questionnaire pertaining to previous late \npayments of taxes and whether or not the nominee is current on taxes \nowed. The nominee had to submit four separate responses to one question \nas the committee came to gradually discover that Rappahannock County, \nVA, property taxes had been paid late in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. \nThe issue is not that someone forgot to pay their property taxes on \ntime; the issue here is the difficulty the Finance Committee had in \ngetting complete, accurate, and correct answers out of Dr. Brainard. \nCommittee staff spent most of 2009 attempting to get straight answers \nfrom Dr. Brainard, and the whole time this was going on the nominee had \nnot paid her 2008 property taxes. The nominee finally disclosed the \nlate payment of the 2008 property taxes on October 12, 2009, though the \ntaxes had actually been paid in September. Answers on this specific \nissue from the nominee reflect a troubling aspect that is \ncharacteristic of many of Dr. Brainard's answers. Though Dr. Brainard \nowns the Rappahannock County property with her husband, she has \nconsistently avoided taking any responsibility for the payment of taxes \nowed.\n  As I said before, the issue is not that someone forgot to pay county \nproperty taxes on time. Though a chronic inability to pay taxes timely \nis a serious concern, the real problem here is the inability of the \nnominee to be straight with myself, our staff, and the committee as a \nwhole.\n  The second issue discussed in the November 18 memo involves the \ncompletion of several forms I-9, employment eligibility verification, \nwhich is required to document that a new employee is authorized to work \nin the United States. The nominee will tell you that all of her \nemployees are eligible to work in the United States, and I do not \ndispute that. As before the issue here is the inability of the nominee \nto respond in a straightforward manner to questions. Additionally, the \nnumber of forms I-9 produced by the nominee with significant \nirregularities was very unusual. The committee released six different \nforms I-9 with irregularities. The committee memo discusses each of \nthese, but possibly the most problematic is one form where it appears \nthat dates have been written over to change the year. When questioned \nby committee staff about these forms I-9 in a meeting with the nominee \nand her accountant, the accountant asked to speak to the nominee alone, \nwithout committee staff in the room. The nominee sent a letter to \nmyself and Chairman Baucus apologizing for the irregularities but \noffering no substantive explanation for many of them.\n  The third issue discussed in the Finance Committee memo involves the \nnominee's deduction of one-sixth of her household expenses from \npartnership income as an office-in-home deduction. Committee staff \nsimply asked the nominee to show how she determined that one-sixth was \nthe appropriate percentage, and the nominee has provided many different \nanswers to this question. The Finance Committee memo summarizes Dr. \nBrainard's attempts to explain her office-in-home deduction with a \nvariety of formulas adding up to a variety of answers. As before, the \nreal issue here is not what percentage the nominee should have used to \ncalculate her office-in-home deduction; the issue is the inability of \nthe nominee to respond to what should be simple questions in a \nstraightforward way.\n  As the committee memo notes, on her 2008 partnership return, the \nnominee reduced the size of her office-in-home deduction by half from \none-sixth to one-twelth. Dr. Brainard said that this change was made \nbecause committee staff had been asking questions regarding her earlier \nuse of the office-in-home deduction. The nominee did not amend her \npartnership returns for 2005, 2006, and 2007 where an office-in-home \ndeduction of one-sixth was taken. I am not able to say that either \nnumber is correct or incorrect because the nominee provided several \ncontradictory answers to this question.\n  As I have been saying, the larger issue here is not that someone was \nlate in paying county property taxes, or the appropriate size of an \noffice-in-home deduction. The larger issue is the apparent \nunwillingness or inability of a person, nominated by the President, to \nanswer questions asked by a standing committee of the Senate in a \nstraightforward manner. The reason Dr. Brainard's nomination took a \nfull 9 months to the day to be discharged by the Finance Committee is \nthat she spent 9 months giving evasive, incomplete, and inconsistent \nanswers to committee staff in response to what are generally routine \nquestions.\n  The only thing that is perhaps even more troubling than a nominee who\n\n[[Page S13881]]\n\ndoesn't seem to take the vetting done by a Senate Committee seriously \nis the reaction we have seen by others, including some who serve in \nthis body. Some apparently see the due diligence and vetting done on \nnominees as an assembly line that produces a guaranteed outcome.\n  We have seen what I believe to be political operatives from outside \nthe Senate selectively leak information in a effort to target the \nFinance Committee's process of vetting nominees and even the specific \nstaffers who carry out this work. These political operatives have had a \nlot of work to do, as Dr. Brainard is the fifth nominee from the \ncurrent administration to run into significant problems during the \nFinance Committee vetting process. The Finance Committee vetting \nprocess has not changed in the nearly 9 years I have been chairman or \nranking member. What has changed are the specific nominees and the \napparent willingness of some to tolerate and excuse issues that would \nhave disqualified nominees from the previous administration.\n  Nominees in the previous administration would have had trouble \ngarnering support if they had these sorts of problems, and I made it \nclear my job was not to defend a problematic nominee. Most people do \nnot know about these problematic nominees from the past because in some \ncases they did not get a hearing and in others they were not nominated \nin the first place.\n  There is only one person who could tell us why the vetting process \nfor this nominee took so long, and that person is Lael Brainard.\n  I have been trying to ask her questions for 9 months now without much \nsuccess, so now my questions are for the critics of the Finance \nCommittee process and those determined to see this nominee confirmed no \nmatter what.\n  How long should we allow a nominee to provide incomplete and \ncontradictory answers before we simply decide that person ought to be \nconfirmed anyway?\n  Who is important enough not to be obligated to follow the same rules \nand obligations as all other nominees?\n  What high government official is so important that they ought to be \nexempt from the burden of routine Congressional oversight?\n  Is knowing the right people a substitute for simple honesty and \nstrength of character?\n  As for myself, I am going to answers these questions by reiterating \nmy opposition to the nomination.\n  I, Senator Chuck Grassley, do not object to proceeding to the \nnominations of Lael Brainard to be Under Secretary of the Treasury, \nMichael Mundaca to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Mary \nMiller to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and Charles \nCollyns to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13881-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO TARAS G.

In accordance with section 502(e) of the Act, I have \ndetermined that the designations of Croatia and Equatorial Guinea as \nbeneficiary developing countries under the GSP program should be \nterminated, effective January 1, 2011.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, December 23, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13881-5", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13881-S13882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 1:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker pro \ntempore (Mr. Van Hollen) has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n\n[[Page S13882]]\n\n\n       H.R. 4284.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain disaster tax relief provisions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I have introduced a bill to extend \ndeadlines for a number of provisions in the Heartland Disaster Tax \nRelief Act of 2008, as well as a number of national disaster tax relief \nprovisions, through 2010.\n  The Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act has been critical in rebuilding \nthe lives and communities of those affected by the terrible floods and \ntornadoes from last year.\n  Because of delays in Federal funding and tighter credit conditions, \nmany individuals, families, and businesses affected by the 2008 floods \nand storms will be unable to meet the deadline for the tax relief \nintended to help with recovery.\n  Louisiana is still rebuilding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \nCongress extended tax incentives for that disaster twice, and might \neven extend them a third time. I am just proposing a second year of the \nsame kind of tax incentives that have been in effect for Hurricane \nKatrina victims for over 4 years.\n  This is especially important when small businesses are struggling to \nrecover, and small businesses create 70 percent of all net new jobs.\n  It is only fair to extend the deadlines and give these individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses the chance to recover and rebuild.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2928\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Heartland Disaster Tax \n     Relief Extension Act of 2009''.\n\n                   TITLE I--HEARTLAND DISASTER AREAS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to prohibit secret modifications and revocations of \nthe law, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today Senator Whitehouse and I will \nintroduce the Executive Order Integrity Act of 2009. The bill prevents \nsecret changes to published Executive Orders by requiring the President \nto place a notice in the Federal Register when he has modified or \nrevoked a published Order. Through this simple measure, the bill takes \nan important step toward reversing the growth of secret law in the \nexecutive branch.\n  The principle behind this bill is straightforward. It is a basic \ntenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law. \nIndeed, the notion of ``secret law'' has been described in court \nopinions and law treatises as ``repugnant'' and ``an abomination.'' \nThat's why the laws passed by Congress have historically been matters \nof public record.\n  But the law that applies in this country includes more than just \nstatutes. It includes regulations, the controlling legal \ninterpretations of courts and the executive branch, and certain \nPresidential directives. As we learned at a hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Constitution Subcommittee that I chaired last year, some of \nthis body of executive and judicial law was increasingly kept secret \nfrom the public, and too often from Congress as well, under the Bush \nadministration. The administration concealed Department of Justice \nlegal opinions and interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court.\n  The shroud of secrecy extended to Executive Orders and other \nPresidential directives that carry the force of law. The Federal \nRegister Act requires the President to publish any Executive Orders \nthat have general applicability and legal effect. But through the \ndiligent efforts of my colleague Senator Whitehouse, we learned in late \n2007 that the Department of Justice took the position that a President \ncan ``waive'' or ``modify'' any Executive Order without any notice to \nthe public or Congress--simply by not following it. In other words, \neven in cases where the President is required to make the public, the \nPresident can change the law in secret.\n  The Office of Legal Counsel memorandum that contains this position is \nstill classified, but Senator Whitehouse convinced the Department of \nJustice to declassify certain propositions in the memorandum. Among \nthem is the proposition that ``[w]henever [the President] wishes to \ndepart from the terms of a previous executive order,'' he may do so, \nbecause ``an executive order cannot limit a President.'' And he doesn't \nhave to change the executive order, or give notice that he is violating \nit, because by ``depart[ing] from the executive order,'' the President \n``has instead modified or waived it.''\n  Now, no one disputes that a President can withdraw or revise an \nExecutive Order at any time; that is every President's prerogative. But \nabrogating a published Executive Order without any public notice works \na secret change in the law. Worse, because the published Order stays on \nthe books, it actively misleads Congress and the public as to what the \nlaw is.\n  This is not just a hypothetical problem dreamed up by the Office of \nLegal Counsel. It has happened, and it could happen again. To list just \none example, the Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping program \nnot only violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; it was \ninconsistent with several provisions of Executive Order 12333, the \nlongstanding executive order governing electronic surveillance and \nother intelligence activities. Apparently, the administration believed \nits actions constituted a tacit amendment of that Executive Order. Who \nknows how many other Executive Orders were secretly revoked or amended \nby the conduct of the administration over the past 8 years.\n  The bill that Senator Whitehouse and I are introducing provides a \nsimple solution to this problem. If the President revokes, modifies, \nwaives, or suspends a published Executive Order or similar directive, \nnotice of this change in the law must be placed in the Federal Register \nwithin 30 days. The notice must specify the Order or the provision that \nhas been affected; whether the change is a revocation, a modification, \na waiver, or a suspension; and the nature and circumstances of the \nchange. If information about the nature and circumstances of the change \nis classified, it is exempt from the publication requirement, but the \ninformation still must be provided to Congress so that we, as \nlegislators, know how the law has been changed.\n  That is what our bill does; now let me talk briefly about what our \nbill does not do. First, it does not expand the existing legal \nrequirements, under the Federal Register Act, that determine which \nExecutive Orders must be published. To the extent the Federal Register \nAct permits a certain amount of ``secret law'' in the form of \nunpublished Executive Orders, our bill leaves that framework in place.\n  Second, our bill does not require public notice when the President \nrevokes or modifies an unpublished Executive Order--even if the \nsubstance of the unpublished order is well-known to Congress and even \nthe American people. This bill is narrowly aimed at the situation in \nwhich the American people have been given official notice of one \nversion of the law, but a different version is being implemented.\n  Third, the bill does not require the President to adhere to the terms \nof an Executive Order. Many scholars have argued that a President must \nadhere to a formally promulgated Executive Order unless or until the \nOrder is formally withdrawn or amended, just as the head of an agency \nmust adhere to the agency's regulations. I happen to agree. But this \nbill does not take issue with the Bush administration's assertion that \nany deviation from the Executive Order by the President is a \npermissible amendment of that Order. It simply requires public notice \nthat the amendment has occurred.\n  Fourth, the bill does not require the publication of classified \ninformation about intelligence sources and methods or similar \ninformation. The basic fact that the published law is no longer in \neffect, however, cannot be classified. On rare occasions, national \nsecurity can justify elected officials keeping some information secret, \nbut it can never justify lying to the American people about what the \nlaw is. Maintaining two different sets of laws, one public and one \nsecret, is just that--deceiving the American people about what law \napplies to the Government's conduct.\n  It is my hope and my expectation that the Obama administration will \nnot continue the previous administration's practice of purporting to \namend the law in secret. But even if the administration agrees to end \nthis practice, that will not end the need for this legislation. At last \nyear's Secret Law hearing, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \nOLC testified that during the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s, the \nReagan Department of Justice took the same position: that the President \ncould secretly modify executive orders simply by not complying with \nthem. We can safely assume that the ability to modify the law in secret \nwill hold as much appeal for a future administration as it did for at \nleast two administrations in the past. We can't wait for this to happen \nin order to act, because we won't know that it has happened--the entire \npoint of the practice, after all, is to keep Congress and the public in \nthe dark. The time to prevent this eventuality is now.\n  I commend Senator Whitehouse for his tireless work to bring this \nissue to light, and I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this modest effort to ensure the integrity of our published \nlaws.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13885]]\n\n                                S. 2929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, l have sought recognition to urge support \nfor the legislation I have just introduced, the Justice Against \nSponsors of Terrorism Act. The legislation would amend the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, FSIA, and the Anti-Terrorism Act, ATA, to \nensure that foreign sponsors of terrorism are held accountable to their \nAmerican victims in our courts. These amendments are necessary because \nsome lower-court decisions have deprived victims of terrorism, \nincluding most recently 9/11's victims, of the legal remedies Congress \nintended to confer on them when it enacted the FSIA and ATA, and \nthereby removed a critical deterrent to the financing and sponsorship \nof terrorism. Congressional inaction would leave the victims of 9/11 \nwithout recourse against the sponsors of al-Qaeda and, more importantly \nperhaps, render the FSIA and the ATA ineffective deterrents to future \nterrorist attacks.\n  Recent news reports serve as a reminder that al-Qaeda and other \nforeign terrorist organizations remain dedicated to their declared goal \nof carrying out large-scale terrorist attacks within the U.S. In our \ncontinuous efforts to prevent such attacks, we have appropriately \nfocused our attention on stemming the flow of money to terrorists \nthrough deterrence. As the Treasury Department's Undersecretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence has observed, ``the terrorist \noperative who is willing to strap on a suicide belt is not susceptible \nto deterrence, but the individual donor who wants to support violent \njihad may well be,'' Testimony of Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence, before the Senate Committee on \nFinance, April 1, 2008. Holding them liable for civil damages in courts \nmay be the most effective--and, given the absence of effective criminal \nsanctions, often only--way to deter them from sponsoring terrorist \nattacks. ``Suits against financiers of terrorism can,'' as renowned \nfederal judge Richard Posner recently emphasized, ``cut the terrorist's \nlifeline.'' Boim v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, \n549 F. 3d 685 (7th Cir. 2008).\n\n  As carefully written by Congress, the FSIA abrogates the sovereign \nimmunity of foreign countries and permits suit against them in Federal \ncourt when, among other things, a foreign country commits terrorists \nacts or other tortious conduct that results in injury on our soil. The \nATA authorizes suit in Federal court by any U.S. national injured ``by \nreason of an act of international terrorism'' and permits the recovery \nof ``threefold the damages he or she sustains'', that is, treble \ndamages, as well the costs of suit and attorneys' fees. ``18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2333(a).\n  But a number of lower Federal courts have frustrated Congress's \nintent by erecting unfounded jurisdictional barriers to suit. No such \ndecision is more significant in its effect than the Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit's In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, \n538 F. 3d 71 (2d Cir. 2009). That decision arose from litigation \nbrought by the victims of the 9/11 attacks, including family members of \nthe nearly 3,000 innocent people killed and commercial entities that \nsuffered in excess of $10 billion in damage to their property. The \nplaintiffs sought damages against, among other defendants, the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia, several Saudi officials, and a purported charity under \nthe control of the Kingdom known as the Saudi High Commission for \nRelief of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Substantial evidence establishes that \nthese defendants had provided funding and sponsorship to al-Qaeda \nwithout which it could not have carried out the 9/11 attacks. Even the \nSecond Circuit acknowledged that plaintiffs had offered a ``wealth of \ndetail, conscientiously cited to published and unpublished sources,'' \nas to the defendants' sponsorship of al-Qaeda.\n  None of the plaintiffs had their day in court, however, for the \nSecond Circuit ruled that the Federal courts have no jurisdiction over \nthe principal defendants. As for Saudi Arabia and its official state \nagencies, the Second Circuit held that they were not subject to suit \nunder the FSIA's tort exception because, having not been designated by \nthe United States as a state sponsor of terrorism, Saudi Arabia was not \ncovered by a separate FSIA exception for suits against designated state \nsponsors of terrorism. Suits arising from terrorist activities, the \ncourt concluded, can only be brought under the FSIA's exception \ngoverning designated state sponsors of terrorism. As for the Saudi \nprinces, the Second Circuit held that the courts lacked personal \njurisdiction over them because, though they ``could and did foresee \n[that] the recipients of their donations would attack targets in the \nUnited States,'' they did not themselves ``direct'' any terrorist \nattacks or ``command'' any ``agent'' to ``commit them.''\n  Both conclusions are wrong. The former is especially troubling \nbecause it establishes an immunity from suit under the FSIA that \nCongress did not intend. A foreign state is subject to suit for its \nterrorist activities under the FSIA's tort exception without regard to \nwhether it is subject to suit under the separate exception for \ndesignated state sponsors of terrorism--that is, without regard to \nwhether the\n\n[[Page S13886]]\n\nUnited States has designated it as a state sponsor of terrorism. The \nSecond Circuit effectively read into the tort exception an exception \nfor terrorist-related torts. Even the Solicitor General, who has \nadopted an unduly restrictive interpretation of the FSIA's exceptions, \nconcluded that the Second Circuit misread the statute on this critical \npoint.\n  The Second Circuit's and other lower courts' decisions on these \nseemingly technical jurisdictional points not only deprive the victims \nof terrorism the compensation to which they are entitled but also \nremove a powerful weapon in our arsenal against foreign terrorism. We \ncan no longer wait for the Supreme Court to correct these errant \ndecisions. The Court's refusal earlier this year to hear the \nplaintiffs' appeal of the Second Circuit's decision in In re Terrorist \nAttacks, despite the importance of the case and the conflicts among the \nlower courts on the key issues it presents, suggests that the Court may \nwell never do so.\n  That is why I have introduced the Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act. The act is main provisions would amend FSIA to make \nclear that, as Congress originally intended, a foreign state may be \nsued under the torts exception if it sponsors terrorists who commit \nterrorist attacks on our soil, without regard to whether it is a state-\ndesignated sponsor of terrorism, and amend the ATA to ensure that its \nanti-terrorism provisions, like FSIA's, are given the meaning Congress \nintended. I urge my colleagues to support these modest, but critical, \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/23/senate-section/article/S13886-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                          committee on finance\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 730) to strengthen efforts in the Department \n     of Homeland Security to develop nuclear forensics \n     capabilities to permit attribution of the source of nuclear \n     material, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Forensics and \n     Attribution Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The threat of a nuclear terrorist attack on American \n     interests, both domestic and abroad, is one of the most \n     serious threats to the national security of the United \n     States. In the wake of an attack, attribution of \n     responsibility would be of utmost importance. Because of the \n     destructive power of a nuclear weapon, there could be little \n     forensic evidence except the radioactive material in the \n     weapon itself.\n       (2) Through advanced nuclear forensics, using both existing \n     techniques and those under development, it may be possible to \n     identify the source and pathway of a weapon or material after \n     it is interdicted or detonated. Though identifying \n     intercepted smuggled material is now possible in some cases, \n     pre-detonation forensics is a relatively undeveloped field. \n     The post-detonation nuclear forensics field is also immature, \n     and the challenges are compounded by the pressures and time \n     constraints of performing forensics after a nuclear or \n     radiological attack.\n       (3) A robust and well-known capability to identify the \n     source of nuclear or radiological material intended for or \n     used in an act of terror could also deter prospective \n     proliferators. Furthermore, the threat of effective \n     attribution could compel improved security at material \n     storage facilities, preventing the unwitting transfer of \n     nuclear or radiological materials.\n       (4)(A) In order to identify special nuclear material and \n     other radioactive materials confidently, it is necessary to \n     have a robust capability to acquire samples in a timely \n     manner, analyze and characterize samples, and compare samples \n     against known signatures of nuclear and radiological \n     material.\n       (B) Many of the radioisotopes produced in the detonation of \n     a nuclear device have short half-lives, so the timely \n     acquisition of samples is of the utmost importance. Over the \n     past several decades, the ability of the United States to \n     gather atmospheric samples--often the preferred method of \n     sample acquisition--has diminished. This ability must be \n     restored and modern techniques that could complement or \n     replace existing techniques should be pursued.\n       (C) The discipline of pre-detonation forensics is a \n     relatively undeveloped field. The radiation associated with a \n     nuclear or radiological device may affect traditional \n     forensics techniques in unknown ways. In a post-detonation \n     scenario, radiochemistry may provide the most useful tools \n     for analysis and characterization of samples. The number of \n     radiochemistry programs and radiochemists in United States \n     National Laboratories and universities has dramatically \n     declined over the past several decades. The narrowing \n     pipeline of qualified people into this critical field is a \n     serious impediment to maintaining a robust and credible \n     nuclear forensics program.\n       (5) Once samples have been acquired and characterized, it \n     is necessary to compare the results against samples of known \n     material from reactors, weapons, and enrichment facilities, \n     and from medical, academic, commercial, and other facilities \n     containing such materials, throughout the world. Some of \n     these samples are available to the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency through safeguards agreements, and some \n     countries maintain internal sample databases. Access to \n     samples in many countries is limited by national security \n     concerns.\n       (6) In order to create a sufficient deterrent, it is \n     necessary to have the capability to positively identify the \n     source of nuclear or radiological material, and potential \n     traffickers in nuclear or radiological material must be aware \n     of that capability. International cooperation may be \n     essential to catalogue all existing sources of nuclear or \n     radiological material.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS FOR \n                   FORENSICS COOPERATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the President should--\n       (1) pursue bilateral and multilateral international \n     agreements to establish, or seek to establish under the \n     auspices of existing bilateral or multilateral agreements, an \n     international framework for determining the source of any \n     confiscated nuclear or radiological material or weapon, as \n     well as the source of any detonated weapon and the nuclear or \n     radiological material used in such a weapon;\n       (2) develop protocols for the data exchange and \n     dissemination of sensitive information relating to nuclear or \n     radiological materials and samples of controlled nuclear or \n     radiological materials, to the extent required by the \n     agreements entered into under paragraph (1); and\n       (3) develop expedited protocols for the data exchange and \n     dissemination of sensitive information needed to publicly \n     identify the source of a nuclear detonation.\n\n     SEC. 4.
