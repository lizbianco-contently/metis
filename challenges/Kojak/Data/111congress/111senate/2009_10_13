Mr. President, is there anything more tragic than a \npreventable catastrophe? Probably not. What is more shameful than \nhaving the ability to stop a disaster and not using that power? Ancient \nand recent history is saturated with examples of nations standing idly \nby while threats escalate and storm clouds gather on the horizon. Too \nmany times we have learned by example what not to do when we see \ntragedy pass before our eyes. Today is no different.\n  Today we face two kinds of preventable tragedies--one on a personal \nscale and one on a national scale. There are preventable deaths. There \nare examples of preventable deaths in every city in Nevada and every \nState in the Union. Stories of preventable deaths fill our mail boxes \nand our media.\n  In many of these cases we can draw a direct line from an American's \ndeath to the lack of decent health care. In almost all of those cases, \nwe can draw another direct line from their lack of decent health care \nto our broken health insurance system.\n  A startling new book by T.R. Reid called ``The Healing of America'' \ntraces his travels throughout the developed world and contrasts our \nhealth care\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\nsystem with far more successful, affordable, and equitable health care \nsystems in several industrialized nations. He approaches this story in \na unique way. He has a bad shoulder. He had had it repaired 10 or 12 \nyears before. It started giving him some trouble, so he started in the \nUnited States asking what to do about his shoulder.\n  He was told what to do in America. Then he went to France and Japan, \nall over the world, and was told what not to do with his shoulder. In \nthe process of talking about his shoulder, he talks about the health \ncare system in every one of those countries. There are some startling \nthings.\n  The phrase ``socialized medicine'' was developed by the insurance \nindustry when President Truman said he wanted to do health care reform. \nIt is interesting that the kind of care they have in different parts of \nthe world is so uniquely described in this book. For example, Germany \nhas had government-sponsored health care since the 1880s, which I think \nis very interesting--I say this with some degree of sarcasm--by the \ngreat socialist Bismarck. He was about as far as one could get from a \nsocialist, but he believed health care should be delivered in a \nChristian way, as he said it. That system is one that has been copied \nin various parts of the world to some degree or another.\n  It is an interesting book, and I recommend it to every Senator. It \nopens telling the story of a woman by the name of Nikki White who died \nat 32 years of age. The official medical records show that she died \nfrom complications of lupus; but if we asked her doctor, the doctor \nwould tell everyone Nikki died from complications of our health care \nsystem. We know how to treat lupus. America is home to millions of \ndoctors and thousands of hospitals that can help someone with lupus \nlive a longer life. America has developed the science and the medicine \nand the therapies that let people with lupus live full, active lives. \nBut because Nikki's health insurance company refused to cover her once \nshe got sick and because Nikki's income was too much for Medicaid but \ntoo little for her medicine's cost, she was stranded.\n  This story is tragic because Nikki died a preventable death in the \nrichest Nation in the history of the world. It is even more tragic \nbecause it is not the only one of its kind, not by a long shot. All \nover America people are dying too soon. There are lots of others just \nlike it.\n  Conditions that should be fixable are now fatal. Easily treatable \ndiseases now become death sentences. More and more, Americans who come \ndown with the flu or are diagnosed with diabetes or suffer a stroke are \ndying far earlier than modern science says they should have to die. \nMore and more, Americans who contract skin cancer or have a hernia or \nexperience complications during surgery are dying rather than being \ncured.\n  These diseases can strike anyone. In fact, more than half of all \nAmericans live with at least one chronic condition, and those \nconditions cause 70 percent of the deaths in America. A group called \nthe Commonwealth Fund researches ways our health insurance system can \nwork better. It recently ranked 19 industrialized countries on how they \nhandle preventable deaths. The United States ranked 19th--at the very \nbottom.\n  Their study also found that as many as 100,000 American lives could \nbe saved if we admitted some health care systems work better than \nothers and borrowed some of the best ideas that make them work. This is \n100,000 lives a year. By the way, we are paying for the privilege.\n  Over the past 8 years of inaction the price of staying healthy in \nAmerica rose to record levels. The number of Americans who can't afford \ninsurance also rose to record levels. At least one in five Nevadans has \nno health insurance. Those who do have it are at great risk of losing \nit. If we don't act, in 10 years health care costs will more than \ndouble what they are today. The number of Nevadans who can't afford \nhealth insurance will double as well. If we don't act, more Americans \nwill suffer needlessly.\n  That Americans are dying preventable deaths is one of two avoidable \ntragedies I said I wanted to discuss. The second is that some here in \nCongress are preventing solutions to that problem. We have the power to \nprevent this national crisis from growing. We have the power to prevent \nit, just like we have the power to prevent diseases from killing us too \nsoon.\n  We have the ability to treat our unhealthy health care system today. \nFive congressional committees--three in the House and two in the \nSenate--have studied the data, debated the arguments, and proposed \nideas for what to do next. While we listen to the stories of real \npeople with real problems, some try to divert our attention with \ndistortions, distractions, and deception. While we strive to change a \nbroken status quo, some defend it at all cost. While we seek common \nground, some insist on opposing good ideas simply because they are \nproposed by people who sit on a different side of this Chamber or by a \nPresident who comes from a different political party.\n  As former Senate leader Bob Dole said last week:\n\n       Sometimes people fight you just to fight you.\n\n  It is inexcusable to let a preventable disease become a deadly \ndisease. It is equally unacceptable to deny the American people the \nchange they demand. If we don't act, we will not have the luxury of \nsaying later, with regret: If we only knew then what we know now. We \nknow now exactly what we need to know. We know now that deaths are \npreventable. The question before the Senate is, do we want to prevent \nthose deaths? These tragedies are avoidable. The question before the \nSenate is, do we want to avoid these tragedies?\n  The broken health care system is fixable. The question before the \nSenate today is, do we want to fix the broken system?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10334-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when we started the debate over health \ncare reform, we knew what the American people wanted. First and \nforemost, they were telling us health care costs are too high and any \neffort at reform would have to focus on driving down those costs.\n  This meant our measure for success would be fairly simple: Would our \nreform proposals lead to lower premiums and lower costs or would they \nnot? That is why an analysis of the Finance Committee bill over the \nweekend by PricewaterhouseCoopers should give us all pause.\n  The report showed that the Finance Committee proposal that is being \nvoted on today would increase health insurance premiums dramatically. \nIt said this bill would cause health care costs to go up--not down--for \nmillions of Americans who currently have health insurance. This report \nconfirms what many of us have feared: that the bills we have been \ndebating will not reduce costs for the American people, but will \nactually drive costs up--an outcome that is fundamentally opposed to \nthe original purpose of health care reform as we all understood it at \nthe outset of the debate.\n  Specifically, this report shows that premiums for a family policy \nwill rise to about $26,000 in the next decade under the plan proposed \nby Senator Baucus--about $4,000 more than they would under current law.\n  One of the reasons for this is that new taxes on health insurance \nplans, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device makers will be \npassed on to consumers--something many of us, including the independent \nCongressional Budget Office, have been saying all along.\n  The bottom line is this: Americans were asking for step-by-step \nreforms, of the kind I have called for in nearly 50 floor speeches \nsince June. The administration's failure to present such a commonsense \nplan is the primary reason that Americans overwhelmingly oppose its \nplans for health care reform.\n  Americans wanted lower costs and greater access. They never wanted \nthe administration or Democrats in Congress to vastly expand the \ngovernment's role in people's health care decisions, to slash Medicare, \nto raise taxes and health insurance premiums,\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\nas well, and to limit the health care choices Americans now enjoy.\n  The American people are not happy with any of these things, and they \nare not happy with the process they are seeing here on Capitol Hill. \nAmericans are understandably unhappy that a handful of Senators and \nWhite House staffers are about to put the finishing touches on the \nDemocratic proposal behind closed doors, especially after the President \npledged to broadcast negotiations on C-SPAN.\n  The administration did not particularly like what \nPricewaterhouseCoopers had to say about the Finance Committee bill. It \nhastily dismissed this report, just as it dismissed commonsense \nRepublican proposals and the concerns of ordinary Americans throughout \nthis debate.\n  Indeed, the administration and its allies seem to view any opposing \nviewpoint in this debate as hostile. It is perfectly obvious why. The \nadministration does not want to hear criticism because it does not want \npeople to know what its proposals will actually do.\n  At a time of nearly 10 percent unemployment, Americans do not need \nhigher taxes and higher health insurance premiums. Yet one thing that \nis perfectly clear about the administration's health care proposal is \nit promises higher taxes on virtually everyone in America.\n  Here is the breakdown: Under this legislation, if you have insurance, \nyou are taxed; if you do not have insurance, you are taxed; if you use \na medical device such as a hearing aid, you are taxed; if you take \nprescription drugs, you are taxed; if you are a business owner who \ncannot afford to provide coverage for your employees, you are taxed. \nAnd the Joint Committee on Taxation and the CBO have both said that \nmany of these taxes will hit the middle class hardest, at a time when \nunemployment stands at a 25-year high.\n  Add all these up and you get a bill that raises taxes, raises \npremiums, and leads to more government control. You can call this many \nthings, but it is not what the vast majority of Americans would \nconsider reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10335-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Republican \nleader of the Senate, as I have every day, waiting for one thing: the \nRepublican health care reform plan. We did not receive it today. We \nhave never received it because there is no Republican approach to \nhealth care reform.\n  I know we have tried to engage the Republicans in this debate. We \nwaited weeks--make that months--to bring over just three Republican \nSenators who would sit down and negotiate with us. In the end, they \nwalked away. One Senator from Maine is still possibly going to vote for \nthis. We hope she will. I hope others will join her. But it is not for \nlack of effort that we do not have a bipartisan approach at this \nmoment.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky failed to mention when he said we have \ndismissed commonsense Republican proposals is when the HELP Committee--\nwhich is the Health, Education, Labor Committee--sat down to write \ntheir health care reform bill--it went on for weeks--day after weary \nday, amendment after amendment was considered by this committee because \nof the gravity of this challenge--we are literally talking about a \nhealth care system that affects every one of us--and at the end of the \nweeks of hearings and the hundreds of amendments offered, 150, maybe \nmore, Republican amendments were adopted to this bill. The committee \ndecided on a bipartisan basis to accept these Republican ideas and make \nthem part of the final product that was going to be voted on by the \nHELP Committee.\n  Well, wouldn't you believe, at the end of that long process--\nbipartisan process--with Democrats and Republicans working together, \nafter 150 Republican amendments had been accepted, at least 1 \nRepublican Senator would have voted for the health care reform bill \nreported by the committee? It did not happen. There were 150 amendments \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle, and still not 1 Republican \nSenator was willing to stand up for health care reform.\n  So when the Republican leader says, we have dismissed commonsense \nRepublican proposals, we took 150 of them and could not get a vote out \nof it--not a single vote. The reality is this. The Republicans have no \nalternative to health care reform. They come to the floor and they \nquote as their sources the health care insurance industry.\n  For the longest time, the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, came and he \nwould quote the so-called Lewin study. Well, it turns out that the \nLewin study about the cost of health care reform had an element to it \nwhich he did not disclose: The Lewin company that did the study is \nowned by the largest health insurance company in America. So they \nquoted as their source on how much this bill would cost the critics of \nhealth care reform, the people who want to maintain the current system.\n  Today, the Senator from Kentucky very carefully avoided saying the \nobvious. This PricewaterhouseCoopers study he is talking about was \ncommissioned by the health insurance industry. That is why they have \ncome out with it the night before the critical vote in the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  What did they say? They predicted if health care reform went through, \nhealth care insurance premiums would go up. Well, there are those who \ndisagree, people with the Congressional Budget Office and others, who \nbelieve that more and more Americans with insurance--not showing up in \nemergency rooms for charity care, where the cost of their care is \npassed on to all the rest of us--is going to mean there is going to be \na downward push on premium costs.\n  They estimate each of us with a family plan pays $1,000 a year in \npremiums to take care of the charity work that is given out at our \nhospitals every single day. If there is less charity work, it means \nless money is going to be needed from all the rest of us who have \nhealth insurance, and that will help bring premiums down as more and \nmore Americans have health insurance protection.\n  But what do we make of the health insurance industry telling us that \npremiums are going to go up? I will tell you what I think. I think it \nis a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think when health care reform passes--\nand I think it will--the health insurance companies, unless we do \nsomething about it, will raise premiums, and they will point at \nCongress and say: You did it. See, we told you not to change the \nsystem.\n  Can they make good on their promise of higher health insurance \npremiums? You bet they can. There is something called the McCarran-\nFerguson Act. It is a law that was passed decades ago that said two \nindustries in America were exempt from antitrust laws. The two were \norganized baseball and the insurance industry. What it means is, unlike \nother businesses making products such as cars and computers, which are \nprohibited by law from collusion and conspiracy in putting together the \ncost of their product, the insurance industry is exempt. That is right, \nit is the only industry, other than baseball, exempt from the antitrust \nlaws of America.\n  So when the health insurance companies tell us: We are going to raise \npremiums, you ought to listen up, they have the power to do it. They \ncan literally meet in the same room and decide to do it--legally in \nAmerica. I think it is an outrage. I think that law should change. But \nthe fact is, it will not change unless there is a force to change it.\n  What is the force that would keep the health insurance companies \nhonest, stop them from this collusion, create real competition to \nprotect consumers, stop them from raising premiums in a fit of pique \nover health care reform? It is called the public option. It says there \nought to be for every American at least one not-for-profit insurance \ncompany available to sell you health insurance. You do not have to take \nit.\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nYou may decide you do not want any part of it because it is a public \noption or a not-for-profit option, but it ought to be your choice. If \nyou have that not-for-profit option--that does not have dramatic \noverhead costs because they hire scores of people to say ``no'' when \nyou turn in a claim, that does not have significant amounts of money \nthey spend each year for advertising, that does not have multimillion-\ndollar CEO bonuses and huge health insurance policies for the people in \nthe boardroom--we believe the costs would be lower and we believe that \ncompetition will force the health insurance companies that are exempt \nfrom antitrust laws to play it straight and give consumers across \nAmerica a fighting chance.\n  Well, you know where the public option is today. Let me tell you who \nsupports a public option. Two out of three Americans consistently \nthrough this debate--although they have heard both sides of the story \nand they have been confused by some allegations and others--two out of \nthree have consistently said: Give us that choice, give us a choice, \nlike Medicare, something that is not profit driven that can be a low-\ncost alternative that we can consider--two out of three Americans.\n  But what about the health care professionals? What about the doctors \nacross America? What do they think about a public option for health \ninsurance? Do not take my word for it. Go to the New England Journal of \nMedicine. They surveyed 2,000 doctors across America and asked them \nbasically: What do you think about a not-for-profit, public option \nhealth insurance plan? Doctors, professionals, medical professionals--\n10 percent of them said: We think we ought to have single payer like \nCanada; 10 percent of the doctors said that. Sixty-three percent of \nthem said: We think it ought to be a blend of public and private so \nthere is a public not-for-profit option available to people. What it \ncomes down to is three out of four doctors in America, when asked, \nbelieve this is a reasonable alternative, to have a public option of \nsome kind. So it is not a radical idea.\n  Who opposes the public option? The health insurance companies do \nbecause it means competition in places where they do not have it today. \nIn most of the markets in America, private health insurance companies--\njust two or three of them--dominate the market. There is very little \ncompetition. And the other health insurance companies there cherry-pick \nhealthy people to try to make money, leaving the rest of the people, \nobviously, paying higher premiums.\n  So when I hear criticism from the Republican side of the aisle of the \ncurrent plan, the obvious question is: What do you offer as an \nalternative? Continuing this current system where the cost of health \ninsurance premiums is going up three times faster than wages in \nAmerica, where fewer businesses are offering health insurance?\n  I was home in Springfield, IL, over the weekend. I went to a grocery \nstore, the County Market. There was a lady there. She was offering \nsamples of food. I did not know her. She recognized me. She stepped \naway from the counter, where people were grabbing these little samples, \nand came up to me. She said: Please pass health care reform. I said: \nHow does it affect you? She said: I work for the city of Springfield. \nWe don't have very good health insurance. She said: My health care \ncosts are such that I had to take this job on the weekends out here at \nthe grocery store giving out samples to try to keep up with health care \ncosts.\n  She said: I'm just one person, Senator, but think about me when you \nget back to Washington. Well, I do, and I will. And I will think about \nwhat has been said on the other side of the aisle. When they say they \ndo not want to expand government, listen, we are not talking about the \ngovernment running a health insurance plan. We are talking about a not-\nfor-profit plan that is an option for people. But for those who are \nkeeping score, one out of three Americans today is covered by some kind \nof government health insurance--about 40 million on Medicaid, another \n40 million on Medicare, tens of millions on veterans health care, and \nhow about all the Federal employees and Members of Congress--please \nhold up your hands--8 million of us in a government-run health care \nplan. I don't see a lot of my colleagues running for the exits to get \nout of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It is one of the \nbest insurance programs in America. It has been for 40 years. It offers \nus, in my case, nine different private health insurance plans to choose \nfrom; open enrollment every year. My wife and I pick the plan best for \nus. Our employer, the Federal Government, pays a portion of it. If we \nwant a bigger plan, we pay more. It is administered by the Federal \nGovernment. It has been for 40 years. It is wildly successful. I don't \nhear a lot of people coming to the floor criticizing that approach. It \nturns out to be a good one and a good model to expand, which is what we \nare trying to do in health care reform.\n\n  When the Republican leader comes and says health care reform is going \nto slash Medicare, open the book and take a look at what is really \ngoing on.\n  There are private health insurance companies that came to the Federal \nGovernment years ago and said: We can do Medicare better than the \ngovernment. We can save the government money. So let us offer the \nMedicare policy as a private health insurance company and we will run \nrings around the government.\n  Well, you know what. It turned out some of these insurance companies \ndid, and it turned out to be cheaper, but too many of them didn't. They \nended up overcharging us for basic Medicare, up to 14 percent more than \nthe cost of Medicare--a subsidy to private health insurance companies \nout of the Medicare system, taking money away from seniors who need it. \nSo when the Senator from Kentucky says we are slashing Medicare, what \nhe doesn't say is what we are going to do is eliminate that subsidy \nover time to these private health insurance companies that are frankly \ntaking money out of Medicare, under false pretenses. They were supposed \nto save us money, and they haven't.\n  The Senator from Kentucky laments the fact that pharmaceutical \ncompanies are going to have to pay more and that medical device \ncompanies are going to have to pay more. Can I tell the Senator from \nKentucky that most of them agreed to this? Why would they agree to take \nless money for health care over the next 10 years? Because they realize \nthat if the 40 million uninsured Americans now have insurance and they \nare showing up at the hospitals and the doctors' offices with that \ninsurance, more of their products, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals \nwill be sold and paid for. So they are willing to take a cut in their \nprofits, realizing their consumer base is going to expand. That is the \nso-called slashing he is speaking about.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes. I see the Senator from Georgia in the Chamber.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me address this notion that what we \nare doing happened behind closed doors, which was said by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I know some don't want to leave the broadcasting of the \nfloor of the Senate, which is broadcast by C-SPAN, but one of the other \nchannels is carrying the Senate Finance Committee. It is not behind \nclosed doors. It is right in front of the television cameras. It is \ngoing on right now as they consider the bill they will be voting on \nthis afternoon.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said the administration doesn't want the \npeople to know what is in this bill. Before this bill is voted on, it \nwill be up on the Internet for everyone to read, as it should be. \nMembers of Congress will have the time and the responsibility to read \nit as well. That is the way it should be on something this important.\n  So I would say the bottom line is this: The Senator from Kentucky is \ncritical of what we are trying to do. We have tried to engage the \nRepublicans in achieving this goal. We haven't had many volunteers on \ntheir side of the aisle. I hope that changes. They don't have a \nRepublican approach to health care reform. The arguments they make \nprimarily come from health insurance companies that don't want to see \nchange.\n  But Americans know we need change. We need to stabilize the system, \nget people security, making sure they can\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\nafford good health insurance, that the costs don't go through the roof. \nWe have to end the abuses of health insurance companies that turn down \npeople when they need them the most, finding deep in some application \nform the failure of a person to disclose they suffered from acne as a \nteenager, so they are going to disqualify them from health insurance \ncoverage later in life--and I am not making this up. We know what \nhappens when they put caps and limits on the amount they will spend in \na lifetime, and then people find themselves with a catastrophic health \nsituation, not covered by their health insurance policy. We know more \nthan twice as many people are filing bankruptcy in America today \nbecause of medical bills, and over three-fourths of them have health \ninsurance that isn't any good. That is the reality of staying with the \ncurrent system. The Senator from Kentucky may want to defend that. I \nthink it is indefensible. If he wants to hear it firsthand from a real \nperson, I suggest he go to the county market and look for the food \nsample lady. She will tell him what is really going on in America today \nas we face health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss our \neconomy and the pending termination or sunset of the first-time home \nbuyer tax credit and the potential implications and effects it \ncertainly is going to have on what is at best a very fragile economy \ntoday.\n  First, I wish to reference this morning's USA TODAY business section \nwhere it was reported that existing home sales trailed down in the \nmonth of August off of the month of July. They did note they were \nbetter than August of a year ago but still deplorably low. Of all of \nthe sales that were made in the month of August, 30 percent were \nattributable to the first-time home buyer tax credit. Unfortunately, \nsubstantially all the rest were attributable to short sales or \nforeclosures.\n  I was home Friday. In my State of Georgia, we have a law that says \nthat if you foreclose on a deed to secure debt or a mortgage, you must \nadvertise for four successive Fridays preceding the first Tuesday in \nthe following month in order to foreclose. So every Friday in the legal \norgan of every county in Georgia, there is a section for foreclosure \nadvertisements. I hold before the Senate today all 74 pages of the \nMarietta Journal legal notices announcing the foreclosure on 1,157 \nhomes in a county of 700,000 people.\n  Houses continue to decline in their value because the market demand \nis down. The foreclosures we see today are not subprime loans; they \nwere the loans that were foreclosed on a year or a year and a half ago. \nWhen we read the addresses of these 1,157, which I won't do, they are \nthe addresses of mainstream America and the mortgages that are being \nforeclosed on are what are called conventional loans that were made to \npeople who had jobs, had income sufficient to make the payments, and \nhad downpayments of 5, 10, or 20 percent. These are the good loans a \nyear ago that today are the loans being foreclosed on. In my State, 1 \nout of every 13 houses shows mortgage holders right now behind in their \npayments. Foreclosures are at record rates.\n  The first-time home buyer tax credit is about to expire. What does \nthat have to do with this foreclosure problem we have and the problem \nof declining values of houses and shrinking equities for the American \npeople? It has everything to do with it. We have a great demonstration \nproject in the first-time home buyer tax credit that shows this \nCongress the way to continue and get a recovery in our housing market. \nIn the time the first-time home buyer tax credit has been in effect, it \nis estimated that 350,000 home sales were made. That is 357,000 sales \nthat would not have taken place.\n  What we need to do is look at the value of the home buyer tax credit \nand see whether an extension makes sense and, if it does make sense, \nhow it should be structured. First of all, I say it makes sense because \nwe had modest success the first time. But I think the limitation of a \nfirst-time home buyer at a maximum of $150,000 in income actually \nrestricts us from helping the part of the market that is represented in \nthese foreclosure pages because these are houses of people with more \nthan $150,000 in income who would need to qualify. These are what are \nknown as the move-up homes, the homes the executives and transferees \nfrom around the country sell when they leave their home county and are \ntransferred to a job in another city or another State. We need to \nenergize that market because the move-up market is where the problem \nexists.\n  So I would submit that when we look at the sunset date of November 30 \non the first-time home buyer tax credit, we should extend it--not \nforever but through midyear next year, to the end of June 2010. There \nis a reason for that recommendation. The worst 3 months of the year in \nany housing market anywhere in the United States are December, January, \nand February because it is winter and because it is the holidays. So \nthere is not much of a market to begin with in those 3 months. If this \ntax credit dies in November and then it dies the day before the \ndeclining market takes place, by the time the spring market comes back \nin March and April, it is too late and we will have a protracted period \nof even poorer sales than we have had recently. But if we pass and \nextend the credit through June 30 of next year, we continue to buoy the \nhousing market around the country. If we take away the first-time home \nbuyer limit and raise it to any home buyer who buys a home for their \nprincipal residence and resides in it for 3 years and we raise the \nincome limitation from $150,000 for a family to $300,000, we stimulate \nthe entire marketplace. That has a cost to it, a score of $16 billion. \nThat is a lot of money, but it is less than 3 percent of the amount of \nthe stimulus, and we know from what has happened in the last 9 months \nthat it works.\n  It is very important that we stimulate and continue the existing \nstimulation of the housing market. The recession that began in December \nof 2007 began with a collapse of housing, first because of the subprime \nmortgage failures, but it continues to today, a continuing collapse, \nand the failures aren't subprime, high-risk credits, they are \nmainstream America. There is a point in time when we owe it to our \ncountry, we owe it to our economy, we owe it to mainstream America, \nwhere we know we have a proven program that works, to extend it and \nbuoy the marketplace.\n  I wish to deal with some of the negatives some people have expressed \nabout extending the tax credit.\n  The first negative I have heard in a lot of interviews is: Well, \nisn't all you are really doing is moving forward some sales that are \ngoing to take place anyway? Well, of course. That is the object. The \nproblem is, we don't want them to take place in 2011 and 2012; we would \nlike to move them forward to take place now. We want people back in the \nbusiness of making the decision that it is a good time to buy.\n  Secondly, people will say: Well, it costs too much. Let's look at \nwhat we have done in 2\\1/2\\ or 1\\1/2\\ years in terms of cost to try to \nsave an ailing economy. We have put $85 billion in 1 night in AIG. That \nis a lot more money than $16 billion. The Federal Reserve has at one \nplace or another invested over $5 trillion. That is a lot more than $16 \nbillion. The stimulus, which is a 2-year stimulus, which is just in its \ninfancy of trying to make some difference, was $787 billion. The \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which was passed in October of \nlast year, was $700 billion. Yet we have a proposal that has generated \n350,000 sales, costs $16 billion, that is about to die, where all of \nthose other programs and trillions of dollars have only saved a \ncollapse but not regenerated an economy.\n  So I come to the floor today to ask everybody in the Senate to think \nabout what is happening. Six weeks from now, the tax credit sunsets. \nWhen it fails, the market again will have downward depression on \nvalues, on sales,\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\nand most importantly on consumer confidence. Let's try to slow down the \nrate of foreclosure. Let's help Middle America, which right now faces \ndifficult times. Let's take them out of the newspaper and let's take \nthem back into a buoyant economy that has jobs, has growth, and has \npromise for the future.\n  I submit that an extension of the first-time home buyer credit by \nremoving the means test, raising the income limitation, and extending \nit to midyear is good for America, makes good sense for this Senate, \nand I hope we will find the time before the current bill sunsets to \npass it and do it for America.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the hidden taxes \nthat American families could be forced to pay under the Baucus proposal \nif Congress doesn't cut half a trillion dollars in Medicare services. \nDespite the score we saw last week by the CBO that there would be an \nestimated $81 billion in savings to the Federal Government, the fine \nprint of that CBO letter paints a different picture and raises some \nreal concerns about whether Congress has the stomach to cut $500 \nbillion in services to the elderly and the disabled on Medicare.\n  This point was raised over the weekend. There were several editorials \nthat ran in the Washington Post, Reuters, the Salt Lake Tribune, and \nthe Colorado Springs Gazette, and they criticized the Baucus bill for \nunrealistically relying on $500 billion in savings in Medicare. These \narticles conclude that Congress is unlikely to enact Medicare cuts \nbased on their annual action--our annual action--since 2003 that has \nstopped cuts to the doctors' reimbursement rates under the sustainable \ngrowth rates formula. This is what we call the SGR.\n  In 1997, Congress enacted the SGR formula, which automatically cuts \nMedicare reimbursement rates when annual spending for doctors' visits \nexceeds the SGR target. Every year since 2003, Congress has stepped in \nto prevent these cuts from going into effect. The question should be \nasked whether it is wrong for Congress to prevent these cuts. I suggest \nno, absolutely not. In fact, there is virtually unanimous agreement \namong Republicans, Democrats, and the President that the fixes must \nhappen because the SGR is a flawed formula that doesn't accurately \naccount for Medicare practice costs.\n  The SGR, however, is just one example of how Congress has been \nunwilling to not only prevent cuts to the Medicare Program but also \nunwilling to fix the flawed SGR formula. Except for 1 year, in 2002, \nwhen Congress allowed the 5.4-percent cut to go into effect, every year \nsince then Congress has ``fixed'' the Medicare cut by affixing a Band-\nAid, which has resulted in artificially adjusting the Medicare \nreimbursement rates and pushing larger ``phantom cuts'' into future \nyears. Will this year's 21-percent cut to Medicare provider \nreimbursement rates go into effect? It is highly unlikely. In fact, the \nBaucus bill contains another Band-Aid measure that pushes this year 21-\npercent cut into 2010, with the notion that next year doctors will face \nan even larger, 25 cut under the Finance Committee proposal.\n  While the past is not always indicative of the future, I believe it \nis highly unlikely that we in Congress will witness any willingness to \nmake a game-changing ``audible'' that forces half a trillion dollars in \ncuts to services for our seniors and for the disabled. The CBO has \nacknowledged this in a letter to Senator Baucus when they discussed the \nbudgetary impact of the health care bill. CBO said:\n\n       The mechanism governing Medicare's payments to physicians \n     has frequently been modified (either through legislation or \n     administrative action) to avoid reductions in those payments. \n     . . .The long-term budgetary impact [of the Finance Committee \n     proposal] could be quite different if those provisions were \n     ultimately changed or not fully implemented.\n\n  If, since 2003, Congress had stepped in to prevent Medicare cuts from \ngoing into effect, why should we expect Congress to now take the \nunprecedented step of cutting nearly half a trillion dollars from the \nMedicare Program? In fact, there was an editorial in the Washington \nPost last month talking about CBO's assumption of Medicare savings. \nThey said:\n\n       Many Medicare ``savings'' are probably phony. Congress is \n     likely to reverse them, as in the past. Put in that category \n     about $200 billion in ``savings'' over 10 years from lower \n     reimbursement rates for doctors, which Congress has \n     repeatedly prevented from occurring. A separate $180 billion \n     in ``savings'' from lower reimbursement for hospitals and \n     other providers are similarly suspect. Together, these items \n     provide about half the [Baucus plan's] financing. If half a \n     trillion is waiting to be squeezed painlessly out of \n     Medicare, why wait for health care reform? If, as Obama \n     repeatedly insists, Medicare overspending is breaking the \n     budget, why hasn't he gotten started on the painless billions \n     in ``waste and fraud'' savings?\n\n  That was in the Washington Post last month.\n  Just today, on the front page of the Washington Post, it was reported \nthat the SGR fix included in the House bill, H.R. 3200, was stripped \nout of the health care reform bill that passed in three House \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Leaders in the House are citing the $240 \nbillion cost of the SGR fix as the main reason for removing this \nprovision. I believe Congress is being shortsighted in not addressing a \nmajor concern in the Medicare Program--a concern that not only would \naddress reimbursement decreases that doctors have faced every year \nsince 2002, but also the concerns about access to doctors that is \nworrying more and more Medicare patients every day. By stripping this \nimportant provision out of the House bill, Medicare patients are left \ncrossing their fingers in the hopes that the SGR fix will ultimately be \nincluded in the health reform bill. I believe removal of this essential \nand important provision, not only because of policy concerns but, \nrather, because House leaders want to stay below an arbitrary pricetag, \nsimply shows Congress's unwillingness to address significant failures \nin a government health program that impacts the lives of some 44 \nmillion elderly and disabled Americans.\n  We know the government has been promising to cut from the Medicare \nProgram, particularly in the areas of waste, fraud, and abuse, since \nthe Reagan administration. Yet spending continues to rise. There is no \nreason to believe this is going to ever change. I will not support cuts \nin services under the Medicare Program. I will ask my colleagues to \ngive weighted consideration to whether they would be willing to tell \ntheir Medicare seniors and disabled constituents that they voted to cut \n$500 billion from their Medicare insurance. Inevitably, if the Congress \ncannot pass a measure to cut from Medicare, then the money will have to \nbe made up either through increased taxes on average American families \nor in the form of additional deficits that will burden future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, with over $2 trillion spent on bailouts, stimulus, and \ncash for clunkers in just the past 22 months, we must be better \nstewards and more vigilant of the potential for additional costs to \nworking families for expanding government services and creating more \nmandates for health insurance.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                    Energy and Water Appropriations\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I plan on spending some time on the CJS \nappropriations bill, but I want to delay a moment. We are going to have \na cloture vote, whether that is today or tomorrow or sometime, on the \nEnergy and Water Conference Report. I was the one who objected to \nbringing that to the floor and for some very serious reasons. \nUnanimously, the Senate body agreed to an amendment that would create \ntransparency in that appropriations bill. There were no objections; it \nwas a unanimous vote. What we attempted to do was to bring to light, to \nthe American people, not just the 30 Senators who were going to get the \nreports--70 percent of the Senate cannot see the reports--to the rest \nof the Senators and to the rest of the American people, the reports \nthat are requested by Congress on the operation of this appropriation \nauthority.\n  We put in there a very specific exclusion for anything that would \naffect security so those items would not be exposed.\n  There were no significant efforts to hold this in conference. So I \nwanted to explain for a few minutes to the American people and to my \ncolleagues why it is important. What we have here are the following \nreports. The question you have to ask is, why does the Appropriations \nCommittee not want the American people to see this information? What in \nthe world could be a good reason for American citizens and 70 Senators \nto not be able to see this? There is not any good reason.\n  I will go through and list what some of the reports are in this bill. \nThen I will raise the question: Why are we not letting the American \npeople see it? Why are we not letting 70 of our colleagues see it?\n  An annual report on the Department of Energy, on their financial \nbalances, is important information to me. It should be to every Member \nof this body. But it also should be important to every citizen out \nthere who is paying for the $1.6 trillion deficit we have this year. \nActually, they are not paying, their kids are.\n  A report by Chief of Engineers on Water Resources, but the way it is \nphrased, it is on a ``water resource matter.'' In other words, someone \nvery specifically tied that so they would have information others do \nnot have. This is government in the dark; this is not transparent \ngovernment.\n  A report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission identifying barriers to \nand its recommendations for streamlining construction of new nuclear \nreactors. If we want to get to clean energy, that is one way to do it. \nYet the barriers for that construction, we are not going to know what \nthey are. The American people are not going to find out and 70 Senators \nare not going to find out. We are not going to have that made available \nto us.\n  Two reports to report on the transfer of funds within the Department \nof Army, and a report on the transfer of funds within the Bureau of \nReclamation for oversight activities--in other words, a report on the \nfunds that are transferring for oversight, only appropriators get to \nsee that. The American people do not get to see it. I do not get to see \nit. The President pro tempore right now does not get to see it. Only \nthe appropriators. Why would we not want to share that with the \nAmerican people? Is there some reason?\n  A report by the administration on detailed accounting of receipts \ninto and obligations and expenditures from the inland waterways trust \nfund. Well, what most people do not realize is when we put out a number \nthat is our budget deficit every year, that number does not recognize \nwhat we have stolen from multitudes of trust funds, including the \ninland waterway trust fund, which is very important to all of the \nthings that go on along the Mississippi River, the McClellan-Kerr \nNavigation System, the Upper Mississippi River, the Great Lakes. All of \nthose are funded by the inland waterways trust fund--except we steal \nall of the money out of it so there is no money in it. Here is the \nreport on it, and they do not want the American people to see it. Why \nwould you not want the American people to see that we are stealing from \nthe funds we have set up that were supposed to be dedicated to do \ncertain things? Because you really do not want a transparent Congress \nso the American people can see what is going on.\n  A report on remediation efforts by the Corps of Engineers through the \nformerly utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. Most of us do not even \nknow what that is. But the fact is, if we have former sites that \nrequired remedial action, why should'nt we all get to see that? Why \nshould we not be able to make a value judgment on whether the Corps did \na good job and what they are doing with the money? But yet we cannot.\n  A report detailing the implementation and progress of the measurement \nplans for each funded energy innovation hub. We have these hubs out \nthere to create alternative and renewable energy, except we are not \ngoing to see what they are doing. It is not going to be available to \nus. It is not going to be available to the American people, and they \nare paying for it. What happens if there is an idea and somebody reads \nabout it and it gives them another idea?\n  A report by the Secretary of Energy to the Committee on \nAppropriations of the House and the Senate on the state of defined \nbenefit pension liabilities in the Department for the preceding year. \nThat is something we should all be aware of, not just a couple of staff \nmembers on the Appropriations Committee. The American people should \nknow that, in fact, they do not have the money in the bank to fund \ntheir pension liabilities. Yet we are going to suppress that \ninformation. We are going to keep it from the sunshine. We are going to \nkeep it from the light of day so the American people cannot see how \nmiserably the government runs its own business. We do not want that \nout. We do not want you to see it.\n  I could go on and on. I have three pages of reports. Notably, some of \nthem are security related and should\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nnot be released to the American public, which this amendment protected.\n  What this means is that 88 percent of the Members of the House and 70 \npercent of the Members of the Senate do not have available to them the \ntools with which to make decisions. But, more importantly than that, \nthe American people do not have transparency in their government. They \nare never going to be made available for taxpayers to read. They are \nnever going to see how sloppily the money is spent, how we borrow money \nfrom funds that are supposed to be dedicated and spend them on things \nthat are pet political projects. We do not want them to see that. This \nis not controversial. The only place it is controversial is to those \nwho are working in the dark. And the very fact that this did not come \nout of conference with transparency--every other appropriations bill we \nhave passed so far has had this transparency for report language. So \nwhy would we bring it to the floor? We should be very concerned that \nwas excluded from this conference report, for a republic cannot \nfunction, it cannot survive unless it is truly transparent to the \npeople it represents.\n  Our President was elected on the promise of bringing greater \ntransparency to Washington, not only just to the workings of the \nFederal Government but to our daily workings as we tend to government. \nCongress should have supported this effort.\n  I serve notice on the Senate that any conference report that does not \nhave transparency, which I will offer and have offered to every bill, \nthat comes back from a conference, I will do everything I can to block \nit until that is put back in it. The American people deserve no less \nthan that. It is, in fact, their government, not 30 appropriators' \ngovernment. It is not just the 30 appropriators who get to govern this \ncountry. The fact that this piece of good government, of transparency, \nof putting out for everybody to see what we are doing has been \nprecluded sends exactly the wrong message to the American people. So it \nwill be that I will come here again, and I will not give up until such \ntime as the American people truly get to see a transparent government.\n  The President and I passed a bill called the Transparency and \nAccountability Act. You can go to usgovernmentspending.gov and you can \nsee where we are spending money. Sometime this spring you are going to \nsee it all of the way down to the subcontractor, subgrantees level. You \nare going to be able to go online and see where every penny, except for \nnational security purposes, is spent and who got the money. That is \nreal open government. That is real democracy. That is real freedom. \nThat is real liberty.\n  Without that, based on the demonstration that we make here today by \nbringing up a bill that keeps us cloaked in secrecy, that keeps the \nAmerican people in the dark, what we will have and continue to have is \nless and less confidence of the American people as we try to lead this \ncountry back to the greatness it once had.\n\n\n                           CJS Appropriations\n\n  I am now going to spend a few minutes, if I may, talking about the \nCommerce-Justice appropriations bill. This is another in a long line of \nbills that has a double-digit increase in the size of the government, \non the back of a double-digit increase last year, and on the back of a \n$16.2 billion shot in the arm from the stimulus.\n  We were at $60 billion, essentially, last year, and we are going to \nincrease it by $7.59 billion. That is a 12.6-percent, 12.7-percent \nincrease. I brought a chart out here last week. I will bring it back \nagain today as we debate the amendments I have. But not counting the \nstimulus, if we keep passing appropriations bills at the rate at which \nthis body has passed this year, the size of the Federal Government will \ndouble in 3.5 years.\n  I think that is probably just exactly the opposite mood of the \nAmerican people today. Yet we turn a deaf ear to the fact that 43 cents \nout of this $67 billion that we are going to spend--43 percent of it we \nare going to directly borrow from our kids.\n  We do not have the money in the bank to pay for this. We are going to \nfinance it through a lower standard of living for our children. There \nis no question a portion of this increase is related to the census. The \nCensus Bureau is in a mess. We have a good new Director. It was \ncompletely mismanaged by the Bush administration, there is no question \nabout it, by the Secretary of Commerce, and also the Director of the \nCensus.\n  We had a great caretaker who replaced the previous Census Director, \nand he did what he could. Now we have a new, very experienced Director \nof the Census by the name of Dr. Groves, who is handling a very \ndifficult problem.\n  But it is going to come out that it is going to take $60 a person--\nhear this--to count the people in the United States.\n  Please give me that contract for 10 cents a person. Please let me do \nit for 10 cents a person. We are going to spend 60 cents a person--\npardon me, $60 a person, $60 a person to count the people in the United \nStates.\n  Go figure. Let's outline what happened to the Census. The Census \nroutinely uses no-bid, cost-plus contracts. Whatever it costs, do it. \nWell, it just so happens their plan went awry. They paid bonuses to a \ncompany that failed to deliver what was ordered. The Census failed to \nbe clear about what they wanted in terms of the electronic devices. So \nwe have $750 million worth of junk we cannot use. Somebody ought to be \nheld accountable for that.\n  Do you know who that is? That is us. How dare we waste almost $1 \nbillion on one contract, because it was a cost-plus, was not overseen. \nWe did not know what we were asking for, and yet the people who \nsupplied it did not lose a thing. That is a very profitable contract.\n  That is why we have problems in the Federal Government. That is why \nwe have $50 billion worth of waste a year in the Pentagon: because we \ndo not know what we want, and there is no capital at risk for the \npeople who are bidding these contracts. So, consequently, they just do \nwhatever because it is cost-plus. They just send a bill at the end of \nthe month, and we pay it. So we are going to have an $18 billion census \nthat has a high likelihood of being the least accurate census we have \never had. There are probably going to be numerous lawsuits over this \ncensus.\n  My hope is that Director Groves can, in fact, salvage the census. But \nwhen we get it, it is not going to be accurate. It is going to displace \nsix House seats because it is going to count illegal aliens who should \nnot be counted in terms of the apportionment for the seats in Congress.\n  There are 561 earmarks in this bill. Two-thirds of them--hear me \nclearly--go to members of the Appropriations Committee. Is that not a \ncoincidence? One-third goes to the other 70 Members of the body, but \ntwo-thirds goes to the 30 members sitting on the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  The President proposed that two programs be absolutely terminated \nbecause they have zero worth, value, and contribution to the Federal \nGovernment. They are both funded in the bill. The bill is one of many \nwe will pass that will have double-digit increases. I wonder how many \nfamilies right now are seeing a double-digit increase in their income. \nThat is a rarity today in our economy. Yet we put on the floor almost a \n13-percent increase which is about the average of everything else we \nhave been putting out here, in spite of the fact we just spent $800 \nbillion of our kids' money on a stimulus package, and this agency \nreceived a significant portion of that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want the American people to know where \nwe stand financially. The war on terror will not defeat us. We will \ndefeat ourselves. Every known republic to the world collapsed through \nfiscal mismanagement. We can read the history, Alexander Tyler on the \nAthenian empire, several other scholarly works throughout the last two \nto three centuries.\n  What we are really talking about is our kids. They are not my kids. \nMy kids are grown. They are all in their\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\n30s. We are talking about youngsters this age. She makes a great point. \nShe is already $38,375 in debt, and all she owns is a dollhouse. The \nsad thing is, she totally underestimates, because her obligation for \nthings we have promised ourselves for which she will have to pay above \nand beyond income tax rates we have today, Social Security taxes and \nMedicare taxes, is just a mere $400,000. So by the time she becomes 20, \nshe will owe $800,000, if we count the interest which is coming. It is \nnot long before we will be spending a trillion dollars a year on \ninterest. And this number, by that time, will be $118,000. So now we \nwill have her at $918,000 that she is going to have to pay off for us.\n  Think about that as a moral question. Should we in fact cut the legs \noff our grandchildren so that politicians and political leaders today \ncan spin things and avoid making the most difficult choices that we now \nneed to make? If one follows the news, especially the financial news, \nthe problem the United States faces today is the fact that the world is \nlosing confidence in the dollar. There is a reason for that. What is \nthe reason? The world is starting to sense that as we continue to \nborrow more and more billions and trillions of dollars that we will not \nbe able to pay it back. Therefore, the world's valuation of our \ncurrency becomes less confident. Therefore, the cost to borrow in the \nfuture becomes higher. The figure I just quoted, the $918,000 per child \nwho is born over the next 30 years, is based on today's interest rates \nof 3.4 percent on a 10-year note that the Government offers. What \nhappens when the interest rates are 10 or 11 percent? We are talking \nabout a fiscal collapse that has never before been seen in the history \nof the world. Yet we continue to put spending bills on the floor and \nlaud the fact that we are only borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar \nwe spend this year.\n  There will come a time when we can't borrow 43 cents out of every \ndollar we spend. What will we do then? What will happen then? What will \nhappen is the following: We will either see a totally debased currency \nwhich means everything we worked for our entire life will be markedly \ndecreased in value or we will see 15, 20, 30 percent inflation. There \nis no other exit for this other than for us to do the following: We \nhave to start making the hard choices now.\n  This bill doesn't do it. From 2008 to 2009, the fiscal year ended \nSeptember 30, we increased CJS by 15.5 percent. This bill comes back \nand increases it another 12.6 percent. Compound that out and we find, \nwithout the stimulus money they also got, that we will double the size \nof this agency in less than 4 years. I am not sure that is what we \nwant.\n  Here is what we have done so far. If we look at the bottom corner, \ninflation is expected to be less than 1.6 percent. Yet we see the \nfollowing percentage increases: 5.7; 7.2; Energy and Water, 1.4--the \nonly reason it was 1.4 is because they got $45 billion from the \nstimulus--Agriculture, 12.6; Treasury-HUD, 22.5; Interior, 16.2; and \nnow CJS, 12.6.\n  Most families--and I know almost every business--are making hard \nchoices right now about what they spend money on and what they do not. \nThey are in tough times. Somehow that hasn't reverberated to this body. \nIf it has, it has not reverberated to the appropriations committees of \nthe House or Senate. That will be an amendment to freeze spending at \nlast year's level, which could easily be done, but we don't have the \ncourage to do that. There will be several other amendments offered. \nThey are working on an agreement at this time.\n  I will be offering three amendments. I will wait until the Senator \nfrom Maryland comes before offering them. I understand they don't want \nme to call them up at this time. So I will not. One of the amendments \nlimits funding to the National Science Foundation. It has created quite \nan uproar with political scientists that we would dare decrease the \namount of money we spend on figuring out why politicians are vague or \nwhy certain people vote a certain way or the other way. What happens \nwhen we spend money on obvious answers is that money for the National \nScience Foundation doesn't go to cure a disease. It doesn't go to make \nan absolute impact on some child who is suffering from a chronic \ndisease that unless the research dollars are there, they will never \nhave a normal life or lifestyle. In fact, everybody screams when some \nof their money gets attacked.\n  So the political scientists in the country, those who get this money, \n$91.3 million over the last 10 years that we have doled out to \npolitical scientists, that $91 million could have gone to the study of \nbiology or chemistry or pharmaceutical science or fields of endeavor \nsuch as micronutrients or cellular metabolism or genetic manipulation \nso we can cure a disease. Instead, where do they spend the money? \nCampaigns and elections, electoral choice systems, political change, \ndomestic conflict, party activism, political psychology, and political \ntolerance.\n  What are some of the good things NSF does? NSF scientists have \ndeveloped new computer-generated robotics to help people with severe \ndisabilities. They can do what we can do, those of us who don't have a \nphysical disability, except they can now do it with a robot. They \nbecome independent again and get their life back. NSF supported \nengineers that created a bone substitute that blends in tendon tissues \nwhich mimics natural bone and provides better integration so that \npeople with lost movement in their joints have it returned. NSF created \ntechnology with their grants to engineer the next generation of \nbiofuels. We are seeing the science. They created a new type of fiber \nreinforced concrete that bends without cracking. It is 300 to 500 times \nmore resistant to cracking and 40 percent lighter in weight which means \nwe can build bridges that will never fall down. We won't have a \nMinnesota tragedy again. That is the real science from the National \nScience Foundation.\n  Let me give a little hint of what the National Science Foundation \nprojects for political science have been.\n  There is $188,206 to ask the question: Why do political candidates \nmake vague statements, and what are the consequences? We all know the \nanswer to that. They make vague statements because they want to get \nreelected. They do not want to get pinned down. It is not hard to \nfigure out, but we blew a lot of money on it.\n  How about a grant for political discussion in the workplace? That has \nto be an important priority for the country now that we are running a \n$1.6 trillion deficit.\n  Here is one: television news and the visual framing of war. I am \ncertain that is an important research topic that we should sacrifice \nour children's future for, and I know it must be a priority for her, \nthis little girl, whose daddy or mama was smart enough to recognize \nwhat the real consequences of our behavior are.\n  Or how about another study: Why people are for or against military \nconflicts? Nobody is for military conflicts. They are for the defense \nof our country. But to spend money to study why people are for or \nagainst? Tell me what that contributes to her future?\n  I am accused of being a flatlander. I do come from Oklahoma. I was \nborn in Wyoming. But there is one difference with us flatlanders: we \nactually have worked in our lives, we understand common sense, and we \nhave had to make hard choices before.\n  How about this study, the impact of Medicare reform on senior \ncitizens' political views. I can tell you what it is. We take away a \nbenefit, they are not going to like it; we add a benefit, they are \ngoing to like it. Send me the check. I will do it for free. It is \nplain, old common sense. It may be nice to have the statistics behind \nthat, but we all know the answer to those questions.\n  Here is another one: evaluate whip counts. Let me tell you what a \nwhip count is. Every party has a whip so they can count the votes \nbefore they happen so they think they know what is going to happen on \nthe vote, so they know what votes to bring up and what votes not to. We \nare going to have a study by Congress: How do whip counts impact party \nleaders in the legislative process? Who cares. Nobody should care about \nthat. What we should care about is her future. We have our priorities \ntotally upside down and turned on their ear.\n  How about a conference on the effect of YouTube on the 2008 election. \nNow, the people who are interested in that are politicians because \n``how do we use YouTube to get reelected?'' Should we\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\nbe paying for that with your tax dollars? ``How do we keep incumbents \nincumbents?'' I would think a better study of political science is, how \ndo you throw us all out. That is a better use of the funds. How do you \nget rid of us since we are doing such a terrible job managing the \nfinances of this country?\n  Or how about the ``NewsHour'' with Jim Lehrer--to pay for complete, \nlive, prime-time gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Democratic and GOP \nNational Conventions. Guess what. They were covered by three other \nnetworks free. We did not pay them a penny. Yet we pay this.\n  We are going to increase NSF's budget in this bill 8 percent, the \nNational Science Foundation. It is the one we ought to be increasing 12 \nor 15 percent, but it ought to be on real science, on pure science, on \nscience that has an outcome we can measure that is not related to the \nobservation of common fact but is new research that will derive great \nbenefits for the people of this country.\n  So I will be offering an amendment to limit the amount of money. We \nare going to hear all sorts of claims. What we have heard already on \nthe blogs is that National Science Foundation political science \nresearch contributes to our understanding of democracy. I think we have \npretty well figured what democracy is. ``Our ability to have a free and \nopen democratic process would be significantly harmed without this \nresearch.''\n  You know what is being harmed is her generation, as we foolishly \nspend dollar after dollar on things that are not a priority--hundreds \nof millions of dollars on program after program after program that 90 \npercent of Americans could say: That might be fine if we were in a \ncash-rich position, but at a time when the Federal Government is about \nto double every 4 years and the debt is about to double every 5 years, \nwouldn't it be smart to not spend money we don't have on things we \ndon't need? So that is what this amendment is.\n  There is another claim: The loss of National Science Foundation \nfunding will significantly harm political science research in this \ncountry. Let me give you a few facts about that. The University of \nMichigan--they are the receiver of the largest grant under the NSF--has \na $7.5 billion endowment. That is just one of the universities--$7.5 \nbillion--and we are supposed to keep sending, every 10 years, $100 \nmillion for political science research.\n  Here is the political science--here it is: The heritage of this \nNation is that one generation creates opportunity for the next by \nsacrificing, making the hard choices they need to make to make sure \nwhat has worked in the past will provide them opportunities in the \nfuture. This does not do any of that. What it says is, the ones who are \non the ins, the people who are well connected now, the people who are \ndependent on millions of dollars of funding--when they are sitting with \nbillions of dollars in their endowments--are worth more than she is. \nThat is exactly the problem.\n  Until we figure out we are going to have to make some tough \nsacrifices, her future is at risk. Unless we do this fairly soon, we \ncould very well be on an irreversible course. Two or three more years \nof spending the way we are spending and borrowing the way we are \nborrowing will doom her to a standard of living 40 percent below what \nwe see today. Those are not my words, the economists agree. The \ngovernments are going to end up consuming 45 or 50 percent of our total \nGDP. We are at 10 percent this year--the highest in our history with \nthe exception of being in the midst of World War II. Never have we been \nin such shape as we are in today.\n  I think we have a lot of things wrong. But the No. 1 thing we have \nwrong is we have forgotten that service is about sacrifice. Service is \nabout giving up something of you so somebody else gets ahead. We cannot \nexpect the American people to model that behavior if we are not willing \nto do it. If everything we do is about protecting our own vested \npolitical interests and protecting our campaign contributors and \nprotecting the well connected and not excluding and divorcing ourselves \nfrom all of that and making great commonsense judgments, we are history \nas a nation.\n  I wonder when it started. I wonder when it started that we decided we \nwere more important than the country. I wonder when it started when we \ndecided we would push our hand and say: Stop the heritage of this \ncountry. When did it start that we decided we were worth more than the \ngenerations that follow us? When did it start that we decided we were \nnot brave enough to take the hits to make the hard choices so the \nRepublic can be preserved? When did it start? When did that cowardice \nstart because it is ever present now as we go through the \nappropriations process.\n  I ran a business for 9 years, and I learned a lot doing that. I \nlearned a lot about people. But I also learned a lot about making tough \nchoices. We, in fact, can make tough choices and preserve what is good \nand best and brightest in all of us. As a matter of fact, hope comes \nfrom that, when people make those tough decisions that, in fact, \nconsider the very personal nature of how individuals are affected and \nthey are at work for the common good for the long run.\n  You see, there is not a business out there today that is surviving \njust thinking only in the short run. If they are, they will not be here \n2 years from now. They are all thinking in the long run. They are all \npositioning, planning, managing, developing. The same with families. \nThey are doing that right now at the dinner table--positioning, \nplanning, developing what is going to come next: How we are going to \nget where we want to go. We are in a rough period now. What do we cut \nback? What is the thing that we sacrifice today to secure the future \nfor our family tomorrow?\n  Ashamedly, not much of that exists in Washington. What does exist is \na willingness to say yes to everybody, and then wink and nod and try to \nhave it both ways. I am not a both ways kind of guy, and neither is \nAmerica. The great sheet is about to be lifted over the, I would use, \nimbecilic methods of Washington. When transparency gets its full view, \nAmerica is going to make some major changes, and I am not talking \nRepublican-Democrat. I am talking both.\n  This is a problem of elitism. This is a problem of short-term \nthinking by the political leaders of this country on: How do I manage \nmy political career and to heck with the rest of the country. Nobody in \ntheir right mind would bring appropriations bills to the floor that \nhave these types of increases at a time when we are stealing $1.4 \ntrillion from our grandkids. How do we justify it? How do we justify \ngrowing the Federal Government at a time when families are struggling \nlike they have never struggled except during World War II and the Great \nDepression? How do we justify that?\n  We do not justify it. We cannot justify it. What we can do, and what \nwill happen in the debate on the amendments I bring forward--they will \nbe ignored. They just will not debate it. It will go away. That is what \nhappens when we bring critical amendments to the floor and question the \nwisdom of growing the Federal Government larger and larger without \ndeveloping a way to pay for it and without taking a critical look at \nall of those programs out there.\n  There is $350 billion worth of waste, fraud, and duplication in the \nFederal Government right now. The American people ought to be clamoring \nthat we freeze spending everywhere until we have done a review of every \ngovernment program that is out there--just like they are doing with \ntheir own families, just like they are doing with their own businesses, \njust like every organization in America today is having to do, except \ngovernments.\n  How is it this can happen? How is it we can go down the sewer drain \njust like other republics, knowing what history says will happen to us \nif, in fact, we abandon fiscal sanity? That is what this appropriations \nbill does, and all the rest of them we have passed because, in fact, we \nwill double the size of the Federal Government in the next 4 years, \nbased on 2008, 2009, not counting the stimulus.\n  If we are running a $1.4 trillion deficit--actually $1.8 trillion \nwhen we count everything we have stolen from Social Security and \neverything we have stolen from, for example, the inland waterways trust \nfund and the other trust funds; and we have not funded any Federal \npensions; and, by the way, we have not funded anything else we have an \nobligation for, such as\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\nVA health care or military retirement--none of those things are \nfunded--what happens when we get in the crunch?\n  What happens when nobody loans to us anymore? Wouldn't it be prudent \nto prepare for that? Wouldn't it be prudent for us to dig in as a \nnation--Democrats and Republicans and Independents--and say: Time out. \nLet's look where we are. Let's quit wasting $350 billion a year. Let's \neliminate the duplication. There are 800 programs outside the \nDepartment of Education that are run by the Federal Government for \neducation--outside the Department of Education. How about eliminating \nthem or at least putting them in the Department of Education and \nconsolidating them. And oh, by the way, education has done a wonderful \njob at the Federal Government level. As soon as the Federal Government \ngot into our educational system, our scores started declining, our \ngraduation rates started declining, and our college graduation rates \nstarted declining. That is the record of the Federal Government's \ninvolvement in education in this country.\n  There is a lot we can fix, not just my ideas. The question I am \nasking is, Why aren't we asking the question? Why aren't the American \npeople challenging their elected Members to the Senate and the House? \nWhere are your priorities? Does she not matter? Does their future not \nmatter? Answer the question: With $918,000 worth of unfunded liability \nand debt for which at 20 years of age she will be paying--we will be \npaying the interest, which means the taxes for that interest will come \nback to her eventually--how will she get a college education? How will \nshe own a home besides a dollhouse? How will it happen? Will Tinker \nBell just come down and give it to her? That isn't going to happen. So \nas we think outyears, we ought to be thinking about what our actions \ntoday are going to cost. Yet we don't.\n  These are disturbing times. These are not just disturbing times \nbecause we face a war on terror, and they are not disturbing times \nbecause we have an economic downturn. What is disturbing is that we \nabsolutely have avoided leadership in bringing this country back to its \ncommonsense basics of spending money we have for things that are an \nultimate priority, not spending money we don't have on things we don't \nneed. A large portion of these appropriations bills spends money we \ndon't have on things we don't need. We may want them. There is no \nquestion that politicians want them. There is no question that the \nNational Science Foundation political science grantees want them. Do we \nneed them? That is the question. And we have no leadership that will \ndiscern, at a crucial juncture in our history, a path that will bring \nus to not only a recovery from this recession but a recovery for an \nopportunity for every child her age.\n  It is deeply personal with me. I have five grandchildren. I look in \ntheir eyes, and I see the potential of their lives and all of these \nother children who are out there. There is tremendous potential in \nthem. You know what, we are going to waterboard them. That is what we \nare going to do. We are going to waterboard them. We are going to flood \nthem with debt. We are going to shackle their opportunities. We are \ngoing to limit their possibilities because we don't have the courage to \nmake the difference for their future.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, and I will come back and offer \nmy amendments when the Senator from Maryland arrives.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To reduce waste and abuse at the Department of Commerce)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Additional Amount for Office of Inspector \n     General.--The amount appropriated by title I under the \n     heading ``office of inspector general'' under the heading \n     ``Departmental Management'' under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF \n     COMMERCE'' is increased by $4,499,000.\n       (b) Offset.--The amount appropriated by title I under the \n     heading ``herbert c. hoover building renovation and \n     modernization'' under the heading ``Departmental Management'' \n     under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE'' is decreased by \n     $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about amendment No. 2667. \nThis is a fairly straightforward amendment.\n  The House has $5 million for renovation of the Hoover Building. There \nis\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\nno question that we need to have a continuing ongoing project of \nrenovating that. However, in the Senate, we have $17.5 million.\n  If we look at the Commerce Department and what is going wrong, what \nwe see is that because we are limited by funds, we don't have an active \nenough oversight of what is going on inside; otherwise, we could never \naccount for the billions of dollars of waste on the census.\n  This is a straightforward amendment. It just says: Of that $17.5 \nmillion, we are going to take $5 million, which still puts us at 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes what the House has, and direct it toward the Inspector General's \nOffice of the Commerce Department. What that does is it enhances \noversight, enhances transparency, and enhances communication back to \nthe Commerce Department so we can see what is going on with an agency \nthat is obviously troubled.\n  The inspector general's department, and agency-wide, is fielded by \ntough, great people who probably would pretty much agree with \neverything I spent the last hour talking about. The fact is, they are \nlimited in what they can do. They are limited by the funds we give \nthem. So we now come down again to priorities. Do we build bicycle \nracks out in front of the Herbert C. Hoover Building or do we spend \nmoney making sure the inspectors general and the auditors can actually \nsee what is going on in this agency?\n  It is very straightforward. It is going to be a fun vote. I \nunderstand how amendments go on the Senate floor when we are in the \nmood to spend money and not act responsibly. But do we really want \ntransparency, do we really want to know what is going on, do we really \nwant to discover the reason we are in such big trouble, and do we \nreally want to fund the inspector general at a level that will give us \nthe information upon which we can make better decisions? That leaves \nalone the question of whether we will make better decisions. I have a \nlack of confidence on that, but at least with the right information, we \nwill be able to, in fact, see what is going on.\n  We continue not to prioritize funds. The Department of Commerce is \ngoing to get a 52-percent increase in funding in our version of this \nbill. It receives $7.9 billion in additional stimulus funds. That was \n85 percent of what they received entirely in 2009, which means in a \nmatter of 2 years we will have given them on average three times what \nthey receive normally in a year. So we are talking about taking a small \nportion--$5 million--and directing it to the Inspector General's Office \nso they can do what is needed to be done in terms of carrying out their \nresponsibilities.\n  There is no question in my mind that the Department of Commerce is \nsuffering from mismanagement. I am not directing this to the present \nSecretary; I am directing this backwards through the Bush \nadministration. Here are some statements that were made in the Senate \nreport accompanying this bill:\n\n       The committee is extremely concerned about the persistent \n     pattern of cost overruns and schedule slippages on major \n     projects and missions carried out by the agencies in this \n     bill.\n       The committee remains apprehensive about the management of \n     the census.\n       Reports have exposed a culture within many agencies that \n     exhibits a lack of accountability in oversight of grant \n     funding.\n       The committee is concerned that the Census Bureau has \n     failed to implement three recommendations by the IG.\n       NOAA's satellite programs have undergone extensive \n     independent reviews after experiencing cost overruns, delays, \n     and setbacks.\n       The National Polar Orbiting Operational Environmental \n     Satellite system has struggled for years with cost overruns \n     and schedule delays and a high risk of gaps occurring to the \n     Nation's weather and climate satellites.\n       The committee remains concerned by the lack of progress in \n     reducing patent pendency and the overall patent backlog.\n\n  I note the committee routinely takes money away from patent fees to \nuse on other funds. As such, the committee has provided bill language \nto transfer funding to the Office of the Inspector General for the \nexpress purpose of conducting all audit engagements in the oversight of \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Despite these concerns--and I didn't list them all--with the Commerce \nDepartment, and a 52-percent increase in spending in the bill, if you \nwere concerned, why would you increase spending that much? That is No. \n1. The account for the inspector general is increased only by 4.4 \npercent. So this is a measly little $5 million out of a $17.5 million \nincrease. The House only has $5 million for the Herbert C. Hoover \nBuilding. So we put 2\\1/2\\ times what the House does in the building, \nand we actually give the IG the money he needs to do his job. There \nisn't an agency that needs more oversight and more work by an inspector \ngeneral than the Commerce Department.\n  I will limit my comments on this at the present time, and I will \ndefer to the chairman, if she wishes to speak; Otherwise, I will \ndiscuss one of the other amendments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first, we acknowledge the need for the \nCommerce Department to clean up its act in terms of its spending. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has indeed identified the very programs that give \nme heartburn as well: the NOAA satellite program, which continually has \ncost overruns; the decennial census, until we intervened with Secretary \nGutierrez, had become a techno boondoggle; the backlog at the Patent \nand Trademark Office is well known.\n  However, he proposes to increase funds for the IG, even though the \nbill already meets the request for this office. This amendment is \nunnecessary because we provide $27 million for the Commerce inspector \ngeneral. This matches what President Obama said he wanted to put in the \nFederal budget, and he thought it would do the job. In fiscal year \n2009, the IG of Commerce received 25.8. So we puffed it up 1.2 million \nalready. In addition to the stimulus package, just to be sure that \nmoney was going in the right direction, we in the subcommittee, working \non a bipartisan basis with Senator Shelby, put in an additional $6 \nmillion to make sure we did have oversight and accountability. We have \nnot received any indication from the IG that that IG needs more money. \nUnnecessary funding will not make those problems go away. What we want \nto do is be able to push them, advocate them, and stand sentry.\n  The building restoration which this amendment proposes to do will \nonly add to the Commerce Department's problems. It is called the \nHerbert C. Hoover Building. The building is in substandard condition. \nIt really is in substandard condition. It is the only building over \nthere that has not been upgraded in several years. Funding in this bill \nwould begin to modernize it, particularly in much needed health and \nsafety codes--heating, air conditioning, electricity, and plumbing. \nFunding in this covers the long partnership with GSA. I want the \nSenator from Oklahoma to know I agree that we have to stand sentry on \nCommerce. If you go over the bill, I have added some tough provisions \nwith Senator Shelby on oversight--particularly on this NOAA satellite \nprogram. But taking from much needed repairs at Commerce to fund the \nmuch needed repairs in oversight I don't think cuts it. I will oppose \nthe amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, though I think he and I are \non the same broadband about necessary stewardship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. We have communication from the GSA that says this \namendment will not inhibit any of the plans, upgrades, or improvements \nto the Herbert C. Hoover Building. No. 2, we all admit there are \nproblems at the Commerce Department. We have a 12.6-percent increase in \nspending but we increase the IG by 4.4 percent. We are going to \nincrease spending three times faster than the ability to track it and \noversee it. We did increase it 4.4 percent, but we increased the agency \n12.6 percent. We have our priorities backward. We should be increasing \nthe IG by 12.6 percent and the agency 4 percent, or 1.6 percent to \nmatch inflation.\n  This amendment will not, in any way, according to GSA, impede their \nability to make the corrections that they need to make in terms of \nhealth and safety at the Herbert C. Hoover Building.\n  I thank the chairman for her recognition of the problems at this \nagency. The answer to solve it is to let the dogs run. Let them find \nit. Let them go after it. Let them bring to light transparency, and let \nthem bring the reports that we need so we can make the changes we need.\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2632\n\n  I want to spend a few moments on my next amendment, No. 2632. This is \na very similar amendment. I spoke about it earlier. This amendment says \nthat whatever reports we ask for, whatever answers we want from these \nagencies, in fact, unless it has to do with national security or \ndefense, should be reported to every Senator, not just the Senators on \nthe Appropriations Committee. And more importantly, it should be \nreported to everybody in America. This is a great open government \namendment which says we will be transparent.\n  We are requesting numerous reports in this bill. Why should the \nAmerican people not get to see what those reports show? Why should we \nnot get to see how we are spending our money, why we are spending our \nmoney, and whether the effect of spending the money is having the \ndesired outcome? H.R. 2847 requires reports, audits, and evaluates all \ndecision documents and expenditures by the Bureau of the Census. We all \nknow that has been a problem. And I dispute that Secretary Gutierrez \ndid anything about the problem, other than talk the former leader of \nthe census into leaving. Secretary Gutierrez should have been following \nthe census to know before it ever got in that kind of shape. We have a \nwonderful leader there now, and I fully support him. I supported his \nnomination, and I supported his approval by the Senate.\n  This would also require a quarterly report by the Attorney General \nregarding the costs and contracting procedures related to each \nconference held by the Department of Justice. Why should not everybody \nget to see that? Why should not Americans, who are actually paying for \nthat, and their grandkids, such as this young lady in the photo, get to \nsee it? Why should she not get to see that? This is straightforward. We \nwill have a vote on this amendment. I have learned my lesson on not \ngetting them accepted. When they go to conference, we still hide it \nfrom the American people. So we will have a vote on this amendment and \nsee whether people want to hide what we are doing or want it exposed \nfully to the American people. It is a good government amendment.\n  We also have a request for a report that the Secretary, within 120 \ndays of enactment of this act, shall report to the Committee on \nAppropriations that audits and evaluates all decision documents and \nexpenditures by the Bureau of Census as it relates to the 2010 census. \nWhy just the Senators on the Appropriations Committee? Why not the \nAmerican people? Why should they not see that?\n  The other thing it will do is allow us to conduct better oversight. \nThe committee chairman--I have great regard for the Senator from \nMaryland, because I think she does care about oversight. I cannot say \nthat about all of our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. We \nwould have done a lot of oversight on the Census Bureau in the \nGovernment Affairs Subcommittee. I can tell you that we have great \nemployees there. We have had terrible leadership until now. At $60 a \nperson to count people in the United States, people ought to ask why. \nHow did we allow this to happen?\n  This amendment is one that the vast majority of Americans concur with \nand the vast majority of my colleagues, I hope, will concur with.\n  I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to make a comment about the status of the \nCommerce Department building. I will be very clear that the \nsubcommittee, on a bipartisan basis, supports vigorous oversight. The \nCommerce Building has not been renovated in more than 20 years.\n  Let me quote to you from the Washington Post in an article called \n``NOAA's Ark.'' It says:\n\n       When the Marine ecologist Jane Lubchenko was finally \n     confirmed in March as the Under Secretary of Commerce in \n     charge of NOAA, she went to check into her new digs on the \n     fifth floor at the Commerce Department. It was a fine corner \n     on 15th and Constitution, nothing fancy, but it overlooked \n     the Washington Monument. But when she opened the door and she \n     went to powder her nose, she found a massive Norwegian rat. \n     The critter had come in through the derelict plumbing that \n     was in her office. Now, she, with her typical good humor, \n     laughed it off and said, as an ecologist, she found it \n     biologically fascinating that sewer rats were able to come \n     into the Commerce Department.\n\n  We told her she couldn't have a grant to study it, but we wanted to \ndo something about the renovation. That is what we are--we want the \nbest and the brightest to work in our government agencies, and to come \nup with new ideas such as in NOAA, to save the planet, to do the \nnecessary scientific research to save fisheries. In that case, it would \nhave influenced the economy of my State tremendously. We cannot \nminimize the need to refurbish that building. Air pockets have been \ndeveloping in the plumbing at the Department of Commerce, and in order \nto get rid of the rats, you have to have regular flushes. This is not a \nlaughing matter. It sounds like a laughing matter, but I want to be \nable to go forward to modernize the Commerce Department, working with \nthe Secretary, and continue our vigorous oversight. Let's modernize the \nbuilding. I hope we can defeat that amendment.\n  There is an amendment that the Senator from Oklahoma has offered that \nrequires more transparency in our reports to Congress. I think that is \na good idea. Again, discussing this with my colleague, Senator Shelby, \nwe both think it is a good idea. If the Senator from Oklahoma will \nconcur--because I am for transparency and I believe we cannot have \nenough of it so that the American people can see things and make up \ntheir own minds--in the interest of time, I would accept the amendment. \nIf the Senator would be willing to do a voice vote, I would be more \nthan willing to accommodate that. I think the amendment is excellent \nand I believe it improves the bill. I am happy to accept it, or have it \nvoice voted, or have a recorded vote, whatever the Senator wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for her words on this \namendment. I have learned a very critical lesson. We have an Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill that we did the same thing on. For some \nreason, it didn't come out of conference. Transparency didn't come out. \nI don't doubt the veracity of the senior Senator from Maryland, but I \nwould just as soon have a recorded vote, if she would not mind.\n  I also want to answer the story of the rat, which is a great example \nof the mismanagement at the Department of Commerce. It does not relate \nto the present Secretary at all. If, in fact, you have plumbing \nproblems in the building, the management is supposed to raise that \nissue. In fact, the Department of Commerce received a large sum of \nmoney with the stimulus. The House has only $5 million for the Herbert \nC. Hoover Building. GSA says this amendment will not limit at all their \nability to accomplish what they want to accomplish there.\n\n  So if, in fact, $17.5 million is enough to get it done, why would we \nobject to having more than that--if GSA says it is only going to pay \n$17.5 million, why are we putting $22.5 million in it in the first \nplace?\n  The example proves my point: Management is lacking. With vigorous \nleadership and a vigorous, strong inspector general force that is \nfunded at the same level of increase that we fund the government, as \nfar as percentage of increases, we could hope to accomplish that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2631\n\n  I will move to my other amendment No. 2631. I spent a lot of time \ntalking about this amendment before the chairman came to the floor. I \nwill not repeat everything I said, but I will discuss the question of \npriorities.\n  I have a great respect for a lot of what the National Science \nFoundation does. I have very little respect for their grants for \npolitical science as a science. Part of that is because I think it is \nlow on the priority of where they should be spending money when we can \ncreate things through NSF to save lives and also because of some of the \ngrants that have been spent and put out there.\n  I will review a few of those over a short period of time and then \nwill yield the floor to my colleague, the chairman of this \nsubcommittee.\n  How do you back up the fact that the National Science Foundation \ngives a\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\ngrant for political science--here is the question asked: Why do \npolitical candidates make vague statements and what are the \nconsequences? In the realm of science, being a physician, being trained \nin the sciences, first of all, it is a question to which we already \nknow the answer. We know why politicians make vague statements. Because \nthey don't want to get pinned down. But most important, they want to \nget reelected or elected. For us to send money to study something that \nstupid, that low on priorities is beyond me.\n  Or why are people for or against military conflicts? Do we need that \nscience to tell us so that the next time we are in a military conflict \nwe go out and manipulate the American people or do we have military \nconflicts based on the national defense and security interests of this \ncountry, even when there are political consequences to it?\n  The real world would never fund such stupidness. They would never \nallow millions and millions of dollars every year to be spent on silly \nthings to help politicians understand why they spin or why they do not \nanswer questions or why people might be for or against war. It is \npretty easy to figure out.\n  Or studying how Medicare reform affects seniors' political views. \nThat is pretty easy: If it hurts me, I am ``agin'' it; if it helps me, \nI am for it. Yet we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars paying for \ngrants, through the National Science Foundation, to universities that \nhave billions and billions of dollars in endowments. As a matter of \nfact, Tufts University has billions in endowments. They charge their \nstudents $40,000 a year in tuition alone. They are the recipients of \nsome of this grant work, and they are the ones squawking the loudest.\n  So here we have an entitled class of professors in political science \nwho now don't want their gravy train taken away when I say right now \nthere is no way this can be a priority for this country with the debt \nwe have and the economic situation we have. It cannot be as important \nas a multitude of other things for this young lady. It cannot be.\n  I do not have any illusions about what is going to happen to this \namendment. I know the appropriators reign supreme. What I am hoping is \nthat the American people ultimately reign supreme. So as we vote to \nvote down this amendment or they vote to table this amendment so they \ndo not have to directly vote on the amendment, one has to walk back and \nsay: What is going on in Washington that you will not clean up the \nexcesses in a time of great national distress? We will not and we \nhaven't, and that is why we have a giant increase from last year and \nthis year. We entered the recession in 2007, remember? That is why we \nborrowed 43 cents out of every $1 we spent this year because we will \nnot make these hard, tough choices about why politicians are vague, \nwhile we continue to spend millions and millions of dollars so somebody \ncan sit in an office and pontificate and you can see the same answer--\nall you have to do is look at the news shows and you get the same \nanswers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I make an inquiry of the Chair. Do we have a limit on \ntime for debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. is evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, for a point of clarification, the time \nof the Senator from Oklahoma has expired and how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to speak on these \namendments for as much time as I may consume, and then if there is some \nremaining time, perhaps we could, in the interest of comity, share some \ntime. As I understand it, there is a vote scheduled at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I wish to \ngive him two punch lines. First of all, I know he doesn't think much of \npolitical science. He made that clear. But I wish to bring to his \nattention that Dr. Elinor Ostrom, who just won the Nobel Prize for \nEconomics, is a political scientist. She received most of her funding \nthrough the National Science Foundation--28 grant awards since 1974. \nThose grants helped her lay the groundwork for winning the Nobel Prize. \nShe is a political scientist, but she used that talent to win the \nprize. I will elaborate on that. I am a big fan of her work.\n  The other point I wish to bring to the Senator's attention is that \nthe National Science Foundation has an $8 million agreement with DOD in \ntheir Social Science Department on the social science dimensions of \nnational security, conflicts, and cooperation. DOD, under its Minerva \ninitiative, has joined with the National Science Foundation because \nthey want academic researchers involved in studying authoritarian \nregimes, the strategic impact of religious and cultural change, \nterrorist organizations, and other new dimensions in social security. I \nwill describe those grants in detail.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In a minute. What I wish to make clear is that the \nNational Science Foundation has helped fund the work that laid the \ngroundwork for a talented person to win not only the Nobel Prize but to \ncome up with the kind of ideas where maybe we could win markets and \njobs. The Department of Defense thought enough of the National Science \nFoundation's Social Science Department to come up with an $8 million--\nand it is not a lot of money--but an $8 million agreement to fund 17 \nprojects, where they are going to be studying things such as \nauthoritarian regimes, terrorist organizations, the impact on religious \nand cultural change, and how maybe they could avoid us being blown up. \nIf one of those studies helps one policymaker make one decision to save \none marine, I think it is worth the 8 million bucks, and I am willing \nto put it in the Federal budget.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator agree that the Defense \nDepartment funds all sorts of research in all sorts of scientific \nareas, and they don't necessarily do that on the predicate--they do it \non the basis of what their need is. There is a very big difference, \ndoes the Senator agree, between the social sciences and political \nscience?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Oklahoma agree that political \nscience is one of the branches of social science?\n  Mr. COBURN. Sure, and I am only targeting with my amendment political \nscience, not social sciences, if the Senator reads my amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Within these DOD grants, I am not sure which ones are \nsociology, anthropology or political science because it is in that one \ndirectorate.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman for allowing me to ask a question.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose, as you can see, the amendment \nof the Senator from Oklahoma. He wants to eliminate $9 million from the \npolitical science program at the National Science Foundation. I don't \nlike targeting an individual science area. Today it might be political \nscience. Another Senator might target biology. Remember how we stifled \nscience under the gag rules and gag guidelines of stem cell research?\n  Also, I don't like trivializing academic research and academics, that \nsomehow or another there is worthwhile science and then there are \nothers that can be minimized or trivialized.\n  First, I remind everyone about the work of the National Science \nFoundation. The NSF has received bipartisan support, and in rising \nabove the gathering storm, the National Academy of Sciences pointed out \nthat the National Science Foundation is one of our lead agencies in \npromoting innovation through its research and its education programs.\n  This bill also supports the funding for the Directorate for Social, \nBehavior and Economic Science. That is the one, which I talked about \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma, which oversees the political science \noffice. This directorate's mission is to use basic research to \nunderstand human and institutional behavior vital to rebuilding our \nnational infrastructure and understanding how we operate as a society.\n  This program began in 1962, and over the years, it has also included \nan open,\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\ntransparent relationship with the Department of Defense. This is not \nblack-box research. This is out-of-the-box research so maybe we could \nfigure out our world better and deal with conflict resolution or when \nwe are in a conflict, how we can work with other people around the \nworld and build democratic societies and democratic institutions.\n  In recent news, we also were awakened with great pride that two \nAmerican women won the Nobel Prize. One is Dr. Greider, in my home \nState of Maryland at Johns Hopkins. I talked with Dr. Greider the other \nday. Wow, what a great American scientist. She answered her own phone. \nShe was going to join her daughter at a soccer game right after she had \ngotten the call from Stockholm. As we talked about her groundbreaking \nresearch in microbiology, she said she was able to do her work because \nof the grants she had received through the National Institutes of \nHealth. They had helped her get her education, and they had helped her \ndo her research. They helped her to win the Nobel Prize. But for \nherself, she thought the prize would be a tribute to what her work was \nin microbiology that could lead to saving lives.\n\n  We also had another woman win the Nobel Prize--Dr. Elinor Ostrom. Her \ntraining is in political science. She won the Nobel Prize for \neconomics. She is the first woman ever to win the prize for economics--\nan American woman. Although not in the Congress, she has received \nseveral political science grants from NSF because political science \nalso looks at institutions which also have an impact on our economy. \nSince 1974, Dr. Ostrom has received over 20 grants, and these grants \nhelped her do her fieldwork all over the world in relationship to the \neconomic activity of people and communities. The Royal Swedish Academy \nof Sciences thought enough of her work to award her the Nobel Prize. \nBut long before they heard of her in Stockholm, the National Science \nFoundation had heard of her and helped her with her award-winning \nresearch.\n  We have to keep this going. Our National Science Foundation and our \nother scientific institutions must go where no thought has gone before. \nThat is the point of discovery. Discovery has led to innovation. \nInnovation leads to the new ideas that lead to the new jobs in our \nsociety. A society that doesn't innovate stagnates. And innovation \ncomes not only in engineering, though much needed; it doesn't only come \nin physics, though much desired; it doesn't come only in medicine, in \nthe biological research, though much revered; a lot of this is the \nbasic social sciences.\n  As I said to the Senator from Oklahoma, for the last 8 years there \nhas been a relationship between DOD and the National Science \nFoundation--again, in open, transparent research. And here, I am \nquoting from the ``Federal Technology Watch,'' October 6, 2009. \n``Federal Technology Watch'' is a weekly report on Federal technology, \nscience, and policy areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article from which I am going to quote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Federal Technology Watch, Oct. 9, 2009]\n\n\n          NSF finds declining federal support of academic r\n\n       US universities reported science and engineering r \n     expenditures of $51.9-billion in FY08, according to a new \n     National Science Foundation (NSF) report released Oct. 2. \n     However, the preliminary findings of NSF's Survey of Research \n     and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges are \n     that federal funding decreased as a share of the academic r \n     total, from 64% in FY05 to 60% in FY08. Despite this drop, \n     the federal government retains its traditional role as the \n     largest source of academic r funding.\n       The FY08 survey data showed an increase in federally funded \n     expenditures of 2.5% in current dollars, reaching $31.2-\n     billion. After adjusting for inflation, this is a 0.2% \n     increase from FY07 and follows two years of real declines \n     since FY05.\n       Other statistical notes from the NSF report include:\n       --Combined sources of non-federal funding grew 8.3% during \n     FY08;\n       --State and local government funding of r expenditures \n     grew in FY08 8.8%, increasing to $3.4-billion from $3.1-\n     billion in FY07;\n       --Industry funding of academic r grew 7.1% to $2.9-\n     billion in FY08;\n       --Funding from academic institutions increased 7% to $10.4-\n     billion in FY08.\n       Also, r funds for joint projects that were passed through \n     primary university recipients to other university sub-\n     recipients almost doubled from FY00 to FY08, growing from \n     $700-million to $1.4-billion in constant 2000 dollars. The \n     current dollar amount of $1.7-billion represents 3.3% of \n     total academic r expenditures in FY08, compared with 2.3% \n     of the total in FY00.\n       InfoBrief 09-318, written by NSF analyst Ronda Britt of the \n     r statistics program, is available at: \n\n\n                         Electric vehicle forum\n\n       The first-ever US-China Electric Vehicle Forum was held \n     last week in Beijing, China.\n       Attended by over 140 US and Chinese officials from \n     government, industry, academia and advocacy groups, the forum \n     discussed progress made in the electric vehicle industry and \n     opportunities for future collaboration.\n       The event, co-hosted by Department of Energy (DOE) \n     assistant secretary for policy and international affairs \n     David Sandalow and Chinese Science & Technology Minister Wan \n     Gang, highlighted the rapidly growing electric vehicle \n     industry in both countries.\n       ``The US and China share a strong common interest in \n     putting millions of electric vehicles on the road soon, which \n     will lessen our dependence on foreign oil and help address \n     the global climate challenge,'' Sandalow said Sept. 29. \n     ``Working together, we can accomplish more than acting \n     alone.''\n       America and China are the two largest auto markets and \n     energy consumers, and together emit over 40% of the world's \n     greenhouse gases. The forum offered a venue for experts to \n     exchange views on recent electric vehicle developments and \n     identify promising opportunities for technical and policy \n     collaboration.\n       This year is the 30th anniversary of the US-China Science & \n     Technology Agreement, which represented the first agreement \n     between the two countries following normalization of \n     relations in the 1970s.\n       ``By working together, the US and China can leverage \n     technological breakthroughs, increase consumer acceptance and \n     grow market penetration of clean vehicles,'' said White House \n     counselor for energy and climate change Jody Freeman, who was \n     a speaker at the forum.\n\n\n                        NSF-DOD projects funded\n\n       $8-million has been awarded to 17 projects by the National \n     Science Foundation (NSF) under a joint NSF/Department of \n     Defense (DOD) solicitation.\n       The competition, Social and Behavioral Dimensions of \n     National Security, Conflict and Cooperation, is focused on \n     basic social and behavioral science of strategic importance \n     to US national security policy, as part of the DOD's Minerva \n     Initiative launched in 2008.\n       Four topic areas that address the needs of national \n     security policymakers and the ideals of open academic basic \n     research were determined jointly by DOD and NSF for the \n     solicitation.

It also includes research into ways nanotechnology \n     can be used to clean up toxic chemicals in the environment.\n       Nanomaterials are between one and 100 nanometers and used \n     in hundreds of consumer products, including sunscreen, \n     cosmetics and sports equipment. The unusual light-absorbing \n     properties of zinc or titanium nanoparticles make high-SPF \n     nano sunscreens clear rather than white and studies have \n     shown that they provide superior protection against UV \n     radiation.\n       Part of EPA's role among federal agencies is to determine \n     the potential hazards of nanotechnology and develop \n     approaches to reduce or minimize any risks identified. As \n     part of the strategy, EPA researchers are investigating \n     widely-used nanomaterials, such as the carbon nanotubes used \n     in vehicles, sports equipment and electronics, and titanium \n     dioxide used in paints, cosmetics and sunscreens.\n       The research, being conducted in EPA's own laboratories and \n     by grant recipients as part of a collaborative effort with \n     other federal agencies and the international community, uses \n     a multi-disciplinary approach that examines all aspects of \n     nanomaterials in the environment, from their manufacture and \n     use to their disposal or recycling.\n       EPA's new nanotech web site offers details about the \n     research: \n\n\n                        President extends PCAST\n\n       On Sept. 29, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order \n     (E.O.) 13511, which extended terms of several federal \n     advisory committees including the President's Council of \n     Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), E.O. 13226, as \n     amended (Office of S Policy), until Sept. 30 2011.\n       Other committees whose terms are extended include the \n     following: Committee for the Preservation of the White House, \n     E.O. 11145, as amended (Interior Dept.); National \n     Infrastructure Advisory Council; E.O. 13231, as amended \n     (Department of Homeland Security); Federal Advisory Council \n     on Occupational Safety and Health, E.O. 12196, as amended \n     (Labor Dept.), President's Board of Advisors on Historically \n     Black Colleges and Universities, E.O. 13256 (Education \n     Dept.), President's Board of Advisors on Tribal Colleges and \n     Universities, E.O. 13270 (Education Dept.), President's \n     Commission on White House Fellowships, E.O. 11183, as amended \n     (Office of Personnel Management), President's Committee on \n     the National Medal of Science, E.O. 11287, as amended \n     (National Science Foundation), President's Export Council, \n     E.O. 12131, as amended (Commerce Dept.), President's National \n     Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, E.O. 12382, \n     as amended (Department of Homeland Security), and the Trade \n     and Environment Policy Advisory Committee, E.O. 12905 (Office \n     of the US Trade Representative).\n       E.O. 13511 took effect Sept. 30 2009.\n\n\n                        US-Russian nuclear talks\n\n       Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman and Russia's State \n     Atomic Energy Corporation's (Rosatom) director general Sergei \n     Kiriyenko held the first meetings of the joint US-Russian \n     Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Security Working Group last \n     week.\n       The Sept. 28-29 meetings opened with a session hosted by \n     Energy Secretary Steven Chu, who met with director general \n     Kiriyenko and deputy secretary Poneman to discuss a number of \n     issues, including the two countries' mutual work securing \n     vulnerable nuclear materials, efforts to increase cooperation \n     on civil nuclear technologies, and cooperation on other \n     nuclear security issues.\n       ``The US and Russia have a long and successful track record \n     of cooperation in the area of nuclear security,'' said \n     Poneman. ``These meetings and our visits to Oak Ridge \n     National Laboratory and the Y-12 National Security Complex \n     demonstrate how seriously our countries take our shared \n     responsibility to promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy \n     while combating nuclear dangers. I look forward to continuing \n     this record by expanding our cooperation in fulfillment of \n     our presidents' joint statement.''\n       The meetings, which ended with a plenary session co-chaired \n     by Poneman and Kiriyenko, were the first since the working \n     group was established under the US-Russia Bilateral \n     Presidential Commission during the July 2009 Presidential \n     Summit. The Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Security Working Group \n     is co-chaired by Poneman and Kiriyenko. In addition to talks \n     in Washington DC, the meetings included a visit by director \n     general Kiriyenko and Poneman to the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration's Y-12 National Security Complex and \n     Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tenn.\n       ``This visit is devoted to an in-depth discussion of the \n     issues of nuclear energy and nuclear security as stipulated \n     by the mandate from the presidents of the Russian Federation \n     and the US,'' said Kiriyenko. ``We're looking forward to the \n     expansion of our bilateral cooperation on these issues.''\n       After their meeting with Secretary Chu, Poneman and \n     Kiriyenko flew to Tennessee to visit ORNL and Y-12, where \n     they watched a joint nuclear security training exercise. At \n     Y-12, Poneman and Kiriyenko discussed nuclear materials \n     management issues and toured the recently completed Highly \n     Enriched Uranium Materials Facility. During their ORNL visit, \n     Kiriyenko and Poneman received a briefing at the \n     Radiochemical Engineering Development Center and the \n     Spallation Neutron Source.\n       As a result of the meeting, a joint action plan was \n     formulated by the working group and will be forwarded to \n     President Obama and President Medvedev through Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey \n     Lavrov. Secretary Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov serve \n     as the Bilateral Commission Coordinators.\n\n\n                       DHS cyber hires authority\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has received new \n     authority to recruit and hire cybersecurity professionals \n     over the next three years to help the agency meet its broad \n     mission to protect the nation's cyber infrastructure, systems \n     and networks.\n       ``Effective cybersecurity requires all partners--\n     individuals, communities, government entities and the private \n     sector--to work together to protect our networks and \n     strengthen our cyber resiliency,'' Homeland Security \n     Secretary Janet Napolitano said Oct.1 at the launch of \n     National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. ``This new hiring \n     authority will enable [us] to recruit the best cyber \n     analysts, developers and engineers in the world to serve \n     their country by leading the nation's defenses against cyber \n     threats.''\n       A collaboration between DHS, the Office of Personnel \n     Management (OPM) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB), \n     the new authority allows DHS to fill up to 1,000 critical \n     cybersecurity staff positions over three years across all of \n     its components. These roles include cyber risk & strategic \n     analysis, cyber incident response, vulnerability detection & \n     assessment, intelligence & investigation, and network & \n     systems engineering. But DHS doesn't anticipate needing to \n     fill all the posts.\n       The announcement was made by Secretary Napolitano at a \n     National Cybersecurity Awareness Month ceremony with Deputy \n     Defense Secretary William Lynn III and White House national \n     security staff acting senior director for cybersecurity Chris \n     Painter.\n       For National Cybersecurity Awareness Month details, visit: \n     \n\n\n                        sba awards prime grants\n\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) announced Oct. 2 \n     that 58 non-profit organizations from 32 states and the \n     District of Columbia are to receive grant funding under the \n     Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs Act (PRIME) to \n     assist low-income and very low-income entrepreneurs with \n     training and technical assistance to start, operate, and grow \n     their businesses.\n       ``SBA remains committed to helping small businesses start, \n     grow and succeed, and PRIME is one of our many tools for \n     doing this,'' SBA administrator Karen Mills said last week. \n     ``Thanks to larger funding this year, we were able to provide \n     grant dollars to more recipients across more states. These \n     grant recipients are on the front line of helping \n     entrepreneurs in particularly underserved communities with \n     critical tools to help them maximize the potential of their \n     businesses, create jobs and help strengthen the local \n     economy.''\n       The competition for PRIME grants was open to applicants in \n     all 50 states and the US territories, and SBA received over \n     400 applications. SBA last year funded 35 grants in 12 states \n     on a non-competitive basis.\n       SBA's PRIME grant funding is intended to establish \n     management and technical assistance, access to capital and \n     other forms of financial assistance, and business training \n     and counseling through qualified organizations to small \n     businesses with five or fewer employees who are economically \n     disadvantaged, and businesses owned by low-income \n     individuals, including those on Indian reservations and \n     tribal lands.\n       The grant funding received will be used to provide training \n     and technical assistance to disadvantaged microentrepreneurs, \n     supply capacity building services to organizations that \n     assist with microenterprise training and services, and aid in \n     researching and developing best practices in the field of \n     microenterprise development and technical assistance programs \n     for disadvantaged micro-entrepreneurs.\n       This year's total program funding amounts to $5 million \n     with grants ranging in size up to $250,000 with a 50% match \n     required of the recipient. PRIME grants are open to \n     microentrepreneur training and technical assistance providers \n     in all 50 states and US territories. They have a one-year \n     performance period, with four 12-month options.\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n       2009 PRIME grant recipients are at: \n\n\n                       US-Italy nuclear r pact\n\n       Two important nuclear energy agreements that could lead to \n     construction of new nuclear power plants and improved \n     cooperation on advanced nuclear energy systems and fuel cycle \n     technologies in both countries were signed by Energy \n     Secretary Steven Chu and Italian Minister for Economic \n     Development Claudio Scajola on Sept. 30.\n       The US-Italy Joint Declaration Concerning Industrial and \n     Commercial Cooperation in the Nuclear Energy Sector, which \n     was signed on behalf of the US by Energy Secretary Chu and \n     Commerce Deputy Secretary Dennis Hightower, affirms the \n     strong interest of the US and Italy to encourage their \n     respective nuclear industries to seek opportunities for \n     construction of new nuclear power plants.\n       ``The agreements reached today reflect our vision for \n     strong partnerships with nations around the world to help \n     address our shared climate and energy challenges,'' said \n     Secretary Chu. ``Nuclear power will play a key role in the \n     production of low-carbon energy in the years and decades \n     to come, and we look forward to working with Italy and the \n     US private sector to advance these important \n     technologies.''\n       ``Clean and efficient energy technologies, including \n     nuclear power, will be a cornerstone of a vibrant and \n     prosperous 21st century economy,'' added deputy secretary \n     Hightower. ``American companies can offer Italy world-class \n     nuclear energy solutions while strengthening our own domestic \n     industry.''\n       A bilateral Agreement on Cooperation in Civilian Nuclear \n     Energy Research and Development was also signed by Energy \n     Secretary Chu and Minister Scajola, which will facilitate \n     cooperation between DOE and Italy's Ministry for Economic \n     Development in advanced nuclear energy systems and associated \n     fuel cycle technologies. Both nations will collaborate in r \n     of advanced technologies to improve the cost, safety, and \n     proliferation-resistance of nuclear power.\n       The agreement will also expand efforts to promote and \n     maintain nuclear science and engineering infrastructure and \n     expertise in each country.\n       Italy will be a key partner in building international \n     consensus and momentum on shared nuclear energy and \n     nonproliferation agenda, and US energy officials look forward \n     to working with their Italian counterparts at the Nuclear \n     Security Summit in April 2010.\n\n\n                         ARS food waste project\n\n       Food scraps are collected every weekday from the Maryland \n     Food Distribution Authority in Jessup, Md., and from small \n     local food service and marketing establishments and trucked \n     to the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Henry Wallace \n     Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Beltsville, \n     Md.\n       Items not containing metal, glass, or plastic are then are \n     mixed with woodchips, leaves and other organic residuals, and \n     several months later some of the finished compost is \n     delivered to the National Mall in Washington DC to be used in \n     gardens at the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Jamie \n     Whitten Federal Building.\n       This unusual operation is part of research by ARS \n     microbiologist Patricia Millner with the BARC Environmental \n     Microbial and Food Safety Lab on ways to reduce the release \n     of methane from landfills by diverting food residuals and \n     other organic materials to composting. She conducts this \n     research with microbiologist Walter Mulbry of BARC's \n     Environmental Management and Byproduct Utilization Lab.\n       This year they are also supplying compost to the inaugural \n     People's Garden, part of a new program for creating a \n     community garden at each USDA facility, as well as for \n     landscaping at the US Botanic Garden and the Capitol.\n       Millner also makes compost available for other federal \n     `green' projects, including roof gardens, rain gardens and \n     other landscaping designs, to retain water and reduce runoff \n     at federal sites in the Washington DC metropolitan area.\n       As part of her efforts to help the federal government model \n     ways to compost food scraps, Millner has a cooperative r \n     agreement (CRADA) with RCM LLC of Maryland to capture ammonia \n     in the final compost to boost its nitrogen content for \n     fertilizer use. She is now comparing several types of \n     insulated composting containers for greenhouse gas emission \n     reduction and other cost-benefit characteristics.\n       About half of the carbon and nitrogen in composting \n     materials is lost to the air, rather than being captured in \n     the compost.\n\n\n                        NIH 115 high-risk awards\n\n       A total of 115 awards for $348-million to encourage \n     investigators to explore bold ideas with potential to \n     catapult fields forward and accelerate the translation of \n     research into improved health were announced by the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       ``The appeal of the Pioneer, New Innovator, and now the T-\n     R01 programs, is that investigators are encouraged to \n     challenge the status quo with innovative ideas, while being \n     given the necessary resources to test them,'' NIH director Dr \n     Francis Collins said Sept. 24. ``The fact that we continue to \n     receive such strong proposals for funding through the \n     programs reflects the wealth of creative ideas in science \n     today.''\n       The NIH High-Risk Research awards are granted under three \n     research programs supported by its Common Fund Roadmap for \n     Medical Research: the NIH director's Transformative RO1 (T-\n     R01) awards, Pioneer awards, and New Innovator awards.\n       Enacted by Congress through the 2006 NIH Reform Act, the \n     Common Fund supports cross-cutting, trans-NIH programs with a \n     special emphasis on innovation and risk taking. Part of the \n     New Innovator Awards ($23-million) is supported by American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding.\n       NIH this year is granting 42 T-R01 awards, 18 Pioneer \n     awards, and 55 New Innovator awards for early-stage \n     investigators, and expects to make competing awards of $30-\n     million to T-R01 awardees, $13.5-million to Pioneer awardees, \n     and about $131-million to New Innovators in FY09. Total \n     funding provided to this effort over a five-year period is \n     estimated at $348-million.\n       More details on the T-R01 award are at: \n       Details of the Pioneer award are at: \n       Information on the New Innovator award is at: \n\n\n                           NHGRI, NIMH grants\n\n       Grants expected to total $45-million were announced last \n     week by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) \n     and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to establish \n     new Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science in Wisconsin and \n     North Carolina, as well as to continue support of existing \n     centers in Maryland and California.\n       ``Our aim is to foster the formation of innovative research \n     teams that will develop genomic tools and technologies that \n     help to advance human health,'' NHGRI acting director Dr Alan \n     Guttmacher said Sept. 28. ``Each of these centers is in a \n     position to tackle some of the most challenging questions \n     facing biology today.''\n       ``NIMH is pleased to partner with NHGRI and to be able to \n     support this innovative study with funding through the \n     American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,'' said NIMH director \n     Dr Thomas Insel. ``These sophisticated genetic models will \n     provide new opportunities to accelerate the pace of \n     scientific discovery and to make progress toward \n     understanding how genes shape behavior.''\n       NHGRI and NIMH are both part of the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH). Launched in 2001 by NHGRI, the Centers of \n     Excellence in Genomic Science program assembles \n     interdisciplinary teams dedicated to making critical advances \n     in genomic research.\n       The new center, to be co-led by Medical College of \n     Wisconsin and Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison will receive about \n     $8-million over three years. The new center at Univ. of North \n     Carolina, Chapel Hill will receive about $8.6-million over \n     five years. The existing center at Univ. of Southern \n     California, Los Angeles will receive about $12-million over \n     five years and the existing center at Johns Hopkins Univ. in \n     Baltimore will get about $16.8-million over five years.\n       Funding to all four centers will be provided by NHGRI. The \n     first two years of the Univ. of North Carolina center will be \n     funded by NIMH, which will contribute about $6-million \n     through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). In \n     addition, NIMH will provide about $1.7-million, in non-ARRA \n     funds, of the total funding awarded to the Johns Hopkins \n     center.\n       More information about the program is at: \n\n\n                         NSF plans CPATH survey\n\n       The National Science Foundation (NSF) plans a one-year data \n     collection for its Revitalizing Computing Pathways (CPATH) in \n     Undergraduate Education Program Evaluation.\n       Established by NSF's Computer & Information Science & \n     Engineering (CISE) directorate, CPATH is aimed toward \n     preparing a US workforce with computing competencies and \n     skills imperative to the nation's health, security, and \n     prosperity in the 21st century. This workforce includes a \n     cadre of computing professionals prepared to contribute to \n     sustained US leadership in computing in a wide range of \n     application domains and career fields, and a broader \n     professional workforce with knowledge and understanding of \n     critical computing concepts, methodologies, and techniques.\n       To achieve this vision, CPATH calls for colleges and \n     universities to work together and with other stakeholders \n     (industry, professional societies, and others) to formulate \n     and implement plans to revitalize undergraduate computing \n     education in the US. Full engagement of faculty and other \n     individuals in CISE disciplines will be critical to success.\n       Successful CPATH projects will be systemic in nature, \n     address a broad range of issues, and have significant \n     potential to contribute to the transformation and \n     revitalization of undergraduate computing education on a \n     national-scale. Qualitative data collection of this program \n     evaluation will document CPATH program strategies used in \n     infusing computational thinking across different contexts and \n     disciplines, examine development of communities of \n     practitioners and dissemination of best practices around \n     computational thinking, and analyze preliminary evidence for \n     how the CPATH program is preparing students for career \n     options in the STEM workforce.\n       Five major questions will guide this program evaluation: \n     How is CPATH infusing computational thinking in a range of \n     disciplines serving undergraduate education? What evidence is \n     there that university and\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\n     community college departments and faculty are integrating \n     computational thinking into their courses? How are \n     undergraduate students benefitting from their participation \n     in CPATH projects? What evidence is there that CPATH is \n     developing communities of practitioners that share best \n     practices regularly across different contexts and \n     disciplinary boundaries? How is CPATH promoting sustainable \n     multi-sector partnerships that represent a broad range of \n     stakeholders (e.g., industry, higher education, K12) and \n     contribute to workforce development supporting continued US \n     leadership in innovation?\n       NSF will seek answers to these questions through use of \n     mixed evaluation methods including document analyses, site \n     visit interviews, and telephone interviews with selected \n     CPATH grant participants including principal investigators, \n     staff, faculty, administrators, students, and external \n     partners. Participation in program evaluations is mandatory \n     for all CPATH awardees.\n       After considering public continent, NSF will request that \n     OMB approve clearance of this one-time collection [OMB No. \n     3145-NEW] for no longer than one year.\n       NSF estimates about 200 respondents (individuals) will take \n     part in the survey and take an average of 1 \\1/2\\-hours per \n     response.\n       For more details, contact Suzanne Plimpton at (703) 292-\n     7556; splimpto@nsf.gov.\n\n\n                        CDC awards center grants\n\n       Award of $4.37-million in competitive grants to enhance \n     health care information management and improve detection and \n     response to emerging public health threats was announced \n     Sept. 25 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC).\n       The CDC grants will fund four new Centers of Excellence in \n     Public Health Informatics at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, \n     Indiana Univ., Univ. of Pittsburgh, and Univ. of Utah.\n       ``These centers will advance the study and practice of \n     public health informatics through collaborative efforts among \n     academic public health experts, local and state public health \n     departments, developing regional health information \n     organizations, and other health and informatics \n     professionals,'' said CDC's National Center for Public Health \n     Informatics acting director Dr Stephen Thacker.\n       The overall purpose of the center of excellence initiative \n     is to find strategies and tools that increase the ability of \n     health departments, physicians and other health care \n     providers to promote health and prevent diseases, injuries or \n     disabilities. A common emphasis will be translation of \n     results into measurable public health impacts.\n       Each center of excellence will conduct two new projects \n     that support national priorities in informatics; and support \n     real-time biosurveillance for potential health threats \n     through immediate access to data from hospitals and health \n     care systems in major metropolitan areas across the US.\n       The principal investigators, projects, and overall goals of \n     the centers are:\n       --Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Boston, Mass.

Ann Dunwoody and Army Research, Development & \n     Engineering Command (ARDEC) Commander Maj. Gen. Paul Izzo, in \n     Arlington, Va.\n       The annual awards program, which gets nominations from \n     across the Army's s community, aims to recognize the best \n     technology solutions for soldiers. This year's awards \n     recognized the following inventions fielded by the Army \n     during 2008:\n       --1. XM153 Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) \n     [Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center \n     (AARDEC)]: Able to be mounted on a variety of vehicles, this \n     system offers the ability to aim and fire remotely a suite of \n     crew-served weapons from a stationary platform or while \n     moving;\n       --2. Projectile Detection Cueing (PDCue)--CROWS Lightning \n     [AARDEC]: This low-cost acoustic gunfire detection system is \n     able to detect and locate the origin of incoming gunfire;\n       --3. Light machine gun & medium machine gun cradle \n     [AARDEC]: This cradle provides a more stable and accurate \n     firing platform and reliable, twist-free ammunition feeding \n     regardless of weapon orientation;\n       --4. Overhead cover for objective gunner protection kit \n     [AARDEC]: An integrated armor/ballistic glass system mounted \n     onto the objective gunner protection kit of tactical and \n     armored vehicles, it provides an enhanced 360 degree \n     ballistic protection for gunners while retaining visibility \n     for situational awareness;\n       --5. Enhanced mobile rapid aerostat initial deployment \n     vehicle [Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development & \n     Engineering Center]: This system combines multiple \n     intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities \n     onto a single, integrated platform;\n       --6. Whisper [Army Communications--Electronics Research, \n     Development & Engineering Center]: The system's passive \n     detection capability can be used to detect enemy radio-\n     controlled improvised explosive device (IED) threats;\n       --7. Combat gauze for treating hemorrhage in injured \n     soldiers [Army Institute of Surgical Research]: Hemorrhages \n     account for 50% of deaths among combat casualties and many of \n     these deaths are potentially preventable with prompt and \n     effective treatment. This large-sized flexible roll of non-\n     woven medical gauze, impregnated with kaolin, a clotting \n     agent, can be used to treat severe external bleeding, \n     especially where a tourniquet can't be applied. It has also \n     been proposed to treat deep bleeding at the end of a long \n     wound tract;\n       --8. Mine-resistant ambush-protected armor weight reduction \n     spiral program [Army Research Lab]: This program enabled Army \n     to meet MRAP program protection requirements for a high \n     priority, anti-armor, IED threat, and its goal was to \n     introduce lightweight composites, new materials, and enhanced \n     ballistic mechanisms to reduce the added weight of final \n     armor packages.\n       --9. Mine-resistant ambush-protected expedient armor \n     program add-on-armor kit [Army Tank Automotive Research, \n     Development & Engineering Center (TARDEC)]: Developed to \n     safeguard soldiers against lethal threats of IEDs and \n     explosively formed penetrators, the armor uses armor physics, \n     as opposed to armor mass, to defeat the threat. It has led to \n     a 50% cut in weight, while increasing the armor protection on \n     all MRAP vehicles without sacrificing vehicle performance or \n     payload;\n       --10. One system remote video terminal A-kit [TARDEC]: An \n     innovative modular video and data system enabling soldiers to \n     receive remotely near-real-time surveillance image and \n     geospatial data direct from tactical unmanned aerial vehicles \n     and manned platforms.\n       AMC is the Army's premier provider of materiel readiness in \n     the form of technology, acquisition support, materiel \n     development, logistics, power projection and sustainment . . \n     .\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The quote is as follows:\n\n       $8 million has been awarded to 17 projects by the NSF under \n     a joint NSF/Department of Defense solicitation. The \n     competition, Social and Behavioral Dimensions of National \n     Security, Conflict and Cooperation, is focused on basic \n     social and behavioral science of strategic importance to US \n     national security policy.\n\n  So again, the competition is in the social science directorate. And \nthe four topic areas the DOD thought it was important to contract out, \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nNSF, are in the following areas, according to this article:\n\n       Authoritarian regimes, the strategic impact of religious \n     and cultural change, terrorist organizations and idealogies, \n     and new dimensions in national security.\n\n  They awarded these 17 grants, and let me read what some of them are. \nOne is experimental analysis of alternative models of conflict \nbargaining. Now, you might say: Ho-hum. But you know what, maybe some \nidea out of that will help us crack how we can bring peace to the \nMiddle East. Another is mapping terrorist organizations. Well, that is \na pretty good idea. Maybe some of that research will help us get out of \nAfghanistan. How about predicting the nature of conflict? Well, we kind \nof know what that is, but do we really? Because if we understand the \nnature of conflict, maybe we can learn to defang conflict.\n  Let's look at another issue which I am very concerned about because \nof my worry about the planet--avoiding water wars: environmental \nsecurity. These may be new threats to the United States.\n  I could read every one of these, but what I want to say is that DOD \nhas partnered with NSF--to quote from this article--``to reach the \nbroadest range of academic, social and behavioral science, and this \ncollaboration combines the insights of DOD with the peer review \nexpertise of NSF in support of the agencies' desire to promote basic \nsocial and behavioral research in areas that will benefit the United \nStates.''\n  ``Federal Technology Watch'' said it best. To take out $9 million is \nreally penny-wise and pound-foolish. I am going to oppose the amendment \nof the Senator on that issue. I will oppose the amendment of the \nSenator on taking money from much-needed Commerce Department \nrenovations and putting it in IG because we do fund the President's \nrequest in IG.\n  I do, however, like the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma on \nmore transparency in government reports that are coming into the \nCommerce Department. I believe we could have passed that one by voice \nvote. I am sorry we have to go through the mechanics of a recorded \nvote. He is worried I would drop it in conference, but I could give him \nmy word that we would maintain that amendment as best we could. But so \nbe it, the Senator is entitled to that.\n  So, Mr. President, as we conclude our conversation this afternoon, I \nwant to be very clear. We oppose two of the Coburn amendments. I accept \none that you will see down at the desk where I stand.\n  I had hoped we could avoid a cloture vote. Senator Shelby and I have \nworked hard on a bipartisan bill, and I once again acknowledge the \nSenator from Alabama, my Republican colleague. We have an excellent \nbill that funds not only the Commerce Department but the Justice \nDepartment, and now we are facing the threat of a filibuster by \namendment after amendment. I had hoped we could have reached some kind \nof agreement on a limited number of amendments, but since we can't, it \nlooks as if we are going to have to go to cloture.\n  I think we have had a good discussion, and I want to reiterate the \nthree goals of the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee. No. 1, we \nwant to promote the security of the American people. We want to do it \nover there and we want to do it here. That is why we fund the Justice \nDepartment. We also want to promote innovation, and we have vigorous \nfunding for our science agencies and innovation from the government \nthat will also be on the side of those innovators. No. 3, where we do \nagree with the Senator from Oklahoma is on increased oversight, \naccountability, stewardship, and transparency.\n  Mr. President, I know we are about 5 minutes from the vote, so I will \nnow reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, \nthe Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee-\n     reported substitute amendment to H.R. 2847, the Departments \n     of Commerce, Justice and Science and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2010.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara A.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \ncommittee-reported substitute to H.R. 2847, the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of \n2010, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. \nHutchison), and the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 56, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 320 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--6\n\n     Begich\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Wicker\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 56, the nays are 38. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider the vote by which \ncloture was not invoked is considered entered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in years past, appropriations bills were \nfinished in a reasonably short period of time. There was cooperation \nbetween both sides. That, of course, has ended. We are now in an era \nwhere the President of the United States goes to a foreign country \ntrying to bring the Olympics to the United States. And when the \nOlympics do not go to Chicago, our Republican colleagues cheer. If you \ncan imagine that, that is what happened.\n  When the President is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, only the third \ntime in the history of the country that a sitting President is awarded \nthe Nobel Peace Prize, we get the same dissatisfaction of this \ntremendous honor given to our country from our Republican colleagues.\n  As was written in the New York Times 1 week ago: The Republicans are \nlegislating out of spite. Anything that slows things down, confuses, \ndiverts from the business at hand, they are\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nhappy to do that. There were 100 filibusters last year. And the \nAmerican people should understand filibusters are more than just a \nword. It takes days and weeks of the Senate's time to work through that \nprocess.\n  We are going to get this bill passed, and we will complete the work \non this appropriations bill--not because the Republicans deserve it, \nwith their many earmarks in the bill. We are going to go ahead and do \nit anyway. We are going to do it because it is the right thing for the \ncountry.\n  There are many amendments that are germane. There are a number of \namendments that were not germane postcloture. They would be considered. \nI told everyone that.\n  This is a game Republican Senators are playing. I think it is a very \nunfair game for the American people. I do hope the American people are \nwatching, and they are. All you have to do is look at the LA Times. In \nLos Angeles this weekend, there was a front-page story indicating that \nthe Republican Party, as a result of what is going on in the Senate, is \nat the lowest point in the history of the country for a political \nparty. Why wouldn't they be?\n  We do have one brave soul who voted to get the bill out of the \nFinance Committee, and I appreciate her work. No cooperation on one of \nthe most important issues facing the country in generations, health \ncare reform. Do they have a plan? Of course not. It is the party of no, \nas indicated in this vote tonight.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on the vote just cast, as my friend \nwell knows, we had worked on an amendment list not only last week but \nearlier today. We were down to what I thought was a manageable list. \nThere is no one on this side of whom I am aware trying to prevent the \nCommerce-Justice-State bill from passing. So far this year we have had \na very good amendment process. Members have been able to offer their \namendments and get votes. I thought until about 5:15 this afternoon we \nwere going to be able to get an amendment list. It broke down somehow \nin the discussions. So I wouldn't make more out of this than it is. We \nwere very close to being able to finish this bill.\n  I suggest we continue to work on the amendment list, which was quite \nreasonable, and wrap up the bill in the very near future.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the suggestion of my \nRepublican counterpart. But we are going to get cloture on this bill, \nand we will handle the germane amendments. We have legislated on this \nbill for 5 days. That should be enough. The list they think is \nreasonable, someone should take a look at it and see how unreasonable \nit is. We will go ahead. We will do the regular order. We will get \ncloture on this bill, and we will handle the germane amendments--maybe. \nWe don't have to handle the germane amendments. We don't have to deal \nwith those. We might do that; we might not do it.\n  I think what has happened in the Senate is outrageous. I want to make \nsure the record is clear. I appreciate very much John McCain saying \nnice things about President Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize. \nAnother person who says he is running for President also said nice \nthings about President Obama getting that. That was Governor Pawlenty. \nObviously, Governor Pawlenty knows the American people think it is \nwrong for someone who receives this high honor, for people not to pat \nhim on the back.\n  What has gone on in the Senate is as indicated in the New York Times \nlast month: they are legislating out of spite. We are going to continue \nto work for the betterment of this country and move forward on the \nagenda this country needs to work on. We have had a successful year \nlegislating. It has been extremely difficult. We have had a lot of \nhurdles to go over.\n  I appreciate the legislation we have passed. We only recently got 60 \nvotes. We have had 58, so we have always needed a couple Republicans. \nAnd we have been able to get those but just barely. I appreciate the \nscowls from the other side as they vote with us.\n  We have a lot of important things to do. We are going to continue \nworking on them. Health care has taken a lot longer than we had \nanticipated, but we will take that over the finish line. It will be \nhard, but we are going to do that. I hope we can do it with some \nsupport from the Republicans. It appears at this stage that we are not \ngoing to get any, other than maybe a couple of courageous souls. Maybe \nwe will get three if we are lucky.\n  We have to do something about energy, an important issue. We are \ngoing to deal with that. We have to do something about regulation \nreform.\n  It would be a lot better for the American people if Republican \nSenators worked with us. Take, for example, the health care bill from \nthe HELP Committee. You would think, after having accepted scores and \nscores of Republican amendments, that some Republican would say a nice \nthing about that HELP bill. Not a word. Every single member of the \nRepublican Party who is a member of the HELP Committee voted against \nthe bill.\n  It is pretty clear what is happening around here. As I indicated--for \nthe third time--Republicans are legislating out of spite, and that is \nnot good for this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With all due respect to my good friend, the majority \nleader, I don't know what the vote we just had had to do with the \nPresident winning a Nobel Peace Prize. I congratulate him for that. I \nthink all Members are proud that he was able to achieve that. I don't \nknow what it had to do with health care. What it had to do with is the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.\n  We had agreed to all of the amendments on a list but one. We said to \nthe majority that we would eliminate the one. So I don't know why they \ncan't take yes for an answer. We basically had an agreement on our \namendment list but for one amendment which they objected to, and we \nsaid we would take it off the list. It strikes me rather than having a \nspirited debate about health care and other matters, we ought to agree \nto the amendment list and finish the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Thursday we waited virtually all day--all \nday--for them to come up with a list. It was never quite right. Never \nquite right. I was here late Thursday night, very late Thursday night. \nEveryone else had gone home. But the Republicans refused to OK a list. \nSo I had no alternative but to file a motion to invoke cloture. The \nagreement is in their minds only. We have been very generous in \nallowing amendments that have nothing to do with bills this whole year. \nWe were still willing to do that with this piece of legislation. This \nis part of a stall that we have had all year long, the stall all day \nThursday. We had problems on Wednesday trying to come up with a list, \nand Thursday. Just never quite right.\n  Suddenly, today, we have a list. We are willing to drop an amendment. \nI don't know what amendment they are talking about dropping.\n  I have made my statement very clear. We have a pattern in the Senate \nby the Republicans that is abusive to the system. It is preventing the \nAmerican people from getting work done. An example is this very \nimportant bill dealing with law enforcement--Commerce-Justice-State--\nFBI agents. Senator Mikulski has worked very hard. She is proud of this \nlegislation. We are going to go ahead and get it done without the \nRepublicans. We are going to go ahead and do it. Their earmarks are \nincluded. We are not going to take away any of their earmarks because \nwe believe in fairness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10352-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, yesterday was a fateful day as we moved \nforward on health care legislation. Yesterday America's Health \nInsurance Plans, the insurance companies, unveiled a report criticizing \nthe Senate Finance Committee's health reform legislation. This is the \ncommittee that negotiated with Republicans for 6 months; the committee \nthat worked with the insurance industry for 6 months; a committee that \nhas, frankly, not included a public option; a committee that has, \nfrankly, bent over backwards to listen to insurance company interests.\n  America's Health Insurance Plans unveiled a report saying that as a \nresult of this health care bill, health insurance premiums are going to \nincrease by double-digit percentages as far as the eye can see.\n  Families USA pointed out that ``this criticism by the insurance lobby \ngives hypocrisy a bad name.''\n  AHIP, America's Health Insurance Plans, talked about rate shock; that \nif we move forward on this health insurance bill, Americans are going \nto be victimized by rate shock. Rate shock is a significant increase in \npremiums that insurance companies have inflicted upon Americans over \nthe past decade, year after year after year.\n  I just got off the phone with a small business person in Cincinnati \nwho has fought as hard as he possibly can. He came to my townhall \nmeeting in Cincinnati, the most conservative part of the State, saying \nhe needed to go in with other businesses in an insurance exchange, \nperhaps with a public option so he could get his rates in check. The \ninsurance companies just raised his rates so dramatically that he is \nlikely going to lose his insurance.\n  Rate shock is when between 2000 and 2009 average family insurance \npremiums for employer-based health coverage increase from $6,700 to \nover $13,073, an increase of 93 percent. Rate shock is when between \n1999 and 2009, premiums for employer-sponsored insurance in my State--\nfrom Findlay to Gallipolis, from Galion to Youngstown--grew 108 \npercent. Rate shock is when 20 percent of middle-income Ohio families \nspend more than 10 percent of their income on health care. Rate shock \nis when between 2000 and 2008, the percentage of employees with an \nannual deductible greater than $1,000 increased from 1 percent to 18 \npercent. One out of five Ohioans is paying a more than $1,000 \ndeductible. Rate shock is when since 2000, insurance costs for small \nbusinesses have increased 129 percent.\n  Who is going to provide the jobs in this economy to get us back on \nour feet as a nation? It is small businesses. Yet the insurance \ncompanies have more than doubled insurance premiums for small business, \na 129-percent increase in less than a decade. Rate shock is when small \nbusiness workers pay an average of 18 percent more in premiums than \nthose in large firms for the same benefits.\n  When America's Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry, talks \nabout rate shock, rate shock is what they have inflicted on the \nAmerican public, what they have inflicted on large corporations, what \nthey have inflicted on small business people, what they have inflicted \non individual American workers, on individuals holding insurance plans.\n  Here is what rate shock, inflicting these huge premiums, has done. We \nknow what it has done to the American public. We know what it has done \nto small business. We know what it has done to workers. We know what it \nhas done to taxpayers. We know what it has done to local and State \ngovernments wrestling with insurance costs while providing other \neducation, health care, public safety, public service services.\n  Here is what it has meant to insurance companies. Between 2000 and \n2007, rate shock, inflicting high costs on ratepayers, has meant \nprofits at 10 of the country's largest publicly traded health insurance \ncompanies going up 428 percent. They are doing just fine, thanks to the \nrate shock they are imposing upon American business and American \nindividuals.\n  From 2007, CEOs of these companies collected a combined total \ncompensation--10 companies, 1 year--of $118.6 million, $11.9 million \neach, 468 times more than the $25,000 an average American worker made \nthat year. The CEOs of the insurance companies made $11.9 million each \nwhile they are saying to people: Sorry, you can't get insurance. You \nhave a preexisting condition. Sorry, we are going to rescind your \npolicies because you got too sick and you spent too much. Sorry, we \nwill not cover you. We will cancel your policy because you are the \nwrong age or the wrong gender or live in the wrong place or you have \nthe wrong disability.\n  The first half of this year, to top it all off, here is what rate \nshock meant to the insurance industry. AHIP spent $3.9 million on in-\nhouse lobbying efforts and another $500,000 on outside lobbying firms \nand consultants.\n  It is just a question of fairness. The question of fairness says to \nall of us, this is not right. People are paying more and more for their \ninsurance. People are losing their insurance because they cannot afford \nit. People are getting cut off their insurance because of preexisting \nconditions. People are being discriminated against because of \ndisability or gender or age or location. That--coupled with the \nsalaries, the CEO compensation--all of that is not fair.\n  But what does that mean individually? Why, other than questions of \nfairness--which really matter. Another is productivity in our economy. \nAs these health care costs are so burdensome to employers, they simply \ncannot hire people. I spoke today to a group. I had a roundtable, one \nof about 140 I have done around Ohio, in my hometown of Mansfield, OH, \nwith about 15 manufacturers, people who are struggling with all kinds \nof things.\n  They cannot get credit. They are victimized by the Chinese currency \nproblems that American industry faces and our government will not do \nenough about. They are badly hurt by health insurance costs. So we know \nabout the question of fairness. It is not fair what has happened to our \nworkers, to our small manufacturers, to our companies, to our \ntaxpayers, while CEOs are doing so well.\n  But let me talk about what this really means. I am going to read four \nor five letters from people in Ohio about why this matters, why this \ninsurance crisis matters. I know the Presiding Officer gets letters--\nwhether they come from Hanover or whereever they come from in her \nState--she gets letters such as this too. Most of the letters I get are \nfrom people who thought they had pretty good insurance, and then they \nget sick and their insurance is canceled or then they find out that one \nof their children has a preexisting condition or a spouse has a \npreexisting condition and they cannot renew their insurance or it gets \nso costly they cannot renew it. That is what comes through in so many \nof these letters.\n  Let met share a few of them. This is a letter from Robert from Lake \nCounty. It is a county just east of Cleveland on Lake Erie in northeast \nOhio:\n\n       In 1986 my wife was terminally ill with cancer and several \n     other illnesses. When I switched jobs and looked for new \n     insurance, we were denied because of her pre-existing \n     condition.\n       In 2001, when I was 58, I lost my job. When COBRA ran out, \n     I was denied insurance based on my pre-existing conditions of \n     diabetes and heart disease.\n       I managed to limp through until I turned 65 and became \n     eligible for Medicare.\n       I'm sure the fear and anxiety I suffered over health \n     insurance hasn't been at all beneficial to my overall health.\n\n  I have heard person after person--in talking to people one-on-one or \nlooking at the letters they write or reading something they have \nwritten on the Internet--tell me they are not quite 65, they might be \n55, they might be 62, and they just hope they can hold on until they \nare 65 so they can get a decent government-sponsored health plan, \nMedicare. That tells me why the public is demanding the public option. \nThe public understands a public option--which is just an option--will \nmake the insurance companies more honest.\n  A public option will not cancel people for having a preexisting \ncondition anymore than Medicare does. A public option will give people \nchoice. It will discipline the insurance companies and keep costs in \ncheck.\n  We know, when you look at this report I just talked about--this AHIP \nreport that talked about rate shock--that is as good an argument for a \npublic option as any I have ever heard of because the insurance \ncompanies say: We are going to raise rates even higher\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\nthan we have already raised them, an even higher percentage than we \nhave already raised them, an even faster climb than we have already \ndone in the last decade. That is why we need a public option, to \ndiscipline the insurance companies, to compete with them. They seem to \nbe competing to raise rates, not competing to keep things in check, \nunlike the way competition used to work in this country. That is why a \npublic option is so important.\n  Shelly from Coshocton, a community in sort of southeast, east central \nOhio, writes:\n\n       I have no health insurance coverage for myself or my son. \n     My husband is disabled and receives Social Security \n     Disability and Medicare.\n       My son was born with a congenital heart defect [and] has \n     already had one open heart surgery.\n       Along with my pre-existing condition, neither of us can \n     afford private coverage.\n       Pre-existing conditions should be illegal for insurance \n     companies to use to delay health care for Americans.\n\n  Shelly is right. When she says that, understand that, yes, we are \ngoing to change the law so we are going to ban the whole practice of \n``preexisting condition.'' No more ``preexisting condition'' under this \nlegislation, no more caps on cost, on coverage, and no more annual or \nlifetime caps, no more discrimination based on gender or disability or \ngeography or age.\n  But even with that, we clearly need a public option to enforce those \nrules so the insurance companies cannot find a way to game the system, \nas they have over and over, year after year after year. That should be \nour commitment to Shelly from Coshocton.\n  Tina from Cuyahoga County--the Cleveland area--writes:\n\n       My husband and I have been married for 30 years.\n       We've lived in the same three bedroom home for the last 26 \n     years, where we sent our two sons to college, without debt, \n     while running our small business.\n       We have our own insurance, but have seen raised deductibles \n     and scaled back coverage. I would guess we've spent some \n     $150,000 on premiums over the healthy years of our lives.\n       Unfortunately, last fall I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's \n     lymphoma. The deficiencies in our current policy were then \n     made clear.\n\n  Again, a good health care policy until she really needed it, which is \ntoo much par for the course in this country.\n\n       Our plan covers only certain services. After 2 different \n     and unsuccessful treatments, I have an $80,000 balance with \n     the hospital.\n       I firmly believe most people have no idea of their exposure \n     because they have been fortunate not to have had the need to \n     use their insurance. I alternate between being furious and \n     depressed.\n       At 53, what have I to look forward to other than single \n     handedly having ruined my family's financial future.\n       Something has to be done. It is immoral that insurance \n     companies should make a profit over people's health \n     conditions.\n\n  I think that says it all: again, so many people have what they think \nis pretty good health insurance until something really bad happens. \nThat is what health insurance should be all about. It really is not \ninsurance if it does not work when you really need it. And Tina from \nthe Cleveland area understands that. A public option will work to make \nsure she continues with her health coverage, that she cannot be denied \ncoverage, that even when she gets really sick, she will be in a pool \nthat will work for her.\n  I have two more letters, Madam President, and then I will yield the \nfloor to the Senator from Utah.\n  This is a letter from Priscilla from Miami County--a county in \nsouthwest Ohio, just north of Dayton:\n\n       I am a 62-year-old widow with controlled cholesterol and \n     high blood pressure.\n       I bring in $2,300 per month on fixed income but pay $1,900 \n     per month for health insurance premiums.\n\n  So $2,300 a month she brings in, and she pays $1,900 a month for \nhealth insurance premiums. She is not quite Medicare eligible. She is \n62 years old.\n\n       I keep my thermostat at 62 degrees in the winter and \n     minimize the use of hot water, unless when needed.\n       I spend about $100 per month on groceries.\n       Since August 2007, I've spent more than $40,000 in \n     premiums, co-pays, and out-of-pocket expenses.\n       My private insurer paid only $8,500 for my medical and \n     prescription claims in that period.\n\n  Priscilla's health insurance simply does not work for her. It is a \nhealth insurance policy that too often does not respond when she needs \nit to respond. She likely--as so many people I know and who call my \noffice--spends much of her time on the phone trying to get her \ninsurance company to pay. You have to figure the stress on people, \ndealing with insurance companies and getting turned down time after \ntime after time, probably compromises their health.\n  She has to wait another 3 years before she is Medicare eligible. This \nlegislation will help her with that. This legislation will give her the \nchance to go into an insurance exchange. She can pick a private plan or \nshe can pick the public option. Either way, she simply will not have \nthese kinds of premiums. She will not have these kinds of out-of-pocket \nexpenses. She will have some costs. She will get some help because she \ndoes not make very much money. That is what this country should do, I \nthink, for people like Priscilla.\n  The last letter I will read is from Cheryl from my home county of \nLorain--Elyria, Avon, North Ridgeville, Oberlin, Amherst, that area of \nthe State just west of Cleveland on Lake Erie:\n\n       We are a working class family riding the fine line between \n     blue and white collar income.\n       I work as a business executive assistant, aware of how big \n     business can influence the outcome of this bill. My husband \n     is a retired fire captain who was forced into retirement \n     after being injured on the job.\n       We get insurance through my employer, but we've seen costs \n     increased considerably in the last three years alone.\n       Our daughters, ages 28 and 26, both work but face difficult \n     choices regarding their health care.\n       One daughter's employer plan is based on her overall \n     health--she lives in fear that something like high blood \n     pressure could possibly increase medical costs by hundreds of \n     dollars a month.\n       My other daughter is a contract worker who has to pay for \n     her own insurance. She makes about $45,000 a year and \n     supports a family of three, but has out-of-pocket expenses \n     anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 before the deductible is even \n     met.\n       These are examples of hard working people who will survive \n     in the short term but in the long term will be paying medical \n     insurance rather than a house payment.\n       Please continue the fight, you cannot let [us] down.\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer from New Hampshire gets these kinds of \nletters from people who are really the backbone of this country, people \nsuch as her daughter making $45,000 a year. She has had barely a \nmiddle-class standard of living. It is clear, with her job as a \nbusiness executive assistant, she has all kinds of out-of-pocket costs.\n  If we are going to get this economy back in shape--and I got that \nagain today talking with those manufacturers, small companies of 30 and \n50 and 100 people, most of them--if we are going to get this economy \nback in shape, we cannot have health care costs weighing down our \nbusinesses and individuals who simply cannot get ahead, who are \nfighting every day to figure out: How do I pay for this? How do I \nbalance paying for my medicine with making my house payment, with \nheating my home, with buying my food? How can we in this society \ncontinue to do that?\n  Then, to top it off, as I said, the insurance industry, yesterday, \nput out a report that talked about rate shock, that if this bill \npasses--the kind of threat they made to this institution, to the House \nand the Senate, to the American people--they are going to jump health \ncare prices.\n  Well, that is, again, why the public option is so important. The \npublic option will provide competition to these insurance companies, \ncompetition they are not used to getting from each other. It might mean \nthat the chief executive officers of the 10 biggest companies will not \naverage $11.9 million in salaries. It might mean their profits will not \ncontinue to escalate. It might mean they have to tighten their belts \nand compete with a public option so their prices are more in check with \nwhat the American people can afford.\n  The time is now. It is imperative that we in this institution send \nlegislation to the President of the United States for him to sign--\ngood, strong legislation that helps small businesses, that helps people \nkeep the insurance they have, if they want to keep it, if they are \nsatisfied with it, and has a public option included in it to compete \nwith insurance companies and keep them honest and to keep costs in \ncheck. It is our duty. It is our imperative. It is what we must do in \nthe next few weeks.\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have taken a lot of votes in my Senate \nservice, as I have had the proud honor of representing my fellow Utahns \nand of course all Americans across this great Nation. I deliver these \nremarks with a heavy heart because what could have been a strong \nbipartisan vote reflecting our collective and genuine desire for \nresponsible reform in the Senate Finance Committee has ended as another \nlargely partisan exercise as we take another step forward toward the \nflawed solution of reforming one-sixth of our economy with more \nspending, more government, and more taxes.\n  Having said that, I wish to compliment the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Max Baucus, from Montana, for having worked so long and \nhard to try to get that bill through the committee. I disagree with the \nbill, but I also recognize that type of effort, and I have great regard \nfor Senator Baucus and others on the committee as well. But I have \nworked through almost 4 weeks of debate in the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee and now through 2 weeks of strenuous debate on \nthe Senate Finance Committee. I was in the original Gang of 7 trying to \ncome up with a bipartisan approach, but I realized that not enough \nflexibility had been given to Senator Baucus, and I decided to leave \nthat group of seven, and I am glad I did, because I predicted when I \nleft exactly what this bill would turn out to be.\n  It almost seems as though these hundreds of hours of debate in the \npast were for naught. It is important for Americans everywhere to \nunderstand that the bills we have spent hundreds of hours working on \nare not the bills that will be discussed on the Senate floor. The real \nbill that is currently being written behind closed doors in the dark \ncorners of the Capitol and the White House--and we can all only hope \nthat all of us, especially American families, will have ample \nopportunity, at least 72 hours, to review the full bill before we are \nasked to consider this on the floor and vote on it--is a bill that \naffects every American life and every American business. The health \ncare reform bill is too big and too important to not have a full public \nreview.\n  I wish to spend my time today talking about why the Baucus bill fails \nPresident Obama's own test for responsible health care reform. This \nbill is another example of Washington once again talking from both \nsides of the mouth and using technicalities and policy nuances to evade \nthe promises made to our seniors and middle-class families. First, \nPresident Obama in his own words has consistently stated: ``If you like \nyour current plan, you will be able to keep it.'' Let me repeat that: \n``If you like your plan, you will be able to keep it.'' That was given \non July 2, 2009, right at the White House, and we are all familiar with \nthat particular commitment.\n  One of the amendments I offered in the Finance Committee simply \nprovided that if more than 1 million Americans would lose the coverage \nof their choice because of the implementation of this bill, then this \nlegislation would not go into effect. This was a simple and \nstraightforward amendment; no nuance, no double-talk. This amendment \nwas defeated along party lines.\n  It should come as no surprise to anyone on the Finance Committee that \nin a recent Rasmussen poll, a majority of Americans with health care \ncoverage--almost 53 percent--said that the bill would force them to \nchange their coverage. This bill is rife with policies that will do \nanything but allow you to keep your coverage. It cuts upward of $133 \nbillion out of the Medicare Advantage Program, which will adversely \nimpact the availability of these plans for millions of American \nseniors, especially in rural areas. That was what it was designed for. \nIt is pushing for policies at the Federal level that actuaries \nacknowledge could increase premiums significantly for millions of \nAmericans, not to mention the new insurance tax which will cost \nfamilies another $500 in higher premiums. This will make current \ncoverage unaffordable for countless Americans.\n  American families are very smart; they are very astute. They realize \nthat there is no free lunch, especially in Washington. They are being \npromised an almost $1 trillion bill--that is really an understatement \nof what it is, and I will get into that later--that will not increase \ndeficits, not raise taxes, and not cut benefits. Only Washington speak \ncould try to sell a promise such as this with a straight face.\n  Second: The President has consistently pledged: ``We're not going to \nmess with Medicare.'' Once again, this is another simple and \nstraightforward pledge that this bill has now evaded through Washington \ndouble speech or doubletalk. This bill strips, as I say, $133 billion \nout of the Medicare Advantage Program that currently covers 10.6 \nmillion seniors, or almost one out of four seniors in the Medicare \nProgram. According to the Congressional Budget Office, under this bill, \nthe value of so-called additional benefits such as vision care and \ndental care would decline from $135 to $42 by 2019. That is a reduction \nof more than 70 percent of benefits. You heard me right: 70 percent. I \noffered an amendment to protect these benefits for our seniors, many of \nwhom are low-income Americans who reside in rural States. However, this \namendment too was defeated in the Finance Committee. The majority chose \nto skirt the President's pledge about no reduction in Medicare benefits \nfor our seniors by characterizing the benefits being lost--vision care, \ndental care, and reduced hospital deductibles--as extra benefits, not \nstatutory benefits.\n  Let me make this point as clearly as I can. When we promise American \nseniors that we will not reduce their benefits, let us be honest about \nthat promise. Benefits are benefits, so we are either going to protect \nbenefits or not. It is that simple. Under this bill, if you are a \nsenior with Medicare Advantage, the unfortunate answer is no, you are \ngoing to lose benefits.\n  Thirdly, the President has consistently stated: ``I can make a firm \npledge. Under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will \nsee any form of tax increase.''\n  That was when the President was a candidate in New Hampshire on \nSeptember 12, 2008, and he has said that since.\n  Let us examine the realities of this bill. As I said before, there is \nno such thing as a free lunch, especially when\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nWashington is the one inviting you over. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, there is more than $400 billion in new taxes \nunder this bill to continue to fund Washington's insatiable appetite \nfor spending. Here are some of the highlights of the $400 billion: $23 \nbillion of new taxes on employers through a mandate that will \ndisproportionately affect low-income Americans and all at a time when \nour unemployment is rapidly approaching double digits. Some think we \nare already in double digits. There is $4 billion of new taxes on \nAmericans who fail to buy a Washington-defined level of coverage; $322 \nbillion of new taxes on everything from insurance premiums to \nprescription drugs to hearing devices and wheelchairs. Representatives \nfrom both the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, JCT, testified before the Finance Committee that these \ntaxes will be passed on to the consumers.\n\n  So even though this bill tries to hide these costs as indirect taxes, \naverage Americans who purchase health plans, use prescription drugs, \nand buy medical devices--everything from hearing aids to crutches--will \nend up footing the bill. By the way, it is interesting to note here \nthat although these tax increases and Medicare cuts will start as early \nas next year, subsidies to help people with their premiums which will \nskyrocket under this plan will not be available until July of 2013--\n3\\1/2\\ years later.\n  By the way, they are going to cut $400 billion out of Medicare. I \nremember a few years back in 1975 when, for that budget that year, we \nwere trying to find $23 billion out of Medicare and the other side just \nabout went berserk over that. Here we are cutting $400 billion out of \nMedicare that already has $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities.\n  So what about the promise of no taxes on families making less than \n$250,000? Look at the evidence. According to the data from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and former CBO director Doug Holtz-Eakin, 89 \npercent of these new taxes will be paid by taxpayers making less than \n$200,000 a year. The insurance excise tax alone would cost families up \nto $500 more in premiums. That is not all. The Joint Committee on \nTaxation also found that at least 71 percent of all penalties collected \nfrom the individual mandate will also come from those making less than \n$250,000. As I said, there is no free lunch in this town.\n  By the way, we all know when this bill is fully implemented it will \ncost significantly more. Every time Washington tells you that something \nwill cost a dollar, it usually costs $10. History is prologue. Medicare \nstarted off as a $65 million a year program and now has a $400 billion \nannual budget. So look for these taxes to only go up in the future as \nwe have just given the Federal Government a whole new checkbook.\n  So based on my count, this bill already has three strikes against \nPresident Obama's own pledges to the American people. He said: ``You \nkeep what you have.'' That is not true. ``No reduction in Medicare \nbenefits for our seniors.'' That is not true. ``No tax increases on \nfamilies making less than $250,000.'' That is not true. In fact, most \nof those taxes will go to the middle class at way below $250,000.\n  Lastly, let me talk a little bit about the myth of this proposal \nactually reducing the deficit by $81 billion over 10 years. Here is the \nharsh reality. The Congressional Budget Office recently reported that \nour national deficit for fiscal year 2009 alone was a shocking $1.4 \ntrillion. That is the highest deficit since 1945 in real terms.\n  Let me put this in perspective. This was the largest yearly deficit \nsince 1945. It was more than three times our deficit from last year. I \nremember how they were complaining about George Bush and those high \ndeficits. It is almost 10 percent of our entire economy. George Bush's \ndeficit was less than $500 billion. I thought it was too high. We are \nnow talking about $1.4 trillion in the first year of this presidency. \nKeep in mind the Democrats controlled the Congress in the last 2 years \nof the Bush presidency. This should send shivers down the spine of \nevery American out there. We are literally drowning the future of this \nNation in a sea of red ink.\n  Here is the fantasy: Congress will actually follow through with these \nmassive Medicare cuts that are being used to make this $829 billion \nspending bill deficit neutral. I challenge a single Member of the \nSenate to tell me when have we ever followed through on such massive \ncuts. Let me use the words of Dr. Doug Elmendorf, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, on this issue:\n\n       These projections assume that these proposals are enacted \n     and remain unchanged over the two decades which is often not \n     the case for major legislation. The long-term budgetary \n     impact will be quite different if those provisions were \n     ultimately changed or not fully implemented.\n\n  I could not have said it better myself. We all remember the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 which attempted to reduce Medicare spending by a \nmere $22 billion over 10 years. That proposal was mercilessly attacked \nby the other side of the aisle as being, among other things, \n``Orwellian'' and ``immoral.'' Now suddenly we are being asked to \nbelieve the Congress will follow through in almost $500 billion in cuts \nto Medicare?\n  Take another example: the physician payment. This bill only contains \na 1-year fix. After that, the doctors will face more than a 20-percent \ncut in their payments, seriously threatening access to Medicare for \nseniors. We all know that we have to fix this problem, and that we \nwill. Unfortunately, the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to \noverhaul this broken system are not included in this score that is \nsupposed to be balanced, and will go to further increasing our \nskyrocketing deficits.\n  Let's be honest about it. The reason they can keep it down to $829 \nbillion was by not counting the first 4 years; not having it \nimplemented until as late as 2014. In other words, that is 6 years. If \nyou extrapolate it out to 10 years, we have $1.7 trillion, $1.8 \ntrillion that this bill is going to cost.\n  One reason for that is because they know we are going to have to do \nthe doctor fix rather than have doctors being paid 25 percent less by \nMedicare and even less by Medicaid, and hospitals 25 to 30 percent less \nby Medicare and even less by Medicaid.\n  The biggest bait and switch on the American people about this bill's \nimpact on the deficit is a simple math trick. If something is too \nexpensive to do for a full 10-year period, just do it for 6 years. That \nis what they have done. Most of the major spending provisions of the \nbill do not go into effect until 2013 or even 2014, coincidentally, \nafter the 2012 Presidential elections. So what we are seeing is not a \nfull 10-year score but rather a 6-year score.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee, the full 10-year score of \nthis plan will easily surpass $1.8 trillion, fully implemented over 10 \nyears, the way it is written. I believe it will be more than that in \nactuality when we add the doctor fix that we are going to have to do.\n  That is on top of the $2.4 trillion we are spending right now.\n  In our current fiscal environment where the government will have to \nborrow nearly 43 cents out of every dollar it spends this year, let's \nthink hard about what we are doing to our country and our future \ngenerations. Our national debt is on a path to double. We can see the \nred lines on the chart. That is the projected national debt since this \nadministration has taken over. It is on a path to double in the next 5 \nyears and triple in the next 10 years. There is still time for us to \nstep back, press the reset button, and write a bill we can all support \nand be proud of.\n  Madam President, what is their answer in the end? I guarantee you, \nthe final bill is going to have some form of--it may be disguised \nsemantically--a government-run plan. That scares every American.\n  In 1965, when we did Medicare, the argument was that Medicare will be \non an equal footing with the private industry. Well, it didn't take \njust a couple of years, and they found out they could not do it. So \nthey had to set prices.\n  Today, Medicare pays doctors 20 percent less and hospitals 25 percent \nless, and Medicaid is even worse than that. If we think the Federal \nGovernment can take over the whole health care system and save money, \nwe haven't observed the history of Medicare. Medicare today is a $38 \ntrillion unfunded liability that we are saddling our kids and grandkids \nwith--and even in my case, my great grandkids. I am concerned. This \nshould not be a political issue.\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  We ought to be working together. I guarantee, if we turn all of this \nover to the government--I heard the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nwho is very sincere and very loquacious and has an interesting \npersonality. I care for him. But if we do that, everybody is going to \nsuffer because the Federal Government cannot do it better. It is just \nthat simple. We have all the years since 1965 to prove that.\n  The fact is, if we turn this over to the almighty Federal Government \nand the bureaucrats in Washington, it will cause a furor like we cannot \nbelieve in this country, and rightly so. I heard the distinguished \nSenator say: Well, if the insurance premiums should increase because of \nthis bill, let's turn it over to the government, and we will save all \nthat money.\n  What about the $38 trillion in unfunded liability in Medicare as we \nstand here today? What about Medicaid going into bankruptcy within the \nnext 10 years? There is nobody who doubts that who looks at the \nfinancial matters in this country. The reason they are is because they \nare run by the almighty Federal Government. I would much rather see a \nsystem whereby we allow the States themselves, which have different \ndemographics--and the Chair is from New Hampshire, which is different \nfrom Massachusetts, and it is also different from my State of Utah. I \nwill bet that the New Hampshirites can handle their problems a lot \nbetter than the Federal Government in Washington. I know Utah can. We \nhave a good health care system because we do all the things that are \nnecessary to make it good. It is closer to the people, and the \ngovernment is closer to the people. They have to be responsible to the \npeople.\n  I would like to see a system where we basically block grant these \nfunds and let the States set up their own programs and have 50 State \nlaboratories that literally can show us the way; where we can compare \nplans and see the good in one State and maybe adapt it to ours. If we \nturn this all over to a government plan, run by Washington, I cannot \nbegin to tell you the stifling that will be to innovation and good \nideas compared to allowing the 50 State laboratories, as federalism was \ndesigned to set up.\n  The majority leader said: The Republicans are just the party of no; \nthey have no plan. We have 40 Members here and we have six plans. We \nfind that even some of our plans are off the charts in cost. Some are \ngood. The fact is, we know this system needs to be reformed. Every \nRepublican is for reforming the system. We are not for bankrupting the \ncountry. We are not for having these almighty bureaucrats in Washington \ndetermine what we all have to do. We are not for turning everything \nover to the government, which is already running Medicare and Medicaid \ninto bankruptcy. We don't believe a central form of government should \ncontrol everything.\n  Our Founding Fathers didn't believe that. That is why they did the \nConstitution the way they did it. Anybody who believes they can do it \nbetter in a government-run program hasn't studied history. I have to \nadmit some of our colleagues on the other side do believe a single-\npayer system is better. Single-payer is socialism, pure and simple. \nThey don't like to call it socialism, but that is what it is. When we \nget socialism, we get everything that goes with it, and that means \nrationing.\n  We have to be reasonable about what services we can give. The States \nwill do it the right way. The Federal Government will mess it up, I \nguarantee it. I don't know anybody who has been here as long as I have \nwho could not acknowledge that. I don't think they should try to \ndispute that. I think they would be run out of Washington. If you want \nbureaucrats between your doctor and you, this is the way to do it--a \ngovernment-run plan right here in Washington, with all the costs and \nexpenses and the oblivious not caring about the future that we have \nseen year after year.\n  That is why Republicans are up in arms. That is why we cannot support \nthis bill. I wish we could work with our colleagues and get together. I \nwish we could do a bipartisan bill. I might add that one person is not \nbipartisan. You can call it that, but it really isn't. I deeply respect \nthat one person, and she knows that.\n  The fact is, we are a long way from having a health care bill. The \nfurther fact is, it will not be the bill that passed out of the \ncommittee today. It is going to even be worse.\n  If I were sitting on the Democratic side, I would be worried to death \nabout what they are finally going to come up with. They really do, for \nthe most part--the majority--believe a single-payer system, run by \nWashington, DC, and the bureaucrats here is going to be better than one \nrun by the States. I have to admit there are some States that would \nmess it up, no question. We can all name them too. There are generally \nStates that are behind the single-payer system, but there aren't many \nof them. The vast majority of States would show us the way and help us \nto find the way and help us to do a good job on health care.\n  Madam President, I am very concerned. I am one who likes to work in a \nbipartisan way, but it has to make sense. What we passed out of there \ntoday doesn't make sense, and it is going to get a lot worse. By the \ntime they take the HELP Committee bill, which was a totally Democratic \npartisan bill, and take what they want out of that, and by the time \nthey take the tricommittee bill over in the House, which is a partisan \nDemocratic bill, it will get worse. When it does, the American people \nare going to be the losers.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of Colorado pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 1777 are located in today's Record under ``Statements of \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. UDALL of Colorado assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10357-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10357-S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am so pleased that last Thursday we passed \nanother appropriations bill in regular order and with bipartisan \nsupport. I thank Chairman Kohl for his work to pass move this bill \nthrough the process. And I think Senator Brownback, the ranking member, \nfor his work on this bill as well.\n  This is a good bill--it is good for the Nation and it is good for my \nhome State of Nevada. By adopting this conference report we are making \ninvestments in rural towns, in working families, and in the farm \nfamilies that feed us.\n  This bill includes significant investments in rural development \nprograms to help our rural towns improve their hospitals, drinking \nwater and sewage systems. We also help rural communities attract \nbusinesses and jobs with investments in broadband access and business \nloan programs. These programs are especially important as we help \nfamilies living in rural towns get through these tough economic times \nand make their communities stronger.\n  In this bill we also increase funding from last year's levels for \nnutrition programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \nformerly known as food stamps, the Women Infants and Children program, \nthe Commodity Food Supplemental Program, the Emergency Food Assistance \nProgram and School Lunch and Breakfast. In addition, I am pleased that \nin this bill Nevada has been added to the list of States authorized to \nrun afterschool supper programs that will provide a hot meal for kids \nwho would otherwise go hungry. We have all seen the stories on the news \nand in the papers about the historic demand for Federal feeding \nprograms and the strain being placed on our local food banks and food \npantries. This bill will help families in Nevada and throughout the \nnation who are currently struggling to put food on the table.\n  We also make a significant investment in the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, CFTC, with $169 million, which is an increase of \n$23 million from last year. We are making this investment because we \nneed the CFTC to be capable of conducting rigorous oversight of futures \nmarkets, especially in\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\ncrude oil and other commodities. The CFTC must be fully equipped and \nstaffed so it can prevent the excessive speculation that drove oil \nprices to record highs last year and really hurt energy consumers. This \nfunding is an important investment that will help us rebuild our \neconomy on a stronger foundation.\n  In addition to these good programs, this bill also includes funding \nfor a number of important Nevada projects. We have funding for the \nNevada Arid Rangelands Initiative, Mormon cricket control, and noxious \nweed control. We have assistance for the Wildfire Support Group in \nOrovada to help them do fuels management. And we have funding for the \nUniversity of Nevada Reno for their work with the Food and Agriculture \nPolicy Research Institute, which does great research to help us \nunderstand what is going on in American agriculture so we can create \ngood programs to help our farmers.\n  This bill makes a number of important investments. So I am very \npleased that this bill has passed the Senate with broad support--76 \nSenators voting to send this conference report to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10358-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate and celebrate \nthe 50th aniversary of the St. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church.\n  For more than a century, a proud and vibrant Greek community has \nthrived in Nevada. 50 years ago, the parish of St. John the Baptist \nGreek Orthodox Church was established in Las Vegas, NV, to serve this \ndynamic community.\n  For half of a century, the parishioners at St. John the Baptist have \ncelebrated their Hellenic heritage through cultural and spiritual \nevents, all while giving back to the Las Vegas community through \nservice. As one example of the many ways parishioners have inspired \nsouthern Nevada, the Panagia chapter of the Ladies Philoptochos Society \nmeets monthly to serve the parish and the community by working in a \nhands-on fashion to serve the liturgical, charitable, educational, \nyouth, and crisis needs of the community.\n  Las Vegas is profoundly enriched by the St. John the Baptist Greek \nChurch. Every year, the church holds a Greek Festival, where Nevadans \nof all backgrounds listen to Greek music, eat Greek food, and embrace \nthe spirit of kefi--a passion for life that radiates from the \nparishioners at St. John the Baptist.\n  It is my honor to celebrate the ``Golden Heritage'' of this storied \nchurch on Friday, October 16, 2009. To my friends at St. John the \nBaptist Greek Orthodox Church: OPA! May you celebrate many more \nsuccessful years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10358-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10358-S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, with the passing of Senator \nTeddy Kennedy, Americans lost a champion, the Senate lost a living \nlegend, and those of us who were fortunate to know him personally lost \na friend and mentor.\n  My memories of Teddy Kennedy reach beyond our short time together in \nthe Senate all the way back to my days as a kid when his brother Jack \nwas running for President of the United States. My father was an early \nsupporter of Jack's campaign and Teddy stayed at our house in Arizona \nwhile he was campaigning for his brother in the west. In those days, \nthe west was not considered a plum campaign assignment so, naturally, \nas the youngest of his clan it fell to him. We had a full house at the \ntime, with all of my brothers and sisters at home, so there wasn't even \na bed for him to sleep on. So he slept on the floor and never uttered a \nword of complaint. My memories of him from that time reflect the same \nTeddy Kennedy everyone describes today. He was a kind man, dedicated to \nhis brother and his family, and always patient with all of us kids and \nour questions.\n  In later years, Teddy continued to be a frequent visitor to New \nMexico. When our family was in the midst of a campaign and needed that \nextra bit of star power, Teddy was there the one person who could \nignite a crowd like no other. As Democrats, we loved having him in our \nState because he could always get a turnout. He had rallies with \n10,000-12,000 people--huge crowds for New Mexico.\n  Teddy Kennedy loved New Mexico and New Mexicans. And New Mexicans \nloved Teddy right back. In most family living rooms, you can find two \nprominently displayed photographs. They include at least one of the \nKennedys be it Jack, Bobby, or Teddy and at least one of the Pope. New \nMexicans just have a very deep affection for the entire Kennedy family.\n  My father eventually served in Jack Kennedy's Cabinet as Interior \nSecretary. These days, he talks a lot about his time in JFK's \nadministration. He says he is now the last of the generation. The last \nleaf on the tree from the Kennedy Cabinet. My father was greatly \nsaddened by Senator Kennedy's passing.\n  Just about every piece of monumental legislation that has come out of \nthis Senate over the past 50 years has had Teddy Kennedy's stamp on it \nsomehow. Whether it was voting rights or education improvements or \nhealth care reform--the cause of Teddy's life--America owes a debt of \ngratitude to the senior senator from Massachusetts for his leadership \nand unwavering dedication to making our country a better place for all \nwho call it home.\n  But the last chapter in Teddy's legacy remains incomplete. That \nchapter is health care reform, and it is our job as Teddy's colleagues \nand friends to pick up where he left off and pass legislation that \nhelps all Americans obtain affordable, quality health coverage. Teddy \nKennedy dreamed of a day when decent, quality health care is a \nfundamental right and not just a privilege. We are once again at the \nedge of transformative change in our country. We have Teddy Kennedy to \nthank for getting us to this point. I look forward to joining my \ncolleagues as we make Teddy's final dream a reality.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the enormous \ncontributions to this body and to our nation of our former colleague, \nthe late senior Senator from Massachusetts, Ted Kennedy.\n  When I took the oath as a U.S. Senator on January 3, 2009, I have to \nconfess to a fair amount of trepidation. Many great statesmen have \nserved before me in this esteemed body. For a former mayor from a State \nso distant from Washington, DC, taking a seat among these American \nleaders was a little intimidating.\n  No sitting Senator was a larger giant than Ted Kennedy and he \nimpacted my life long before I arrived here. As a boy born and raised \nin Anchorage, my parents spoke of the great pride in public service the \nKennedy family inspired in our family and in our Nation. My father, the \nlate Nick Begich, served for 2 years in the Congress with Senator \nKennedy, before my dad's death in 1972.\n  In many ways, Alaska and Massachusetts can't be further apart. Alaska \nis just celebrating its 50th year of admission to the United States and \nis a vast land rich in natural resources and of conservative, \nindependent-minded people. The Bay State was the site of one of \nAmerica's first settlements more than four centuries ago, is well \ndeveloped, and its residents decidedly more liberal.\n  Yet in the first week of April 1968, those differences faded when \nSenator Kennedy traveled to Sitka to deliver a speech to the Alaska \nDemocratic State Convention. The days-old assassination of Dr. Martin \nLuther King Jr. still ached in the hearts of Americans. In a scratchy \ntape recording of his speech, Senator Kennedy calls on Americans to \nrise above the frustration and fury they felt and to rededicate \nourselves to ``wipe away cynicism and to introduce the understanding \nthat we wish to see future generations exercise so they will not suffer \nas their mothers and fathers have suffered.''\n  The transcript of that speech shows that Alaska U.S. Senator Ernest \nGruening and the gathered Alaskans rose to a standing ovation as \nSenator Kennedy concluded his inspirational remarks. Today, 41 years \nlater, those words continue to serve as an inspiration to me.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet Senator Kennedy only \nonce, when he welcomed me as a Member of this body just a few months \nago. The intimidation I felt as a new Senator melted in his warmth and \ngraciousness.\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nIt will be a moment I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10359-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO SOUTHGATE'S VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the \nPiney Woods School in Piney Woods, MS on their 100th anniversary. The \nPiney Woods School was founded in 1909 by Dr. Laurence C. Jones to \neducate the head, heart, and hands of young people. This transformative \neducational model was first exhibited by teaching the children of poor \nsharecroppers to read. Today, the school serves as a home, and offers \neducational opportunities to students from 23 States and 7 foreign \ncountries.\n  The Piney Woods School is one of only four historically African-\nAmerican boarding schools left in the United States. Diligently \npreparing their students for institutions of higher learning, Piney \nWoods propels 98 percent of its graduates on to attend some of the best \ncolleges and universities in the country. The school has been featured \non ``60 Minutes'' and ``U.S. News and World Report'' for their \ncommitment to educate our disadvantaged youth.\n  The Piney Woods School has also made a commitment to service and \nleadership in their community, State, and country. The school was the \nfirst high school in the Nation to incorporate an Americorps program \ninto its curriculum. Each of the 50 members in the senior class at \nPiney Woods School serves in the role of a quarter-time Americorps \nvolunteer. In this capacity, they are actively involved in providing \nservice in disaster areas, building playgrounds in inner cities, \ncreating afterschool programs for youth in rural American communities, \nand providing online tutorial services for students.\n  I congratulate the Piney Woods School on 100 great years and commend \nthem on their educational successes and commitment to service. I am \nproud that the Piney Woods School is in my home State of Mississippi, \nand I wish them the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10359-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ACT\n\n   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nACT organization, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, this year. \nAs many of our colleagues know, ACT is an independent, nonprofit group \nbased in Iowa City that provides an array of testing, assessment, and \nresearch services in the areas of education and workforce development.\n  ACT was launched in 1959 as the American College Testing Program by a \nUniversity of Iowa professor of education and colleagues from 16 \nMidwestern States. Their goal was to help college-bound students find a \ngood match for their interests and aptitudes, and to help colleges and \nuniversities place students into appropriate freshman-level classes.\n  On November 7, 1959, about 75,000 students took the first ACT \nassessment. This year, nearly 1.5 million graduating seniors 45 percent \nof all high school graduates in the Nation took the ACT exam.\n  From its relatively humble beginnings a half century ago, ACT has \ngrown into an enterprise with a global reach. In addition to its \ntesting and assessment services, it has developed programs to prepare \nstudents for success in college. It has created the National Career \nReadiness Certificate, a tool that thousands of educators and employers \nnationwide use to confirm that individuals have essential core \nemployability skills. In addition, ACT is one of several partners in a \nnew Manufacturing Skills Certification System designed by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Nation's largest industrial trade \norganization.\n  In addition to its Iowa City headquarters, ACT has 12 field offices \nacross the United States, as well as offices in Australia, Korea, \nChina, Singapore, and Spain. It has a global workforce of nearly 1,500.\n  I salute all of the superb professionals at ACT, whose vision and \nhard work have built an organization respected worldwide for its \ninnovation and excellence. And I wish them even greater success in \ntheir next half century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10359-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE MUSCATINE HISTORY AND INDUSTRY CENTER\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nMuscatine History & Industry Center for being selected to participate \nin the rigorous Museum Assessment Program sponsored by the American \nAssociation of Museums.\n  The entire Muscatine community takes great pride in the History and \nIndustry Center's success in showcasing the city's past role as ``pearl \nbutton capital of the world,'' as well as the historic contributions of \nthree local enterprises: Bandag, a half-century-old company \nspecializing in silver tubes, mesh venting, and tire treads; HNI \nCorporation, the world's second largest manufacturer of office \nfurniture and the nation's No. 1 maker of gas- and wood-burning \nfireplaces; and Stanley Consultants, a global provider of engineering, \nenvironmental, and construction services.\n  The Muscatine History and Industry Center is a relatively small \nmuseum, but it has a very big impact. Not only does it welcome many \nthousands of visitors annually, it reaches out to the community with a \nvariety of programs and activities, and hosts daily visits by school \ngroups--from prekindergarten through high school. Students and youth \ngroups learn by interacting with the Center's artifacts and many hands-\non activities.\n  As the center begins participation in the Museum Assessment Program, \nit looks forward to an extended period of self-examination and peer \nreview designed to improve its operations and programming, and to \nidentify current and future challenges.\n  I congratulate the Muscatine History and Industry Center for taking \nthis giant step forward in its development as a museum.

The Art on Campus Collection \nconsists of more than 2,000 works of public art located all across the \ncampus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces, and offices. The Farm \nHouse Museum is a wonderful 19th century house and a National Historic \nLandmark, offering visitors a window into what life was like on campus \nin the university's earliest days, when most faculty members lived on \nthe college grounds.\n  These collections and museums make a powerful contribution to the \ncultural\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nlife of the ISU campus. They do so thanks to the quality of their art \nworks and artifacts. Just as importantly, they do so by inviting the \ncommunity to participate in special conferences, lectures, panel \ndiscussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks. University Museums has \nreinvented the idea of the museum as an educational and intellectual \ncenter, reaching out beyond the campus to the wider Ames community, \nincluding K-12 schools, with a wide range of cultural programs and \nactivities.\n  Accreditation by the American Association of Museums does not come \neasily. It involves a rigorous process in which a museum demonstrates \nits commitment to the highest professional standards, public service, \nand excellence in education.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of comprehensive cancer care planning under the \nMedicare Program and to improve the care furnished to individuals \ndiagnosed with cancer by establishing a Medicare hospice care \ndemonstration program and grant programs for cancer palliative care and \nsymptom management programs, provider education, and related research; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce the \nComprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, a bill to improve cancer \ncare quality by encouraging the development of written plans for cancer \ncare. The U.S. has a system of cancer care that is the envy of all \nnations for its technical superiority and the sophistication of \ntreatment offered to many patients. Unfortunately, not all Americans \nreceive the best care the Nation has to offer.\n  The Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act would take a step \ntowards ensuring that all Americans have access to cancer care of the \nhighest quality. The bill would authorize a Medicare service for cancer \ncare planning and encourage the adoption of care planning as a routine \npractice in all cancer care settings. The Institute of Medicine, IOM, \nhas identified as critical to high-quality cancer care the development \nof plans of care at the beginning of cancer treatment and at the \ntransition to survivorship. Moreover, the debate on health care reform \nhas highlighted care coordination to improve efficiency and reduce \nunnecessary utilization of health care resources. Care planning \nfacilitates the coordination of cancer care.\n  The need for this legislation was first brought to my attention in \ndramatic\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nfashion in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when cancer patients and \ntheir physicians scurried to recreate their records in order to \nminimize interruptions in care and to prevent any duplication of care. \nSome of the problems that cancer patients encountered could have been \neliminated if they had possessed written care plans. In a moving \nstatement at a Hill briefing in 2007, one of my constituents described \nher efforts to create her own care plan by grabbing various documents \nthat had been supplied by her oncologist as she was being evacuated \nfrom her home. Although not as useful as a clear care plan, these \ndocuments helped that patient and her new physician chart her course of \ncare. The experience taught us that key recommendations from the IOM \nrelated to cancer care--and especially the recommendation for cancer \ncare planning should be taken off the shelf and put into action.\n  There are many advantages of written cancer care plans for patients, \nphysicians, and the entire health care system. Patients report that \nthey are empowered by receiving care plans that spell out choices, \nfacilitate the coordination of treatment and symptom management, and \nidentify the follow-up services they will need post-treatment. \nPhysicians say that communication with their patients is improved by \ndeveloping and sharing care plans that are clear and concise, and some \npractices that have adopted care planning say that they are observing \nthe identification and elimination of duplicative tests and procedures \nand an overall greater efficiency in care, all achieved while enhancing \nquality of care and patient satisfaction.\n  The Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representatives Lois Capps and Charles \nBoustany, establishes a new Medicare service for cancer care planning \nand authorizes programs that are aimed at increasing the utilization of \ncare planning in all cancer care settings and ensuring access to care \nplans by underserved populations. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation to enhance cancer patients' access to \nquality care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Research program.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a \n     cancer care system that provides comprehensive and \n     coordinated care of high quality.\n       (2) The cancer care system has not traditionally offered \n     individuals with cancer a prospective and comprehensive plan \n     for treatment and symptom management, strategies for updating \n     and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care \n     professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and \n     treating possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.\n       (3) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis \n     and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that \n     begins at the time of diagnosis and often becomes more severe \n     at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side \n     effects, and late effects of cancer and its treatment may \n     have a serious adverse impact on the health, well-being, and \n     quality of life of cancer survivors.\n       (4) Cancer survivors who are members of racial and ethnic \n     minority groups may face special obstacles in receiving \n     cancer care that is coordinated and includes appropriate \n     management of cancer symptoms and treatment side effects.\n       (5) Individuals with cancer are sometimes put in the \n     untenable position of choosing between potentially curative \n     therapies and palliative care instead of being assured access \n     to comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and \n     symptom management.\n       (6) Comprehensive cancer care should incorporate access to \n     psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of \n     cancer (and the symptoms of its treatment), including pain, \n     nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and depression.\n       (7) Comprehensive cancer care should include a means for \n     providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary \n     and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to \n     ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up \n     monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer \n     and cancer treatment.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Ensuring Quality \n     Cancer Care'', described the elements of quality care for an \n     individual with cancer to include--\n       (A) the development of initial treatment recommendations by \n     an experienced health care provider;\n       (B) the development of a plan for the course of treatment \n     of the individual and communication of the plan to the \n     individual;\n       (C) access to the resources necessary to implement the \n     course of treatment;\n       (D) access to high-quality clinical trials;\n       (E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the treatment of \n     the individual; and\n       (F) psychosocial support services and compassionate care \n     for the individual.\n       (9) In its report, ``From Cancer Patient to Cancer \n     Survivor: Lost in Transition'', the Institute of Medicine \n     recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary \n     treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care \n     along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.\n       (10) Since more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur \n     among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, the problems of \n     providing cancer care are problems of the Medicare program.\n       (11) Shortcomings in providing cancer care, resulting in \n     inadequate management of cancer symptoms and insufficient \n     monitoring and treatment of late effects of cancer and its \n     treatment, are related to problems of Medicare payments for \n     such care, inadequate professional training, and insufficient \n     investment in research on symptom management.\n       (12) Changes in Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer \n     care, enhanced public and professional education regarding \n     symptom management, and more research related to symptom \n     management and palliative care will enhance patient decision-\n     making about treatment options and will contribute to \n     improved care for individuals with cancer from the time of \n     diagnosis of the individual through the end of the life of \n     the individual.\n\n     TITLE I--COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CARE UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill for the relief of Hotaru Nakama Ferschke; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, we are debating a lot of great long-term \nissues in this body. I wish to speak for a short period of time today \nabout something on the other end of the political spectrum, about \nsomething that I believe is an issue--a small issue--a private bill \nthat all of us should come together on in rather quick measure.\n  Every now and then, there comes an issue that tells us a lot about \nwho we are and how we live up to our promises, great and small, and \nparticularly the promises that we make to those who step forward and \nplace their lives on the line in order to carry out the policies that \nwe ourselves put in place.\n  Like all of the Members of this body, I take a back seat to no one in \nmy affection and support for the people who step forward and serve our \ncountry. I come from a family that has a long citizen-soldier \ntradition. I have several ancestors--direct ancestors--who fought in \nthe American Revolution, and we have participated as citizen-soldiers \nin just about every war since then.\n  My colleagues know how strongly I feel about the U.S. Marine Corps. I \nhad the great privilege of commanding marines in combat in Vietnam. My \nbrother was a marine. My son is a marine. My son-in-law is a marine.\n  Many of my colleagues know of my long association with the people of \nOkinawa, beginning almost 41 years ago when I first was there on my way \ninto Vietnam, but continuing as a journalist, as a government official, \nas a tourist, as a guest of the government.\n  As most of my colleagues know, in my nongovernment service, I \nprincipally made my living as a writer, as a novelist. All of these \nissues dovetail in this private bill that I and the two Senators from \nTennessee are introducing today.\n  In the first novel I wrote, which was about the Vietnam war, a \nsubplot was about a young marine who fell in love with an Okinawan girl \nand who, after being wounded, went back into Vietnam, had left her with \nchild, and was killed. She, not knowing this, bore the burden of \ncarrying his son without having been formally married to this young \nmarine. Flash forward 40 years to the future and to a different war, \nand we have a situation that I believe needs some prompt action on our \npart.\n  This private bill is not asking for any favors. It is not asking for \nany special consideration. It is simply asking that the young widow of \na marine be treated like any other widow.\n  SGT Michael Ferschke, a 22-year-old marine, had been serving in \nOkinawa and had met Hotaru Nakama. They dated for a year before he \ndeployed to Iraq. Just before he deployed, they found out that she was \nwith child. They had, by all independent verifications, agreed that \nthey would be married before they discovered she had been with child. \nHe deployed to Iraq, and due to the circumstances of his combat time, \nthey arranged to be married by telephone on July 10, 2008, when he was \nin Iraq. One month later to the day, he was killed.\n  That marriage is a marriage that is recognized, including in the \nState of Virginia, as a valid marriage. And yet because of an \nidiosyncracy in our immigration laws that dates back 55 years, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, for immigration purposes, will not \nrecognize this marriage.\n  This quirk in the law was put into place during the Korean war in \norder to prevent fraudulent marriages that had never been consummated. \nBut clearly in this case, this is a marriage that could not be \nconsummated because this young man was serving our country in Iraq. \nThey have a child.\n  Every agency of the U.S. Government has done everything they can on \nthis young widow's behalf. She is staying with the young marine's \nfamily in Tennessee on a tourist visa. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of State, the U.S. Marine Corps--all have been \nas helpful as they can be in assisting this marine's young widow in her \ndesire to have permanent immigration status in this country. There is \nno way it can happen under present law because of the peculiarities of \nthe law. There is only one way that can happen, and that is if we pass \na special bill that will do only one thing, and that is to give her the \nexact status that she would have had if they had been standing next to \neach other when they exchanged their vows in marriage. And there is \nonly one reason they were not standing next to each other when they \nexchanged their vows in marriage, and that is because he was serving \nhis country in Iraq.\n  I earnestly hope that all of this body and the other body can come \ntogether and remove this idiosyncracy from the lives of these people \nwho have suffered so much because Michael Ferschke, sergeant, U.S. \nMarine Corps, stepped forward and did what we asked him to do and \nserved our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW:\n  S. 1776. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the update under the Medicare physician fee schedule for \nyears beginning with 2010 and to sunset the application of the \nsustainable growth rate formula, and for other purposes; read the first \ntime.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise for just a moment because I am \nintroducing a bill today that I will speak more about at another time, \nbut it is a very important bill for the physicians of this country.\n  We have had a failed, flawed payment system in place for many years \nas it relates to physicians, and we come back\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nevery year, in fact, and stop the cuts that are proposed under that \nflawed system to make sure we are not putting our physicians in harm's \nway as it relates to their Medicare reimbursements.\n  This has gone on year after year after year after year. We all know \nthat the sustainable growth rate process is flawed and yet we have not \nfixed it permanently. So the legislation I have would, in fact, fix \nthis permanently and guarantee we are stopping this cycle that we put \nour physicians and hospitals through every year, where there may be a \ncut, there may not be a cut, and in the end we have to come in and fix \nit.\n  So this is a bill that would permanently change the payment system \nfor physicians to a fairer system. It does have a cost to it. It is \nless than it was prior to the very positive action the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services took a few weeks ago, removing the costs of \nmedicine from the formula. It should never have been there in the first \nplace. But by removing that, that means the overall costs are less than \nthey otherwise would be.\n  But it is important we get this right, we fix what has been a very \nflawed system. As we go into the health care reform debate, I think it \nis important we get this done right first so every physician \nunderstands we are not going to put them in this position year after \nyear after year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1777. A bill to facilitate the remediation of abandoned hardrock \nmines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise tonight to announce that \nI am introducing legislation designed to help promote the cleanup of \nabandoned and inactive hard rock mines that are a menace to the \nenvironment and public health throughout the country, but especially to \nthe West.\n  In previous sessions of Congress when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I introduced similar bills. Following the introduction \nof those previous bills, revisions were made to incorporate a number of \nchanges developed in consultation with a wide range of interested \nparties. These parties included representatives of the Western \nGovernors' Association, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nhardrock mining industry, and environmental groups.\n  The bill I am introducing today is also the product of further \nconsultations. It represents years of effort to reach agreement on \nestablishing a program to advance the cleanup of polluted water from \nabandoned mines.\n  For over one hundred years, miners and prospectors have searched for \nand developed valuable hardrock minerals, such as gold, silver, and \ncopper. Hardrock mining has played a key role in the history of \nColorado and many other States. The resulting mineral wealth has been \nan important aspect of our economy and the development of essential \nproducts that we all take for granted.\n  However, as all westerners know, this history has too often been \nmarked by a series of ``boom'' times followed by ``busts,'' when mines \nwere no longer profitable. When these busts came, too often the miners \nwould abandon their work and move on, seeking riches over the next \nmountain. The resulting legacy of unsafe open mine shafts and acid mine \ndrainages can be seen throughout the country and especially on the \nWestern public lands where mineral development was encouraged to help \nsettle our region.\n  The problems caused by abandoned and inactive mines are very real and \nvery large. They include acidic water draining from old tunnels; heavy \nmetals leaching into streams, killing fish and tainting water supplies; \nopen vertical mine shafts; dangerous highwalls; large open pits; waste \nrock piles that are unsightly and dangerous; and hazardous dilapidated \nstructures.\n  Unfortunately, many of our current environmental laws, designed to \nmitigate the impact from operating hard rock mines, are of limited \neffectiveness when they are applied to abandoned and inactive mines. As \na result, many of these old mines go on polluting streams and rivers \nand potentially risking the health of people who live nearby or \ndownstream.\n  Right now, there are two serious obstacles to progress. One is a \nserious lack of funds for cleaning up sites for which no private person \nor entity can be held liable. The other obstacle is legal.\n  While the Clean Water Act is one of the most effective and important \nof our environmental laws, as applied to abandoned hard rock mines, it \ncan mean that someone undertaking to clean up an abandoned or inactive \nmine will be exposed to the same liability that would apply to a party \nresponsible for creating the site's problems in the first place. As a \nresult, would-be Good Samaritans understandably have been unwilling to \nvolunteer their services to clean up abandoned and inactive mines.\n  The Governors of our Western States have recognized the need for \naction to address this serious problem. They have adopted bipartisan \nresolutions on this subject, such as the position adopted in the 2007 \nresolution entitled ``Cleaning Up Abandoned Mines.'' In this \nresolution, the Governors urged Congress to take action to address \nliability issues and funding concerns. The Governors sent a letter in \nNovember 2007 expressing support for the previous version of the bill I \nam introducing today.\n  The bill I am filing today will help address this impediment and make \nit easier for volunteers, who had no role in creating the problem, to \nhelp clean up these sites and improve the environment. It does so by \nproviding a new permit program whereby volunteers can, under an \napproved plan, reduce the water pollution flowing from an abandoned \nmine. At the same time, volunteers will not be exposed to the full \nliability and ongoing responsibility provisions of the Clean Water Act.\n  Unlike other bills that have been introduced on this topic, my bill \nonly addresses Clean Water Act liability and does not waive any other \nenvironmental law. This is because I do not believe we have to go that \nfar. There are administrative avenues and options available to Good \nSamaritans to address compliance without other environmental laws that \nmay apply at these sites. However, such administrative options are not \navailable for Clean Water Act liability. So my bill only addresses this \nrestriction on moving forward on projects to clean up water releases.\n  The new permit proposed in my bill would help address problems that \nhave frustrated Federal and State agencies throughout the country. As \npopulation growth continues near these old mines, more and more risks \nto public health and safety are likely to occur. We simply must begin \nto address this issue, not only to improve the environment but also to \nensure that our water supplies are safe and usable.\n  Let me be clear, the bill does not address all the concerns some \nwould-be Good Samaritan may have about initiating cleanup projects. I \nam committed to continue working to address those additional concerns \nthrough additional legislation and in other ways. But the bill I am \nfiling today can make a real difference, and I think it deserves \napproval without unnecessary delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na longer version of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am \n     introducing legislation designed to help promote the cleanup \n     of abandoned and inactive hardrock mines that are a menace to \n     the environment and public health throughout the country, but \n     especially in the West.\n       In the 107, 108, 109, and 110 Congresses, I introduced \n     similar bills aimed at that result. Following the bill's \n     first introduction in the 107 Congress, revisions were made \n     to incorporate a number of changes developed in consultation \n     with interested parties, including representatives of the \n     Western Governors' Association, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, the hardrock mining industry, and environmental \n     groups.\n       The bill I am introducing today is also the product of \n     further consultations. It represents years of effort to reach \n     agreement on establishing a program to advance the cleanup of \n     polluted water from abandoned mines.\n       For over one hundred years, miners and prospectors have \n     searched for and developed valuable ``hardrock'' minerals--\n     gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and others. Hardrock mining \n     has played a key role in the history of Colorado and other \n     states, and the resulting mineral wealth has been an \n     important aspect of our economy and the development of \n     essential products. However, as all westerners know, this \n     history has too often been\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\n     marked by a series of ``boom'' times followed by ``busts'' \n     when mines were no longer profitable. When these busts came, \n     too often the miners would abandon their work and move on, \n     seeking riches over the next mountain. The resulting legacy \n     of unsafe open mine shafts and acid mine drainages can be \n     seen throughout the country and especially on the western \n     public lands where mineral development was encouraged to help \n     settle our region.\n       The problems caused by abandoned and inactive mines are \n     very real and very large--including acidic water draining \n     from old tunnels; heavy metals leaching into streams, killing \n     fish and tainting water supplies; open vertical mine shafts; \n     dangerous highwalls; large open pits; waste rock piles that \n     are unsightly and dangerous; and hazardous dilapidated \n     structures.\n       Unfortunately, many of our current environmental laws, \n     designed to mitigate the impact from operating hardrock \n     mines, are of limited effectiveness when applied to abandoned \n     and inactive mines. As a result, many of these old mines go \n     on polluting streams and rivers and potentially risking the \n     health of people who live nearby or downstream.\n       Right now there are two serious obstacles to progress. One \n     is a serious lack of funds for cleaning up sites for which no \n     private person or entity can be held liable. The other \n     obstacle is legal.\n       While the Clean Water Act is one of the most effective and \n     important of our environmental laws, as applied it can mean \n     that someone undertaking to clean up an abandoned or inactive \n     mine will be exposed to the same liability that would apply \n     to a party responsible for creating the site's problems in \n     the first place. As a result, would-be ``good Samaritans'' \n     understandably have been unwilling to volunteer their \n     services to clean up abandoned and inactive mines.\n       Unless these fiscal and legal obstacles are overcome, often \n     the only route to clean up abandoned mines will be to place \n     them on the nation's Superfund list. Colorado has experience \n     with that approach, so Coloradans know that while it can be \n     effective, it also has shortcomings. For one thing, just \n     being placed on the Superfund list does not guarantee prompt \n     cleanup. The site will have to get in line behind other \n     listed sites and await the availability of financial \n     resources.\n       We need to develop an alternative approach that will mean \n     we are not left only with the options of doing nothing or \n     creating additional Superfund sites--because while in some \n     cases the Superfund approach may make the most sense, in many \n     others there could be a more direct and effective way to \n     remedy the problem.\n       The Governors of our western States have recognized the \n     need for action to address this serious problem. The Western \n     Governors' Association has several times adopted resolutions \n     on this subject, such as its most recent resolution in 2007 \n     entitled Cleaning Up Abandoned Mines, wherein the governors \n     urge Congress to take action to address liability issues and \n     funding concerns. WGA also sent a letter in November 2007 \n     expressing support for the previous version on the bill I am \n     introducing today.\n       The bill I am filing today responds to a legal obstacle, \n     the potential liability under the Clean Water Act that now \n     deters many would-be ``good Samaritans'' from undertaking \n     efforts to clean up abandoned hardrock mines. Unlike other \n     bills that have been introduced on this topic, my bill only \n     addresses Clean Water Act liability and does not waive any \n     other environmental law. That's because I do not believe that \n     we need to go that far. There are administrative avenues and \n     options available to good Samaritans to address compliance \n     with other environmental laws that may apply at these sites. \n     However, such administrative options are not available for \n     Clean Water Act liability, and so my bill only addresses this \n     restriction on moving forward on projects to clean up water \n     releases.\n       To help the efforts of ``good Samaritans,'' this bill would \n     create a new program under the Clean Water Act under which \n     qualifying individuals and entities could obtain permits to \n     conduct cleanups of abandoned or inactive hardrock mines. \n     These permits would give some liability protection to those \n     volunteering to clean up these sites, while also requiring \n     the permit holders to meet certain requirements.\n       The bill specifies who can secure these permits, what would \n     be required by way of a cleanup plan, and the extent of \n     liability exposure. Notably, unlike regular Clean Water Act \n     point-source permits, these new permits would not require \n     meeting specific standards for specific pollutants and would \n     not impose liabilities for monitoring or long-term \n     maintenance and operations. These permits would terminate \n     upon completion of cleanup, if a regular Clean Water Act \n     permit is issued for the same site, or if a permit holder \n     encounters unforeseen conditions beyond the holder's control. \n     I think this would encourage efforts to fix problems like \n     those at the Pennsylvania Mine.\n       The new permits proposed in this bill would help address \n     problems that have frustrated federal and state agencies \n     throughout the country. As population growth continues near \n     these old mines, more and more risks to public health and \n     safety are likely to occur. We simply must begin to address \n     this issue--not only to improve the environment, but also to \n     ensure that our water supplies are safe and usable. This bill \n     does not address all the concerns some would-be Good \n     Samaritans may have about initiating cleanup projects--and I \n     am committed to continue working to address those additional \n     concerns, through additional legislation and in other ways. \n     But this bill can make a real difference, and I think it \n     deserves approval without unnecessary delay.\n       For the benefit of our colleagues, I am including a brief \n     outline of the bill's provisions.\n       Eligibility for Good Samaritan Permits--Permits could be \n     issued to a person or entity not involved in creation of \n     residue or other conditions resulting from mining at a site \n     within the bill's scope. Any other similar person or entity \n     could be a cooperating party to help with a cleanup.\n       Sites Covered by the Bill--The bill covers sites of mines \n     and associated facilities in the United States once used for \n     production of a mineral, other than coal, but no longer \n     actively mined, but does not cover sites on the national \n     priority list under Superfund.\n       Administration--The permits would be issued by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or by a state or tribal \n     government with an approved Clean Water Act permitting \n     program.\n       Remediation Plans--To obtain a permit, an applicant would \n     have to submit a detailed plan for remediation of the site. \n     After an opportunity for public comments, the EPA or other \n     permitting authority could issue a permit if it determined \n     that implementing the plan would not worsen water quality and \n     could result in improving it toward meeting applicable water \n     quality standards.\n       Effect of Permit--Compliance with a Good Samaritan permit \n     would constitute compliance with the Clean Water Act, and \n     neither a permit holder nor a cooperating party would be \n     responsible for doing any remediation activities except those \n     specified in the remediation plan. When the cleanup is done, \n     the permit expires, ending the Good Samaritan's \n     responsibility for the project.\n       Report and Sunset Clause--9 years after enactment, EPA must \n     report to Congress about the way the bill has been \n     implemented, so Congress can consider whether to renew or \n     modify the legislation, which under the bill will terminate \n     after 10 years.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Good Samaritan Cleanup of \n     Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government and State governments have \n     encouraged hardrock mining in the United States through a \n     wide variety of laws, policies, and actions;\n       (2) mining operations produce metals and minerals that have \n     important social benefits and values;\n       (3) many areas in the United States at which historic \n     mining operations took place are now the locations of \n     inactive and abandoned mine sites;\n       (4) the mining activities that took place prior to the \n     enactment of modern environmental laws often disturbed public \n     and private land, and those disturbances led to environmental \n     pollution, including the discharge of pollutants into surface \n     water and groundwater;\n       (5) many of the individuals and corporate owners and \n     operators of mines the actions of which caused the pollution \n     described in paragraph (4) are no longer alive or in \n     existence;\n       (6) many of the historic mining sites have polluted the \n     environment for more than a century and, unless remedied, \n     will continue to do so indefinitely;\n       (7) unabated discharges from inactive and abandoned mines \n     will continue to pollute surface water, groundwater, and \n     soils;\n       (8) many of the streams and water bodies impacted by acid \n     mine drainage are important resources for fish and wildlife, \n     recreation, drinking water, agriculture, and other public \n     purposes;\n       (9) some of the remaining owners and operators of historic \n     mine sites do not have adequate resources to properly conduct \n     the remediation of the mine sites under applicable \n     environmental laws;\n       (10) from time to time, States, individuals, and companies \n     are willing to remediate historic mine sites for the public \n     good as Good Samaritans, despite the fact that those States, \n     individuals, and companies are not legally required to do so;\n       (11) Good Samaritan remediation activities may--\n       (A) vary in size and complexity;\n       (B) reflect a myriad of methods by which mine residue may \n     be cleaned up; and\n       (C) include, among other activities--\n       (i) the removal, relocation, or management of tailings or \n     other waste piles;\n       (ii) passive or active water treatment; and\n       (iii) runoff or runon controls;\n       (12) the potential obligations, requirements, and \n     liabilities under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) that may attach to Good Samaritans as \n     the result of the conduct by the Good Samaritans of \n     remediation activities can dissuade potential Good Samaritans \n     from acting for the public good;\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n       (13) it is in the interest of the United States, the \n     States, and local communities to remediate historic mine \n     sites--\n       (A) in appropriate circumstances and to the maximum extent \n     practicable; and\n       (B) so that the detrimental environmental impacts of the \n     historic mine sites are lessened in the future; and\n       (14) if appropriate protections are provided to Good \n     Samaritans, Good Samaritans will have a greater incentive to \n     remediate historic mine sites for the public good.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to encourage the partial or complete remediation of \n     inactive and abandoned mine sites for the public good by \n     individuals or entities that are not legally responsible for \n     the remediation;\n       (2) to allow any individual or entity not legally \n     responsible for environmental conditions relating to an \n     inactive or abandoned mine site--\n       (A) to make further progress toward the goal of meeting \n     water quality standards in all water of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) to improve other environmental media affected by past \n     mining activities at the inactive or abandoned mine site \n     without incurring any obligation or liability with respect to \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.);\n       (3) to ensure that remediation activities performed by Good \n     Samaritans--\n       (A) result in actual and significant environmental \n     benefits; and\n       (B) are carried out--\n       (i) with the approval and agreement, and at the discretion, \n     of affected Federal, State, and tribal authorities;\n       (ii) in a manner that enables the public to conduct a \n     review of, and submit comments relating to, the remediation \n     activities; and\n       (iii) in a manner that is beneficial to the environment and \n     each community affected by the remediation activities; and\n       (4) to further the innovations of, and cooperation among, \n     the Federal Government, State and tribal governments, private \n     individuals, and corporations to accelerate efforts relating \n     to conservation and environmental restoration.\n\n     SEC. 3. SCOPE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)--\n       (1) reduces any existing liability; or\n       (2) facilitates the conduct of any mining or processing \n     other than the conduct of any mining or processing that is \n     required for the remediation of historic mine residue for the \n     public good.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOOD SAMARITAN DISCHARGE PERMITS.\n\n       Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1342) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(s) Good Samaritan Discharge Permits.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       ``(A) Cooperating person.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `cooperating person' means any \n     person that--\n\n       ``(I) is a Good Samaritan;\n       ``(II) assists a permittee in the remediation of an \n     inactive or abandoned mine site;

Res. 312\n\n       Whereas foreign development assistance is an important \n     foreign policy tool in addition to diplomacy and the \n     military;\n       Whereas the United States is currently involved in two \n     wars, both of which military and civilian experts agree can \n     only be solved with sound development strategies to \n     complement military efforts;\n       Whereas development assistance is part of any comprehensive \n     United States response to regional conflicts, terrorist \n     threats, weapons proliferation, disease pandemics, and \n     persistent widespread poverty;\n       Whereas, in 2002 and 2006, the United States National \n     Security Strategy included global development, along with the \n     military and diplomacy, as the three pillars of national \n     security;\n       Whereas, in its early years, the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) had more than 5,000 full-\n     time Foreign Service Officers and 15,000 total staff;\n       Whereas, in 2008, USAID had slightly more than 1,000 full-\n     time Foreign Service Officers and 3,000 total staff;\n       Whereas the loss in permanent staff and institutional \n     expertise at USAID has compelled it to rely disproportionally \n     on outside contractors to help manage programs in more than \n     150 countries;\n       Whereas the USAID managed program budget, calculated in \n     real dollars, has dropped more than 40 percent since 1985;\n       Whereas, from the early 1960s until 1992, the Office of \n     Management and Budget enforced a rule mandating that all \n     foreign aid programs and spending must go through USAID, \n     except when USAID chose to contract with other Federal \n     agencies;\n       Whereas today more than half of all aid programs are \n     administered by Federal agencies other than USAID, and \n     development funding is spread across more than 20 United \n     States Government agencies; and\n       Whereas this decline in personnel, budgets, and \n     coordinating leadership has diminished the capacity of USAID \n     and the United States Government to provide development \n     assistance and implement foreign assistance programs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) a highly capable and knowledgeable individual should be \n     nominated with all expediency and exigency to serve as the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development;\n       (2) the Administrator should--\n       (A) serve as the chief advocate for United States \n     development capacity and strategy in top-level national \n     security deliberations;\n       (B) serve as a powerful advocate and effective leader of an \n     empowered USAID; and\n       (C) marshal the resources, knowledge, capacity, and \n     experiences of the Agency--\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\n       (i) to effectively represent the Agency in interagency \n     debate and in advancing and executing foreign policy; and\n       (ii) to improve ultimately the effectiveness and capability \n     of United States foreign assistance;\n       (3) the United States Agency for International Development \n     must be empowered to be the primary development agency of the \n     United States and to serve as the principal advisor to the \n     President and national security organs of the United States \n     Government on the capacity and strategy of United States \n     development assistance;\n       (4) the Administrator should substantially and \n     transparently increase the total number of full-time Foreign \n     Service Officers employed by the Agency in order to enhance \n     the ability of the Agency to--\n       (A) carry out development activities around the world by \n     providing the Agency with additional human resources and \n     expertise needed to meet important development and \n     humanitarian needs around the world;\n       (B) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Agency as \n     the lead development agency of the United States; and\n       (C) more effectively help developing nations to become more \n     stable, healthy, democratic, prosperous, and self-sufficient; \n     and\n       (5) the Administrator should submit a strategy to Congress \n     that includes--\n       (A) a plan to create a professional training program that \n     will provide new and current Agency employees with technical, \n     management, leadership, and language skills;\n       (B) a 5-year staffing plan; and\n       (C) a description of further resources and statutory \n     changes necessary to implement the proposed training and \n     staffing plans.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Durbin and Senator, Cardin, aimed at putting \nthe Senate on the record in support of empowering and strengthening the \nU.S. Agency for International Development. This is a simple and \nstraightforward resolution, but I believe it speaks volumes about the \ncurrent situation of U.S. overseas development policy.\n  USAID has been without an administrator for nearly 10 months. It is \ncritical that this position is swiftly filled by an individual who can \nserve as a strong advocate for the agency in national security and \nforeign policy deliberations within the U.S. Government. The \nAdministrator must also work urgently to strengthen, empower and \nrevitalize the agency itself. This essential position must be filled if \nthe U.S. is to take on the myriad of foreign policy challenges that \nexist in a holistic and sustainable manner--because for nearly all of \nthe challenges we face as a Nation, development will play a key role in \nhelping us solve them.\n  This resolution also recognizes the tremendously important role \ndevelopment plays in foreign policy, and puts the Senate on record as \nsupporting an empowered USAID. I believe USAID should be a strong and \nindependent voice in high-level U.S. foreign policy debates. If U.S. \ndevelopment policy and, by extension, U.S. foreign policy, is to \nsucceed in the long run, USAID must be an independent body that can \nadvocate for what it knows best--how to effectively deliver and \nimplement U.S. foreign assistance, at the highest level. It must have a \nserious seat at the table. Our foreign policy will neither be \ncomprehensive nor sufficient to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury, without serious and unbiased input from America's development \nexperts.\n  Finally, this resolution recognizes that USAID must be empowered to \nfulfill its mandate with a robust staff that understands both the needs \nof the international community as well as the strategic value of \ndevelopment.\n  It has long been understood that international development is a \ncritically important aspect of our foreign policy. It is high time we \nmatched this reality with a real and meaningful commitment. I encourage \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution to \nempower and improve USAID.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 313--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF RED RIBBON \n                               WEEK, 2009\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Bennett) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 313\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, an 11-\n     year special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who \n     was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while engaged in the \n     battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been sponsored by the \n     National Family Partnership and nationally recognized since \n     1988 to preserve Special Agent Camarena's memory and further \n     the cause for which he gave his life, and is now the oldest \n     and largest drug prevention program in the Nation, reaching \n     millions of young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, committed \n     throughout its 36 years to aggressively targeting \n     organizations involved in the growing, manufacturing, and \n     distribution of controlled substances, has been a steadfast \n     partner in commemorating Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and Attorneys General of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, and more than 100 other organizations \n     throughout the United States annually celebrate Red Ribbon \n     Week during the period of October 23 through October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     Nation faces in securing a safe and healthy future for \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas although public awareness of illicit drug use is \n     increasing, emerging drug threats and growing epidemics \n     demand attention, including the abuse of methamphetamines, \n     inhalants, and prescription medications, the second most \n     abused drug by young people in the United States;\n       Whereas between 1996 and 2006, the percentages of \n     admissions to substance abuse treatment programs as a result \n     of the abuse of methamphetamines, prescription medications, \n     and marijuana each significantly rose;\n       Whereas drug dealers specifically target children by \n     marketing illicit drugs that mimic the appearance and names \n     of well known brand-name candies and foods; and\n       Whereas parents, youths, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during this week-long celebration: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2009;\n       (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-\n     free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to promote \n     the creation of drug-free communities and to participate in \n     drug prevention activities to show support for healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10373-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10373-S10374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2676.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate and House \nVeterans' Affairs Committees have worked out an agreement on S. 423 and \nH.R. 1016, the proposed Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and \nTransparency Act of 2009. With the President's signature, this vital \npiece of legislation, which I will refer to as the ``Compromise \nAgreement,'' will authorize, beginning in fiscal year 2011, advance \nappropriations for certain medical care accounts of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs by providing 2 fiscal year budget authority.\n  This compromise agreement will provide sufficient, timely, and \npredictable health care funding to those who have sacrificed a great \ndeal for this Nation. By ensuring advanced appropriations to the \nmedical services, medical support and compliance, and medical \nfacilities accounts, VA will be able to better align its funding cycles \nand function more effectively.\n  The VA system has experienced recurrent problems with receiving \nproper\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\nand timely appropriations. Funds for VA have been appropriated late in \n19 of the past 22 years, and in the past 7 years, such appropriations \nwere only received, on average, 3 months after the commencement of the \nnew fiscal year. In testimony provided to the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs in conjunction with a hearing in July of 2007, James \nDudley, a former director of the Richmond VA Medical Center, wrote that \nas a VA hospital administrator he dealt with the ``uncertainty of \nsufficient resources to meet the needs of the veteran population.'' He \nwent on to say that, ``Our primary concern was always quality of care \nso we delayed maintenance, construction or equipment purchases to \nensure that the patients were cared for.''\n  Also, because of the uncertainty, requests for supplemental \nappropriations for VA health care have also increased in frequency \nduring recent years. This compromise agreement will represent a step in \nthe right direction, as VA administrators and directors will be able to \nmore efficiently service veterans with adequate and stable funding to \nthe VA health care system.\n  I recognize mandating a 2-fiscal year budget authority is a serious \nundertaking, and as such, have worked to have the compromise agreement \nlead to enhanced oversight of the VA health care budget process. The \nComptroller General of the United States will be required to conduct a \nstudy of adequacy and accuracy of the budget projections made by VA's \nenrollee health care projection model or any other model or methodology \nused to measure health care expenditures, for each fiscal year of the \nbudget request. The Comptroller General's report would be submitted to \nboth the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees no later than \n120 days after the date on which the President submits the budget \nrequest for the coming fiscal year.\n  Advanced funding is a concept that has been endorsed by The \nPartnership for Veterans Health Care Budget Reform, an organization \nmade up of nine major veterans service organizations--The American \nLegion, American Veterans, Blinded Veterans Association, Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, Military Order of \nthe Purple Heart of the USA, Inc., Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Inc. It is also endorsed by The Independent Budget; The \nMilitary Coalition, an organization of 35 veterans and military service \norganizations; and the American Federation for Government Employees.\n  I appreciate the support from our colleagues who have cosponsored \nthis legislation, including Veterans' Affairs Committee members \nSenators Burr, Rockefeller, Murray, Sanders, Brown, Tester, Begich, \nBurris, Specter, and Isakson. I am also grateful to Senator Snowe for \nserving as an original cosponsor.\n  This legislation will allow the government to honor its obligation to \nprovide high quality, consistent, and adequate health care to the \nNation's veterans and I am gratified will soon become public law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Explanatory Statement for this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY SENATOR AKAKA, CHAIRMAN OF THE \n       SENATE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS, REGARDING H.R. 1016\n\n    Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009\n\n       H.R. 1016, as amended, the ``Veterans Health Care Budget \n     Reform and Transparency Act of 2009,'' reflects a Compromise \n     Agreement reached by the Senate and House Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs (the Committees) on the following bills \n     reported during the 111th Congress: H.R. 1016, as amended \n     (House bill); S. 423 (Senate bill). H.R. 1016, as amended, \n     passed by the House of Representatives on June 23, 2009. The \n     text of S. 423 passed the Senate as a substitute amendment to \n     the House bill on August 6, 2009.\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     H.R. 1016, as further amended to reflect a compromise \n     agreement between the Committees (Compromise Agreement). \n     Differences between the provisions contained in the \n     Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of the Senate \n     Bill and the House Bill are noted in this document, except \n     for clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary \n     by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, \n     and clarifying changes.\n\n\n                         SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       Both the House bill (section 1) and the Senate bill \n     (section 1) would provide the short title as the ``Veterans \n     Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009.''\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision.\n\n\n                SECTION 2. PRESIDENT'S BUDGET SUBMISSION\n\n       The House bill (section 3) would amend section 1105 of \n     title 31, United States Code, to require the President to \n     submit information on the estimates of appropriations for the \n     fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the budget is \n     submitted for the Medical Services, Medical Support and \n     Compliance, Medical Facilities, Information Technology \n     Systems, and Medical and Prosthetic Research accounts of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       The Senate bill contains no similar provision.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision but \n     modifies it to require information on the estimates for three \n     accounts: the Medical Services, Medical Support and \n     Compliance, and Medical Facilities accounts.\n\n\nSECTION 3. ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL CARE ACCOUNTS OF \n                  THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       The House bill (section 4) would amend title 38, United \n     States Code, to add a new section providing authority, \n     beginning with fiscal year 2011, for the provision of advance \n     appropriations for the Medical Services, Medical Support and \n     Compliance, Medical Facilities, Information Technology \n     Systems, and Medical and Prosthetic Research accounts of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs. The new section would require \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide additional \n     detailed budget estimates in support of advance \n     appropriations for these accounts in the annual information \n     it provides to Congress in support of the Department's budget \n     request. The House bill would also require a report to be \n     submitted annually to Congress, no later than July 31 of each \n     year, on the sufficiency of the Department's resources for \n     the fiscal year beginning after the date of the submission of \n     the report for the provision of medical care and include \n     estimates of the workload and demand data for that fiscal \n     year.\n       The Senate bill (section 3) would amend title 38, United \n     States Code, to add a new section providing that, beginning \n     with fiscal year 2011, new discretionary budget authority for \n     the provision of advance appropriations for the Medical \n     Services, Medical Support and Compliance, and Medical \n     Facilities accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     shall be made available for the fiscal year involved, and \n     shall include new discretionary budget authority for such \n     accounts that become available for the first fiscal year \n     after such fiscal year.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains the House provision \n     modified to include only the three accounts specified in the \n     Senate bill.\n\n\n  SECTION 4. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW OF THE ACCURACY OF VA MEDICAL \n   CARE BUDGET SUBMISSIONS IN RELATION TO BASELINE HEALTH CARE MODEL \n                              PROJECTION.\n\n       Both the House bill (section 5) and the Senate bill \n     (section 4) would provide for enhanced oversight of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs budget process by requiring \n     the Comptroller General to conduct a study of the adequacy \n     and accuracy of baseline model projections for health care \n     expenditures. Both the House bill and Senate bill would \n     require the Comptroller General to submit reports on the \n     dates in 2011, 2012, and 2013 that the President submits a \n     budget request for the next fiscal year, to appropriate \n     Committees of Congress and to the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, containing statements of whether the amounts \n     requested in the budget by the President are consistent with \n     anticipated expenditures for health care in such fiscal year \n     as determined utilizing the Enrollee Health Care Projection \n     Model, its equivalent, or other methodologies.\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision modified \n     to require the annual reports to be submitted not later than \n     120-days after the submission of the President's budget and \n     to include an assessment of the review conducted by the \n     Comptroller General as to whether or not the relevant \n     components of the budget request are consistent with the \n     estimates of the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of medical care and services. The Committees have \n     selected a 120-day deadline to give the Comptroller General \n     sufficient time to review the President's budget following \n     its submission and to, at the very least, inform the \n     deliberations of the House and Senate Appropriations \n     Committees prior to their consideration of VA appropriations \n     bills. However, it is the Committees' desire that, \n     notwithstanding the 120-day deadline, the reports under this \n     section be submitted as quickly as possible after submission \n     of the President's budget request so as to be useful by the \n     Committees in meeting their responsibilities under the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to provide views and \n     estimates on matters within their jurisdiction to the House \n     and Senate Budget Committees, as well as during deliberation \n     on annual Congressional budget resolutions.\n\n\n                         PROVISIONS NOT ADOPTED\n\n       Section 2 of the House bill would express the Sense of the \n     Congress that the provision of health care services to \n     veterans could be more effectively and efficiently planned \n     and\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n     managed if funding was provided for the management and \n     provision of such services in the form of advance \n     appropriations.\n       Section 2 of the Senate amendment expresses Congressional \n     findings which support the need for enactment of advance \n     appropriations for VA medical care.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MUHAMMAD YUNUS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 846 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 846) to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \n     Dr. Muhammad Yunus in recognition of his contributions to the \n     fight against global poverty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Professor Muhammad Yunus is one of the \nworld's leading figures in the fight against poverty. He has dedicated \nhis life to economic and social change, and in doing so has transformed \nthe lives of millions of people around the world.\n  He is affectionately called the ``banker to the poor,'' largely \nbecause he is\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\nthe father of the microcredit movement, as we know it today. \nMicrocredit means small loans at competitive interest rates to very \npoor people. The loaned money can be used to buy basic tools and \nequipment or supplies that can be used to make an income or livelihood \nor generate revenue.\n  It was 1976 when Dr. Yunus began his innovative effort with loans of \njust $27 from his own pocket to 42 craftspeople in a small village in \nhis native Bangladesh. From that small start, he launched what has \nbecome a global movement to create economic and social development from \nthe ground up.\n  In 1983, Dr. Yunus founded the Grameen Bank to carry out his model on \na much larger scale. With thousands of very small loans, the bank has \ngiven millions of people living in extreme poverty a chance to start a \nsmall business or buy a few things to sell at the local market. Today, \nthe Grameen Bank operates in more than 84,000 villages around the \nworld. It has provided more than $8 billion in low-interest loans to \nnearly 8 million people. And its borrowers, who are among the poorest \nof the poor and are not required to provide any collateral, repay their \nloans at the remarkable rate of 98 percent.\n  Over the past 30 years, Dr. Yunus's microcredit concept has been \nemulated in more than 100 countries over 5 continents affecting the \nlives of as many as 155 million people. This simple economics professor \nfrom Bangladesh came up with an idea that has touched positively the \nlives of over 155 million people on Earth.\n  Dr. Yunus's work has been particularly dramatic when it comes to its \nimpact on women, who represent 95 percent of his bank's borrowers. \nEconomic, legal, and social inequities in the developing world make it \nmuch harder for women to earn an adequate living and support their \nfamilies. Women make up 60 percent of the world's working poor, 70 \npercent of the hungry, and 67 percent of the illiterate.\n  When I visited Uganda many years ago and visited a microcredit \noperation, I asked the ladies who were there, through an interpreter, \nhow microcredit had changed their lives. One lady said: My knees have \ngone soft. I asked for a translation--an explanation--and she explained \nthat before she got the microcredit loan that gave her a chance to go \nto the market to make a little money to feed her family, she used to \nhave to crawl on her knees to beg her husband for money to feed her \nchildren. She said she doesn't have to crawl on her knees anymore. Her \nknees have gone soft.\n  By focusing its lending on women, Dr. Yunus and the Grameen Bank \nempower women both within their families and within their communities. \nThe effect is remarkable: Babies are more likely to survive infancy and \nthrive; their children--especially daughters--are more likely to attend \nschool; families are more likely to eat; and marriages postponed when \nan educated girl has a chance to look at life from a new perspective.\n  In 2006, Dr. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his ground-\nbreaking work. This award recognized that lasting peace and prosperity \ncan be achieved only when large numbers of the world's poor have the \nmeans to break out of poverty. In August, President Obama recognized \nhim with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Bennett of Utah and I offered the Dr. \nMuhammad Yunus Gold Medal Act, S. 846, to honor his efforts. I thank \nSenator Bennett for his leadership on this bill and our 70 colleagues \nwho have cosponsored it.\n  Saturday, October 17, is International Day for the Eradication of \nPoverty. Few people have done as much as Dr. Muhammad Yunus to \neradicate poverty among the more than 1 billion people worldwide who \nsurvive on about a dollar a day. We honor his commitment and recognize \nhis work and his remarkable achievements as an individual.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate; and any statements related to the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 846) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Dr. Muhammad Yunus is recognized in the United States \n     and throughout the world as a leading figure in the fight \n     against poverty and the effort to promote economic and social \n     change;\n       (2) Muhammad Yunus is the recognized developer of the \n     concept of microcredit, and Grameen Bank, which he founded, \n     has created a model of lending that has been emulated across \n     the globe;\n       (3) Muhammad Yunus launched this global movement to create \n     economic and social development from below, beginning in \n     1976, with a loan of $27 from his own pocket to 42 crafts \n     persons in a small village in Bangladesh;\n       (4) Muhammad Yunus has demonstrated the life-changing \n     potential of extending very small loans (at competitive \n     interest rates) to the very poor and the economic feasibility \n     of microcredit and other microfinance and microenterprise \n     practices and services;\n       (5) Dr. Yunus's work has had a particularly strong impact \n     on improving the economic prospects of women, and on their \n     families, as over 95 percent of microcredit borrowers are \n     women;\n       (6) Dr. Yunus has pioneered a movement with the potential \n     to assist a significant number of the more than 1,400,000,000 \n     people, mostly women and children, who live on less than \n     $1.25 a day, and the 2,600,000,000 people who live on less \n     than $2 a day, and which has already reached 155,000,000, by \n     one estimate;\n       (7) there are now an estimated 24,000,000 microenterprises \n     in the United States accounting for approximately 18 percent \n     of private (nonfarm) employment and 87 percent of all \n     business in the United States, and the Small Business \n     Administration has made over $318,000,000 in microloans to \n     entrepreneurs since 1992;\n       (8) Dr. Yunus, along with the Grameen Bank, was awarded the \n     Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to promote economic \n     and social opportunity and out of recognition that lasting \n     peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find \n     the means, such as microcredit, to break out of poverty; and\n       (9) the microcredit ideas developed and put into practice \n     by Muhammad Yunus, along with other bold initiatives, can \n     make a historical breakthrough in the fight against poverty.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design \n     to Dr. Muhammad Yunus, in recognition of his many enduring \n     contributions to the fight against global poverty.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There are authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund, such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs \n     of the medals struck pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/13/senate-section/article/S10381-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10381-S10382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL METASTATIC BREAST CANCER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
