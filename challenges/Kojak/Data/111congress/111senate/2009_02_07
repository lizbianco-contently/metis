Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1) making supplemental appropriations for job \n     preservation and creation, infrastructure investment, energy \n     efficiency and science, assistance to the unemployed, and \n     State and local fiscal stabilization, for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 3 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders \nor their designees.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is a chance for us to engage in \nconstructive discussion. It is still a very interesting proposition. I \nthink it is going to pass, and it will be, in spite of what was said \nlast night, bipartisan. In fact, it could not possibly pass without \nthat being the fact.\n  There are a number of things in here which are called cuts, but I \nthink it is very important we remember that these are, for the most \npart, not cuts from the present situation but cuts from the original \nstimulus package, which was cut by over $100 billion, and\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\ntherefore they appear to be cuts, but they are not cuts. They are \nactually, for the most part, additions--substantial additions--to what \nwe already have. So if the bill had not passed, a lot of these programs \nwould cease to exist.\n  So I think it is a positive document. It is not without flaws. We \nhave a conference committee coming and that will be very important. I \nlook forward to the engagement today and to the conference committee \nand to the passage of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me ask my friend from Arizona what his \nintentions are at this point because it seems to me it might be \nadvantageous to perhaps have those who oppose this bill state their \ncase in the beginning, and maybe we can even have some discussion back \nand forth, in the best traditions of the Senate, about that. Then, we \ncan, on this side, come back and perhaps offer a few alternatives and \nthen go back and forth. I would ask the Senator from Arizona, does that \nmake sense?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts, I certainly think that would be a good way to engage in \nthis debate. There are at least four speakers on our side who would \nlike to engage in this discussion today, possibly one other. We could \nstart, if it would be acceptable to you, and then the Democratic side \nrespond and simply go back and forth in that way, with the time being \ndivided equally.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think that would be great. Perhaps what \nwe could agree upon, so we don't have an imbalance, and we are not \ntalking beyond each other, is perhaps have some kind of reasonable \nlimitation on the back and forth so we do get to have a legitimate kind \nof debate.\n  I will yield the floor and wait for my colleague from Arizona and \nthen perhaps come back.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it would be my intention not to take more \nthan about 20 minutes. That would certainly then permit the kind of \ndiscussion the Senator is suggesting.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think one of the reasons President Obama \nhas not had an easy time getting Republicans to support his \nstabilization program is because he has misrepresented the Republican \napproach to this problem, and obviously that is of concern to us. In \ndiscussing with the American people his approach to the stimulus of our \neconomy, he has first used some dangerous words, I would say, in \ndescribing the emergency nature of this.\n  A lot of people have said he is trying to scare the American people. \nI don't think that is true. I think what he is trying to do is \ndemonstrate the seriousness of the situation. But I also believe it is \nnot an excuse for acting in an inappropriate way, to say we have to do \nsomething right now, and if we don't, there is going to be catastrophe \nin the land; therefore, suggesting we need to be less careful about \nwhat we do. We believe the President's initial conversations are \nappropriate and that we need to be careful about how we approach this \nproblem, among other things, because of what could occur over the long \nterm.\n  He has also mistakenly represented the point of view of Republicans \nin two specific ways: First of all, suggesting the only reason \nRepublicans oppose this program is because we just believe in tax \nrelief. Of course, we believe in tax relief, but we do not believe that \nis the only solution to this problem. In fact, we understand there has \nto be a component that helps people in need, such as the extension of \nunemployment benefits. We understand that certain kinds of spending can \nbe very effective at a time such as this.\n  Senator McCain specifically noted some military spending. Because of \nthe way the military operates, they can get the money out the door \nquickly, and that can be very beneficial. We also focused, first, on \nhousing because that is where this problem began, and that is why our \neffort to fix housing first was presented on the Senate floor. Our \nDemocratic colleagues rejected that notion. Of course, we also \ndemonstrated why some tax relief can also be beneficial. But we have \nnever said that only tax relief will work.\n  Our Democratic colleagues like to point out a very high percentage of \ntheir bill is tax relief, apparently agreeing with us that tax relief \nis important. But the two biggest pieces of tax relief in the \nDemocratic bill are, first of all, the rebate program, such as the \nrebate program last year. Last year, it was $600; this year, it is $500 \nfor 2 years. It was not effective last year, and there is nothing to go \nsuggest it is going to be any more effective this year to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  The other part that is discussed is the alternative minimum tax \nrelief--so-called AMT. Now, we have been relieving Americans from \nhaving to pay the AMT for a decade and not as part of a stimulus bill \nbut because it is the right thing to do. No one ever intended that \nAmericans below the millionaire status would ever be paying the \nalternative minimum tax. So we have been fixing that each year so \nAmericans would not have to worry about it. It doesn't do to count that \nas part of the tax relief and suggest it is because of a stimulus \nintention.\n  The other thing the President has spoken of that bothers Republicans \nis talking about the ``tired ideologies'' that got us into this problem \nin the first place. Now, if you are going to try to get some bipartisan \nsupport from Republicans, I submit that is not the way to do it. I \nwould like to know exactly what tired ideologies the President is \ntalking about. What exactly?\n  Now, in his inaugural speech, I think the President hit a couple of \nhome runs. He talked about ``reaffirming the greatness of our Nation.'' \nHe said:\n\n       It has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of \n     things . . . who have carried us up the long, rugged path \n     toward prosperity and freedom.\n\n  He talked about requiring a new ``era of responsibility,'' and \nemphasized the values of honesty and hard work.\n  Now, those are values that are very important to Republicans. We \nbelieve that, for example, we should have a Tax Code and Government \nregulatory policy that at least does not punish those who are risk-\ntakers and doers, who have exercised responsibility and who have helped \nto make this Nation what it is, including many of the people who work \nhard and who run the businesses that create the bulk of the jobs in \nthis country. So what exactly is it the President is talking about when \nhe talks about the tired ideologies of the past and responsibility?\n  There is much talk in this bill of all the aid to the States. Now, \nthe States have doubled their spending in the last 5 years, and most \nacknowledge they need to get their fiscal houses in order, but many of \nthem are simply looking forward to being bailed out by this bill. So I \nask: Is that the kind of responsibility we want to foster or should we \nexpect more of the States so they can do their part in dealing with \nthis crisis?\n  Does the President believe the tax cuts of 2003 created the \nrecession? Obviously, no one believes that. Not only were they not \nresponsible for the recession we are in, but they are accredited with \nthe job growth and economic stimulus this country received during the \nmiddle part of this last decade.\n  Does the President believe President Bush's efforts to control Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac's risky investments and toxic loans caused the \npickle we are in right now? Obviously not. Indeed, all the evidence is, \nit was the President's cohorts in the Congress who stopped the efforts \nto control Fannie and Freddie and, as a result, this great housing \nbubble was created and burst, to the detriment of everybody in the \ncountry.\n  Would the President suggest the Reinvestment Act might have had \nsomething to do with it? There is a failed policy of the past, \nessentially making the banks lend money to people who actually couldn't \nafford it. In the long run, they suffered as much as everyone else \nbecause they couldn't carry the mortgages on the homes they were put \nin. We did not do them a favor, and we didn't do their neighbors a \nfavor, who are now sitting next to a home that is in foreclosure.\n  It seems to me the President is rather casually throwing out some \ncareless language, and if we would be a little more precise and try to \nget together as\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nRepublicans and Democrats to identify the problem and work together on \nit, we would get a lot further.\n  Let me ask this question. If the question were put to the Senate \ntoday: If you knew that a bill in the Senate was going to cause a \nrecession in 10 years, would you support it? Well, that is what the \nCongressional Budget Office--the bipartisan office that supports our \nefforts in the Congress--says about this legislation; that there will \nbe negative economic growth--negative GDP--in a decade as a result of \nthis legislation.\n  According to the CBO report, dated February 4, sent to Judd Gregg, \nthe ranking member of the Committee on the Budget, they say:\n\n       CBO estimates that by 2019 the Senate legislation would \n     reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent.\n\n  Now, that is 10 years from now. That means if this went on for at \nleast two quarters, that is the definition of a recession. They note in \nthe very beginning that the effects of the legislation would diminish \nrapidly after 2010 and that in the long term, GDP will be reduced.\n\n  If you have a bill before you that you are told by the experts is \ngoing to result in a recession, would you maybe want to stop and think \ntwice about what you are doing? There is evidence that this is kind of \na sugar high. We put a lot of spending out now, but once the high is \ngone and you crash, you are going to be in a recession. That, in \neffect, is what is stated here. Just as we do not let our kids have too \nmuch candy, I think we need to be a little careful about legislation \nwhich we are told is going to result in a recession.\n  It is not just the CBO. In December 2008, the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research published a document titled ``What are the Effects of \nFiscal Policy Shocks?'' by Andrew Mountford of the University of London \nand Harald Uhlig. I am quoting:\n\n       The best fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is a \n     deficit-financed tax cut [and] the long-term costs of fiscal \n     expansion through government spending are probably greater \n     than the short-term gains.\n\n  In other words, in effect confirming what the CBO has said.\n  They explain why:\n\n       [That's because] government spending shocks crowd out both \n     residential and non-residential investment--\n\n  By the way, the CBO report I cited does talk about the increase in \nthe national debt crowding out private investment with the same \nnegative effect--\n\n     while the [positive] response of consumption is small and \n     only significantly different from zero on impact.\n\n  But suppose these recent studies were mistaken, I suggest, and the \nspending spree would even work as advertised. We are still left with \nthe number of jobs allegedly to be created at a very significant cost, \nwell over a quarter million dollars per job.\n  The bottom line here is that doing something temporary which is going \nto cost a lot of money and result in long-term economic downturn is not \nthe kind of policies we should be pursuing.\n  One of the concerns Republicans have had is that it is not only the \namount of money that is being spent in this bill--and it is a shocker. \nIt is over $1 trillion. And incidentally, the deal that was reached \nyesterday still has us spending something like $1.17 trillion, so this \nis still a very big spending bill.\n  By the way, the President acknowledged it is a spending bill. He said \nthat is the whole point. One of the problems with that is that you \ncannot fix it by simply shaving a little bit off of some of the \nelements of spending, as this deal apparently does. You have to start \nfundamentally at the bottom.\n  Actually, Larry Summers, who is the chief economic adviser of the \nPresident, had it right when he says this of legislation: ``The \ninvestments,'' he says, ``will be chosen strategically based on what \nyields the highest rate of return for the economy.'' That is the way it \nshould be done, built from the bottom up based only on what actually \ndoes the most good rather than simply throwing a lot of spending at the \nproblem and hoping that some of it sticks or actually trickles down and \nactually helps the American people. This legislation, the so-called \ndeal here, doesn't build it from the bottom up. It takes the base bill \nand just shaves some off different pieces of it.\n  I would note that we do not have text of the legislation yet, so we \nare dealing with a couple of different press releases, which, by the \nway, don't identify who put them out, and they are slightly different \nwith respect to what they say. So when we are discussing this deal, we \nstill do not know what it is. This is Saturday. We are supposed to vote \non this on Monday. Obviously, we are not going to be here tomorrow. Is \nthis a way to legislate over $1 trillion of spending that is going to \nbe a burden on our children and grandchildren? I think not. I think the \nauthors of this legislation owe us a little more consideration in \ngetting the facts to us about what the bill actually does.\n  As I said, the two big tax pieces are the AMT relief--which we have \ndone routinely each year, not as part of a stimulus but because it is \nthe right thing to do--and the rebate part, which we know did not work \nlast time, and there is no reason to believe it is going to work this \ntime. There is only about 2.5 percent of the tax part of the bill which \nactually goes to business tax relief, potentially enabling businesses \nto create jobs--for example, allowing them to write off purchases of \nequipment earlier than they otherwise would, therefore incentivizing \nthem to hire people and thereby, obviously, creating jobs. That is the \ntax part of this.\n  On the spending side, we are told that there are certain reductions \nin certain of the accounts. But, as we look through it, many of the \nthings that were criticized before appear to still be there. If you \ntake what was added on the Senate floor to the deal that was struck, \nyou are at about $827 billion, which is still above the level of the \nHouse bill which was criticized strongly by proponents of the deal last \nevening on the floor. They called the House bill a Christmas tree. Yet \nthis bill in its total amount is above the level of the House bill. \nThere may have been a 4.7-percent reduction from the level of spending \nin the House bill, but it obviously doesn't change it from being a \nChristmas tree. It has not been fundamentally altered from the bottom \nup with an effort to invest in things that actually will stimulate \njobs. It simply shaved off some of the excess spending in the bill.\n  For example, as we understand it, in the building account, the \nFederal building account for Federal buildings, the Senate bill had a \n$6 billion amount. Under this deal that was made, it is $2.5 billion. \nSo some money was shaved off there. The NOAA facilities construction \nwent down from $795 million to $645 million, a $150 million savings. \nThat is great, but the fundamental problem is that this is not going to \ncreate jobs--that remains. Federal auto fleet--they cut that in half, \nthe cars for Government workers, from $600 million to $300 million. The \nDC sewer system remained unchanged. They didn't actually cut, that I \nsee.\n  The bottom line, as my colleague from Maine described on the floor, \nthese are the kinds of things that should go through the regular \nappropriations process where they should compete with other worthy \ncauses, going through the appropriations process and the appropriators \nmake the tough decisions.\n  My colleague, who is a member on the committee, had a couple of \nthings to say in describing the appropriations process. He pointed out \nthat we have the responsibility to be deliberate and consider these \nitems carefully in the context of the President's formal budget \nrequest. Why? Because there are so many worthy things to spend money on \nthat it is our job to make the tough decisions about which ones to put \nat the top of the list and which ones, perhaps, to defer or to reduce. \nThat is the job these people on the Appropriations Committee do, and \nthey do it well. They have to stick with the President's budget.\n\n  What is in this bill is new spending without any kind of tax receipts \nto cover it or offset spending to make up for it. It is emergency \nlegislation, just added to the debt.\n  As the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee wisely pointed \nout, the kinds of projects that are in this bill should go through the \nappropriations process. It is great that they have been reduced \nsomewhat in number, but that does not solve the fundamental problem.\n  Let me close here so we can actually engage in this debate. We still \ndo not know whether a lot of the earmarks are in the legislation. My \nstaff has\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\ntried to look. It appears, because they have not specifically been \ntaken out, that several of the items, some of the items I mentioned--\nthe money for Amtrak, the $1 billion for the census, the new money for \nthe Smithsonian, digital television transmission bailout, the \nauthorization for benefits for Filipino veterans of World War II--all \nof those things and much more are still in here. Obviously, we will be \ninterested to see whether the final version of the bill, when we \nactually get it, corrects these deficiencies, but it doesn't appear \nthat they have.\n  Again, what Republicans are suggesting here is that it is really a \nfour-part process: help those who are in need; target the spending, \nwhich will actually create jobs; fix housing first; and provide \ntargeted tax relief that will actually also help to stimulate the \neconomy. That is the Republican approach. I think we have some better \nideas that could have been incorporated into this legislation if it had \nnot been such a partisan exercise.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, with the permission of the manager, I yield \nmyself the time that I use this morning.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. There is \nan awful lot to try to respond to and to put into appropriate \nperspective. I want to start to try to do that as clearly, and \nhopefully as succinctly, as I can.\n  The Senator has suggested that this has been a ``partisan process.'' \nI have to tell him as a Senator who has now been here--this is my 26th \nyear here, having witnessed in the last 8 years an unprecedented level \nof changes of the rules, breaking of the rules, refusal to hold \nconferences so we get together and do the normal procedures here, \nunwillingness even to have accountability hearings to allow this side \nto hold hearings, call witnesses--I mean, I can run a long list to \ndescribe the desert that has been the last 8 years.\n  I remind my colleagues, and I do not want to spend too much time on \nthis because it is important to go forward, but you cannot go forward \nand have a legitimate discussion of what is real here unless you put \nthings in their appropriate and honest context.\n  The fact is, the Republican President, President Bush, just left \noffice a few weeks ago. For 6 of the 8 years he was in office, the \nRepublicans ran the Senate. I think we were down as low as around 43 \nSenators at one point. We did not have conferences. We were given bills \nthat we were ``jammed'' and had to vote on that were rewritten \ncompletely in conference committee and they came to the floor.\n  Notwithstanding all of that, notwithstanding that experience, Senator \nReid came to the floor of the Senate and completely opened the \namendment process. He did not fill the tree, he did not use any \nparliamentary procedure to prevent the Republicans from bringing an \namendment, and, indeed, some of the amendments of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle were agreed to. Senator Isakson has a major \namendment in here with respect to housing that is a very expensive \namendment. It added spending to this bill. Senator Specter and a few \nothers added some $12 billion for the National Institutes of Health. \nSo, please, let's put this in an appropriate and proper perspective.\n  Did they lose some votes on things they wanted to do? Yes, because \nthe American people voted in November to change the makeup of the \nSenate. The American people experienced what happened over the course \nof the last 8 years, and they are feeling the pain today.\n  I am hearing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle keep coming \nover and saying: My gosh, what a terrible thing it will be to add a \nburden to the debt of every family in America. You better believe that \nit is a tragedy. But where were they for the last 8 years when that \ndebt was being taken from $5 trillion in 2000 up to $10 trillion today? \nNot once did the President of the United States--not once did he veto \nan appropriations spending bill. Their President--their majority leader \ncould have said: We are not accepting this bill. Mr. President, you \nhave to veto it. It never happened.\n  Now, the reality is we have an economy that is hurting. The President \nof the United States has appropriately said that if we do not do \nsomething, this may lead to a catastrophe. I believe that, and my \ncolleagues believe that. Some people on the other side of the aisle \nbelieve that. This is an unprecedented economic cycle in which we find \nourselves.\n  Economist after economist, on both sides of the aisle--Mark Zandi of \nMoody's economy.com--he is a Republican economist--strongly suggests we \nhave to spend this kind of money in order to get the economy moving \nagain. We need to examine that a little bit and examine some of the \ncomments of my colleague from Arizona.\n  First of all, he claims we rejected housing. I tell you, if it were \nnot so--it just really amazes me to hear that. Last January at the \nWhite House--Senator Kyl was there, Senator McConnell was there, \nSenator Reid was there, Senator Durbin and a few others of us, Speaker \nPelosi was there, John Boehner was there and the President, the Vice \nPresident, Secretary Paulson.\n  And everybody went around and said what they had to say about that, \nthe stimulus package that we were then talking about putting in place, \na stimulus package a year ago. They went around the table, and it \nfinally came my chance to say something. I looked at the President, and \nI said: Mr. President, this may be a little unorthodox because I know \nwe are talking about this stimulus bill, but nobody here has mentioned \nhousing. I have to tell you, I just came from Brockton, MA, where the \nmayor is struggling with 1,000 foreclosures. There are 400 more coming \nat him. This is pandemic. If we do not keep people in their homes, this \nis going to get worse.\n  I then turned to the Secretary of the Treasury, and I said: Mr. \nSecretary, you could be negotiating mortgages now and keeping people in \ntheir homes at the revalued value of the homes, the devalued value of \nthe home, because they can afford to stay in it if they are paying 13.5 \npercent or 9.5 percent. But if they get to pay a percentage like most \nof the other people in America who have some influence and access--you \nknow, I have not met a business executive in America who is paying 13 \npercent or 9 percent, but average Americans were, and they were being \nrun out of their homes because of it.\n  Well, they all nodded and said, well, that sounds reasonable. We have \nto take a look at it. I came back with Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon \nand together, as members of the Finance Committee, we put it into the \nFinance Committee stimulus package. It came to the floor of the Senate, \nand guess what. My friends on the other side of the aisle opposed it. \nThey stripped it out.\n  We had a $15 billion mortgage revenue bond to help keep people in \ntheir homes, and the administration opposed it, even 1 week after the \nPresident of the United States went to the well of the Congress, and in \nhis State of the Union speech said: We need mortgage revenue bonds. \nEverybody applauded, but they came back and stripped it out.\n  From that day forward, until, I think it was August or September, \n10,000 people a day were foreclosed on. That is 10,000 Americans a day \nwho lost their homes, kicked out, locks changed. No wonder we are where \nwe are today. With that many homes, street to street to street to \nstreet, losing their value, and then the homes next to them losing \ntheir value, and the people got scared, they lost their jobs--and we \nhave lost jobs at a record rate. There were two point-some million jobs \nlost, 568,000 last month alone.\n  So I have to tell you, there are a lot of people a lot smarter than \nme to whom I try to listen, and everybody I talk to who is in the \nbusiness of business, of making deals--I am not talking about Wall \nStreet theorists or people who arbitrage and play the market, play the \ngame; I am talking about people who go out and create wealth, invest; \npeople who make judgments about risk, risk taking, and take new ideas \nand turn them into jobs, which is what has always made America great. \nThose people tell me they cannot get the lending; they cannot get the \ncredit. Banks that have money are scared to lend the money because if \nthey look at the marketplace and they make what a\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nbanker has to make, which is a prudent judgment about, hey, if I lend \nthe money, are my shareholders and the board of directors going to come \nto me and say, why were you so stupid to lend that money when the \neconomy is going down, and you did not have a chance of getting it \nrepaid.\n  That is the psychology of the marketplace, and Government is the one \ninstrument that has the ability to change the psychology. That is why \nit is so important we ``spend'' some money.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say this is a huge \nspending bill. They are going to spend. You know, well, I have to tell \nyou, I asked my friend from Alabama yesterday: OK, let's be real about \nthis. You say you do not want to borrow the money. What a terrible act \nit is of Government to be for borrowing. Well, what is the alternative \nto borrowing? There are only two alternatives: you can raise taxes--and \nthere is not one of them who will vote to do that--or you can cut \nspending. This is not the moment to cut spending; this is the moment to \nprime the pump. This is the moment you have to get money flowing into \nthe system.\n  Now, therefore, we are stuck. We have to borrow some money, and we \nhave to borrow it on the presumption, on the judgment, that we are \ninvesting this money we borrow in the most intelligent way to break the \ndownward psychology of the market and to encourage the creation of new \njobs.\n  Now, I would agree with my colleagues, I do not want to spend money \non a project that just vanishes, poof, and there is no payback to the \neconomy in the long run. We are not going to see long-term benefits to \nour country. But that is not what we are doing here. What we are doing \nhere is creating jobs. I mean, how do we get products from point A to \npoint B? We drive them on roads or we put them on a train or we fly \nthem in airplanes, but our infrastructure that supports all of that is \nfalling apart.\n  Other countries are investing far more than we are into their public \ntransit systems, into their air systems, and so forth. We have about a \n$1.6 trillion deficit in terms of our infrastructure investment. So \nwhat we are doing is saying: We are going to invest in some of those \nthings now, tomorrow. We can put people to work tomorrow morning. All \nacross this country we have projects that are shovel-ready, signed on \nthe dotted line. We can do the bidding. In fact, many of them are \nalready bid. They do not have the money. There are 45 States in the \nUnited States of America that have shortages in their budgets, and \nthose States are required, unlike the Federal Government, to balance \ntheir budget.\n  So facing the need to balance their budget, what do they do? They cut \nservice, they cut firefighters, they cut police, they cut teachers, \nthey cut the road projects. That adds to the downward spiral. Everybody \nhears their neighbors saying: Wow, I just lost my job. Then they start \nto fear for their job. As they fear for their job, they retrench in \nspending: I am not going to spend this week. We cannot go out to dinner \nthis week. We cannot take that vacation. We cannot take that house. We \nare not going to travel to see the family at Christmas or Easter or \nwhatever it is.\n  People stop spending. As more of the ripples of job loss go, the more \nafraid people become. So they hunker down for the possibility that they \nmay be the next to lose their jobs. That is part of the downward \npsychology. So you have to break it. And, I will tell you, there is \nnothing worse than doing too little to fix it. Nothing would be dumber \nthan coming out here and spending too little billions of dollars and \nnot knowing that we are doing enough to change the psychology and get \nthe job done.\n  Now, on the housing package, the Senator from Arizona said: We \noffered a housing package. Well, you know, they did offer a housing \npackage. But just because we rejected it does not mean we do not think \nhousing is important or we have to do it with what I said earlier about \nhousing. We are going to do housing. The President and Larry Summers, \nwho has been here meeting, is talking about how we are going to \napproach housing. But the program they offered, first of all, opposed \nany kind of bankruptcy relief so we can actually negotiate keeping \npeople in their homes, which is inefficient.\n  It did not target the money in an effective way. It had a 4-percent \nmortgage for everyone in the system so that people who do not even need \nthe money wind up getting a break in terms of their mortgage. So it was \nnot targeted. Moreover, it did not even require the banks to make a \nloan modification or even write down some of the bad loans they had. It \nwas not comprehensive. So the fact that it is rejected does not display \nthat this is partisan. It simply is a statement by the majority of the \npeople representing the people that we do not think it was a very good \nidea, and we are going to come back and fix it; the same thing with \nthis issue.\n  Incidentally, let me share with a few of my colleagues why this is \nsort of this old ideology versus new. The Senator talked about the \ntired ideology of the past. What is it? Well, I think today Michael \nSteele, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, made a \nstatement on behalf of the Republican Party. He said:\n\n       For the last 2 weeks, we have been trying to force a \n     massive spending bill through Congress under the guise of \n     economic relief.\n\n  Well, we are having votes. This is a democracy. We are not forcing \nanything. We are trying to get the job done because there is an urgency \nto getting it done.\n  But then he says:\n\n       The fastest way to help those families is by letting them \n     keep more of the money they earn. Individual empowerment, \n     that is how you stimulate the economy.\n\n  That is a big ideological/philosophical difference about how you most \nrapidly stimulate the economy. Let's think about it for a minute, the \nindividual empowerment. OK, we turn around and we give every family in \nAmerica the great big tax cut that the Republicans are talking about. \nHere is what he says: We want to give--the first 16,000 bucks you make, \nyou are going to be taxed at a lower percentage.\n  Terrific. We lose revenue at the Federal level that we could put into \nschools, fire, police, education, energy investment, investment in \nairports, rail, all of those things for which we do not have enough \nmoney. But we give it back to the people.\n  Then he says: They will go out and buy things. They probably will. \nSome of them may save it. What are they going to buy? Is there a \nguarantee they are going to go out and buy energy-efficient materials? \nNo. Is there a guarantee they will go out and buy an American car that \nis a hybrid, that actually does better? No.\n  They could go out and buy a car made in China or Japan or Germany. \nThat does not help us a lot. Or what if they pay off their credit card \nbill because it is so big that they need the money to pay the bill? \nThat is just paying for past things already purchased, for services \nalready given. It does not stimulate the economy. Please. And if they \ndo have some money to invest, there is no guarantee they will choose to \ninvest it in the United States of America. They might think it is much \nbetter to invest it in some international mutual fund that is investing \nin a country that has a better economy right now.\n  So that is a tired old philosophy. That is what we did in the 1980s \nand many of us opposed it. I voted against that tax cut. You know what. \nWe took the deficit of this country to an unprecedented level, crowding \nout the private marketplace in terms of borrowing, and we did not \ninvest in the things in which we needed to invest in the country.\n  Let me share and say to my colleagues that we have a multi-headed \ncrisis we are looking at. This is only one part of the package. I also \nwant to address the question where the Senator from Arizona said this \nwould be a recession way down the road. Well, I disagree with that. We \nare in a recession now. We have to do everything possible to break out \nof the reversion.\n  Now, the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act would ``have an immediate and substantial \nimpact on the U.S. economy, most noticeably in terms of job growth and \nGDP growth.'' That is the Congressional Budget Office. They say: In our \nefforts in this bill, our No. 1 priority is to put people back to work. \nIf tomorrow we spend money on a road construction effort so people who \ngo to\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nwork at that site will have a job, the people who drive the truck to \nbring the asphalt and the materials will have a job, the people who \nsupply the materials to those people will suddenly be ordering again. \nThey will pay taxes. They will take home a paycheck over the next year \nor two and that will begin to change the psychology of what we are \nlooking at here.\n  You have to spend some money. That is what Franklin Roosevelt did. \nThis situation cries out for it just as powerfully as that did. The CBO \nreport says the recovery package, as reported out of the Senate--I \nemphasize the Senate, the Senate Appropriations and Finance Committee--\nwould create between 900,000 and 2.4 million new jobs in 2009, this \nyear; between 1.3 and 3.9 million jobs next year; and between 600,000 \nand 1.9 million jobs in 2011.\n  These jobs would correspond to an unemployment rate reduction of .5 \npercent to 1.3 percent in 2009; .6 to 2 percent in 2010; and .3 percent \nto 1.0 percent in 2011.\n  Additionally, the report estimates that the legislation would grow \nthe U.S. domestic product, our GDP, by 1.4 to 4.1 percent this year; \n1.12 percent to 3.6 percent next year in 2010; and .4 to 1.2 percent in \n2011. So there is job-creating potential in this.\n  We need to transform the American economy. What is most exciting \nabout what we have put together in this bill, it is the first big, \nlegitimate effort to do that that I have seen in years. In the height \nof the oil crisis last summer, we were sending over $1 billion a day to \nSaudi Arabia. I would rather send that billion dollars a day down to \nthe Southwest, to Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. There is this \nunbelievable ability to be developing solar thermal in America. We have \na solar thermal plant in Nevada now. We could produce electricity \nwithout using oil and gas and fossil fuel. I am told--because the \nSenator from Arizona raised the question--that the water tables down \nthere are creating a self-serving cycle, a contained cycle so that the \nwater can be reused in a way that doesn't disturb water demand. But you \ncan drive electricity. We can produce six times the electricity needs \nof the United States from that region alone. Why aren't we doing it?\n  If we produce six times the electricity needs of the United States \nfrom one part of the country and modernize our grid, then people can \nstart buying electric cars. We will have an electric car that goes 100 \nmiles an hour and gets 100-plus miles to the charge which doesn't solve \nall long-distance problems, but for most Americans, the commute is 40 \nmiles a day. So you could actually do most of your week on electricity, \nnever touching a drop of gas and oil which would reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil, raise our security, raise health standards, \nmeet our environmental standards, and do an enormous amount to meet the \nchallenge of global warming. If we don't send a billion dollars to \nanother country, we are using it here at home to develop more renewable \nenergy and more jobs and future jobs in robotics, artificial \nintelligence, communications, and life sciences.\n  There are jobs to be created. It depends on how intelligent we are in \ninvesting the money in the right places. That is what this legislation \ndoes.\n  Let me share this with my colleagues. We have $40 billion going to \nthe Department of Energy for development of clean, efficient American \nenergy from advanced battery systems for energy efficiency, \nconservation grants, weatherization assistance, all kinds of research \nfor clean coal technology. We are about to have a breakthrough \ntechnology that I believe will allow us to burn coal clean and create a \nconstruction material called calcium carbonate that can be used as \ncement, concrete for building. It contains the CO2, and it \nhelps us to deal with this crisis. Those are new jobs, countless new \njobs.\n  I hope our colleagues will recognize that what is happening is a very \nlegitimate, philosophical, perhaps ideological difference. But this is \nnot old over here. This is new. This is what America voted for this \nyear, a change of direction, in order to get it right.\n  We are staring at an economy where health care premiums increased \napproximately 80 percent. Gas prices reached historic highs. They are \nnow down temporarily, but they will not stay there. College education \ncosts have risen 70 percent. Housing affordability, we all understand, \nis a huge problem across the economy. We will deal with that. Wages of \naverage Americans who are working are declining. The benefits they work \nfor are declining. Their retirement accounts have been wiped away. \nWorkers' earnings for college degree graduates are declining. Job \ncreation is the worst in America since Herbert Hoover's administration. \nThe unemployment rate rose to the highest level since 1993, and it is \nstill rising. We are told it will rise further. The deficit-financed \nBush tax cuts weren't paid for. They were deficit financed, and we have \nwound up with the least job growth we have had in any kind of recovery \nin modern history.\n  Today more American families and children face severe financial \nproblems than at any time. That is why this is urgent. It is only a \npart. We have to come back and do housing in a matter of weeks. We have \nto fix the banks in a matter of weeks.\n  I am confident if we do this, we are going to turn this around. We \nare going to have the most exciting economy we have had in years. There \nis no question in my mind that if we release American entrepreneurial \nand creative genius to create new products and move us to that future, \nwe will do what America has always done--we will continue to lead. That \nis what this debate is about, a new direction, a new time, and a new \nmoment.\n  I hope our colleagues will embrace it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to engage with my \ncolleague from Massachusetts. I will make five quick points, and then \neither Senator Sessions will follow me or, if a Member on the other \nside wishes to speak in between, he will then follow that individual. \nFirst let me clear up two things.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about deficits and, in effect, \nblamed the Bush administration. I would note the facts which are that \nlast year, under a Democratic-controlled Congress, the deficit doubled \nfrom what it was when Republicans were in control, and it is going to \ndouble again this year under Democratic control of Congress.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me try to make my points. I don't want to take less time \nfrom my colleagues.\n  Secondly, I acknowledge that the Senator from Massachusetts did raise \nthe issue of housing at the White House. The point I wanted to make was \nnot that Democrats and Republicans weren't both concerned, that \nDemocrats didn't have some good ideas. Simply, it is not fair to \ncharacterize the Republican position as wanting to deal with tax relief \nonly, that Republicans believe housing needs to be a part of this. In \nfact, we would prefer to fix housing first rather than, as the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts said, we are going to do housing later.\n  Incidentally, the bill to supposedly fix housing passed last June \nwith both Democratic and Republican support. It was obviously not \nenough.\n  Third, the Senator from Massachusetts talked about debt and said, \nwhat is the alternative to borrowing, either raise taxes or cut \nspending. That is true. But he said you can't do either in a recession. \nActually, that is not true. As I quoted before, the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research said this about that precise point:\n\n       The best fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is a \n     deficit-financed tax cut. The long-term costs of fiscal \n     expansion through government spending are probably greater \n     than the short-term gains. As between the two, some spending \n     can help. But long-term, it costs more if you have deficit \n     spending, and it provides for relief if you have tax cuts \n     financed through deficit.\n\n  The fourth point: My colleague from Massachusetts disagreed that this \nlegislation will result in a recession and noted that the CBO report \nsaid there would be short-term stimulus. That is exactly right. But \nwhat I said is also true. On page 5:\n\n       Including the effects of both crowding out of private \n     investment, which would reduce output in the long run, and \n     possibly productive government investment, which could \n     increase output, CBO estimates that by 2019, the Senate \n     legislation would reduce GDP by between one-tenth and three-\n     tenths of a percent.\n\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n\n  As I noted, the definition of a recession is when you have two \nconsecutive quarters of negative GDP.\n  Finally--and this is probably the most instructive point of all--\nthere is a clear difference between the parties. But I think it is \ninteresting when my colleague from Massachusetts described as one of \nthe failed ideologies of the past the notion that individual \nempowerment will do any good, when he ridiculed the idea of letting \npeople keep more of their own money. You have a very stark contrast \nbetween what some Democrats believe and what most Republicans believe. \nRepublicans do believe that Americans are better off being allowed to \nkeep more of their money. Why? Because they will make wiser decisions \nabout what their family needs than will some bureaucrat in Washington. \nI don't mean bureaucrat in a pejorative way. I am a government \nemployee. I didn't get any smarter when I came back to Washington. When \nI go back to Phoenix or Tucson, I see people struggling to take care of \ntheir families, and they are making very important and wise decisions \nabout how to deal with their family budgets. It is true, if they get a \ntax rebate, they are more likely to save it or pay off credit card debt \nthan to spend it. That is why that kind of tax relief, a rebate, the \nquick fix that is in this bill, doesn't work. Why? Because Americans \nmake wise decisions with their own money. They know they have to \ndeleverage their own personal budgets, as businesses know they have to \ndeleverage all of their debt.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me conclude my remarks.\n  Republicans believe that individuals are better off in making \ndecisions about their financial future than allowing the government to \ndo it for them. That is why we say, as Michael Steele said, let people \nkeep more of their own money and not have people in Washington decide \nwhat is best for them in how they want to spend it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to conclude and let Senators respond on their own \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Arizona, it probably is a \ngood idea if you try to play by the rules here. We are going back and \nforth. Each Senator has a certain amount of time. We can engage, but I \ndon't think that you, as my friend and counterpart, should feel you \nneed to make a speech after every point that is made on our side. I \nthink that is a tendency right now, and it doesn't do service to others \non your side or my side who want to speak.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have finished what I have to say. My \ncolleague Senator Sessions asked if I would respond to Senator Kerry, \nbecause he responded directly to me. He will follow next. There is no \nrule that says a Senator can't speak twice. Other Senators will rotate \nin time. I think that is the appropriate way to engage in the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will only take 2 minutes and then yield \nto a colleague. I think it is good to have this back and forth, \nfrankly, because it is a way to shed a little more light on these \nthings.\n  First, I did not say, in quoting Mr. Steele, that individual \nempowerment is not important. I didn't say that we are not for it. I am \nquoting him:\n\n       Individual empowerment, that is how you stimulate the \n     economy.\n\n  That is his program.\n  Forty-two percent of this bill is tax cuts. I have voted for \ncountless tax cuts in the Senate. I was one of the authors of zero \ncapital gains for new investments. I believe in tax cuts. We have \nterrific tax cuts in this bill. But clearly, there is no discussion in \nMr. Steele's comments about what we ought to be spending it on, how \nmuch we ought to be spending, how spending will make a difference.\n  Secondly, on the deficit doubling in the last couple years, yes, it \ndid. No. 1, because we have a war in Iraq and a war in Afghanistan, a \nwar in Iraq that many of us here believed spending $12 billion a month \nwasn't worth, and the American people believed wasn't. But \nnevertheless, that is one reason. Secondly, we passed a stimulus. We \npassed it outside of the budget process, because nobody wanted to pay \nfor it. We needed to begin to stimulate the economy already.\n  Third--and the Senator knows this--we did a fix to the alternative \nminimum tax so that millions of Americans would not be taxed \nunwittingly and inappropriately. We tried to pay for it. I signed on to \nSenator Conrad's amendment. We had a vote on the floor of the Senate. \nWe lost, because the Republicans decided they didn't think we should \npay for the alternative minimum tax fix. That is why we doubled the \ndeficit.\n  We had pay as you go in the Senate. We put it back in place to \nrestore fiscal responsibility, and it is important to put that in the \nproper context.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would ask my leader from West Virginia \nif I could have my 15 minutes now since Senator Kyl did speak, and then \nI will be done with that 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, I need to find out if the Senator from Alabama--\nbecause we are meant to go back and forth--will take time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will tell you.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator does not wish to speak, we can do it \non our side.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just speak for about 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. All right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, all we really have to rely on to help us \nfigure out the arguments about how this stimulus package will work is \nour Congressional Budget Office. We just chose a new Director, Mr. \nElmendorf, who is a very impressive guy. Mr. Elmendorf was really \nchosen by the Democratic majority in the Congress. They have the \nmajority and this is who they chose. We like the man, and Republicans \nvoted for him too.\n  Mr. Elmendorf produced a report the day before yesterday in which he \nsaid that if you take the number of jobs this bill would create, and \nyou take the various numbers that are in the bill, the ranges that are \nin there would be between $600,000 and $300,000 per job. I do not think \nany estimate has come in less than $300,000 per job. One argument was \nit was $900,000 per job. Mr. President, $1.2 trillion at 1.3 million \njobs is not that good a deal in terms of a return on jobs.\n  But the fundamental question is: will the thing work? We know one \nthing. We know it will cost us $1.1 trillion when this bill passes. It \nwill not be like the TARP, which was an investment on which we hope to \nget some of the money back. Every bit of this is money is spending and \nit will go right out of the door. The Congressional Budget Office notes \nthat this money will be borrowed and that it will cost us about $40 \nbillion a year to service this borrowed money. The Congressional Budget \nOffice notes, in addition to that, we have to get the money from \nsomewhere. In addition, this borrowing by the federal government crowds \nout other private companies that are in trouble, and who may want to \nborrow money to keep going until this recession ends. Yet now they \ncannot borrow the money to keep their businesses going.\n  The Congressional Budget Office concludes that over the next 10 years \nwe will have less growth than if we had not passed this bill in the \nfirst place. Let me say this: It will be worse the second 10 years \nbecause all the short-term economic benefit that will come from it will \nbe gone completely 10 years from now, and we will then have a $40-\nbillion-per-year tax burden on the American people.\n  How big is $40 billion? That is the annual road budget, highway \nbudget for the United States of America. That is a lot of money. So the \nquestion is, Can we reduce the size of it? Can we have some \ninfrastructure spending that can actually be spent quickly and create \njobs and build something important and permanent for America? Can we \ninfuse money into the economy effectively and targeted and temporarily \nto get us out of this difficult time we are in? I think we can. I think \nwe can do a lot better than this bill at less of a cost and more of a \nbenefit.\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 10 to 12 minutes to the \nSenator from California.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to Senator Rockefeller, I thought it \nwas 15 we had discussed.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, add on 3 more minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, the reason I need the time is, every time one of my \ncolleagues gets up, it just amazes me at some of the things they say.\n  Now, my friend, the Senator from Alabama, is very worried about going \ninto debt because of this economic recovery package. He is calling for \na small package. I do not know what he believes a ``smaller package'' \ndefinition is, but we know from economists, Democratic and Republican, \nif the package is too small it does no good. He is very worried about \nthe debt. We all are worried about the debt. Where were my Republican \nfriends--and they are my friends; I work with them every day--where \nwere they when George Bush took the debt from $5 trillion to $10 \ntrillion over 8 years--doubled it--put it on the backs of every man, \nwoman, and child--$17,000 of debt for every man, woman, and child? I \nnever heard a word. They spent it on Iraq. I say it is time to spend it \nhere and help our people. They spent it on tax cuts for the richest \npeople, those who did not need it, and they did not care about the \ndebt.\n  I want to help the middle class and the working poor, the backbone of \nAmerica, because without that backbone, we have nothing. So I think the \nrecord has to be set straight. I thank those Republicans who worked \nwith us Democrats on coming up with a solution. Thank you, thank you, \nthank you. You stepped forward. You listened to President Obama. You \nstepped forward for positive change. You stepped forward to help \nAmerica.\n  We are in a deepening economic crisis. In my home State of \nCalifornia, the unemployment rate is 9.3 percent. We all know \nCalifornia is trend setting. This is one trend I hope the rest of \nAmerica will not follow. But, by God, if we do nothing, if we do not \nembrace the bipartisan package--and I know it is not perfect--but if we \ndo nothing, that is, in my view, a hostile act--a hostile act; not a \npassive act--because to do nothing endorses the status quo.\n  I wish to spend a minute showing you some charts which illustrate the \nstatus quo.\n  Since 2001, 4.1 million manufacturing jobs lost.\n  In 2008, alone, 2,589,000 good-paying American jobs lost, just in \n2008.\n  For every 1 percent increase in the national unemployment rate, we \nsee a 1 million increase in Medicaid, a 1.1 million increase in the \nuninsured, a $1.4 billion rise in State Medicaid and CHIP spending, a \n$200 billion rise in Federal Medicaid and CHIP spending.\n  So what are we saying? If we do nothing, we are not going to save any \nmoney as a national government. We are not going to let people die on \nthe streets or starve to death or not get health care. We will all pull \ntogether to help them. We need to reverse this so we do not spend money \nthis way, so that we create jobs.\n  Now, I have a picture to show you. I do not know if you have seen \nthis, Mr. President. If you cannot see it from there, it is a crowd of \npeople. It looks like folks trying to jam into a rock concert. Do you \nknow what it is? One thousand applicants lined up for 35 firefighting \njobs in Miami, on February 2, 2009. They had to call the police to \ncontrol the crowd.\n  Now, I have a list of the layoffs in my State. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have some examples from that list printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Employment Development Department\n\n                             LISTING OF WARN NOTICES BY LAYOFF DATE (JAN-JUN)--2009\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                      Employees\n               Layoff date                       Company name-                   Location             affected\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1/1/09-.................................

Mr. President, Target laid off 382 people in Sunnyvale; \nHarman Becker Automotive laid off 325 people in Northridge; Ghirardelli \nChocolate laid off 107 people in San Francisco; Circle Foods laid off \n112 people in San Diego. And it goes on and on and on: 500 laid off, \n1,000 laid off, and on and on and on.\n  What happens when someone loses his or her job? And what happens when \nthe mom and dad lose their jobs? It is a life-altering change. We know \nthis housing crisis got us into this jam, and we need to address it far \nmore. That is why President Obama has said: Do this first, get this \neconomic recovery on track. Then we will look at housing and do the \nthings we need to do. Then we will look at the financial sector. So it \nis a three-legged stool. We have to do all of it. It is what the \nelection was all about.\n  But we need to step up to the plate now because it is one thing to \nlose your home because you were in a terrible situation with your \nmortgage and your interest rate kicked up to 8.9, 10 percent. That is \nawful. It is even worse to lose your home because you are two paychecks \naway from homelessness. We need to stem the tide.\n  I do appreciate my Republican colleagues' newfound respect for fiscal \nresponsibility. But we have to admit--admit--they never cared about it \nthe last 8 years. And that is how I started off, challenging my friend \nfrom Alabama. The past 8 years: deepening, deepening debt. Imagine \nthis: When George Bush took the oath of office, our budget was in \nsurplus. We had a surplus in our yearly budget. The Republicans took \nthat to $1 trillion of deficit. We had $5 trillion in debt. It was on \nthe way down. Economists said it was going to go to zero. I remember \nsaying to my husband, it is going to be so amazing when we do not even \nhave to sell Treasury bonds because we are going to be out of debt. \nWell, because of the war in Iraq, and because of these tax cuts to the \nwealthiest, that debt turned around, and, as I said, is a huge burden \non the backs of our taxpayers.\n  So imagine if President Obama inherited a surplus and inherited a \ndebt that was going down, and we had a recession, it would be so much \neasier, my friends, than it is right now. I do not like this. I voted \nfor balancing the budget under Bill Clinton, and I believe we will get \nback to a balanced budget\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nagain. But we have to take care of a crisis. We have to stem the \nbleeding. Every economist tells us that.\n  I could stand up and say I do not like the package. I would have had \nX more dollars here; I would have cut out this program there. I lost an \namendment on the Senate floor with my friend from Nevada that I thought \nwas a great tax cut. I got my clock cleaned. I could have taken my \nmarbles and gone home, you know, sucked my thumb, pulled the covers \nover my head, and said: I am really mad. I was right and they were \nwrong. But the country is in trouble.\n  Mr. President, 1,000 people are lining up for 35 firefighting jobs in \none of our great States. So guess what. I have to put aside my ego, and \nI have to work with my colleagues.\n  Again, I thank my Republican colleagues who moved forward and said: \nWe know this election was about change, and we are going to give this \nPresident a chance. Thank you, I say to them.\n  Our country is in economic trouble. The election was about the \neconomy. The election was about the economy. I am going to remind \npeople about that. It was just a little while ago.\n\n  John McCain, September of 2008: ``The fundamentals of our economy are \nstrong.'' Remember? The fundamentals of our economy are strong. His \nchief economic adviser said:\n\n       We have become a Nation of whiners. Constant whining, \n     complaining about a loss of competitiveness, American \n     decline. You've heard of mental depression? This is a mental \n     recession.\n\n  Well, tell that to Mr. Arreola, 27 years old, of Boyle Heights, CA. \nHe said: ``You've got to stay positive, but the economy is falling.''\n  He is looking for jobs. Every day he goes to north Los Angeles to a \njob center. Two months ago he lost his job at a computer warehouse. He \nsaid he has had to put his two children into foster homes until he can \nfind a new job. He said: ``I'll take anything.''\n  Is that a mental recession? The chances of this man finding a job are \ngetting slimmer. The pace of job losses has been accelerating. This \nthing is getting worse, the economists tell us.\n  We had an election about this. Barack Obama, January 8, 2009:\n\n       I know the scale of this plan is unprecedented, but so is \n     the severity of our situation. We have already tried the \n     wait-and-see approach to our problems and it is the same \n     approach that helped lead us to this day of reckoning.\n\n  So yes, I am mad that my amendment with the Senator from Nevada \ndidn't pass. I thought we did a good job in debating it, but I am not \ntaking my marbles and going home. I am working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. We have a chance now to get out of this \nrecession. Will this package do it alone? It will not. I told my \ncolleagues there are three legs to the stool, including the housing \ncrisis and the financial crisis. I was an economics major a long time \nago and I worked on Wall Street as a stock broker. In my lifetime, I \nhave never seen a time such as this.\n  So if we listen to our colleagues, we will either do nothing--and by \nthe way, they are filibustering this bill; let's make it clear. We \ncould have voted this out already, but they are filibustering it. That \nis their right. That is their right. I defend their right, but they \nhave to take the consequences of stalling it. Maybe we will have to \nstay through the recess, and we will. We will get this done, thanks to \nsome independent-minded people on the other side of the aisle working \nwith all of us.\n  One of my colleagues on the other side said the other day in a very \nemotional fashion: I feel left out of this process. As Senator Kerry \nhas said, this is one of the most open processes I have ever seen here: \namendment after amendment after amendment after amendment; several \nRepublican amendments passed. Senator Coburn had one pass. Senator \nSpecter had one pass. Senator Isakson had one pass. There were a couple \nof others. So the fact is it is an open process. When my Republican \ncolleague held up the bill and he said I feel left out, you know what. \nI don't feel sorry for him. If he was on this floor, he could have \noffered his amendments. He could even pick up the phone and call the \nPresident of the United States or the Chief of Staff and he knows he \ncould get through. He could talk to any one of us any day of the week \nand work with us, but he has chosen to stand apart. He says he feels \nleft out. Well, I would rather be him than the family who is left out \nin the cold--in the cold winter because they lost their home, because \nthey lost their job, because they lost their health care. So get over \nit. Get over it. Come and talk to us. Come and work with us. This \nelection was about change, not the same old same old trickledown tax \ncuts that don't work. Yes, there is 42 percent tax cuts in this bill. \nThat is not enough for my friends on the other side. They wanted all \ntax cuts or mostly tax cuts. We tried it. It didn't work. It has gotten \nus where we are today: huge debt, huge deficits, slow growth, no \ngrowth, recession.\n  So in summation, we are headed to a better day. This Senate debate is \nvery important. I thought it was terrific that John McCain led the \ndebate yesterday. In essence, it relived the debate around the \nelection: John McCain and his theory that the fundamentals of the \neconomy are strong; we just need to do a few things around the edges, \nversus Barack Obama and his vision of boldness and change. I am glad \nthis Senate in a bipartisan way has embraced that vision. I look \nforward to the passage of the bill. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for yielding me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I know the manager on the other side \nis not here, so how much time would the Senator from Nebraska require?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I anticipate about 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the legislation \nthat is before us that is making its way through the process. Make no \nmistake about this legislation, it is a bill with the largest price tag \nin the history of our Nation--really in the history of the world. A \nmind-boggling $1.2 trillion is going to be acted upon probably in the \nnext 72 hours. I would venture to guess that if you went around and \nasked how many zeroes are in that number, many could not answer that \nquestion. Despite what I believe to be a good-faith effort to cut some \nof the cost out of the bill--a reduction of about $110 billion or \nroughly about 10 percent of the overall cost--I wish to be on the \nrecord saying that simply is not enough. It is not good enough. What is \neven more troubling to me is that even with those cuts, this \nlegislation is roughly about $7 billion over the House version. The \nbest efforts to cut wasteful spending still have left us with what \nappears to be a more expensive version than even the House version.\n  The sponsors of the amendment assert they have cut about $110 \nbillion. However, let me be very clear about something. The bill is \nstill comprised of wasteful spending in programs that I would suggest \nmight be worthy of some support in the appropriations process, but I \ndon't see how they stimulate the economy. The wheels on the train have \ncompletely fallen off in terms of this bill resembling an economic \nstimulus bill. It is a gigantic appropriations bill.\n  Now, I wish to be clear about another thing. I am not saying that \nmany of these programs are not legitimate programs. In fact, in the \nyears I have been in public life, I have fought for many of these \nprograms. But someone will have to explain to me how giving money to \nconsolidate the Department of Homeland Security headquarters will \nstimulate this Nation's economy. Or how money to NASA for Earth science \nmissions will give a shot in the arm to the economy and generate real \neconomic activity. Program after program: Motor vehicles for the \nfederal government, money for trail maintenance. I could go on and on \nand point out program after program that, again, maybe good within the \nannual appropriations process, but I don't see how it stimulates the \neconomy.\n  I also wish to talk about the tax portion, if I might, for a moment. \nMany of us have heard time and time again when the President talked \nabout helping the middle class, but did my colleagues know the figure \non what constitutes middle class continues to dwindle away? If what I \nam hearing about the alternative is true--and we haven't seen any \ndetail on this--but it appears that the compromise shrinks\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nthat yet again. It shrinks the composition of those receiving the work \nopportunity tax credit by 44 percent from what the President originally \ndefined as the middle class.\n  Now, it appears that if the schedule goes on as anticipated, on \nMonday the Senate will be asked to vote to move this compromise \nfurther, but the American people need to know the facts about this \namendment and the overall debate. Many on the news, and even today I \nhave listened to talk of bipartisanship here, talk of people crossing \nthe aisle. At one point in my career I was a Governor; at another point \nbefore that I was a mayor. I come from a very unique perspective. I \ncome from a State that has the only unicameral system in the Nation. \nBut what is even more unique is that the legislature it is not \nRepublican or Democrat. Our Senators were elected on a nonpartisan \nticket. In fact, they used to say that they held that nonpartisan badge \nas a badge of honor.\n  When I was Governor, or when I was mayor, I can tell you what I \nthought bipartisan was. We would see a problem out there as it arose \nand I would bring the elected people in, literally one at a time, and \ntalk to them: What do you think we should do here? What is your best \nidea? How should we approach this issue? That would go on for months \nleading up to the introduction of a bill. Then, on the floor, they \nwould work through that bill. Oftentimes there would be groups gathered \naround trying to work on a given section of the bill--Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents. Eventually, a bill would be produced and a \nvote would be taken and some would vote yes and some would vote no and \nsometimes they would send me a bill I didn't like and I would veto it \nand then they would decide whether they wanted to override it. That is \na bipartisan effort.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that unless there is a new meaning \nattached to this word--I have only been here about 26 days--this bill \nresembles nothing I see as bipartisan. It appears to me that most of \nthe time only two Republicans were a part of closed-door meetings, and \nin the end, that was announced as a bipartisan effort. I don't \nunderstand that. If you think about the dynamics of this, less than \\4/\n10\\ of 1 percent of the Congress participated in this on the Republican \nside.\n  The one constant I hear over and over again is the pressing need to \nenact this legislation now; that we have to hurry. In fact, I just \nheard the word ``filibuster'' used--that we don't have to do anything \nexcept get this bill done. Well, let's examine the discussion regarding \nTARP last year, and what we heard or what we read about the need for \nTARP sounds exactly like what is going on now. Now we have TARP, it is \nin place, and congressional investigators are telling us the Treasury \nDepartment overpaid for bank stocks by $78 billion. I wonder what we \ncould have done with that $78 billion that has now been wasted. Nearly \n22 percent of the taxpayer money used for the bailout--22 percent gone \nin an instant. Well, as the old adage says: Fool me once, shame on you. \nFool me twice, shame on me.\n  I am not willing to put aside due diligence. We owe that to the \nAmerican taxpayers. We have a responsibility to make sure we get it \nright this time. We cannot afford to find a few months from now that \nwhat we thought would work didn't work at all.\n  I wish to share a story. I am reading through a stack of newspaper \nclips from all around that my staff prepared for me, and there is this \nlittle community and they had a road project and it was making its way \nthrough their capital improvements process. It finally got to this \nyear, the year it would be built, and the money is in the bank to do \nthat project. Do you know what the article pointed out? That they took \nthe money away from that project. Why? Not because they didn't believe \nin the merits of that project, but because they knew that this major \nallocation of funds was going to come from the Federal Government. And \ndo you know what? Having been there as a mayor and as a Governor and as \na city council member and as a county commissioner, that is going to \nhappen thousands of times across this country.\n  The stimulative effect is not going to happen in the timeline that is \npromised. It won't be long and we will be reading GAO reports about \nwaste, fraud, and how this didn't do what it was supposed to do.\n  I will wrap up with one last thought. This is literally borrowed \nmoney. I pointed out last night that we took a lot of votes getting \nhere. We are going to take a few more votes to pass the bill. And do \nyou know what? We are not going to vote on paying for this. In fact, I \ndon't believe anybody alive in the Senate will take a vote on paying \nfor this.\n  We have left the paying for this bill to another day. I hear the \ndebate about who is responsible and this one did that and that one did \nthis--I don't think that is what the American people were trying to \naccomplish in November. I think what they were trying to accomplish was \nfor us to get our fiscal house in order. I don't think they sent me or \nany of my colleagues here to try to sort out fault. I think they sent \nus here to solve problems. I see the massive amount of money and, \nagain, I will reference my experience. I come from a State where our \nConstitution requires a balanced budget. It forbids the elected \nofficials from borrowing over $50,000. I used to joke with Nebraskans \nthat $50,000, when the Constitution was passed, was probably a handsome \nsum of money. It can't buy very much today.\n  Post-9/11, when the Presiding Officer was a Governor and I was a \nGovernor and we were struggling with how to balance the budget, I could \nnot issue debt. There were only two choices: raise taxes and cut \nspending. I believed in the second choice. I sometimes lost those \narguments because my unicameral legislature disagreed with me. But we \nhad a very clear and straightforward assessment of what our problems \nwere and what the costs were. It never occurred to any of us that we \ncould go out and tell our kids and grandkids we are going to buy \nourselves out of the problem and leave it to them to try to figure out \nhow to pay for it.\n  I will wrap up with this thought. I have only been here 26 days. I \ndon't know whose fault this is. I do know and believe that the kind of \nchange we were asked to bring here was a different direction in terms \nof how we run our Government. I want to be a part of that. I have \nattended all the meetings on budget balancing to try to educate myself \nas to how overwhelming this problem is. I will tell you that we have to \ngrab ahold of this at some point, or there won't be a solution. Our \ndollar won't be worth anything. The foreign purchasers of our debt will \nlook at us and say the only solution America knows is to print more \nmoney, and their money isn't worth much anymore. My generation probably \nwon't pay a very heavy price for that, but other generations will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am honored to be here to speak out in \nfavor of the economic recovery plan. Anyone in Minnesota can tell you \nthat when it is 20 below, as it has been the last month, and your \nbattery is dead and you need to get to work, your No. 1 priority is to \nget a jump-start right away, not stand around talking about it and \ndebating and using the old ideas from the past.\n  That is what this economic recovery plan is about, a jump-start. \nYesterday, we learned that the U.S. economy lost another 598,000 jobs \nand the unemployment rate jumped to 7.6 percent. We lost more than \n200,000 manufacturing jobs last month--the largest 1-month decline in \n26 years. Since January of 2007, we have lost a staggering 1 million \njobs in the construction industry. Industries across the board, from \nretail, to transportation, to financial services are shedding jobs.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the unemployment rate rose to 6.9 \npercent last month--the highest it has been in over 20 years. With each \npassing day we get more bad news: rounds of layoffs, dropping consumer \nconfidence, and increasing debt.\n  Behind all the statistics and numbers are real families in Minnesota. \nThey are families I have met across our State--families like the woman \nwho wrote to us, saying she had inherited a little bit of money and she \nwas going\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nto use it for her daughter's wedding, but it was all lost in the stock \nmarket; families like the one I met in Litchfield, MN, in a cafe, who \nsaid she was now working three jobs to be able to get her kids \nChristmas presents; families like the man's who wrote and said that \nwhen they put their daughters to bed, he and his wife sit at the \nkitchen table and put their heads in their hands because they don't \nknow how they are going to make ends meet.\n  On Thursday, the President told us:\n\n       The time for talk is over. The time for action is now, \n     because we know that if we don't act, a bad situation will \n     become dramatically worse.\n\n  The President called on us to take immediate action. That is what \nthis economic recovery plan is about--a bipartisan group of Senators--\nand, Mr. President, you and I were involved--who got together and said \nwe need to get this done. I thank Senators Nelson and Collins for their \nhard work. It is not a perfect bill, and I don't agree with everything \nin it and with everything that came out, but literally we cannot afford \nto wait any longer to get something passed.\n  At the core of this bill is jobs. This bill is about jobs, jobs, \njobs. It will put Americans to work by rebuilding our roads, highways, \nand bridges, which have been neglected far too long. The U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation estimates that for every $1 billion of \nhighway spending, it creates nearly 48,000 new jobs and generates more \nthan $2 billion in economic activity.\n  In Minnesota, we know a little bit about the need for spending on \ninfrastructure. I live six blocks from that big bridge that fell that \nday in the middle of the Mississippi River. My 13-year-old daughter--\nwho is up in the gallery today--and I would drive over that bridge \nevery day when she would go to visit friends. One day, that bridge fell \ndown and 13 people were killed. Many more were injured, and cars were \nin the middle of the river. It shocked America into realizing the \nsituation with our declining infrastructure.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration, more than 25 percent \nof the Nation's 600,000 bridges are either structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. In his 1963 memoir, ``Mandate for Change,'' \nPresident Eisenhower famously said that more than any single action by \nthe Government since the end of the war, the one that would change the \nface of America is this: transportation--its impact on the American \neconomy, the jobs it would produce in manufacturing, construction, and \nthe rural areas it would open up is beyond calculation.\n  He was right. That is why this economic recovery plan contains \nsignificant investment in infrastructure and science--in fact, $114 \nbillion in infrastructure and science.\n  Another piece of the plan I want to highlight is the emphasis on \nenergy jobs. I spent the last few months traveling around my State. I \ncan tell you what I have seen. I have seen the little telephone company \nin Sebeca, MN, that needed a backup power structure because power was \ngoing out for their customers. They put together a packet with small \nwind and solar, and they sold it to the people in their area. They have \nbeen selling like hotcakes. The windmills in Pipestone, MN, became so \npopular that they opened up a bed and breakfast. You can go and stay \novernight with your wife and wake up in the morning and look at the \nwind turbine. That is the package.\n  The point of this is that the people in our State see the value of \nthese new energy jobs, whether it is a little solar panel factory in \nStarbuck, MN, or a big wind turbine manufacturing factory up in the \nMoorhead area. They see the value of new energy jobs. This energy \ntechnology revolution--or ET--is different than the information \ntechnology resolution--IT. When I saw the IT revolution, as big as it \nwas, jobs tended to be segmented in certain areas such as the Silicon \nValley, and they tended to be for people with graduate degrees and \nPhDs. This energy technology revolution will spread jobs across the \ncountry, in manufacturing jobs, green helmet jobs, and many other jobs \nfor the people of this country.\n  As Van Jones said, a guy who has written a book called ``The Green-\nCollar Economy,'' when you think about the green economy, you don't \nthink about Buck Rogers; you think about ``Joe Sixpack'' putting on a \ngreen hardhat; you think about ``Rosie the Riveter.'' Just think about \nRosie the Riveter manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines. This is \nPresident Obama's plan: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  Finally, this plan contains money, significant money for broadband \nand telecommunications infrastructure--$7 billion. When President \nRoosevelt said he was going to put rural electrification in place in \n1935, we only had 12 percent of American farms with electricity. About \n15 years later, 75 percent of the farms had electricity. That is what \nGovernment action can do.\n  Look at broadband. We have gone from fourth in the world to 15th. \nThis is not the kind of progress that will keep our country moving and \nget us back on track. For broadband, there is $7 billion in this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation. It is \nabout jobs, jobs, jobs. It is time to get America moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note that my bill managing \ncolleague is not here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think I have inherited that job from \nSenator Kyl. I yield such time as Senator Ensign would choose to use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we have an important bill in front of us. \nWe all know that. The reason is because our economy is struggling. A \nlot of people have talked about the jobs that have been lost, the \nunemployment rate rising, and people losing their homes, and the fear \nof losing their homes and jobs.\n  No State has been more severely affected in this last 12 months than \nmy own home State of Nevada. We lead the country in foreclosures. Our \nunemployment rate is over 9 percent now. Many people thought that \nNevada was almost recession proof, because we had been in an \nunprecedented economic expansion. We led the Nation for 15, 16 straight \nyears in not only job creation on a percentage basis, but also \npopulation growth. It was kind of an economic miracle in our State. Our \nhousing prices were skyrocketing for the last decade. When that bubble \nburst, we were one of the four States that was affected most severely.\n  There were a lot of causes, we all know, to the reason that the \nprices went up so rapidly. A big part of that, I argue strongly, is \nGovernment intervention. We, as the Government, said let's increase the \npercentage of home ownership in the United States. Through the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, we said: Banks, a certain percent of your \nmoney will have to go to subprime loans. And, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, we want you to get into this subprime market. Then what happened, \nto exacerbate the situation, was Wall Street got involved in all of \nthis and made it all worse. We took out the person who was loaning the \nmoney and severed the direct relationship between the lender and the \nborrower. These mortgages were sold overseas and around the world. \nThere was no accountability, and we saw a huge runup. While the runup \nwas going on, everybody was happy. Jobs were being created in the \nhousing market. It was helping the economy throughout the early part of \nthe decade. Everybody was happy, and a lot of wealth was being created \nin their homes. We didn't put in a strong regulator back in 2004, when \npeople recognized that Fannie and Freddie would cause a major problem \nin our housing market. We didn't put a strong regulator in then. It was \nblocked on party lines in the Banking Committee in the Senate. \nRepublicans tried to pass a bill and it was blocked by Senate \nDemocrats. Having that strong regulator in over Fannie and Freddie \ncould have stopped this whole thing from happening. We all know--and \nall economists agree, and there is no doubt about this.\n  Unfortunately, that cancer that was the housing crisis has now spread \nto the rest of the economy and our financial markets.\n  The question now is not only what caused it, but what do we do about \nit. How do we actually bring ourselves out of this particular problem?\n  I am going to spend a couple of minutes talking about history. I \nthink it is important we learn from history. Not all of the things we \ncan learn from history are a perfect model, but they give us a lot of \nguidance. We have a couple\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nof examples. Obviously, the Great Depression in our own country is a \ngreat place to go back and look at what happened. We can look at what \nled us into the Great Depression and what things worked to get us out \nof the Great Depression and what didn't.\n  First of all, during the 1920s--they called it the Roaring Twenties. \nWhy did they call it the Roaring Twenties? It is because the economy \ngrew. Unemployment was almost nonexistent in the United States because \nPresident Coolidge at the time recognized that low tax rates encouraged \nthe private sector to invest, and this would be a good thing. People \ngot very excited. Jobs were created. Everybody was doing great. But the \nstock market became overvalued. It was a kind of frenzy, similar to \ntoday's housing crisis or the dot-com bubble during the 1990s. Just \nlike the dot-com bubble that burst during the 1990s, the stock market \nburst in 1929. That was a correction. That was a correction in the \nstock market. That was not the start of the Great Depression. What led \nto the Great Depression then were the policies implemented by a \nRepublican President by the name of Hoover. What did he do? He \nincreased taxes, tremendously increased Government spending, especially \non infrastructure projects, and, worst of all, instituted what are \nknown as the Smoot-Hawley laws, which were protectionist laws. It \nstopped trade around the world. Unemployment rates over the next couple \nof years kept going up and up, eventually up to as high as 25 percent \nin this country, way higher than they are today.\n  Then we had the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He saw that \nthe answer to this was to have massive Government spending. So he put \ninto place what we all know now as the New Deal. People argue today \nthat the reason the Great Depression continued on was because Roosevelt \nwould spend money and back off, spend money and back off, spend money \nand back off. They didn't feel as though they did enough spending at \nthe time, nor did they keep the spending going.\n  Going into 1937, there were some other mistakes. Once again, taxes \nwere raised. There was a depression within a depression in 1937.\n  We have to ask ourselves this fundamental question: Even if you \nbelieve the New Deal was helpful, do we really want to take 5, 7, 10 \nyears to get out of the economic problems we have today? The New Deal \nnever brought us out of the Depression. Never did. The only thing that \nbrought us out of the Depression was World War II.\n  By the way, World War II was not the answer to our economic problems. \nThere were severe sacrifices made by Americans all across the country. \nEverybody was working on the war effort. But there were tremendous \nsacrifices that were made--rationing of food, rationing of gasoline, \nrationing of any kind of consumer product that we take for granted \ntoday. And the economy was very tough after World War II. As a matter \nof fact, the stock market in the United States never recovered. After \nthat crash in 1929, it never recovered until the mid-1950s. Do any of \nus here want to wait 25 years for our stock market to recover and to \nstart back up the path beyond what it was just a year ago?\n  I want to discuss not only parts of the stimulus bill but also what \nwe have done in the last several years.\n  First, this chart shows the percentage of Federal debt that is held \nby the public as a percentage of GDP--this is the most accurate way to \nmeasure the debt, as a percentage of our economy.\n  The early 2000s started growing, started growing, but then in the \nlast several years debt went up dramatically. The deficits and the \naddition to the debt were going up much faster than this chart looks, \nbut not as a percentage of our economy because our economy was growing \nvery fast.\n  People have argued that the money was spent on tax cuts. The evidence \nis very clear on this point. The tax rate cuts, just like under Ronald \nReagan and just like under John F. Kennedy and just like under Calvin \nCoolidge, actually led to more tax revenues because they stimulated \neconomic investment, they stimulated people to work harder, to invest \nand create jobs, and therefore we ended up with more tax revenue. The \nproblem with this last decade under President Bush is that we spent too \nmuch money.\n  By the way, who is responsible for this spending? Has anybody read \nthe Constitution? Congress holds the purse strings. The President \ncannot spend the money that we do not authorize him to spend. In this \nbody and the other body across the Capitol, we spent too much money. \nThere were only about 20 of us who kept voting no on these massive \nspending bills. There were about 20 Republicans. The rest of the \nRepublicans and Democrats sent the last President bill after bill that \nadded to Government spending that added to the size of our Government.\n  This chart shows total Government spending as a percentage of GDP. We \ncan see when President Bush took over it kept rising, kept rising, kept \nrising. Now we can see what is going to happen with spending as a \npercentage of GDP. This is not sustainable.\n  The spending bill that is before us today is part of the reason for \nthat line. We understand that Secretary Geithner is going to bring us \nat least another $500 billion, the third round of TARP. We still have \nto pass an omnibus spending bill.\n  The next chart shows some of these items. We have to pass an omnibus \nbill. There is going to be a war supplemental bill that is going to be \npassed this year. Some people are saying this is just the first \nstimulus bill we are going to pass because the arguments I have heard \ncoming from the economists who believe that Government spending is the \nanswer just believe that during the Depression, there was not enough \nGovernment spending, so we have to do a massive amount of it.\n  We are talking $350 billion for the first part of the TARP, and $39 \nbillion was just added with the Children's Health Insurance Program. By \nthe way, this number, $39 billion, is way low because they are saying \nthis program is going to stop in a couple years. We know that is not \ngoing to happen. The truer cost is well over $100 billion. The second \nround of TARP is another $350 billion. This stimulus package, when we \ncount interest that has to be paid over the next 10 years, is $1.2 \ntrillion. The omnibus bill is estimated around $400 billion; $70 \nbillion for a war supplemental; TARP III is estimated at $550 billion.\n  When do we stop? When are we going to be responsible to future \ngenerations? Do you know what this all adds up to? Higher taxes. It is \nimpossible not to have higher taxes in the future, and in the very near \nfuture.\n  The President came out and said that in the next several years, we \nare going to have over $1 trillion deficits for the next 4 or 5 years. \nThat is not sustainable. Right now, the only reason we have not had a \ncomplete economic collapse is because other countries around the \nworld--they are called sovereign wealth funds--have been buying our \nTreasury bills. It is smart for them to do that because if they don't, \ntheir economy collapses too. What happens if political pressure mounts? \nWhat happens if all these countries say: We are not sure U.S. Treasurys \nare good to buy anymore. They are a little too risky now. If that \nhappens, our economy goes off a cliff and there is no way to save it. \nSo we have to be concerned about the amount of spending that is in this \nbill. It has to be responsible.\n\n  I believe in infrastructure spending if it is done and it is done \nright. But what we shouldn't do is just spend money for the sake of \nspending money.\n  The President said the other night that spending equals stimulus. \nThat was basically what he was saying. Not all spending is stimulus. \nCertain spending is good stimulus, but not all spending is stimulus.\n  We also have to be careful about the size of the spending because we \ncannot just keep printing money like this. Not only will we have to \nhave higher taxes in the future, but it causes inflation. It is a basic \neconomic principle. It is just like a family who lives beyond their \nmeans or a business that lives beyond its means or a State government. \nAt a certain point, living beyond your means catches up with you. So we \nare going to hurt--and according to the CBO, they said there will be \nsome short-term stimulus in this bill, we all know, there will be \nstimulus, but the long-term problems we are creating with this stimulus \npackage can be very severe.\n  Let me point out a couple of things. First, before I point out a \ncouple things in this spending bill, I want to talk about Japan for \njust a little bit.\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\n  Japan, during the 1990s, had severe economic problems. They said: We \nare going to pass stimulus bills. As a matter of fact, during the \nnineties, I think they passed six stimulus bills, if I am correct.\n  This is Japan on this chart. These blue bars are government spending \nas, once again, a percentage of their economy. In the late eighties, \nnineties, it kept going up, up, and up. This red line is unemployment \nin Japan. As they kept spending, if government spending was the answer, \nwe would see a reduction in unemployment, wouldn't we? That isn't what \nhappened in Japan. As a matter of fact, the 1990s in Japan is called \nthe lost decade. They had bad monetary policy, and there was bad \nmonetary policy during the Depression as well.\n  Hopefully, we are not doing that today. But it isn't just Government \nspending that is going to get us out of this mess we are in today.\n  This compromise plan before us--first of all, nobody has seen it. It \nis not available yet. I think the only copy is at the desk because it \nwas not in a form you could copy it. None of us have seen this bill. \nNone of our staff have on either side of this aisle. Nobody has seen \nthis complete substitute before us today. It is a $1.2 trillion bill \nwhen we add in the interest.\n  If you assume the optimistic projections of 4 million jobs, this is \nabout $300,000 per job that is either created or saved. It used to be \njust created, now it is created or saved--$300,000 per job. If the low \nend of the projections are correct--you always have a high end and low \nend; I was being optimistic--at the low end, about 1.3 million jobs, \nthe price tag per job is over $600,000. Don't you think we can do \nbetter than between $300,000 and $600,000 per job? Common sense, don't \nwe think we can spend the money and create more jobs for that much \nmoney?\n  We have heard about the pork in this bill, and Senator Coburn had an \namendment yesterday--I am glad it was adopted--that would take out some \nof the pork in this bill. The unfortunate thing is, what they did was \nthey asked for a wish list of Governors and mayors across the country. \nThese kinds of items could still be allowed: $6.1 million for corporate \njet hangars in Fayetteville, AR; $8 million for citywide bicycle \nfacilities in Miami, FL; $15 million for pedestrian ways in St. Louis, \nMO; $47 million for new bike paths throughout the country.\n  I cycle. I like bike paths. I love to see them out there. I ride my \nbike almost every weekend--not this weekend because we are stuck in DC. \nBut I love to cycle. This is not a time to build these kinds of things. \nIf we are going to invest in infrastructure, invest in infrastructure \nthat actually makes the economy more efficient, such as roads that are \nneeded.\n  By the way, in Japan, when I put up that chart before, a lot of that \nspending they did ended up being bridges and roads to nowhere. If you \ndo not target this money correctly--and the only way to do that is to \ntake our time. When we rush through bills, we are going to see bridges \nto nowhere, we are going to see bicycle paths that people feel good \nabout riding, but it is not going to help the economy. We need to take \nour time. If we rush through this bill, I believe we are going to have \nsome very serious regrets in the years to come. We are going to have \ninflation. We are going to have to have higher taxes, and in the long \nrun, we are going to do a huge amount of damage to our economy.\n  Let's get together. Let's sit down, not as Republicans and Democrats \nbut as Americans. That is the way the process should have been done in \nthe first place. I have told the folks on the other side that if they \nwant a bipartisan bill, they need to start in a bipartisan fashion. The \nPresident said he wanted a bipartisan process. You don't bring a \nDemocratic bill from the House of Representatives, jam it through here, \nsend it over to the House with no Republican input in either the House \nor the Senate, and then just allow amendments to happen but not at the \ncrafting of the bill.\n  I believe this stimulus package could have been put together with \nRepublicans and Democrats and probably had 80 votes in the Senate \nbecause neither side has all the right ideas. Neither side does. Our \nside doesn't have all the right ideas; their side doesn't have all the \nright ideas. So to put the best ideas together, we should have sat down \ntogether, taken our time, and gotten this thing right.\n  Mr. President, $1 trillion is not something where you can afford to \nblow it all. If you don't get $1 trillion right, you have made a \nmassive mistake that you may not be able to recover from. That is why \nwe need to slow down and do what is right for this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Udall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for managing this effort, and I am honored to be with you \ntoday.\n  The first thing I want to say is, I think the important thing that \nhas happened is we have seen several Republicans step forward to work \nwith us on this economic package, and I would congratulate them and \nthank them for their bipartisanship--the two Senators from Maine and \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania--who have seen that we have a very \nserious economic crisis facing us, and we need to focus on that with an \nurgency to do something. So they understand that and they are willing \nto work with us to make sure we get this done in a timely fashion.\n  Now, I have been listening to the debate for almost 2 hours, and \nthere have been several assertions that have been made by our friends \nacross the aisle. No. 1 is, the President has misrepresented tax cuts \nand the Republican position; and, No. 2, the assertion which has to do \nwith a failed ideology. They do not understand that.\n  Well, it is pretty clear to me what the difference is, and there is a \nbig difference. During the 8 years under George Bush and the Congress \nthat supported him--the Republican Congress--we had tax cuts for the \nwealthy, and that was the solution to things. What we have in this \npackage--and this is the big difference--is what we call--and President \nObama has worked with the Senate and the House on this--a make work pay \ntax credit. This is a tax cut for working families. This is money that \nis going to be spent by working families that will flow through the \ncommunity and get our economy growing again.\n  Now, on the issue of failed ideology--and I am not trying to read \nPresident Obama's mind or anything--I think what President Obama was \ntalking about when he talked about failed ideology and failed policies \nis, if you look at the Bush Presidency, and you look at the 8 years he \nwas in office, we have seen a couple of things happen: massive debt. \nDuring his 8 years, the debt has grown from $5 trillion to $10 \ntrillion. When he took over, the country was in a surplus. We projected \nover 10 years that we had a $5.6 trillion surplus. Today, we have a $10 \ntrillion or more deficit. And, by the way, that is the biggest swing we \nhave seen in our history, from a surplus to a deficit. That has put us \nas a nation in a horrible hole. So we know we have a big problem, and \nPresident Bush created that.\n  The Bush economic policies over the last 6 years have hurt the middle \nclass. We have seen middle-class incomes decline by $2,000 a year. The \neconomic policies he has put in place have hurt middle-class and \nworking families. And there is something we have inherited, and we need \nto be frank about it. It is a massive financial collapse on his watch--\nBear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, and the list goes on and on. \nEverybody who is analyzing that now says it is due to deregulation, \nlaisser-faire Government policies, and an approach by that \nadministration to just let people regulate themselves.\n  I remember when Chris Cox stepped forward and said, it was a mistake \nto let them regulate themselves. Well, that is what he did with his \nleadership over there at the SEC. So what President Obama is trying to \ndo, and what the Senate and the House are trying to do now, is to fix \nthe problems we have inherited from this administration--these serious \neconomic problems, financial problems. We very much appreciate the \nsupport of Republicans in doing that, especially the three who have \nstepped forward to work with us.\n  So I don't think there is any doubt there have been failed policies, \nbut in\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\ntalking about the economic recovery, we are talking about several \nthings we are going to do. First of all, in the package that is before \nus, that I believe we are going to get out sometime soon, we are \ntalking about a financial and banking recovery. We are also talking \nabout stabilizing housing and making sure foreclosures are stopped so \nwe don't go to 8 million foreclosures and those sorts of things. But \nwhat we should be focusing on, which this package does, and which is \nvery important, is helping the States so they do not contribute to the \ndownward spiral.\n  My State of New Mexico, our Governor, has proposed to the \nlegislature, which is sitting right now--the New Mexico Legislature is \nsitting--$454 million in cuts. That is 10 percent of the State budget, \nroughly in that range. So what will that do in our State of New Mexico? \nThat will lay people off, projects will slow down, and we will be \ncontributing to the downturn. What this package does that I think is \ntremendously important is, it allows the States to not make those kinds \nof cuts.\n  A number of my colleagues have talked about how important this \nlegislation is. Economists agree that a recovery package simply must be \npassed. If we do not act, we face double-digit employment--with \nmillions more workers who cannot make ends meet because their hours \nhave been cut and their pay is too low.\n  We have the power to help. We must use it.\n  Some of my friends who oppose this bill seem to think that we should \npass a recovery package, but we should not to do anything to address \nour long-term prosperity. They say that this compromise bill is being \nused as an excuse to do the things we want to do anyway. If that means \nthat this bill is not about creating jobs, then it is just plain wrong. \nThis bill will create jobs. Economists from ACROSS THE POLITICAL \nSPECTRUM will tell you that.\n  But my friends have a point. This bill will do things that should \nhave been done years ago. It addresses concerns that would be very real \neven if we did not face an economic crisis.\n  Let me give you an example. A business in my State just had to lay \noff almost its entire workforce because it couldn't raise capital. This \nbusiness has devoted itself to designing technologies that will make \nAmerica a global leader in clean energy. The bill we're considering \ntoday could help companies like this get their technologies to market. \nFor this one firm, that could have meant 55 jobs. Someone could say \nthat the recovery package is pursuing goals that are not just about \neconomic recovery.\n  But let me ask: if you are going to create 55 jobs, why not end \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil? Why not create the jobs of the \nfuture--jobs that cannot be sent overseas?\n  Let me give you another example. In Indian country, more than a \nquarter of all Native Americans live in poverty. The unemployment rates \nreach as much as 80 percent on some reservations. And the economic \nhardships facing all Americans today, are only compounded in Native \nAmerican communities. As Chairman Dorgan said, ``Nowhere in this nation \nare jobs and construction improvements more needed than on American \nIndian reservations . . . Where tribal communities have faced \nlongstanding infrastructure needs.''\n  In this legislation today, we direct investments to Native \ncommunities. To improve Indian Reservation Road Infrastructure. To make \nsure Native people have access to clean drinking water. And to make \nsure Native children have an opportunity to thrive by investing in \ntheir nutrition, and in their educations. So, again, I have to ask: if \nour goal here is to create jobs, and uplift our economy, why not \nprovide a Native American family with an income . . . with hope for the \nfuture? This legislation helps to do just that.\n  That is not to say that this recovery package is perfect. We would \nall make adjustments if we could. But we must compromise. And we must \nget it done. We all realize the long-term consequences if we fail.\n  Short-term thinking helped get us into this mess. And if we solve \ntoday's economic problems without thinking about our future, we will be \nback here again. Nobody wants that.\n  More importantly, when this bill is signed into law, our \nresponsibility as Senators and as citizens will not be over. The bill \nwe are considering is an act of trust in the American people. Much of \nthe money in this bill will not be spent by Washington. It will be \nspent by Governors and mayors, State agencies and school boards--the \nmen and women who make up the strong base of our representative \ndemocracy. This is a time for active citizenship. When this bill is \nsigned into law, men and women across this country need to watch how it \nis spent. We need to make sure that our local governments get the money \nto families that need help and businesses that will create jobs. This \nrecovery package contains unprecedented provisions to provide oversight \nand demand accountability. But it will not work unless we make it work.\n  I look forward to working with State and local officials in New \nMexico to make sure the taxpayers' money is spent wisely. I will be \nworking to make sure this money creates jobs today. I will be working \nto make sure it lays the groundwork for a brighter future. And I \nencourage my constituents to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to notify me after \n8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are some fundamental things that \nare important in America that can't be denied. They are like the law of \ngravity. They won't go away. One of them is that there is no free \nlunch. Nothing comes from nothing. Something has to be produced by \nsomebody at a cost, and debts must be paid. If we incur debt, we incur \nan obligation. Money does not come from the air, and if we were to be \nirresponsible and print large amounts of money to use to pay our debts, \nwe would inflate the currency and debase the value of every asset held \nby every American and the value of the dollar, which has very \npernicious consequences for us.\n  I would like to take a moment to share some thoughts. This is a quote \nfrom Larry Summers, President Obama's No. 1 economic adviser and a very \nexperienced man. I am not quoting Mr. Summers to claim that he has \nchanged his position; I am quoting Mr. Summers because fundamentally \nthese statements are accurate statements. Mr. Summers has said that:\n\n       As with any potent medicine, stimulus, if misadministered, \n     could do more harm than good by increasing instability and \n     creating long run problems. A stimulus program should be \n     timely, targeted, and temporary.\n\n  That was in January of last year. I think that is a fundamentally \ntrue statement. And one of the things I am worried about in this bill \nis that it is so diffuse, it is so untargeted and so large that it does \nnot meet any of the standards mentioned by Mr. Summers.\n  Mr. Summers has also said that:\n\n       Fiscal stimulus, to be maximally effective, must be clearly \n     and credibly targeted . . . with no significant adverse \n     impact on the deficit for more than a year or two after \n     implementation.\n\n  I believe that the bill before us violates the criteria Mr. Summers \noutlined in this statement. In January of last year Mr. Summers said:\n\n       Poorly provided fiscal stimulus can have worse side effects \n     than the disease that is to be cured.\n\n  Now, that is why I have cited the Congressional Budget Office report \nof just 2 days ago so often. In this report, Mr. Elmendorf concluded:\n\n       Over the 10-year period, the growth of the economy would be \n     less if we pass the stimulus than if we had no stimulus at \n     all.\n\n  I didn't make that up. It is difficult to accept that you can't \ncreate something from nothing very easily. We can get a little bump in \nthe economy now by reaching into the future and bringing $1.1 trillion \nor $2 trillion and spending it now and let our children worry about \npaying it. You can get that. But it quickly gets away from us.\n  So in 10 years, the Government borrowing $1 trillion-plus from the \nmarketplace crowds out credit and denies small businesses and other \npeople the ability to get loans. So there are costs in this. It is just \ncritically important that every dollar be properly accounted for and \nthat we not stick in a bunch of programs that may be ineffectual and\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nthat don't go through the normal committee process.\n  President Clinton's Budget Director, Alice Rivlin, warned a few days \nago that:\n\n       A long term investment plan should not be put together \n     hastily and lumped in with the anti-recession package. The \n     elements of the investment programs must be carefully planned \n     and will not create many jobs right away.\n\n  To interpret that language, the long-term investment plan means new \nprograms--new health care programs, new environmental programs, and new \nenergy programs. Alice Rivlin warned that these programs shouldn't be \nlumped in with an antirecession package. She warned that the elements \nof the investment programs are the things that will continue to be out \nthere for a long time. She says that these programs are not going to \ncreate jobs right away. In addition, money could be wasted because the \ninvestment elements may not be carefully crafted.\n  We have to be careful in crafting this bill or we will not create \njobs; we will create ineffectual programs. Yet we are going to run them \nthrough without going through the normal budgetary process and the \nnormal authorization committee process. We have all kinds of bills in \nhere, all kinds of legislation in this bill that would normally be the \nproduct of committee hearings and public debate. They have just been \nstuck in and they are being run through with a few days of debate. The \nproponents of these programs like them. They think they sound good and \nthey are pushing them forward. I don't dispute their integrity or their \ngoodwill, I am just saying history tells us we have to be careful.\n  I supported ethanol, and I know Senator Grassley did. Some now think \nwe went too far. Senator Grassley doesn't. I don't know where we are on \nit, but we were all excited at the time. We thought we were going to \nfix all our problems.\n\n  I would also like to point out that Senator Conrad, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, a Democratic leader in the Senate here, really a \nfine Senator, has repeatedly expressed his grave concern about a bow \nwave that is being created with the stimulus. In other words, the \nstimulus, in perspective, seems to be legislation that will be one-\ntime, temporary, and targeted. But Chairman Conrad says there are at \nleast $120 billion of programmatic changes that are not going to quit, \nand therefore we are increasing our permanent expenditure baseline by \n$123 billion. Senator Coburn from Oklahoma believes it is a $300 \nbillion bow wave of permanent spending in this bill that is never going \nto end. It is very difficult. We are doing it so rapidly that it is \ntroubling.\n  I want to say one more thing. Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nGrassley have been here longer than I, but if you look at what we are \ndoing--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if you look at what we are doing, it \ndoes not reflect well on the Congress and the Senate.\n  Last fall, we were told by Secretary Paulson that we had to pass a \n$700 billion bailout for Wall Street. I remember one day they told us \nwe had to pass it before the next day, before the Asian markets opened. \nDo you remember that? You have to do it before the Asian markets open. \nWe fiddled around and were panicked and pushed and shoved and \nthreatened and everything. Eventually Congress folded up and passed the \n$700 billion TARP program. Only $350 billion of that has been spent to \ndate, so it obviously was not the most important thing in the world. \nFurthermore, most economists think it has done very little good.\n  Now we come up with a stimulus. All of that was in addition to our \ndebt. It was classified as emergency spending and went outside of the \nbudget process with very few hearings. Every penny of this bill is now \ngoing to the debt. None of this money is going to be returned to the \nGovernment. Once we sign the bill, the money goes out of the door and \ngets spent. That is another $1.1 trillion. It did not go to the \nauthorizing committees and in-depth hearings on all these programs were \nnot held.\n  We know in another few days we are going to have another \nmultibillion, maybe $500 billion plan proposed by the administration \nfor the second part of the Wall Street bailout and maybe additional \nlegislation for housing.\n  I say to my colleagues, somehow all of this is spent outside the \nbudget. We pass a budget and we are supposed to stay within that \nbudget. Yet all of these huge, unprecedented expenditures are spent \nwithout any requirement that those expenditures compete with other \nprograms. We want to do hybrid cars, but it doesn't compete with other \nlegitimate efforts to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We just \nstick it into this bill without any hearings.\n  I am really worried about it. I think we are losing our discipline. I \nthink Congress has been rubberstamping the Executive. I voted against \nPresident Bush's request to give this money to Wall Street, and I am \ngoing to vote against this stimulus package unless it is substantially \nchanged.\n  I do believe Senator McCain's legislation is one of the best \nalternatives proposed thus far. I support it. It is over $400 billion. \nIt has more for roads and highways than this bill. This bill only has \n$30 billion for highways and bridges. It is supposed to be an \ninfrastructure bill, yet $30 billion is less than 3 percent of the \nentire package. This funding represents even less than 3 percent if you \ncount the $347 billion in interest the bill would cost.\n  It is a very troubling bill. It is being ramrodded through. It is not \ngoing to have the kind of impact on this country's economy that we \nwould like it to have. Indeed, I am afraid that unfortunately the \nCongressional Budget Office is right. Whereas we might have a temporary \nboost in the economy for the first 2 or 3 years, over the next 10 years \nit will be negative, and over the next 10 years after that it will be a \nflat negative with no benefit whatsoever to the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia \nfor being here today. I thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nfor being here today, and all my other colleagues who are here.\n  When I left the seventh grade basketball game in the morning at 8 \no'clock, my children wanted to know--they are used to me working on \nSaturdays, but usually it is in Arkansas. They said to me, ``You are \ngoing into the Capitol? What are you doing, Mom?'' I said we have \nsomething very important facing this country right now, the gravity of \nthe situation we find ourselves in as a nation right now, looking for \nthe solutions to the challenges we face in this great country. I told \nthem we are so blessed to live in this country, it is worth coming in \non a Saturday to talk through the issues, the challenges we face, and \nwhat the solutions are for this country moving forward.\n  I have to say I am glad to be here, and I am glad to be joined by \nsuch compassionate and pragmatic Members who are also here to talk \nabout how we get ourselves out of this. We can talk about history, we \ncan talk about what got us here. The most important thing to talk about \nis how we put our country back on track.\n  The most important challenge we have been faced with here is \nobviously our economy. There are lots of others that will feed in. As \nthe Senator just mentioned, we have other opportunities down the road \nto deal with those. But I am proud of the effort in the Senate.\n  President Obama gave us a good beginning in his recommendations of \nhis recovery package. The House worked on theirs. We are here now, the \ndeliberative body, to look at how it is we can improve upon this.\n  I have to say, I think about some of the best advice I have ever \ngotten in life. Life is about choices, and we all are faced with \nchoices and the many hats we wear in our lives. We have choices of how \nto be good parents, how to make those choices. We have choices in how \nto be responsive and to be a good wife and to be a good daughter to\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\naging parents. And yes, how to be good Senators, coming together to \nrepresent the interests of our State but also the well-being of the 50 \nUnited States, this great Nation of which we are a part. That is what \nwe are here about right now. That is why we worked late into the night \nlast night. Everyone was tired. Now we have come back today to begin, \nhopefully, a bigger and better discussion of how we face these \nchallenges and where we find these solutions.\n  I was extremely proud of my colleagues, Senator Collins, Senator Ben \nNelson from Nebraska, and the others who came together. I joined that \ngroup to listen and talk about how we can bring balance to these \nsolutions, those who have concerns about how much is spending in this \nbill and how much is tax cuts, and where do we go to create that \nbalance that will help us move forward in this country to create the \neconomy we need to create without creating outrageous debt that could \nbe harmful to our children. It is a delicate balance, and that is why \nthat group came together; it was to see how do we find a bipartisan way \nto come up with these solutions.\n  Trimming about $100 billion is what came out of that. It was a good \nthing. It was a good thing to say, yes, they are all things we are \npassionate about. Nobody is against education. We do not want to \ndemonize the programs that exist in what people are passionate about. \nBut is this the place to do it? Can't we maybe reduce some of that \nextra spending we put in this bill to make it comparable to what it is \nthat everybody wants to see? That was a good step. It was something we \nshould be proud of in this body, that in a bipartisan way people did \ncome together to say: What are our challenges, what are our options, \nhow do we balance this?\n  There are great ideas out there. I tend to disagree a little bit--new \nideas can be good ideas. We have to look for the new ideas. We have to \nmove from an old energy economy to a new energy economy. We have to \nlook at the new ways of health care where we can find efficiencies and \neffectiveness that will bring us greater quality of care at a lower \ncost, accessibility to more Americans in health care needs and in \nhealth insurance. These are things we can do. But we cannot do them if \nwe do not work together and we are not willing to take steps forward. \nIf all we do is look back, look in the past and worry about what got us \nhere and worry about all of those things as opposed to working \ntogether, we will never make it.\n  One of the other critical pieces of this recipe is patience. We have \nto be patient. Yes, this is timely. It is much needed. We are in a \ngrave situation in this country in terms of our economy. We have to \ndeal with this crisis and put ourselves back on track. We can do it \nwith timely and targeted and temporary measures. My colleague from Iowa \nmentions that often, and it is a wonderful thing for each of us to \nremember as we go through these things.\n\n  We also have great passion for a lot of the different specifics that \nare important to our States. We have to have patience with that. There \nwill be other trains leaving this station. We will do an omnibus bill, \nwe will do an appropriations bill, we will do a move into that new \nenergy economy, we will do an energy bill, we will do health care \nreform, and we will do tax reform. We are dedicated to doing those \nthings. But this right now should be our focus, should be our most \nimportant focus, of moving forward. We all, when we have an important \njob to do, get very anxious. Now we need to have patience. We need to \nmove in a calculating way, working hard, to come up with the solution \nwe need to have. But we do need to do something now. We are here today \nbecause we want to get it right, we want to work hard with others in a \nbipartisan way, across the aisle, to make sure what we are doing is \ngoing to be important.\n  I would say to my colleagues, look at what we have done. Look at \nwhere we have come over the course of the last week. We have already \nbrought about a balanced package, frankly, in terms of spending and tax \ncuts. Those are positive things. We are going to have to spend \nsomething. We are talking about dealing with this economic crisis, \nspurring the economy, giving the ability to the people, the hard-\nworking families of this country--look at what we have done on the tax \nside: support for small businesses, tax relief for small businesses \nthat want to keep their payrolls going, that want to keep those jobs \ngoing, that want to make sure those working families are still going to \nbe getting their payroll checks and putting into the GDP through the \nconsumption their families need.\n  We have an awful lot to do. But I hope the Members of this body will \nnot give up, will not torture themselves about what other people have \ndone and will remember who we are in this body and our ability to come \ntogether and work. We have done it in the past.\n  When our country needs us the most, it is absolutely essential that \nwe put down all of what may be behind us and make sure we are working \nhard to get this right. We can, we must, for the sake of this great \ncountry, the sake of the blessing each and every one of us has in \nliving in this great country. It is our responsibility, it is our duty, \nand it should be our honor to come together and work these problems \nout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have two or three items of this \nlegislation I want to discuss with my colleagues, some items I hope can \nstill be worked into the final package.\n  The first deals with the idea that President Obama put forth in his \ncampaign about the zero capital gains. If you look at what is possibly \ngoing to be passing this Senate, you find that this bill contains only \nabout $21 billion in net tax relief for businesses, and that is for the \npurpose of encouraging investment because investment creates jobs and \nthese are long-term jobs. I don't find any fault with the business \nincentives that are in here, but $21 billion, for the most part--it is \ntax relief going to just big business.\n  That has to be a result of the $19 billion dollar net operating loss \ncarryback provisions which are in this bill, mostly benefitting large \ncorporations.\n  Well, how much tax relief for small business is in this $827 billion \nbill? Not much. I think it is a pretty puny amount. So I stand to \nencourage support of a proposal by President Obama to eliminate capital \ngains on sale of stock in small business and startup corporations.\n  Under present law, under section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, \n50 percent of the gains realized on the sale or exchange of certain \nsmall business stocks held for more than 5 years is excludable from \ngross income. That 5 years is very important because we want to look at \nlong-term investment, not the just the get in quick and get out quick \nthat has created a lot of economic problems.\n  Now, beyond that, the remaining gain is taxed at the rate of 28 \npercent. So excluding half the gain from tax, and taking the other half \nat 28 percent, you end up at 14 percent. However, regular capital gains \nare currently taxed at 15 percent, so you can see section 1202, which \nwas intended to encourage investment in small business corporations is \nnot very effective.\n  A tax rate of 14 percent, pretty simply, is not much better than 15 \npercent and, consequently, does not do much good. It is actually even a \nworse situation in that that portion of excluded gain is subject to the \nalternative minimum income tax. Therefore, this bill should go further \nthan it does.\n  Now, obviously, the underlying piece of legislation tries to address \nthe small business investment but not the way President Obama \nsuggested. So I am back to where President Obama was. This bill should \nbe amended, and I have an amendment that would do three different \nthings:\n  First, it would increase the section 1202 exclusion to 100 percent of \nthe gain realized upon the sale of qualifying small business stock, \ninstead of the 75-percent exclusion included in the underlying bill; \nsecond, it would make the section 1202 gain not subject to the \nalternative minimum tax; and, third, it would increase from $50 million \nto $75 million the amount of aggregate gross asset the corporation \ncould have and still qualify as a qualified small business corporation. \nAgain, this amendment would implement President Obama's campaign \nproposal to eliminate capital gains tax on sale of stocks in small \nbusinesses and startups.\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\n  Would you please note the President's campaign proposal was not \nmerely to bring down the capital gains rate on small business to 7 \npercent, as the stimulus bill now written would provide but, very \nimportantly, eliminate capital gains for the sale of stock of small \nbusinesses and startup corporations.\n  If you wonder why the President's as well as my emphasis upon small \nbusiness investment is--you know it better than I do, or as well as I \ndo--70 to 80 percent of the new jobs are created in new business and \nyou realize, in 2007, I believe it was, maybe it was 2006, whenever we \nhad the latest figures, the only net gain in employment in the United \nStates was in small business, while there was probably a downturn in \nbig business at that time.\n  So we ought to move forward. What I would like to have you note is \nthe main policy justification for preferential tax treatment for \ncapital gains is because of the risk inherent in many investments in \ncapital assets that are taxed at ordinary rates would discourage risk-\ntaking, because ordinary tax treatment would take a large share of the \nupside but would not help the taxpayer in the case of the investment \nnot working out, on the downside.\n  To correct this imbalance in our law, capital gains are given \npreferential treatment. I explained to you the importance of giving to \nit small business because they are the employment machine of our free \nmarket economy. This argument concerning risk-taking is especially \nstrong regarding investment in originally issued stock from small \ncorporations such as we are discussing in this legislation, in a little \nsmaller way.\n  With small corporations especially, it is still in startup mode and \nstill raising new capital. The risk of failure is especially high. That \nis even more so, given the fragile nature of today's economy, which \nleads me then to my next two points: I have spoken about the importance \nof the stimulus bill being targeted and temporary; that is, if the word \n``stimulus'' is to have any real meaning, the bill should be targeted \nand temporary.\n  The question is, Is this provision--I suppose you could raise it \nabout the provision in the bill, which is a smaller version of what \nPresident Obama recommended. Is this provision concerning elimination \nof capital gains tax on the sale of small business corporation stock \ntargeted and temporary?\n  Well, you know the answer is obviously yes on targeted. The provision \nis targeted with where relief is needed. One thing all of us heard over \nand over again is capital markets are one, frozen; two, people are not \nloaning money; and, three, they are not investing money in anything \nvery risky, but rather than simply putting their money in Treasury \nbills or cash, very safe, risk-free places. So small businesses are \nstarved for the capital needed to invest, and they need to invest in \nnew capital, new equipment, and new employees.\n  What will it take to encourage people to invest new equity in small \ncorporations? Well, I believe this provision will help by giving \nfavorable tax treatment for such investment. Note that the favorable \ntax treatment described in this amendment will not be extended to the \npurchase of small business corporate stock on the secondary market. If \nan individual buys already-issued small business corporate stock from \nanother individual, this does not get the new capital to the small \nbusiness itself; rather, the favorable tax treatment described in this \nbill would only be for originally issued stock of corporations issued \nafter the date of enactment of this legislation.\n  Why only for originally issued stock? Because that is the stock \nissued for direct capital injections from the investor into the \ncorporation. By targeting this amendment in such originally issued \nstock, this will result in new capital investment in small business \ncorporations where jobs are created in America.\n  Now, targeted, yes; temporary, yes. So the provision must be \ntemporary under this legislation. This provision would only apply to \nthe purchase of originally issued stock after the date of enactment, \n2009 through January 1 of 2011. Of course, all of us hope our current \neconomic problems will have eased by that date, 2011. Thus, to make \nsure this provision is targeted during the time it is needed most, it \nis targeted for the remainder of this year and next year.\n  According to the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, this \nprovision has a 10-year cost of $1.5 billion. You can surely see that \nwith the job creation machine small business brings about, this is a \ngood investment. Please do not count on me to say this again, but I \nhave the audacity to hope that this proposal will attract large \nbipartisan support, this proposal of the President is actually change \nwe can believe in. I encourage support for that provision.\n  Going to another issue, a large portion of this bill is devoted to \nhealth care, so also I will bring up that. In the Senate, we are giving \nStates more money for Medicaid; giving subsidies so people who lost \ntheir jobs can pay for health insurance and throw billions of dollars \nat pet projects related to health care.\n  Over in the House, they are going even further. They are expanding \nwho is eligible for Medicaid, letting people stay on their employer's \nhealth plan for up to 35 years after they are fired and ultimately have \nthe taxpayers foot that part of the bill.\n  Last week the Wall Street Journal summed up these reforms with an op-\ned entitled, ``Democratic Stealth Care.'' Under the title, the article \nquotes:\n\n       With the Nation preoccupied by financial crisis, Democrats \n     have been quietly working to nationalize health care.\n\n  Now, some may think this is just a conspiracy theory, but between the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program last week and now the stimulus this \nweek, I begin to wonder.\n  The Government-run Children's Health Insurance Program alone is going \nto cause 2.4 million people to drop out of the private market, the \nprivate market where people already have health insurance and where \nthey are already paying for it, and join the taxpayer-funded program \nand that probably the additional kids who need to be in that program \nwill not be in it.\n\n  Now this is a big victory for the people who want the Government to \nchange over our health care system. But they are not going to stop \nthere. Some say Medicaid spending in this stimulus bill is meant to \nhelp States get people already enrolled. Well, who is going to argue \nwith that? But I think you have to look at it beyond that.\n  If you just wanted to shore up existing Medicaid programs, why does \nthis bill provide billions more than what the Congressional Budget \nOffice says States will actually need to meet that responsibility? When \nwe marked up this bill in the Finance Committee, I said: Anything in \nthis stimulus package should meet the three Ts test that we hear: \ntimely, targeted, and temporary.\n  But that also applies to these health provisions. Well, I do not see \nhow giving States billions more for Medicaid dollars than they need so \nthey can add more people to the program we already cannot afford meets \nany of these tests. I am not saying that about people who are \nunemployed and would otherwise qualify, I am talking about beyond that. \nIt also is not very targeted to give the same CEOs who got $18 billion \nin bonuses last week a Government handout to buy health insurance. But \nunder this bill, you can get a subsidy to pay for health insurance \nregardless of how much you make.\n  The budget deficit for this year is already targeted and projected to \nbe over $1 trillion. After the stimulus bill and other legislation, the \ndeficit is going to grow to over $2 trillion. It is critical that we \nmust be fiscally responsible with these taxpayers' dollars. I do not \nsee how giving a millionaire, who maybe got fired from a corporation, \nmoney to buy insurance is fiscally responsible. But this legislation \nallows that because there is not an income cap for getting on Medicaid.\n  The Wall Street Journal article I mentioned goes on to say: ``In this \nnew health care nirvana, even the rich are welcome.''\n  It also says that: If you add it all up, ``the Democrats may move ten \nmillion more people under the Federal health umbrella in just 4 \nweeks.''\n  This certainly sounds, of course, like a big step toward too much \nGovernment-run health care for this Senator. I thought Republicans and \nDemocrats were going to work together on our reform of our health care \nsystem. Well, I\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nmust have missed some memo along that line because it looks like this \nbill is taking steps a lot further with things that are normally in a \nhealth care reform package.\n  Quite frankly, we do have a bipartisan process going on that I am a \npart of. I am glad to be a part of it. But some of those moves make me \nsomewhat cynical.\n  On another point, something in this stimulus package appropriates \nmoney for the National Science Foundation. I wish to speak about an \nissue there. Not that they should not have the money, but we have to \nchange things at the National Science Foundation if that money is going \nto be spent wisely. Last week, I sent a letter to the National Science \nFoundation asking about the inspector general's semiannual report. The \nIG found extensive use of National Science Foundation computers to view \nsexually explicit material.\n  A particularly severe incident described in the semiannual report \ninvolved a manager at the National Science Foundation spending, would \nyou believe it, up to 20 percent of his official worktime viewing \npornography, over a 2-year period of time, at a cost to taxpayers, us, \njust for his salary of $58,000. Now, he is no longer there. But there \nis a culture hit there that encourages this sort of thing. The IG \nestimated that, obviously, that is a waste of taxpayer money and spoke \nabout that.\n\n  As my investigators began digging around the National Science \nFoundation, they found that pornography is not necessarily the main \nproblem. It is only a sign that the National Science Foundation has not \nbeen subjected to too much scrutiny over the years. We are going to put \na damper on that misuse of taxpayer money, because I have some very \npowerful cosponsors of my amendments in Senator Mikulski and Senator \nShelby, who are the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that oversees the National Science Foundation budget. They \nare also involved with the extra money for the National Science \nFoundation in this stimulus bill.\n  To make sure the National Science Foundation gets a very clear \nmessage that Congress is serious about ensuring accountability of \ntaxpayers' money, this amendment freezes $3 million of the additional \nbillions of dollars going to NSF for a short period in the money that \nis going as operating funds directly to the Office of Director of the \nNational Science Foundation. This money will become available when the \nNational Science Foundation Director does what he is supposed to be \ndoing. If he had been doing that, we wouldn't have these problems we \nare trying to fix.\n  The tasks are, No. 1, the National Science Foundation Director needs \nto submit a report to Congress detailing the steps the National Science \nFoundation has taken to remove pornography from the foundation \ncomputers. By the way, this report is only based upon one server. I \ndon't know how many servers they have, but they have, obviously, more \nthan one that needs to be gone through. The inspector general found \nproblems after searching that one and believes there is a more \nextensive problem.\n  No. 2, the National Science Foundation Director submits a report to \nCongress detailing an appropriate response of the National Science \nFoundation IG semiannual report where all this information came from. \nThis will include actions taken to stop people watching pornography \nwhile on the job at the National Science Foundation.\n  No. 3, the National Science Board needs to hire an independent \ngeneral counsel. The board is supposed to provide oversight over the \nNational Science Foundation, but they have been relying on the National \nScience Foundation's own attorney for legal advice. This is pretty \nsilly and raises concerns about the independence of the National \nScience Foundation's own attorney. So we are going to want them to have \nsomebody more independent.\n  I am certain this will not fix all of the problems at NSF, but with \nthe help of Senators Mikulski and Shelby, we are on a road to making \nthis organization more accountable to the taxpayers. We will have a lot \nmore work to do at the agency, but I am happy that Senator Mikulski is \nin position there.\n  In the $800 billion bill we have before us, it calls for more \ncongressional oversight. I know most everybody knows that. But I want \nto point out some problems we have to take care of to make sure all \nMembers of Congress are able to do congressional oversight with an \namendment simply ensuring that we in Congress can keep a watchful eye \non the extraordinary amounts of money being spent in the stimulus bill \nover the next 2 years. We need this oversight. Over the years, under \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations, I have taken on the \nresponsibility of asking a lot of the tough questions of the executive \nbranch, regardless of whether the President was of my party or the \nother. Day in and day out, many Members of Congress--this one \nincluded--write letters asking questions about how laws we pass are \nbeing carried out. We ask about allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse \nthat come to our offices on a regular basis. In order to get to the \nbottom of these allegations and truly understand how executive branches \nunder both Republicans and Democrats are conducting the people's \nbusiness, it is not enough to rely upon assurances from bureaucrats \nthat there is nothing to worry about.\n  We need access to documents, records generated by the agencies that \nwe are trying to oversee. We need to access those records in order to \nact as a constitutional check on the executive branch to verify that \nwhat they are telling us is more than just spin. Documents and records \ncreated at taxpayer expense ought to be available to their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress. It is that simple. It is fundamental to \nour constitutional system of checks and balances. Too often, however, \nunelected bureaucrats, sometimes political appointees, misinterpret the \nlaw and deny congressional requests for information without any \nlegitimate legal reason for doing so.\n  My amendment would take away those bogus legal arguments by making \nthe will of this body crystal clear. If an agency gets money under this \nbill and if the agency gets a request for records from the chair or \nranking member of congressional committees, the agency must provide \nthose records. A vote for this amendment is a vote to make sure that \nCongress has the information it needs to do its duty under the \nConstitution. We cannot act as a check and a balance if we allow \nourselves to be kept in the dark about what is going on in the \nexecutive branch, particularly when we are appropriating almost $800 \nbillion over the next 2 years as a stimulus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the time be extended \nuntil 3:30, but it already has been. By what mechanism, I know not, but \nit doesn't make any difference. That is why the Senator from Iowa was \nable to continue.\n  Since it is now 7 of and Senator Nelson and I both wish to speak, I \nask unanimous consent that the time for debate be extended until 3:30, \nwith the time equally divided between the leaders or their designees \nunder the same provisions of the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, most of the Senators know how \nmuch I love the Senate and how I love individual Senators who are quite \nextraordinary individuals. It is because of that love that I have \nconcern we continue to see excessive partisanship in the Senate, what \nis described as the most deliberative body in the world. This is not to \nsay that because we are the most deliberative body, we should not have \nour political fights and sharply disagree. But when crisis faces the \nNation, it seems to this Senator there ought to be a focus on finding \ncommon ground instead of that which separates us.\n  I want to give two examples of where I thought it was a very fine \nhour that the Nation found common ground in a bipartisan way. The first \nwas when I had the privilege of serving in the House of Representatives \nin 1983. Social Security was facing a financial default within a 6-\nmonth period. Two old Irishmen, who would fight every day but at the \nend of the day could walk through the door as personal friends and had \na personal relationship so that\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\nthey could get things done, those two old Irishmen--one being the \nPresident of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and the other one being \nthe Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill--realized that if we were going \nto solve the potential default of the Social Security system, we had to \ncome together in a bipartisan way. Indeed, they said: We are going to \ntake this third rail of American politics off the table at the next \nelection. It will not be an election issue. We are going to solve it. \nWe are going to use the mechanism of a bipartisan commission to come \nand bring a solution.\n  That is exactly what happened. The solution was brought by the \ncommission. The Congress passed it overwhelmingly. There had to be give \nand take and shared pain by all different sectors. It was not used as a \npolitical weapon in the next election. Social Security was made \nactuarially sound for the next 75 years. That is one example.\n\n  Another example of unity in a bipartisan way was in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11, 2001. Of course, I will never forget in that day that we \nhad dispersed to all parts of Washington, because we had to flee the \nCapitol when we thought the fourth airplane was in-bound to destroy \nthis magnificent symbol of America, later that day, into the evening, \nMembers of Congress, the House and the Senate, spontaneously gathered \non the center steps of the east side of the Capitol and broke out \nspontaneously singing ``God Bless America'' in a show of unity.\n  I will never forget the weekly caucuses that we separate here, where \nthe Democrats meet in one place and the Republicans meet in another \nplace, there was a joint caucus bringing about unity in the aftermath \nof crisis.\n  It occasions this Senator to wonder, where is that unity in this \ncrisis? Do we not think this crisis is of sufficient magnitude that we \nought to be coming together? We say we have a bipartisan solution, but \nit takes all 58 Democratic Senators, plus three Republican Senators to \nget over the 60-vote threshold mark in order to pass this legislation \non next Monday and Tuesday. That is technically bipartisan, but it is \nnot really. Is this crisis not of sufficient magnitude?\n  Look back last fall. After the defaults of a number of major \nfinancial institutions and suddenly Lehman having a financial hole so \nbig that regulators decided they had to let it go, the confidence went \ncompletely out of the system. In a rushed manner, we passed the \nTroubled Assets Relief Program, with the acronym TARP. It injected \ncapital in the system. None of us is happy as to how we have seen the \nfirst segment of $350 billion spent. But at least it put funds in to \ninject some confidence that the Federal Government was going to stand \nbehind the banking system and not let it go down the tubes. So we \nstarted working our way through that.\n  Look at it from the standpoint of bankers. They need capital. They \nneed investment. We are seeing that the Secretary of the Treasury is \ngoing to come out next Monday with a proposal that is going to inject \nnew capital by, this time, instead guaranteeing those troubled assets, \nthe Federal Government. This is a role for government, in that the \nFederal Government, in addition, is going to put money so that loans \ncan be made for students, for small business, to pay off credit card \ndebt, and to go out and buy automobiles. That is necessary. Banks need \nto make loans, but they can't if people make a run on their bank and \nstart pulling out their assets. Thus, the need for more confidence \ninjected into the system. That is what we are trying to do with TARP \nand now this fiscal stimulus plan.\n  This plan: 42 percent of the stimulus is coming from tax cuts; 58 \npercent is coming from fiscal stimulus by additional spending. In order \nto get three Republican votes to get us over the 60-vote threshold, \n$110 billion was cut; $25 billion off of the tax cuts and $85 billion \noff of the spending, with a $110 billion reduction of the overall \nstimulus plan. Yet we still do not have unity.\n  I cannot understand why, when the Senator from Georgia, who is my \ndear friend, and I think one of the most effective Members of the \nSenate, passes what is a very attractive amendment, upping a $15,000 \ntax credit for the purchase of a home, the total of which, the pricetag \nfor that tax credit is approximately $35 billion--and I am told the \nSenator from Georgia, with that provision in the bill, is not going to \nsupport it on final passage or on the motion for cloture, which we have \nto have to cut off debate to get to the bill.\n  Where is the unity and where is the bipartisanship? We masquerade as \nbipartisans, and yet this lingering insidious attempt to always divide \ninstead of reconcile still hangs over the Capitol of the United States \nof America. It would be certainly this Senator's hope that as we get on \ndown the line, and it goes into a conference committee to iron out the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate, that maybe there will be \nmore Senators who can come together and say at this critical time in \nour country, when the financial institutions were about to go under, \nwith a complete economic cardiac arrest on the horizon, we could reach \nout and, as the Good Book says: reason together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD, Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate considered an \namendment offered by Senator Coburn that would prohibit stimulus funds \nfrom being directed to institutions of cultural merit in communities \nthroughout the country.\n  As well intentioned as Senator Coburn's amendment may be, it is \nmisguided. Among the many institutions that would be prohibited from \nreceiving stimulus funding under the Coburn amendment are museums, \ntheaters, art centers, zoos, aquariums, and community parks. And while \nthe amendment would correctly prohibit funding for casinos and golf \ncourses, I question the judgment of grouping institutions of \nsignificant cultural merit, such as museums, with these other \nsuperfluous uses. I also question the notion that Washington knows \nbetter than the communities and States themselves which projects will \nstimulate their local economies and preserve jobs and which will not.\n  In 1935, President Franklin Roosevelt put millions of people back to \nwork through the Works Progress Administration. Job creation was not \nlimited to only public works and housing, but also included efforts to \nstrengthen art and culture. The Federal Art Project, Writers Project, \nand Theater Project provided jobs to thousands of the unemployed. \nPresident Roosevelt understood the benefit in investing in America's \ninfrastructure and the long-term economic value in fostering the \nNation's cultural development.\n  Educational and cultural institutions are the economic anchor in many \ncommunities. In Connecticut, cultural institutions contribute \napproximately $9 billion annually to the State's economy and support \nroughly 110,000 jobs. These institutes of learning bring educational \nprogramming to schools in surrounding communities. These institutions \nare employers. They stimulate the local economy and bring patrons to \nsmall businesses and revenue to our communities and States.\n  Our museums, theaters, art centers, zoos, and aquariums are not \noutcasts. These institutions are members of our communities that have \nbeen hard hit by the economic downturn. While facing understandably \nreduced attendance during times of economic crisis, they have also \nsuffered from reduced charitable giving and slashed local and State \naid.\n  The crisis can be seen throughout Connecticut. In June, the Mark \nTwain House and Museum, a National Historic Landmark, was almost forced \nto close its doors. In November, the Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk \nannounced layoffs because of an unsteady economy and declining \nattendance. In December, Mystic Seaport faced a similar situation and \nwas forced to eliminate 23 full-time positions. And just this week, the \nConnecticut Opera, which is the sixth-oldest continuously performing \nopera company in the country, was forced to halt operations. These \nstories are not unique to my home State--they are being echoed \nthroughout the country.\n  Yesterday's New York Times featured a cover story on the successes \nand failures of Japan's actions to stimulate the economy in the early \n1990s. Dr. Ihori of the University of Tokyo determined, ``decisions on \nhow to spend money were made behind closed doors by bureaucrats, \npoliticians and the construction industry, and often reflected \npolitical considerations more than economic.''\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\n  Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator Coburn is just that--\na decision more reflective of political considerations than economic. \nThe amendment will unfairly tie the hands of our governors and local \nofficials who know best what will stabilize and stimulate their local \neconomies in order to retain badly needed jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I wish to clear up a couple of quick points. I think I \nwill be the last speaker from our side, and I am not sure about the \nother side. But we have until 3:30, and I will not speak that long.\n  I think it is important to point out a couple things.\n  No. 1, the point has been made that we rushed this thing and we are \njamming it down the throats of people. Well, first of all, if we are \ndoing that, we are not doing it in quite as numerically an advantageous \nway as we should.\n  Secondly, I think two of the most important committees that handle \nthis whole matter--the Finance Committee and the Appropriations \nCommittee--have been through full markup, have had hearings on this. I \nremember our markup in the Senate Finance Committee lasted 12 \nconsecutive hours on our section of this bill. So it has been very well \nthought through. It has been very well debated. Amendments have been \nraised. Amendments have been rejected. We had 45 votes on the floor \nabout this. They have been debated back and forth. They have been \ndiscussed. It is not clear to me if we did this for another week that \nwe would be any wiser or we would have any crisper or more targeted \nbill than we have today.\n  The second point I wish to make is, when it is pointed out that as a \npercentage of total spending State spending is doubled, tripled, and \nall the rest of this--as if the States have been acting in some kind of \nvery irresponsible fashion--I was a Governor. And Governors are capable \nof doing that from time to time. But I want to point out that as a \npercentage of total spending, State spending has not increased at a \ngreater rate than any other of the sectors in our economy. It is just \nthat the price of health care and the price of everything else--\ninflation, all of it--has caused that. So people can say it is a $1.2 \ntrillion bill, but that does not take into account all the reasons I \nhave enumerated.\n  There are a lot of costs that are going to go up, and that is why at \nthe end of a period of time it may be that, but we are not voting on \nsomething which is 5 years in the future or 8 years in the future. We \nare voting on something which has to take effect right now.\n  That brings me to what I want to say, and that is two points. We have \nwandered, it seems to me, a bit in this debate away from the people who \nI think haunt us in their tragedy. I regret that. People have talked \nabout individual amendments they want to get. There is an enormous--42 \npercent of it is in tax cuts. That is probably more than most Democrats \nwould do. But, on the other hand, the tax cuts tend to be more toward \nthe middle class and small business, which is what the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee wants. He wants more, and I understand that. \nBut we all want more or less of something. But what we do not want is \nfor the American people to suffer, as they are now suffering. That is \nthe only reason we are here. It is the only reason we are here.\n  This is only the beginning. We have at least two other major bills we \nare going to have that are going to require a lot of money that we are \ngoing to have to deal with. This is the first one. This is our first \ntest. I think it is extraordinary, the point the Senator from Florida \nmade, and others have made, that it took three Republicans and one \nDemocrat to come together in essence to put forward a bill which I \nthink is going to end up passing if we can work out our differences \nwith the House in conference, which I think we will be able to do.\n  Now, why do I say this? I say this because we have no choice but to \ncome to the aid of the American people. I am not saying that Government \nspending is the answer to everything, as I am not saying that tax cuts \nare also the answer to everything. And incentives are good. The tax \ncuts over the last 8 years, which went to primarily people who did not \nneed those tax cuts--I do not think that ended up in more jobs. It may \nhave ended up in more money and, therefore, more income tax revenue for \nthe Government, but it was not stimulative in the way we are trying to \ndo today.\n  So we want jobs. We want road construction. We want education. We \nhave had to cut--I have my list of tragedy here of all of the programs \nwe have had to cut in order to meet the needs of the more moderate \nbill, the $780 billion bill. I look down at this list, and I look at so \nmany programs that I think need to be increased. But then I stop and I \nthink: Well, they are being increased. They are not being increased by \nas much as the Democrats, as a main, wanted, and so we call them what \nis stated here: ``Quick Review of Cuts Made.'' That is not cuts made to \nthe program from where they are now. That is cuts made to where we \nwanted to put them.\n  Why did we want to put them there? Because that would help stimulate \nthe economy and to bring more jobs to our people. You cannot make light \nof this. You cannot talk about this without talking about what is \nhappening to American families. You cannot do that. I come from a State \nwhich is not wealthy but which is full of incredibly hard-working \npeople, incredibly hard-working people who have been working hard all \ntheir lives to stay afloat because that is the nature of our State and \nit is the nature of our topography, it is the nature of the resources \nwe have and the way they have been handled. So, yes, I battle for them \nand, on the other hand, I also have to battle for the entire Nation \nthrough this program because we all live or die together.\n  Part of this is in the mind. People have to have confidence that the \nSenate has passed a bill and that we are moving in the right direction. \nIt is not a question just of supporting a President from a Senator from \nthis side of the aisle who happens to be a Democrat. It is a question \nof doing the right thing by the American people. And if it takes as \nmany billions of dollars--$780 billion--to do that, then I say we have \nto do it. We have no choice.\n  Sometimes I have the feeling from the other side that what they want \nto do is adjust a number of amendments to increase the number of tax \ncuts, but that the plight of the American people is talked about, is \nused in not rhetoric but in their words, and used stirringly, but their \nreal thinking is not there, it is in getting more to the way the other \nparty has chosen to see progress hopefully happen in this country, and \nthat is through tax cuts.\n  I cannot help but reiterate what has been said; that is, when \nPresident Clinton left office, he left a $5.6 trillion surplus. To some \ndegree, I criticized him for something he actually could not have done \nbut he could have done morally, and that is to go to the Congress, call \na special session or whatever, and say: We have $5.6 trillion. We also \nhave a whole world to confront, wars to fight, an entire Nation to \nrebuild--which was going to be my second point--and we can start right \nnow doing that. That was while the economy was still prosperous. He was \nstill President.\n  Then we entered into this massive period of borrowing for wars, which \nthe intelligence showed was not right in this Senator's judgment. And \nnow we are in Afghanistan and now we are in Pakistan, and who knows \nwhere it will stop. Well, al-Qaida is in 50 or 60 other countries, so \nit may not stop for quite a while.\n  I will say to the Presiding Officer, I can remember when I was a \nPeace Corps volunteer in the Philippines. I suspect the Presiding \nOfficer had not been born yet. I was in the southern part of Mindanao \nin the city called Zamboanga City. It is the headquarters of Abu \nSayyaf, who is the al-Qaida leader for Southeast Asia, and all of the \nsame kind of slaughtering and mass killing between ethnic groups or \nreligious groups was taking place then.\n  It is taking place all over the world--has been for centuries. You \ncan go back to the English kings and the way they tortured people. What \nwe do in this country is not something we can always be proud of. So it \nis the nature of people to fight.\n  The whole question of the war on terror, on one hand, trying to \ncontrol\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\nthat, but then, on the other hand, how do we mitigate the need for it, \ngets into questions of something that nobody wants to talk \nabout. Nobody ever has wanted to talk about it, and that is substantial \namounts of foreign aid, to give people in other countries a feeling \nthat we care about more than just killing high-value targets or \nGuantanamo or whatever, but we care about their lives.\n\n  First, we have to start by showing the American people that we care \nabout their lives. That is why we are here. This is the first of three \nbills. This bill has to pass. This bill is a good bill. It is not the \nbill I would have written. There are cuts made which are very painful \nto me in terms of not just my State objective, but also my \nresponsibilities in the Senate over the Commerce Committee and then \nover the Intelligence Committee. But we have to do that. We have to do \nthat. We have to do that because people are suffering. When people are \nsuffering, they turn to their ministers for a while, but essentially \nthey know it is only the government that can come in, in emergencies, \nin critical situations, in desperate situations, and infuse money in \ncertain areas which will create jobs.\n  Now, the President has been very clear that some of these jobs will \ncome more quickly, saying a lot of them will--and a lot of the tax cuts \nwill become available by September of next year. That is some time. A \nlot of them before that. Some of the jobs would not take place right \naway because you can't suddenly build a bridge. You have to have your \nplans, they all have to work, and it takes time. But we have to do \nthat. We have to do that. We have to put people back to work. People \nwithout work who can work and who have families to support have no \nreason to have hope. If they give up hope, then they become part of not \njust people who are unemployed but people who have given up on \nemployment, and they don't show up in the unemployment figures. They \nare called the people who have given up.\n  My own feeling is the unemployment rate is probably closer to 13 or \n14 percent in this country right now. A lot of people have just lost \nall hope. They are the same people, they have the same values, the same \nfamilies as others do.\n  So I hope we can pass this bill. I hope this is not a matter of \nanytime the Government intervenes, it wastes money. When the Government \nintervenes, sometimes, yes, it does. When Wall Street gives out bonuses \nand takes trips to spas and things of that sort, I call that wasting \nmoney, and I think we are paying attention to that. So it is part of \nhuman nature. Yet I think we are going to have an enormous effort on \noversight of this program. I know the President is, I know the Congress \nwill, so that as little money as possible will be wasted and people \nwill get back to work.\n  Work is what people want to do. Work is what gives people dignity. I \nremember that from my early days in West Virginia when I went to a \nplace where nobody had work and they couldn't hold their heads up high. \nSometimes even people I love and who changed my life, who were what I \ncall my secular rebirth in life, sometimes the men, when we had \ncommunity meetings, would squat on their haunches and face away from \nthe meeting. Psychologically, they were saying: I don't really believe \nwhat is going to come out of this is going to help me. I am here \nbecause you asked me to come, but I am not really here because I don't \nhave faith.\n  We have to restore that faith, and we do that by giving people a \nsense that things are on the move, that things are going to get better, \nthat bills pass as opposed to fail.\n  I don't want to see a bill which is mostly passed by Democratic votes \nand with a very few Republican votes. I don't want to see that. I will \ntake it because it will get the program under way, but it is not the \nway it should be. Senator Nelson is correct. This looming partisanship \nis still a part of our problem in the Senate. The discipline of the \nparty on the other side is usually a bit better than the party on my \nside, so they can be very effective in slowing things down, as I think \nwe have seen.\n  The last point I wish to make is, this is not just a matter of \nhelping people in desperate need and helping them as quickly as \npossible. Nonaction is not an option. Standing by and watching is not \nan option. It doesn't do any good for anybody to vote against this \nbill, even if it isn't what they want, because it will create activity. \nIt will create confidence. It will create momentum.\n  The final point I wish to make is, it will create something more. We \nneed in this country--and we have needed it for a long time, and it is \nwhy I wish President Clinton had taken that $5.6 trillion, pulled us \nall together and said, OK, we are going to spend 4 trillion of these \ndollars on re-creating America, re-creating schools, re-creating higher \neducation, science and technology, re-creating a sense of fairness. \nYes, arts, yes--not just $20 million contracts for athletes but people \nwho add to the luster of our Nation. We have a long way to go. We don't \nhave an air traffic control system which is digitalized. Mongolia is \nbuilding them. We are behind Mongolia. Every other industrial country \nin the world has an air traffic control system which is digitalized and \noperates off a GPS system. Therefore, we have 33 percent more air \ntraffic congestion than we need, and danger is increased. So we have to \nrebuild an entire Nation: elementary schools, secondary schools, high \nschools, colleges, postgraduate. We have to attract scholars into the \nareas where we need innovation. There is nothing like innovation. \nSenator Nelson knows this better than anybody because of what happens \nat NASA, but we need it.\n  We need people who want to serve in government. We want people to go \ninto public service. If I had my way, I think I would probably get \nquite a few cosponsors who would say we ought to have a bill that \nrequires every single American to take a period of 2 years out of their \nlife and commit it to public service, community service. They could go \ninto the military. They could go into teaching. They could go into \nnursing homes, home care, research, whatever, but 2 years out of their \ntrack so they could look at themselves and their country, so they \nwouldn't just be doing the same thing every day.\n  I was lucky to have that experience twice in my life, and it has made \nme a better person. I think it is the way you bring America together \nagain so that you have everybody in the trenches together. Everyone is \nequal. The rich don't get a break; the poor don't get help. If they \ncan't afford not to do this without help, then they get help. That \nwould be expensive, but I think it is something this Nation needs in \norder to heal itself.\n  So let me end by saying we have absolutely no excuse whatsoever for \nnot passing this bill or what comes out of the conference. We have no \nexcuse. It would be a shame and an act of cruelty to do that to the \nAmerican people who are now suffering. In the process of so doing, and \nof helping them, and of giving them some sense of hope about their own \nlives which, let's face it, is very important in how hard people choose \nto try and fight, participate in community affairs, and do all kinds of \nthings. But we need to rebuild our Nation. If this crisis had never \nhappened, I would be giving the second half of my speech. We have to \nrebuild the Nation, Mr. President, because we have let it slide over \nthe last 50 years. Infrastructure is the most obvious example. I can \nname so many other areas. Broadband gets cut. That hurts me because \nthat is the way people can achieve much faster communication, through \nthe Internet. Long distance learning has been cut. It is still much \nmore than it is now, but it has been cut from the original Democratic \nbill. That is the way people in a poor county in southern West Virginia \nlearn Japanese from the University of Nebraska because they can do it \nonline and then remake their careers and give themselves hope.\n  So I hope we will be large in our thinking, small in our politics, \nand generous and encouraging to the American people by passing the bill \nbefore us.\n  I thank the Chair and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/07/senate-section/article/S1906-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have worked very hard this week. It is \nnot often the Senate is in session this time of night on a Saturday or \nthis time of night most any time, but we have had a long hard week and \nspent many hours trying to come up with an answer to America's \nfinancial troubles.\n  Yesterday at 5 or 6 o'clock, we reached an agreement with a few of \nthe Republicans to come up with a nice piece of legislation that will \nmeet President Obama's request for resources in different areas that \nwill help our economy. The main direction is tax cuts. People are \nneedful of money. That money will be spent. And about 58 percent of it \nis job creating.\n  Why are we here tonight if the agreement was basically reached \nyesterday? It is because we have a bill that is about 800 pages long. \nThis product we have produced is about $800 billion. We put it together \nyesterday starting about 4:30 p.m. Everything has to be right. We don't \nwant a problem, anyone raising an issue that one of the numbers is \nwrong or one of the lines is not where it should be. So for the last \n35, 40 hours, people have been working nonstop to get a product so we \ncould lay down the amendment, and that should be done in the next half \nhour or so. But people have literally worked all night.\n  Mr. President, you and I are out here. We are two of the one hundred. \nThey can recognize us. They have little pictures. They can see us. The \npeople who are making this product we can lay down are people you do \nnot see very much. The enrolling clerks, you don't see them very much. \nThey are in the bowels of the Senate someplace putting this together \nhours and hours at a time, being aided and assisted by other members of \nthis wonderful staff we have.\n  The line down the middle of this aisle is what divides Democrats and \nRepublicans, and tradition has it that the Republican staff is with the \nRepublican Senators. But the problems we face with this deep recession \nwe are in have nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans. It has \neverything to do with economic travails of the American people.\n  So those few people who are watching this proceeding on television or \nare in the galleries tonight are seeing a situation where there is not \na lot of floor activity. But today, as every day when we are in \nsession, so much of the work is done that is not in the camera lights. \nAn extraordinary group of public servants is here to assigned \npositions. They do it with a smile. They treat the public and us so \nwell. It is difficult to describe what a wonderful job they do.\n  Anyone out there listening to these proceedings or watching these \nproceedings should know we have police officers who are guarding the \nCapitol. That is something that has not always been. As a young man, I \nwas here. I worked this shift 6 days a week as a police officer and \nwent to school in the daytime. In those days, as a police officer, we \ndidn't have much to worry about. We had to make sure traffic on \nConstitution Avenue and Independence Avenue moved OK, but that was \nabout it. But now the police officers are the best trained police \nofficers in the world, a force of almost 2,000 watching and protecting \nthis Capitol, not only all the people who work within these buildings \nbut also the millions of tourists who come here every year. We have \nevil people around the world who every day are trying to figure out \nways to violate the Capitol, and we have these brave men and women \nprotecting us.\n  We have doorkeepers who make sure people who come into this Chamber \nare qualified and have the right credentials to do that. We have all \nthe people in here--Chamber attendants, Parliamentarians. We have \nJournal clerks, legislative clerks, enrolling clerks, bill clerks, and \nfloor staff on whom we depend. If the Presiding Officer is not \npresiding but is out here and has a question about something, most of \nthem don't come to me, they come to the staff, each one of whom is so \nqualified and competent to answer questions about Senate procedure that \nSenators depend on them a great deal.\n  All the people I mentioned, and certainly a lot of others, are public \nservants in the true nature of that word. They serve all Members of the \nSenate. They get little, if any, recognition for what they do.\n  One of the groups I didn't mention at all is the valuable staff we \nhave in the cloakrooms. There is a cloakroom to my right consisting of \nthe Republican staff and to the back of me is the Democratic cloakroom. \nThey are never seen. They are back in the cloakrooms. Every day we are \nin session, they come in about an hour before we start. They are here \nlong after we leave, as are the people I mentioned. We depend on them, \nwhen there is a phone call, to look for us. Of course, they do that. \nThey run through there, walk through there, find a page, bring a \nmessage to us. They do so many things that are invaluable to our being \nable to work here.\n  I extend to everyone I mentioned the appreciation of all Senators. We \nrecognize that without any one of the groups I mentioned, any one of \nthe attendants I have mentioned, if they are not here on a given day, \nwe don't do very well. It is a team effort, and the example they set \nshould be recognized.\n  Democratic and Republican staffs don't argue and fight. They get \nalong very well. They have a product to produce and they do it. I think \nmany times we can learn a lot from them how we can get along and \nproduce more than perhaps what we have.\n  I thank everybody for their service, a job well done, and hopefully \nwithin the next little bit, we will have an 800-page bill in perfect \nform.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant Parliamentarian proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 570\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator has a \nvery busy schedule, and he was unable to take it easy today.\n  I talked earlier about all the people who are helpful to us. Some \npeople I didn't mention who are so vital to us, Mr. President, are the \nParliamentarians. The Senate rules are extremely complex. I know them \npretty well, but I am amateur compared to our Parliamentarians who \ninterpret the precedents and Rules of the Senate and advise the \nPresiding Officer anytime we are in session. Their work is vital to the \nwell-oiled Senate we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/07/senate-section/article/S1989-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
