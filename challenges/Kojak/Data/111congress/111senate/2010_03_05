Mr. President, we had a good, hard week working on this \nlegislation dealing with the tax extenders, expiring provisions--COBRA, \nunemployment compensation, FMAP. So those watching don't think it is \nsome kind of coded message, these are very important provisions. The \ntax extenders are measures that come at the end of the year. Many of \nthem should be extended for much longer than a year, but we are in a \nmode now of paying for things, and as a result, we don't have the money \nto do it for more than a year.\n  The expiring provisions are very important issues. They deal with \nsatellite TV, which is important to about 1.5 million people in \nAmerica. Many in the rural West depend on this.\n  Unemployment compensation--today is a big day in America. Only 36,000 \npeople lost their jobs today, which is really good. The unemployment \nrate around America has not changed. The prognosticators thought it \nwould go up. It has not. So we need to extend it. There are about 15 \nmillion people in America out of work. These extended unemployment \nbenefits will help millions of those people. We were fortunate enough \nearlier this week to get a 30-day extension, so that when we finish \nthis legislation--we should finish it hopefully on Tuesday--we can go \nto conference with the House and quickly work out our differences.\n  In addition to that, we talked about COBRA. That is a provision that \nallows people who are unemployed to buy, at a decent rate, health \ninsurance.\n  There have been some amendments offered to this legislation which \nwill really improve it as we send it to the House. One of the \nprovisions is very important. I met with 12 Governors a few days ago. \nEvery one of them wants us to pass something called FMAP, which is \nmoney States get from the Federal Government to help them with their \nMedicaid programs. Many of the standards they have for Medicaid we set \nback here, so it is only appropriate that we help them with the money \nthat is so important to those States, especially in these trying times. \nThese Governors handed me a letter signed by 48 Governors asking that \nwe extend FMAP. And we would do that. Unemployment compensation and \nCOBRA are for 1 year. FMAP would be for 6 months. It is fungible money. \nThey can use it for things other than Medicaid. We are working to get \nthat done. I hope we can get it done.\n  We have had a good debate this week. We hope to be able to end this \nTuesday. Later today, I will file cloture on the bill. People have had \ntime to offer all the amendments they want. Some amendments, we haven't \nbeen able to vote, and there won't be votes on those.\n\n[[Page S1212]]\n\nRather than have individual cloture on various amendments--we simply \ndon't have time for that--I am going to file cloture on the bill. Those \namendments on which we are having trouble getting votes will likely \nfall, as they are not germane to the subject matter at hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1212-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about the House \nof Representatives yesterday passing our jobs bill. That was very \nimportant. We had a bipartisan jobs bill here. They have already sent \nus a message. We can work on that. Even though there may be people \nobjecting to it, we can do that with one cloture vote. We will do that \nand interrupt the work we are doing when that message gets here. It is \nimportant because even though we have a short-term extension of the \nhighway bill, this would extend it for 1 year, saving 1 million jobs. \nIt is very important.\n  Build America Bonds--the Governors I met with, as I mentioned, a few \ndays ago also really love our Build America Bonds, which is part of the \nAmerican Recovery Act. The money is gone there. We are going to \nreplenish that. This is important to Governors and local officials \nbecause it has done great things for creating jobs.\n  We also have a provision to allow people to be hired by employers if \nthey are out of work for 60 days. They hire them for 30 hours a week. \nThey do not have to pay their FICA tax, and at the end of the year they \nget a $1,000 tax credit. This is going to create thousands and \nthousands of jobs across America.\n  One of the reasons I wanted to mention this specifically, the House \nvoted this bill out yesterday. Virtually every Republican in the House \nvoted against it.\n  I heard interviews on National Public Radio this morning. One \nRepublican Congressman said this bill was so bad because we need small \nbusinesses to be able to write off purchases they make. I suggest to \nthe man--whose name I know, but I will not try to embarrass him here--\nthat he read the bill because if he read the bill he would understand \nthat is one of the paramount provisions we have in this legislation. If \na small business purchases something, they don't have to depreciate it. \nThey can write it off up to $250,000. That is terrific.\n  I had a telephonic conference call late last week explaining it to \nthem. I had quite a few small businesses on the telephone. They love \nthis. They are waiting to buy things. As soon as this is signed into \nlaw, they will run out that day and buy stuff. They need stuff. This \nwill give them an incentive to do so.\n  I suggest to the person, who I guess rushed to the microphones to \ntalk about how bad the bill was, that he should try reading it first. \nMaybe if he did that, he wouldn't be making a fool of himself across \nAmerica by talking about small businesses being able to write things \noff, when that is really in the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1212-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UPCOMING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we finish this legislation, we hope to \nmove to the Federal Aviation Administration legislation. We have had \nall over Capitol Hill--I am sure the Presiding Officer has had people \nfrom Oregon visit with him--people who run airports. They want this FAA \nbill so very much. Why? Because you would have to search hard for an \nairport in America that doesn't already have the design plans ready to \ndo work on that airport. As soon as we pass this FAA bill, there will \nbe lots of jobs. The first year, they estimate that as many as 150,000 \njobs will come from our passing this legislation. There are runways \nthat need to be resurfaced. There are all kinds of terminals that need \nto be built and refurbished. They are waiting to do this. More \nimportantly, it will make American air travel much safer. I won't go \ninto a lot of detail here, but most countries now use global \npositioning systems to determine where their aircraft are. It is \nmodern. That is the way it is. Not in America. We are still using World \nWar II radar. This legislation is very important. We are going to try \nto get to that very quickly.\n  We are going to do the jobs message from the House. We are going to \ndo small business.\n  I had a long conversation with the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nMs. Snowe, who used to be chairman of the Small Business Committee and \nnow is ranking member. We talked at some length. She is anxious, as we \nare, to move to this legislation. As I told her, don't think you are \nalone on this. I get calls from the White House several times a week \nabout moving forward on another small business jobs package other than \nthe one I just discussed.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We are trying to work out our \ndifferences with the House on the health care bill. We will be able to \ndo that. There will be a decision made shortly as to how we will \nproceed on that.\n  I look forward to the week. It is a heavy schedule legislatively, but \nI think we are ready to do that. With all these important matters, it \nis very important that we return here next week with the anticipation \nthat we will do some work to help America.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, it appears we are \nbreaking through and getting more done on a bipartisan basis. I \ncertainly hope that is the case. Simply saying no, as has happened the \nlast year and a half, has accomplished nothing for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1212-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are now on our fifth day of \nconsideration of this important legislation to create jobs and extend \nvital safety net and tax provisions.\n  As a reminder, this legislation would prevent millions of Americans \nfrom falling through the safety net. It would put cash into the hands \nof Americans who would spend it quickly, boosting economic demand. It \nwould extend critical programs and tax incentives that create jobs.\n  We had another productive day on the bill yesterday. We conducted \nthree rollcall votes on amendments. We adopted four amendments. As I \ncount it, there are nine amendments pending.\n\n[[Page S1213]]\n\nThose amendments are the underlying substitute amendment, Senator \nLandrieu's amendment on the Go-Zones, Senator Murray's amendment on \nsummer employment for youth, Senator Coburn's amendment on \ntransparency, Senator Webb's amendment on executive bonuses, a \nFeingold-Coburn amendment to rescind unused transportation earmarks, an \namendment by Senator Reid of Nevada on geothermal receipts, a McCain \namendment on the use of budget reconciliation, and a Lincoln amendment \non emergency disaster assistance.\n  A piece of legislation such as this is like a long-distance run. It \nstarts out with a lot of energy and a lot of activity. After a while it \nreaches its stride, plateaus, and moderates its pace. But then the pace \npicks up again near the finish; that is, if we have much energy left.\n  For this bill, most of the activity is behind us. This bill reached \nits stride. We see the finish line ahead on Tuesday or so, and we \nexpect a final push then.\n  We will work today to clear as many of the pending amendments as we \ncan. If Senators have other noncontroversial amendments, we are happy \nto try to clear those today as well. The Senate will conduct no \nrollcall votes today.\n  The majority leader indicated that we would see a cloture vote on \nthis bill on Tuesday, and we hope to conclude action on this bill on \nTuesday as well.\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I had hoped to call up an \namendment I have. Of course, I would have had to have gotten unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending amendment in order to do that. It is \nmy understanding that we will attempt to do that parliamentary \nprocedure at a later time.\n  What I would like to do at this point is explain the amendment I will \nbe offering. May I proceed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this is an amendment to restore \nsome sanity and common sense to the executive pay practices that have \noutraged all of us that we have seen on Wall Street among the biggest \nfinancial institutions in this country. It is very simple and \nstraightforward.\n  It encourages large banks and financial institutions to adopt widely \naccepted and sound compensation practices. Banks, under this amendment, \nthat would fail to adopt those standards would lose the benefit of \ncertain tax deductions, such as the tax deduction of their executive \ncompensation as a cost of doing business over $1 million per executive. \nIn other words, they could no longer deduct the large compensation \npayments they make to highly paid employees. But we do not limit it to \n$1 million compensation. The bank could pay whatever it wanted. We are \njust going to get some commonsense practices in here.\n  With the status of financial reform legislation uncertain, I believe \nwe are going to have to deal with this issue immediately because of the \nangst in the country. I think all of us have read with astonishment the \nrecent reports that Wall Street banks continue to pay outlandish \nbonuses to the executives who may not be so deserving. Then, just to \nadd insult to injury to the American taxpayer, many of those \ninstitutions are still living on taxpayer-funded life support.\n  In most business professions, pay for executives should chase \nperformance. Managers and executives are rewarded for creating lasting \nvalue to their companies. Unsuccessful managers and executives are \nshown the door. But these basic commonsense principles have been lost \nin these major Wall Street financial institutions that we have seen \nuncovered over the last several months.\n  This year, total Wall Street bonuses exceeded $20 billion. In less \nthan a year and a half after the fall of Lehman Brothers, it is back to \nbusiness as usual for some of our major banks, and that is inexcusable. \nWe have been here before. We had this same debate last spring. Remember \nwhen AIG paid absurd bonuses to financial traders who had managed one \nmajor accomplishment? And what was that accomplishment? They drove \ntheir company into the ground.\n  Although we talked and talked on the floor of the Senate and \nlegislation was introduced, Congress failed to act back then, a year \nago. And here we are again. There is an old saying that comes to mind: \nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n  If we are going to right this financial ship of state, we are going \nto have to tackle all of the flaws in our financial system, and that \nincludes executive pay, and executive pay specifically on Wall Street.\n  There is now almost unanimous recognition that poorly crafted \nexecutive pay practices at major banks and financial institutions \ncontributed to the near collapse of the financial system and the need \nthat we had to step up to that almost caused financial meltdown, the \nneed of a $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout called TARP, Toxic \nAssets Relief Program.\n  Think: Just last week the general counsel of the Federal Reserve \nBoard of Governors testified that the compensation practices in the \nbanking sector were a contributing cause to the crisis. In January, the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, found that ``excessive and \nimprudent risk taking remains a contributing factor in the financial \ninstitution failures and losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund.''\n  The FDIC attributes these continuing failures and losses in part to \nbank compensation practices. Current pay practices encourage this \nexcessive risk taking because short-term gains are heavily rewarded, \neven if they are unsustainable. The negative consequences of severe \nlosses are often externalized and shifted to the shareholders and \nultimately, when we have to bail them out, to the public taxpayers.\n  The Federal safety net for financial institutions encourages traders \nand executives to take unnecessary risk, and the most obvious example \nis the $700 billion Wall Street bailout which I and other Senators \ninitially opposed. Executives who should have been left without their \nshirts instead were left with golden parachutes.\n  Let's take an example. The CEO of Bank of America resigned at the end \nof last year with a $73 million severance package. Bank of America is \none poster child for a poorly managed financial institution. Why? It \nreceived $45 billion in taxpayer funds to avoid insolvency.\n  To put that in perspective, that is almost $150 from every man, \nwoman, and child in this country. It is the equivalent of every \nAmerican writing a check for $150 to Bank of America's management. Once \nthe CEO was basically asked to step down, he walked away with a $73 \nmillion severance package.\n  Did Bank of America respond by ramping up lending to small businesses \nto help get the economy going? That is what we begged them to do. That \nis what we have been begging, through the TARP and the stimulus bill, \nto make programs for loans to small business available. Did Bank of \nAmerica do that? No. But they did manage to find $73 million for their \nCEO's severance package. What we find is that Wall Street all too often \nhas rewarded failure with bloated bonuses and outrageous severance \npackages.\n  If we want to get to real and meaningful financial reform, it is \ngoing to have to include changes in the existing compensation culture \nin the financial industry.\n  I know what the response is going to be: Why should you penalize us? \nIn order to get good executives, we are going to have to pay these big \ncompensation packages.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned, that is fine. But we need to \nmake sure a huge compensation package is tied to performance.\n  The amendment I am offering is going to put an end to the reality \ndisconnect on that street known as Wall Street that has rewarded \nfailure and that emphasizes short-term stock appreciation over long-\nterm growth. This amendment does so by putting some\n\n[[Page S1214]]\n\nbasic and well-accepted principles of sound compensation practices in \nthe Tax Code.\n\n  For example, major banks and financial institutions would only be \nable to deduct their large executive compensation payments if the pay \ncomplies with the rules that focus on rewarding long-term performance. \nThese principles were developed by the Financial Stability Board, the \ncouncil of major central banks. These are fellow bankers who set up \nthese principles. The Federal Reserve was instrumental in developing \nthose compensation principles.\n  So the tax deductions for major banks would be conditioned on the \nfollowing: If you are going to have a compensation executive package \nover $1 million, it must be performance based, and at least half of the \nperformance-based compensation must vest over an extended period of 5 \nyears or more. This will tie compensation not only to performance but \nto long-term performance. For executives at public companies, at least \nhalf of the performance-based compensation must be paid in employer \nstock, and compensation agreements for top executives must include a \nclawback provision that will retract deferred compensation in the event \nof ethical misconduct. Lastly, the compensation agreements must \nprohibit employees from engaging in personal hedging strategies, such \nas compensation insurance, that undermine the risk alignment \nprinciples.\n  In addition, the employer's bonus pool must take into account the \ninstitution's liquidity needs, reserve requirements, and the risk that \nfuture projected revenues will not materialize.\n  Finally, this amendment I am going to offer creates new and \nmeaningful executive compensation disclosure requirements so that \nshareholders can be empowered and investors can be empowered to hold \nbanks accountable for compensation practices that fail to fully comply \nwith these new tax rules that are there by virtue of the principles \nadopted.\n  Of course, the special interests are going to come in and argue that \nCongress should not get involved in compensation decisions, that the \nmarket knows best. They will argue if Congress passes measures such as \nthis that Wall Street is going to pack up its bags and move to greener \npastures abroad. Unfortunately, right now, what the market knows is \nthat big short-term gains lead to big bonuses, and big losses lead to \ntaxpayer-funded bailouts. And the American taxpayer is fed up.\n  This is only going to apply to the largest 57 banks in this country. \nThis is not going to apply to most of the banks in this country. We \nneed to take real steps now to reform compensation practices, and it is \nmy hope that the chairman of the Finance Committee is going to be able \nto get this amendment accepted without opposition. It is common sense, \nit is desperately needed, and the American people are crying out for \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Bozeman's Resiliency\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in mourning and remembrance on the \nfirst anniversary of a devastating natural gas explosion in downtown \nBozeman, MT.\n  At 8:11 in the morning, 1 year ago, downtown Bozeman was quiet, under \na thick blanket of snow. One minute later, a blast ripped through the \nsilence, killing a young woman named Tara Reistad Bowman and \ndevastating most of the 200 block of East Main Street.\n  Windows were shattered as far as four blocks away. A passing cyclist \ncommuting to work was thrown off his bike by the blast, and 911 calls \nshowed that the explosion was felt miles away. The firefighters and \nrescue crews responding to the blast later found that a natural gas \nline behind Montana Trails Gallery was cracked and that a gas leak had \ncaused the explosion.\n  Ten businesses and several apartment units were leveled by the blast \nor engulfed in the flames that followed. Boodles and Starky's, the \nRocking R Bar, and the American Legion--all destroyed. Assistant City \nManager Chuck Winn described it as the worst catastrophe he had ever \nseen in the city.\n  Firefighters from Bozeman, from Big Sky, and from Three Forks--nearby \ncommunities--all came to the rescue to put out the blaze. These brave \nmen and women stopped the fire from spreading to nearby stores. The \nMontana National Guard was called upon to help provide security.\n  One year after this tragedy, we pause to recognize today as a day of \nmourning and remembrance. We join the men and women of Bozeman who will \nobserve a moment of silence this morning.\n  Today, Montanans will mourn the loss of Tara Bowman. Our thoughts and \nprayers go out to her friends and her family and all who knew her. I \nnever met Tara, but I understand she was a very special woman. She was \na talented artist and a mentor to other artists in Bozeman. Tara liked \nto paint in the quiet morning. She had come into work early to the \nMontana Trails Art Gallery the morning of the blast. Her family and \nmany friends around Bozeman miss her dearly.\n  Today, as we mourn, we also remember the actions of the people of \nBozeman after the blast. Oftentimes, in the routine of everyday life, \nwe forget we may be called upon at any moment to act heroically. There \nwere many heroes that day in Bozeman. More than 70 firefighters from \ndepartments throughout Gallatin County answered the call for help. \nAlthough it took hours to shut off the natural gas that had caused the \ninitial blast, the volunteers continued to fight the blaze.\n  Many had left their day jobs to perform this dangerous duty. The \ncalls to help continued long after the blaze was extinguished. \nResidents had lost their homes and small business owners had lost their \nlivelihoods. In the truest expression of what it is to be a Montanan, \nthe people of Bozeman pulled together to help the victims of the blast \nand rebuild downtown.\n  Local businesses donated food to emergency workers. They donated \nlumber to cover shattered windows. A community relief fund provided \n$200,000 for those left homeless to find shelter and replace paychecks \nfor those left jobless.\n  The story of a man named Chris Cundy fully illustrates this generous \nspirit. Chris was left homeless after the explosion and the subsequent \nfire destroyed almost everything he owned. Chris even lost the tools of \nhis trade: his musical instruments--several electronic keyboards and a \ngrand piano. But then the community stepped in. The Red Cross met his \nimmediate needs--toothbrushes, soap, towels, and debit cards. Musicians \naround Bozeman raised funds to help replace his instruments. A fellow \nrenter borrowed a saxophone from a local music store so he could keep \nplaying to pay the bills.\n  After the explosion, Chris started playing music full time and even \nperformed to raise funds for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti. \nChris has proven that good can come from tragedy. He told the Bozeman \nChronicle:\n\n       The scope and depth of the community's support depicts \n     values that exist only with people who truly care about one \n     another.\n\n  A year later, I am glad to report that downtown Bozeman has made \ngreat strides. The American Legion has already begun to rebuild, and \nplans have been submitted to reconstruct many of the other destroyed \nbusinesses as well. I am working to make sure Federal dollars help fund \nthe reconstruction.\n  At this time next year, city officials expect every business impacted \nby the blast to be back on its feet and in operation. That is the \nresiliency of Bozeman and the spirit of Montana.\n  Today, we pause to remember last year's blast in mourning of our \nloss. We remember the actions taken by the great people of Bozeman, and \nwe proceed with renewed hope for the future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S1215]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I hope \nultimately will be given a chance for consideration on this very \nimportant legislation we are working on right now. I commend the chair \nof the Finance Committee for his good work on trying to focus this next \nround of job-creation activities that will be created, I believe, as we \nmove forward on extending some of the tax provisions that expired last \nyear. Some of these tax provisions were part of our stimulus bill that, \nabout a year ago, we passed to help jump-start job activities; a \nstimulus bill I sometimes think the American public--perhaps we never \nexplained. In fact, close to one-third of that bill was tax cuts, \nanother third was direct assistance to States and localities, and the \nfinal third was a series of new initiatives, many of which are just now \nstarting to come to pass.\n  I can recall, about a year ago, I came to the Senate floor as we were \ndebating the stimulus, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to \ntalk about fiscal accountability; to talk about our long-term outlook; \nand to make some recommendations on how we might better track the \nperformance and outcome of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, \nwhat most folks commonly refer to as the stimulus.\n  Here we are 1 year later and unfortunately it appears critical \nRecovery Act reports and plans have gone missing or have been long \nignored or were never fully developed in the first place. As we debate \nthis important piece of legislation that extends a number of the tax \nprovisions, I think we ought to take this moment as well to correct \nsome of the deficiencies in reporting on the fiscal responsibility I \nthink all of us on both sides of the aisle would like to see in the \noverall Recovery Act activities. We have this chance, at this point, to \ncorrect course and to ensure we can account for every dollar. Now it is \ntime to correct management and transparency gaps that still exist.\n  Today, I would like simply to very briefly go through a couple things \nmy amendment would do. Hopefully, the chair of the Finance Committee \nand folks on the other side will agree to have these amendments \nincorporated. My amendment will, in three very important ways, correct \nthe management and transparency gaps that still exist in the Recovery \nAct. First, it will require agencies to update the implementation plans \nthey have developed last year for high-risk programs.\n  High risk has this connotation that somehow it is a bad area or bad \nidea. No, the high-risk areas I am defining are those programs that are \nover $2 billion that saw a funding increase of over 150 percent more \nthan their fiscal year 2008 funding or are brandnew programs. These \nprograms will be required to update their plan by July 1, 2010.\n  Let me take a moment and describe what kind of programs I am talking \nabout. As I mentioned a few moments ago, the stimulus broke into tax \ncuts, assistance to the States, and then, finally, an agreement that we \nought to take up a series of areas that have for years been talked \nabout in this country but, candidly, we have never done much about--\nbroadband technology, high-speed rail, smart grid, health care \ninformation technology. These are all areas that, again, had broad \nsupport on both sides of the aisle, that we talked about, and only in \nthe case of the stimulus were there actually funds put behind these \ninitiatives. The challenge was, a year ago many of these areas had very \nlittle funding or had no programmatic prior experience so the \nadministration appropriately took some time to gear up these programs. \nWe are just starting to see some of the disbursement on high-speed rail \nand disbursement on the President's Race to the Top education grants. \nBut for these new programmatic areas, we need to make sure there is a \nplan in place, that there are metrics in place, and that we know how \nthese dollars are being spent out. So the first part of my amendment \nwill require these programs in high-risk areas to update their plans by \nJuly 1 of this year.\n  Second, my amendment will require these high-risk programs to report \nback to Congress and the public quarterly, beginning September 30, \n2010.\n  These reports must include performance and financial data to let us \nknow whether these programs are working and meeting the goals they \ndefined in their initial business plan that they would lay out to us in \nJuly of this year.\n  I think this is terribly important. These are areas that, because \nthey are new--I think they have enormous popular support, but because \nthey are new, we need to make sure that at the front end of these \nprogram implementations, we have that business plan in place, we have \nthe metrics, and we have a reporting mechanism.\n  The second part of my amendment is an area that we have been working \nwith the inspector general around the Recovery Act, Mr. Devaney, and \nothers. I think many of us in this Chamber would be disturbed to find \nout that the recent quarterly report showed that over 1,000 recipients \nof stimulus funding--1,000 agencies, departments, grantees--had failed \nto report back the legally required data on how these dollars have been \ndistributed, what kind of tracking is in place. Consequently, when we \nhear critiques, particularly from the other side, about the stimulus, \nabout the job creation and efficiency, well, an appropriate rebuttal \nrequires facts being in place. Over 1,000 of the recipients that have \nreceived stimulus funds have basically ignored the law and failed to \nreport back. So my amendment proposes financial penalties of up to \n$250,000 for recipients of the stimulus funds who knowingly fail to \ncomply with the existing quarterly reporting requirements. We have to \nensure that our agencies, Congress, and the public are getting the \ninformation they need to know if these important investments are \nworking.\n  The amendment requires agencies to notify recipients if they miss a \ndeadline. They will provide an opportunity for the recipient to report \nand offer technical assistance if they need that assistance to get back \non track. But if recipients knowingly do not file the required reports \nor if they ignore these agency requests for this information, agencies \nmay impose a penalty to hold these recipients accountable. The \namendment provides sufficient discretion for agencies to set penalties, \nsuch as consideration of whether the recipient is a nonprofit, \ngovernment, or small business entity. We don't want to add on a new \nburden, but we simply want those who are receiving financial assistance \nfrom the stimulus fund to actually fulfill their obligation and make \nsure they report back to us and the public on how those dollars are \nbeing spent.\n  I repeat, it is not too late to correct the gaps in program \nmanagement and transparency in the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct. So much of the Recovery Act funding is still in the pipeline. As a \nmatter of fact, at the end of last fiscal year, last October, only 18 \npercent of our recovery dollars had been spent out. Even at the end of \nthis fiscal year, at the end of September 2010, only about 54 percent \nof the dollars will be spent out. We still have literally hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to be spent out from this program.\n  We have to make sure--we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to the \npublic--that we have in place both the appropriate metrics on these \nhigh-risk programs and that those other organizations that are \nreceiving dollars do what is their legal requirement to report back on \nthis terribly important data.\n  I hope we can get this amendment adopted. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring this added \ntransparency and this added management oversight to this very important \nactivity.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Sessions pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3083 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n[[Page S1216]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                          Military Commissions\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was pleased to see an article in the \nBoston Globe today saying:\n\n     . . . White House advisers are close to recommending that \n     President Barack Obama opt for military tribunals for the \n     self-professed Sept. 11 mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed and \n     four of his alleged henchmen, senior officials said.\n       The review of where and how to hold a Sept. 11 trial is not \n     over, so no recommendation is yet before the president and \n     Obama has not made a determination on his own, officials \n     said. The review is not likely to be finished this week.\n\n  The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n  I will just say, I think that is right. I appreciate the President \nreevaluating the position taken by his Attorney General. I think it was \nbased on a number of errors in analysis of the nature of the conflict \nwe are in and the status of law, frankly, in America today. I have \nwritten about that in the Politico publication.\n  I will make a point or two about the five errors, mistakes, sometimes \neven falsehoods, it seems to me, that have been put forth to justify \ntrying military combatants--unlawful combatants, really--in civilian \ncourts and why this is not a good idea and some of the thought \nprocesses we should go through.\n  On February 3, Attorney General Holder wrote this:\n\n       Since the September 11 attacks, the practice of the U.S. \n     Government followed by prior and current administrations \n     without a single exception has been to arrest and detain \n     under Federal criminal law all terror suspects who are \n     apprehended inside the United States.\n\n  That was his letter. The Attorney General is incorrect in that. It is \nmade clear by his own citation in that very same letter of the Jose \nPadilla and the Ali Al-Marri cases. In those two cases, President \nGeorge W. Bush ordered each terror suspect transferred into military \ncustody after they were captured on U.S. soil. It does not mean they \ncannot later be tried in civilian court, if that is appropriate and you \nhave a good reason for doing that. It is not often I could see what \nthat would be the case, but it could be. You are not prohibited from \ndoing it. The law has apparently established that. They were taken into \nmilitary custody. That means the Speedy Trial Act is not triggered. It \nmeans the government does not have to pay an attorney for them. And it \nmeans they can be interrogated, but interrogated consistent with the \ntechniques Congress has approved in legislation that dealt with the \ncontroversy over what kind of interrogation is appropriate. We have \nlegislated on that issue.\n  Secondly, administration officials have often noted that Richard \nReid, the so-called shoe bomber, was charged in the civilian criminal \nsystem, but they fail to mention that the military commission was not \neven in place when he was arrested in December of 2001, not long after \n9/11. The Military Commission Order No. 1 that created the military \ncommissions was not signed into law until the next year in March. \nCongress, which dealt with these issues, did not authorize, \nlegislatively, the commission system and its structure until 2006. So \nthat is not a very good argument, is it?\n  Mr. Holder, in his letter to me and other Senators, stunningly cites \nthe Second Circuit decision in the Padilla case to assert that the \nPresident lacks the authority to detain a U.S. citizen as an enemy \ncombatant on U.S. soil. He cites the Second Circuit and says the \nPadilla case is authority for the proposition that the President lacks \nthe authority to detain a U.S. citizen as an enemy combatant on U.S. \nsoil if he is captured. The Attorney General, however, fails to note \nthat the Supreme Court reversed that decision, stating in the 2004 \nHamdi v. Rumsfeld case that there is no bar to this Nation holding one \nof its own citizens as an enemy combatant. A citizen, no less than an \nalien, can be ``part of or supporting forces hostile to the United \nStates or coalition partners'' and ``engaged in armed conflict against \nthe United States,'' and ``such a citizen, if released, would pose the \nsame threat of returning to the front during the ongoing conflict.'' Of \ncourse, that is accurate. Just because you are a citizen does not mean \nyou cannot attack the United States, join with forces hostile to it and \nattack the United States.\n  How they missed that citation is pretty stunning. If a lawyer in the \nDepartment of Justice in the Solicitor General's Office arguing before \na court of appeals somewhere in America failed to note that the opinion \nhe was citing was overruled, they would be subject to disciplinary \naction. The lawyer is an officer of the court; they have to know what \nthey are citing to the court. They should not ask them to believe \nsomething that is not accurate. Yet that came out of the Attorney \nGeneral's Office. We can do that, is my point.\n  On the question of granting terror suspects Miranda rights--that is, \nthe right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer, that kind of thing--\nthe Attorney General and his team have cited the Padilla case to \nsuggest the government could not have held Mr. Abdulmutallab, the \nChristmas Day bomber this past Christmas, in military custody without \naffording him the same access to counsel he was due as a criminal \ndefendant. That is just not true. You do not have to capture a person \non the battlefield. And this is the legal situation we are talking \nabout when they captured Abdulmutallab. In World War II, if you \ncaptured a Japanese or German soldier, you did not appoint them \nlawyers. You did not try them often. You held them until the war was \nover, and they did not get trials during that time.\n  To support this totally unjustified position, they note in one of \ntheir letters that the judge in the case, Judge Michael Mukasey, who \nlater became Attorney General of the United States--and a fabulous \nlegal mind--who at that time was a Federal judge in New York, granted \nMr. Padilla a lawyer. So they say he is entitled to a lawyer. But that \nwas long after his arrest and it arose from a much lighter contest \nabout his detention and whether he should be given a hearing in Federal \ncourt. The judge agreed to give him a habeas corpus hearing and \nappointed a lawyer for him. But that is not to say that Abdulmutallab, \nwho was captured on Christmas Day and interrogated for 50 minutes, was \nentitled to be given a lawyer or be given Miranda rights. It is not \naccurate. It is not correct.\n  In Mr. Holder's letter of February 3, he wrote this:\n\n       The Bush administration used the criminal justice system to \n     convict more than 300 individuals on terrorism related \n     charges.\n\n  We have heard that argument made time and again by Members of the \nSenate. Last May, Senator Kyl wrote to Mr. Holder seeking basic \ninformation to support these claims. Senator Kyl noted that ``a \ncomparison of terrorists in Federal prisons to terrorists detained in \nGuantanamo is instructive only if the severity of their actions, their \nbackground, and allegiance is equivalent.'' No answer was received. In \nNovember, I asked Attorney General Holder at a Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing if he would provide that information. He responded \nunequivocally:\n\n       I will supply you with those 300 names and what they were \n     convicted of. I will be glad to do that.\n\n  Months later, he has still not provided the list. I think the reason \nis clear, frankly: the facts do not support that allegation, that \nstatement.\n  Many of the individuals labeled as terrorists by the Obama \nadministration whom they are counting in this number--I think they have \nnow dropped it down to 195 or 200--were prosecuted for far lesser \ncrimes than Mr. Abdulmutallab, who had a bomb on his person to blow up \na plane, who had come directly from al-Qaida in Yemen, attacking this \ncountry as a direct representative of al-Qaida in Yemen, carrying an \nal-Qaida bomb. Mr. Andrew McCarthy, a former Federal prosecutor in \nterrorism cases in New York, recently shed light on a 2008 article \npublished by Human Rights First which said that 195 defendants have \nbeen convicted so far in 199 terrorism-related cases. But Mr. McCarthy \ndigs into it and notes that the report defines ``terrorism'' so broadly \nthat its finding included prosecutions for false statements, financial \nfraud, and immigration fraud.\n  Some say: You are politicizing this matter, Jeff. Don't be so \ncritical.\n  That is what Mr. Gibbs at the White House says, that criticizing and \nraising\n\n[[Page S1217]]\n\nobjections to falsehoods and inaccuracies, and legal statements that \nare not in error is somehow politicizing it. We have young men and \nwomen in combat today. Their lives are at risk. I think the leaders of \nour country in a time of war should not be spinning this Congress, but \ngiving us the unvarnished truth.\n  I wanted to say that, and to say I am glad there is now apparently an \nevaluation going on as to how best to handle this situation. I was also \npleased that Senator John McCain and Senator Joe Lieberman introduced \ntheir legislation--I believe yesterday they introduced it or the day \nbefore--that would call for trials of unprivileged enemy belligerents. \nThat is the more recent term. It used to be ``unlawful combatants.'' \nNow it is ``unprivileged enemy belligerents'' in military custody. It \nsays they are not to be given Miranda rights. They can be detained in \nmilitary custody for initial interrogation and to determine their \nstatus. It uses Congress's spending power to deny funding to article \nIII civilian trials for these unprivileged enemy belligerents and \nmandates, in effect, trials by military commission.\n  I would just note, Congress passed legislation and funding to deal \nwith the Supreme Court's concerns about the legitimacy or the propriety \nof the procedures used in military commissions. They raised questions \nabout that; found several things they believed were inadequate, and \nCongress dealt with it. We had a debate for a number of weeks and we \npassed legislation. The military, at the same time, was reading the \nopinion and changing their procedures to be in compliance with the \nSupreme Court and the laws of our country.\n  We put money in establishing our courtroom in Guantanamo to try these \ncases, and we are basically ready to go, after a lot of years, I will \nadmit, of uncertainty. Now the President, unwisely--probably based on \nan improvident campaign promise that he would end this--is attempting \nto end it. But I hope now he will reevaluate at least some of that and \nwe can get this system back in the right order because an unlawful \nenemy combatant can be tried for crimes. A lawful soldier can't be \ntried.\n  If you capture an enemy--a Japanese soldier or a German soldier who \nis fighting for his country and he is out there in his uniform and \nfighting according to the laws of war--they are not prosecuted. But if \nyou sneak into the United States surreptitiously, carrying a bomb in \norder to sabotage and kill innocent men, women, and children, contrary \nto the rules of war, then you can be tried. You can be detained as long \nas the war continues as an unlawful combatant. If you violated the laws \nof war, you can be tried for it.\n  For example, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is the alleged mastermind of \n9/11, can be tried for murder in military commissions because he was \nnot a common criminal. He was a part of al-Qaida, executing a military \nattack on the United States, contrary to the rules of war.\n  So I would hope we can move forward with this in a good way; that the \nPresident will take the lead because these kinds of decisions are \neasier made in the executive branch than by the legislative branch \nhaving to cut off funds or pass legislation mandating this or that. The \nConstitution certainly allows these cases to be tried, and the Supreme \nCourt has so approved it.\n  In fact, Attorney General Holder, in the Judiciary Committee, as a \nresult of questions I asked him, has agreed these cases can be tried in \nmilitary commissions and that there is no constitutional prohibition of \nit. In fact, he said it was a policy decision that caused him to have \nthe cases tried in civilian courts and not in military courts. I \nbelieve that is a policy error and it needs to be corrected.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Latin America\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our relations \nwith our neighbors to the south in Latin America. I recently had the \nopportunity to travel to Latin America and visit the countries of \nHonduras, Panama, and Colombia. These meetings were very productive.\n  During these meetings I had the chance to meet with the new President \nof Honduras, President Lobo, as well as our great ally and friend, \nPresident Uribe of the country of Colombia.\n  Our partnership and friendship with Latin America goes back many \ndecades. In recent times we have used wonderful programs such as USAID \nand the Millennium Challenge Corporation to help build the \ninfrastructure of Latin America as well as provide the tools to create \njobs that will be sustainable in these countries.\n  Our goal in Latin America is simply this: We want them to succeed. We \nwant strong neighbors with good democracies, with a respect for the \nrule of law, a place where their people can be free and prosper and \nhopefully establish great trading partnerships with us in the United \nStates of America.\n  But the history of Latin America, even recently, is while there have \nbeen many successes, there have also been setbacks. We have recently \nhad troubles in Honduras with President Zelaya, the former President \nwho tried to stay in office, and then we had an ouster of him. There is \na debate among us as to whether that was a coup or whether it was \nlegally done. But, nonetheless, it was a disruption in that country's \nemerging democracy.\n  In meeting with President Lobo, I was impressed that he has put \ntogether a national unity government endeavoring to create those \ndemocratic institutions and strengthen the ones that Honduras was \nbuilding upon and establish a rule of law that will give countries such \nas America and business people from our country the opportunity to \ntransact business in that country.\n  I believe that under President Lobo's leadership, we have got a good \nchance for Honduras reemerging on the stage in Latin America as a good \nand healthy democracy.\n  I was pleased that Secretary Clinton recently recognized the \ndemocratically elected president. I encourage President Obama to \nreceive President Lobo. We need friends in the region. We need friends \nfor a number of reasons. We need friends in Latin America, specifically \nCentral America, because of the devastating and harmful drug trade. The \ndrug trade in Latin America that funnels drugs and guns to this country \nis not just a challenge in and of itself because of the deadly \nnarcotics it brings to America, it is a challenge because of the \nviolence and the organized structure of violence that goes with it.\n  Recently we saw drug gangs in Mexico extract the worst form of \nvengeance upon a family of a young military officer. A military officer \ndied in Mexico killing the head of a drug cartel. He was celebrated by \nthat country in what would be akin to a state funeral. And the drug \ncartel, to exact vengeance and to send a signal, killed all of the \nmembers of that soldier's family. That is terrible.\n  The money that is provided by these drugs that run from northern \nSouth America, the Colombia region, and then through Central America, \nthese connections, that violent chain is very dangerous to this \ncountry. It is dangerous for many reasons, but there is an increasing \ndanger. There is an increasing danger that has occurred with the \nentrance of Iran and its progeny into Latin America. We now know that \nAhmadinejad is trying to show his sphere of influence in Latin America; \nthat Hezbollah and Hamas, surrogate groups for Iran, who have done most \nof their damage in Lebanon and in Gaza, are now setting up shop in \nLatin America.\n  One of the reasons I am here to speak on the floor today is I am \nconcerned that the same networks that transported violence and drugs \nand guns to this country could be used by Hezbollah and Hamas to \nprovide a national security threat to us in this country and \npotentially bring terrorism to us in that way.\n  So our friendship with these countries such as Honduras, our \nfriendship with countries such as Panama, our friendship with countries \nsuch as Colombia matter. It not only matters because we care about the \nhuman rights\n\n[[Page S1218]]\n\nof the people in those countries and we want them to be prosperous and \nfree, but it matters because of our own national security.\n  Good, stable democratic partners are good for the United States of \nAmerica. So we should continue to acknowledge President Lobo. We should \nrestore the visas that were suspended during the Zelaya incident. We \nshould do everything we can to encourage trade to continue with the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation, continue with USAID so that country \ncan be prosperous and free and secure.\n  The same goes for Panama. Panama is a wonderful friend and partner to \nthe United States. The Panama Canal, which the United States had for \nmany years but now is in the hands of Panama, is a tremendous trading \nconduit to our country, and the Panama Canal is expanding. Right now, \ndredging and other works are being put in place to allow larger ships \nto come through the Panama Canal. Why is that important to the United \nStates of America? Well, no longer will these post-panamax ships from \nChina have to go to California to let off their goods. No longer will \nthey have to go around the bottom of South America. Now they can come \nthrough the Panama Canal and service the eastern seaboard of the United \nStates.\n  For a State such as mine in Florida this is very important. So we \nhave to do the work in this country to make sure we are ready for \nthose, what they call post-Panamax ships, that our ports are dredged \ndeep enough that we have the security and the infrastructure in place \nto make sure we can receive those large ships.\n  I have been an advocate for making sure that Florida's ports are \nready to receive those ships, because that trade will create thousands \nof jobs not just in my home State but all across this country.\n  That brings me to the point of trade. We have pending trade \nagreements that have not yet been sent over by the White House to be \nratified by this Congress; trade agreements with Panama that need to be \nratified, trade agreements with Colombia that need to be ratified, and \nalso with South Korea. It makes no sense not to ratify those \nagreements.\n  Let me turn my attention, if I can, to Colombia. We have no better \nfriend in Latin America than President Uribe. President Uribe will go \ndown in history as one of the greatest leaders in this hemisphere. He, \nin my mind, is akin to Abraham Lincoln to their country, because when \nhe came into office about 8 years ago, we were on the verge of Colombia \nturning into a narcoterrorist state, in which the drug gangs would have \ntaken over the country.\n  In fact, before President Uribe came to office, the previous \nPresident sought to negotiate with the FARC by setting aside a part of \nthe country as a safe haven for the FARC. It was a disaster. I am told \nthat when President Uribe was sworn into office, almost 8 years ago, \nthat the FARC was shelling and bombing Bogota to try to kill him on his \ninauguration. It is hard for us to realize what a civil war would be \nlike, but that has been the situation in Colombia.\n  Because of the efforts of the United States of America, and because \nof our military and trade support, and Plan Colombia, which we put $1 \nbillion into, Colombia turned the tide. The good guys are winning, and \nthe FARC, the narcoterrorists, are losing. We are doing a very good job \nof beating those folks back. President Uribe must be commended.\n  But of all of our friends in the hemisphere, we have not ratified the \nfree trade agreement with Colombia. We have done it with Peru, we have \ndone the Central America Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA, but not Colombia. \nThis agreement is 4 years old. I have spoken to our United States Trade \nRepresentative and urged him to urge this administration to send these \ntrade agreements here.\n  I know the problem is not the Senate. The problem is down the hall \nwith our colleagues in the House. I know they are concerned about \ncertain issues in Colombia. I want to point out for my friends in the \nHouse of Representatives, because they are concerned about organized \nlabor in Colombia, that under the leadership of this government in \nColombia, homicides of union members are down nearly 80 percent since \n2002. Homicides, in general, are down 45 percent in 2008, the lowest \npoint in 22 years. Kidnappings are down by more than 80 percent, and \nacts of terrorism are down 63 percent.\n  I had a chance to go to Bogota. It is a beautiful and wonderful city. \nIt rises nearly 8,000 feet above sea level, which is 3,000 more feet \nthan Denver. Yet it is green and verdant, and it is one of the world's \nmost unbelievable places to grow flowers, and 75 percent or more of the \nflowers that come in this country that you get at your florist come to \nus through Colombia. When they come from Colombia, guess where they go \nthrough to get to the United States of America. They all come through \nMiami, which makes me proud as a Senator from Florida.\n  That trade we have right now, the Colombians benefit from free trade \nbut we do not benefit in return. We must ratify this agreement. We must \nacknowledge our friends in Colombia. By not ratifying the agreement, \nthe signal we are sending is that perhaps our relationship with them, \nunder this administration, is not as good as it has been with previous \nadministrations. We do not want to send that wrong signal to a model \ncountry for Latin America.\n  But let me again talk about this concern I have about the emerging \nthreat of Iran and its influence in Latin America. There is a deadly \ncombination forming between Ahmadinejad of Iran and Hugo Chavez of \nVenezuela. I ask unanimous consent that this newspaper article which I \nam about to read from be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Venezuela Plotted To Kill Rival, Spain Says\n\n                (By Santiago Perez and Jose de Cordoba)\n\n       Madrid.--Spain and Venezuela headed toward a potential \n     diplomatic face-off after a Spanish judge on Monday accused \n     Caracas of collaborating with rebel groups to assassinate \n     Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and other top political \n     figures.\n       Spanish National Court Judge Eloy Velasco alleged Monday \n     that the Venezuelan government had collaborated with Basque \n     separatist group ETA and Colombia's main guerrilla group in a \n     plot against leaders living in or traveling to Spain that \n     began in late 2003.\n       The allegations were part of an indictment that ordered 12 \n     alleged members of ETA and of the Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     of Colombia, or FARC, to stand trial on charges of conspiracy \n     to commit murder and terrorism, according to a copy reviewed \n     by The Wall Street Journal.\n       ``There is evidence . . . showing the cooperation of the \n     Venezuelan government in the illegal collaboration between \n     FARC and ETA,'' according to the indictment.\n       Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, \n     speaking at a news conference Monday in Hanover, Germany, \n     said he had ordered his Foreign Ministry to ``request an \n     explanation from the Venezuelan government'' regarding the \n     allegations. ``We are awaiting such explanation,'' Mr. \n     Zapatero said.\n       Caracas responded angrily to the allegations. Venezuela's \n     Foreign Ministry, in a statement, dismissed the charges as \n     ``biased and unfounded.''\n       Hayden Pirelac a congressman from the ruling coalition of \n     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, said the Spanish judge's \n     allegations were part of a campaign ``to discredit \n     Venezuela,'' adding: ``We don't give guerrillas refuge, or \n     have any pact with guerrillas.''\n       The allegations come at a bad time for Mr. Chavez, whose \n     popularity is falling due to electricity shortages and an \n     economy mired in recession and high inflation. They could \n     also prove tricky for Colombia and Spain, both of which have \n     been trying to move beyond past differences with Venezuela's \n     populist leader.\n       The indictments also bring fresh attention to Spain's \n     National Court, whose judges act on their own investigations \n     and are independent from Spain's executive and legislative \n     branches. Some judges have gained international attention, \n     and criticism, for their handling of global cases involving \n     other governments, including an investigation into \n     allegations of U.S. torture at Guantanamo Bay.\n       Mr. Velasco, by contrast, has handled mainly local and less \n     controversial terrorism cases, maintaining a low profile \n     domestically and internationally.\n       Mr. Uribe, one of the targets of the alleged assassination \n     plots, responded cautiously. ``I think we should react \n     prudently and see what is going on through diplomatic \n     channels,'' he told Colombian radio from Uruguay.\n       Another alleged target, former Colombian President Andres \n     Pastrana, also demanded an explanation from Venezuela. ``We \n     are talking about an alleged plot against the lives of, among \n     others, two Colombian acting heads of state,'' he said in a \n     statement.\n       Mr. Velasco issued international arrest warrants and \n     extradition requests for the 12\n\n[[Page S1219]]\n\n     men named in the indictment, all of whom allegedly belong to \n     either ETA or FARC and whose whereabouts are unknown. One \n     man, identified as Arturo Cubillas Fontan, is believed to be \n     living in Venezuela.\n       In detailing Caracas's alleged role, Mr. Velasco pointed to \n     Mr. Cubillas Fontan, who the judge says led ETA's activities \n     in Latin America since 1999 and acted as a link with the \n     FARC. It says Mr. Cubillas Fontan was hired by Venezuela's \n     Agriculture Ministry in 2005.\n       Mr. Cubillas Fontan's alleged contacts with the FARC \n     included ``military training for ETA members in the Colombian \n     jungle, in exchange for ETA's help in Spain, locating \n     terrorist targets sought by FARC,'' according to the \n     indictment. Those targets included visiting Colombian \n     dignitaries, including Messrs. Pastrana and Uribe and current \n     Vice President Francisco Santos.\n       The document also says that during a training course on \n     explosives, FARC members were accompanied by ``an escort \n     vehicle with Venezuelan soldiers that was arranged and \n     organized'' by Mr. Cubillas Fontan and another person.\n       Venezuela's government, in its statement; said Mr. Cubillas \n     Fontan had been living in Venezuela since 1989 under a deal \n     struck by then-Venezuelan leader Carlos Andres Perez and \n     former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.\n       Information used in the indictment came from the laptop \n     computer of a top FARC guerrilla commander killed by \n     Colombian forces in 2008. In the months that followed, the \n     computer files revealed what international intelligence \n     officials say are close ties between the FARC and top members \n     of Mr. Chavez's government.\n       The Venezuelan government has long insisted that the \n     information from the computers was made up by the Colombian \n     government in an attempt to discredit Mr. Chavez, an \n     allegation Colombia denies.\n       The indictments will prove challenging for Spain, one of \n     Venezuela's major trade partners. The two sides improved \n     their diplomatic relations under the stewardship of Mr. \n     Zapatero, a leftist, but the road hasn't been smooth.\n       Mr. Chavez in 2008 made a surprise announcement he was \n     nationalizing the Venezuelan franchise of Banco Santander, \n     though the improved relations with Madrid might have helped \n     the Spanish financial giant secure a $1.05 billion payment \n     for the unit, more than many analysts expected.\n       Colombia has also been trying to mend fences with \n     Venezuela, despite a rocky relationship in the past few years \n     thanks largely to ideological differences between Mr. Chavez \n     and the conservative Mr. Uribe. Last year, after Mr. Uribe \n     agreed to host U.S. bases in Colombia, Mr. Chavez cut \n     economic ties.\n       Last week, Mr. Chavez and Mr. Uribe got in a shouting match \n     at a regional meeting of heads of state in Cancun, after Mr. \n     Uribe told the Venezuelan leader to ``be a man'' and discuss \n     the Venezuelan trade embargo. In the following days, both \n     sides said they would try to bury the hatchet.\n       In addition to the 12 people who were ordered to stand \n     trial on murder and terrorism charges, Mr. Velasco also \n     charged Remedios Garcia Albert with the crime of \n     collaboration with a terrorist group, according to the \n     indictment.\n       In the document, Mr. Velasco described Ms. Garcia Albert as \n     an alleged member of FARC's international support group \n     residing in Spain and ordered her to present herself in court \n     for questioning on March 24.\n       According to court officials, Ms. Garcia Albert, a Spanish \n     national, is free on bail linked to another terrorism case. A \n     lawyer for Ms. Garcia Albert wasn't immediately available for \n     comment.\n       Spain doesn't try people in absentia, so a trial for the \n     other 12 people would take place only if they are arrested.\n       Latin America's oldest and biggest guerrilla group, the \n     FARC has been fighting to overthrow the Colombian government \n     and install a Marxist dictatorship for four decades. The \n     guerrillas, who in 2001 encircled the capital, kidnapping \n     motorists who ventured out at will, has been put on its heels \n     by Mr. Uribe, a provincial lawyer who has revamped Colombia's \n     military and driven the rebels back into Colombia's jungles.\n       In 2008, the Colombian army bombed the jungle hideout of \n     Raul Reyes, the group's No. 2 commander. His laptop included \n     details of attempts by top Venezuelan military and \n     intelligence officials to give money and weapons to the FARC, \n     which, like ETA is considered a terrorist organization by the \n     U.S. and European Union.\n       Once a peasant guerrilla army, the FARC lost most of its \n     ideological motivation and turned to drug trafficking, \n     extortion and kidnapping for funding. It now has an estimated \n     8,000 combatants under arms, down from a high of about \n     18,000.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. This article from March 2, 2010, I believe it is a Wall \nStreet Journal article, talks about the revelation that has occurred \nthat Hugo Chavez and his government were involved with the Basque \nseparatist group in Spain in an effort to assassinate the President of \nColombia, President Uribe.\n  This article from March 2, 2010 says that:\n\n       Spanish National Court Judge Eloy Velasco alleged Monday \n     that the Venezuelan government had collaborated with Basque \n     separatist group ETA and Colombia's main guerrilla group \n     [which is the FARC] in a plot against leaders living in or \n     traveling to Spain that began in late 2003.\n       The allegations were part of an indictment that ordered 12 \n     alleged members of ETA and of the FARC to stand trial on \n     charges of conspiracy to commit murder and terrorism.\n\n  This was an effort to assassinate the President of Colombia. And it \nwas done, according to this judge, in combination with the President of \nVenezuela, Hugo Chavez, who is just as bad as Raul Castro in Cuba. He \nis trying to spread the same tyranny to the country of Venezuela, a \ncountry that was formerly free. He is shutting down media, he is \narresting college students, he is destroying the economy to the point \nwhere there are now brownouts because they cannot provide enough \nelectricity, a country which has tremendous oil reserves and energy \nreserves.\n  But he is not using those to bring money into the country, he is \nshutting the economy down. He is bringing despair to his people. The \nCuban Government is now involved in the operation of Venezuela. They \nare calling it Vene-Cuba. This is a danger to us. Who is received by \nHugo Chavez in Venezuela? Ahmadinejad from Iran. And what do we believe \nand what are we concerned about? That Hezbollah and Hamas are now \nsetting up shop in Venezuela, in the region as well.\n  I have another article that I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record from the Associated Press by Curt Anderson. ``Three men \ncharged in Miami with financing Hezbollah.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Feb. 19, 2010]\n\n          Three Men Charged in Miami With Financing Hezbollah\n\n                           (By Curt Anderson)\n\n       Miami.--Three men were charged in an indictment unsealed \n     Friday with illegally exporting electronics and video games \n     to a South American shopping center that U.S. officials claim \n     funnels money to the Hezbollah militant group.\n       The men, along with a fourth still being sought in South \n     America, are accused of violating a U.S. ban on transactions \n     involving people or entities on a Treasury Department list of \n     suspected terrorist fundraising networks. Hezbollah, which is \n     fiercely anti-Israel and allied with Iran, is considered a \n     terrorist group by the U.S.\n       The shopping center, Galeria Page in Ciudad del Este, \n     Paraguay, was included on the banned list in December 2006 \n     along with owner Muhammad Yusif Abdallah. Abdallah is \n     described as a senior Hezbollah leader in a region of South \n     America long considered a haven for counterfeiting, \n     smuggling, piracy and other crimes.\n       The suspects arrested in the U.S. Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement investigation were identified in court documents \n     as Khaled Safadi, 56, and 43-year-old Emilio Gonzalez, both \n     of Miami; and 46-year-old Ulises Talavera-Campos, a citizen \n     of Paraguay.\n       Attorney Michael Tein represents Safadi, whom he said is \n     innocent.\n       ``Terrorism?'' Tein said. ``More like `The Great Sony \n     Playstation Caper.' The indictment literally charges them \n     with selling Playstation 2 video games to Paraguay. That's \n     some weapon of mass destruction.''\n       It wasn't immediately clear if the other two had attorneys, \n     and a bail hearing was scheduled for Wednesday.\n       The men also face charges of conspiracy and smuggling. They \n     face a maximum of 35 years each in prison if convicted.\n       According to the indictment, the three men ran companies \n     that used the Port of Miami to move goods including Sony \n     Playstation video game consoles, digital cameras and other \n     items that eventually wound up at the Paraguay destination. \n     About $1 million in exports were identified by ICE, the FBI, \n     Treasury officials and other investigators with Miami's Joint \n     Terrorism Task Force.\n       The men allegedly used fake invoices, false addresses and \n     phony names to mask the true destination of the goods. The \n     companies involved also were indicted.\n       John Morton, assistant Homeland Security secretary for ICE, \n     said the arrests will disrupt a network involved in ``the \n     illicit trade of commodities that support terrorist \n     activities and ultimately threaten the national security of \n     the United States.''\n       Hezbollah, which means ``Party of God'' in Arabic, fought a \n     2006 war with Israel and has been blamed for numerous suicide \n     bombings and other attacks. The Lebanon-based group has \n     become a more conventional political entity in recent years, \n     holding seats in Lebanon's parliament as well as two Cabinet \n     posts.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX.\n\n       Three men were charged in an indictment unsealed Friday \n     with illegally exporting electronics and video games to a \n     South American shopping center that U.S. officials claim \n     funnels money to a Hezbollah militant group.\n\n[[Page S1220]]\n\n       John Morton, assistant Homeland Security secretary for ICE, \n     said the arrests will disrupt a network in ``the illicit \n     trade of commodities that support terrorist activities and \n     ultimately threaten the national security of the United \n     States.''\n\n  In his book ``The Gathering Storm,'' Winston Churchill described all \nthe failed attempts and all the missed opportunities of Europe in the \nyears building up in the 1930s to World War II. The failure of courage, \nthe missed opportunities to stop Nazi Germany in its rise, Winston \nChurchill described it as a gathering storm because there were signs \nall along the way of fascism and the war machine that Adolf Hitler was \nbuilding. What did the allies do when Germany reestablished its \npresence in the land between France and Germany, in that Rhineland \nregion, and sent their troops back in? They did nothing. What did the \nallies do when the Germans went into Czechoslovakia? They did nothing. \nThere were these steps along the way. It was a gathering storm that was \nignored until it was too late.\n  The point I am trying to convey is, we have an existential threat \nwith Iran. Ahmadinejad is an existential threat to this country. We \nknow he is trying to build the ability to have nuclear weapons. We know \nhe is talking with Hugo Chavez about mining uranium. That is our \nconcern, and the sanctions and the discussions we are having are not \nworking. I give credit to Secretary Clinton on recently coming out and \nsaying we don't even know that Ahmadinejad is in charge of Iran. It may \nbe the Revolutionary Guard, the military, that is running Iran. But the \ntime for talk is over. We have to work on the world community to impose \nsanctions against Iran. We need to stop trading as a world community \nwith Iran. We need to stop buying oil from them. We need to shut them \ndown until the people of Iran can take their country back, bring back \nhuman rights, democracy, the right to petition the government, the \nright to elect leaders, the right to free speech. Iran was a \nprogressive society before 1979. We see the young people in the streets \nwho have been beaten down, trying to express their views, trying to say \nthe election of Ahmadinejad was not legitimate.\n  I explain these things because I believe Iran is trying to set up \nshop in Latin America. We need strong, bolstered friends in the region \nto defend against this. We do not need Hezbollah and Hamas posing a \nnational security threat right here in our own hemisphere. There is a \ngathering storm. The steps we take today, if we are strong, bold and \nvigilant, can stop the storm from breaking upon us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Financial System Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to lay out \nwhere we are on this effort to do reform of the financial structures of \nour economy. It has been a long undertaking and I will not take a lot \nof time and I will not go into great detail. But I thought it might be \nhelpful for my colleagues and others to get some sense or a feel of how \nthings are progressing. So I wish to share some thoughts on some major \nissues we are grappling with.\n  I wish to begin by thanking the 22 other members of the Banking \nCommittee. About one-quarter of the Senate is seated at that table in \nour Banking Committee hearing room. I wish to thank every member for \ntheir work. We have been deeply involved now for well over a year--more \nthan a year; a year and a half--on the issue of how we should shape the \nregulatory structure of reform. This year we have had somewhere around \n80 hearings, listening to a broad range of experts and others who have \nbrought their thoughts and ideas, not to mention the informal meetings \nthat occur outside of the normal hearing process.\n  It has been a very long undertaking, and worthwhile. We have been \ntrying to examine the causes of this problem that has been so \ndevastating to our country and to others outside of our country--the \neconomic near collapse--and then, from that experience, trying to shape \nand set up policies that will fill in those gaps that led us to this \nproblem.\n  Secondly, we are trying to take steps so that we are prepared to \ndeal, as we will at some point in the future have to, with another \neconomic crisis as it comes along, and to have what I call an \narchitecture or a structure that will allow our system to be able to \nrespond far more prudently than it was able to during the last couple \nof years.\n  I should add as well a third goal, and that is to create a structure \nto not only grapple with the crisis, but also be a source of innovation \nand creativity for wealth creation and job creation that our financial \nservices sector had a reputation of accomplishing, or at least helping \nto accomplish over the years. Those are not inconsistent goals. It is a \nchallenge to balance them. It is never perfectly right. But our \nresponsibility--both as legislators in this Chamber and the other body, \nas well as the role of regulators and, obviously, those in the private \nsector and public sector--is to try and strike that balance between \nprotecting the public and consumers who use financial services, as well \nas to be able to provide a level of confidence to those who use them, \nthat the system is going to be safe.\n  It doesn't mean you are going to get a guaranteed return when you buy \na stock, but you ought to feel confident when you deposit your paycheck \nthat the institution is going to be there, or you are going to be \nprotected from losing those resources.\n  So I wish to take a few minutes and share some thoughts on where we \nare. I will quickly add, as well, I wish to pay particular thanks to \nthe members of the committee. As many people are aware, Senator Shelby \nand I, my ranking member, have worked closely together over the last 3 \nyears that I have been chairman of this committee on a wide range of \nissues, and I am grateful to him for his efforts. He is, obviously, \nsignificantly involved in this debate. I wish to thank Bob Corker, the \nSenator from Tennessee. He is a new Member of this Chamber, but has \nperformed, I think, a tremendous task of trying to sit down and work \nout the differences, and they are complex and they are difficult. \nNonetheless, he has rolled up his sleeves and demonstrated a level of \nmaturity and interest far beyond the years of his service. All of us--\nand I, certainly--wish to thank him publicly as well for his efforts, \nand that of his staff, trying to help us get there.\n  Other members of the committee, including Jack Reed of Rhode Island, \nChuck Schumer, Mark Warner, have taken on particular heavy lifts, and I \nwill talk about them in a minute as I discuss what is going on, along \nwith Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Mike Crapo of Idaho. So there have \nbeen a lot of people involved in this as we go forward. I would be \nremiss if I didn't acknowledge their hard work and that of their staffs \nover these many months.\n  We are still not there yet. I am not here to announce an agreement or \nto tell my colleagues we have reached a consensus. We are trying to get \nthere, but we are not there yet. We are making an effort to see if we \ncan't develop a set of proposals that will enjoy broad support in this \ninstitution as we go forward.\n  So we have all seen, of course, the devastating consequences. I \nhardly need to spend much time enumerating them here. People are living \nthem every day, and they don't necessarily need to hear them outlined. \nHowever, I will just share again what all of us are painfully aware of.\n  Mr. President, 8.4 million jobs have been lost since December of \n2007. The unemployment rate is currently at 9.7 percent. It has been \nobviously far too high. I think all of us know, as the Presiding \nOfficer does, that there are pockets in our country where that 9.7 is \nmaybe half the unemployment rate in certain areas of rural America and \nurban America. An astonishing 6.1 million Americans have been without a \njob for half a year or more in our Nation. Millions of our fellow \ncitizens who did nothing wrong have nonetheless lost homes, their \nretirement security, their jobs, their health care. Small businesses \nhave been unable to access credit and have been forced to lay off \nworkers, reduce production, or even have\n\n[[Page S1221]]\n\nhad to shut their doors. Working class families in our country have \nseen their wealth decline significantly, and, worst of all, today we \nremain entirely vulnerable to yet another crisis.\n  We haven't finished this work, and if something were to happen again \ntomorrow, as much as we have been working on this issue, we haven't \npassed the necessary legislation to minimize a crisis bringing us close \nto the brink of financial collapse as the one we are presently in did.\n  So, obviously, the status quo--I am getting kind of tired of using \nthose words; business as usual, whatever words you want to use to \ndescribe it--cannot persist. Congress, in my view, must pass \ncomprehensive, meaningful reform of our financial system. My hope and \nintention is to do everything I can in the waning days of my service \nafter 30 years here to achieve that goal.\n  We have to correct the failures that allowed us to get into this \nmess, but we must also develop a regulatory system that is prepared for \nthe next one, and one that is going to invite, as well, the kind of \ncreativity and innovation that allow for job creation and wealth \ncreation that our system has in the past provided.\n  Over a year ago, the Banking Committee, as I pointed out earlier, set \nout to investigate the causes of financial crises and the \nvulnerabilities that lie in our financial regulatory structure. Over \nthe last year or more, we have held literally dozens and dozens of \ngatherings, hearings, informal and formal meetings. We have listened to \nhundreds of experts in a wide variety of fields who have been either \naffected by, or who have offered some ideas as to how we can create \nthis architecture about which I have spoken. We have examined and \nreexamined all sets of proposals sent to us by the White House, the \nTreasury, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and others.\n  In November of last year, I offered my colleagues a discussion draft \nof where I was. I didn't suggest it had cosponsors or backers, but I \nthought people ought to know where the chairman of the committee was, \nso I laid out a broad proposal in these areas. It certainly produced a \ndiscussion, I can tell my colleagues. Not always a welcome one from \ncertain corners, but I thought people ought to know at least where I \nstood on these issues. If I were going to write this alone and I didn't \nwant anyone else to offer their ideas and suggestions, I had some \npretty strong and sound ideas as to where we ought to be. I then asked \nmy fellow committee members, Democrats and Republicans, to work on \nmajor parts of the bill. It is so complex and so big and broad, the \nsubject matter, that I didn't think any one member, even a chairman and \na ranking member, could necessarily put their arms around all of it. So \nI asked various members who expressed an interest in various subject \nmatters if they would take on the responsibility, a Democrat and a \nRepublican working together, to see if they could come up with some \nideas that would be sound, intelligent reforms of the financial system.\n  It has been an enormous task. As I said a moment ago, these are \nincredibly complex issues, but with the good work done by so many on \nthe committee, I believe we are well on our way to producing a very \nstrong bill. The problems with our economy run system-wide, and while \nthere is the temptation by some to address only one or two issues and \nclaim victory and call it a day, we are working in our committee on a \nbill that will attack these problems and vulnerabilities in a rather \ncomprehensive way, one that we believe will make a difference.\n  The bill as we fashion it is designed to achieve four major \naccomplishments: No. 1--and the first priority, I would argue, if I had \nto prioritize whether the others fall into this category--is ending \ntoo-big-to-fail bailouts. That, to me, is the most important thing we \ncan achieve here.\n\n  Never, ever again should the American taxpayer of this country be \nforced to write a check, which they did, because there is an implicit \nguarantee that the Federal Government of the United States will bail \nout a company lest it threaten the stability of the economy as a whole. \nIt will make it so undesirable for a company to get too big or too \ncomplex with new capital, new leverage requirements, supervisory \nrequirements, and set up a mechanism so large, complex companies can be \nshut down through bankruptcy or resolution in a way that does not \nthreaten the economy or expose the American taxpayers, as they have \nbeen. It is a resolution, it is a bankruptcy, it is a receivership, and \nit is painful to creditors, to shareholders, and to the management who \nbear the burden but not taxpayers.\n  We are very close to achieving that. Again, I thank Mark Warner of \nVirginia and Bob Corker of Tennessee who dealt with this issue, this \nand systemic risk, which I will mention in a minute. They worked I \ndon't know how many hours sitting down trying to fashion this \nresolution mechanism. But the idea that we would watch the American \ntaxpayer write out a check for $700 billion, knowing the reaction of \nthe American public--by the way, in the absence of what we are trying \nto do here, I think we did the right thing. Had we not done it, the \nfinancial problem would have been a lot worse. We never again ought to \nbe put in that position, where that is the only alternative we have. \nThis bill will address that issue.\n  Secondly, we create an early warning system in the economy so \nsomebody is looking out for the next big problem. The bill would create \nwhat we call a systemic risk council--that is our goal--that will have \nthe job of looking across the economy to identify unsafe products, \nactivities, institutions that could threaten the economy as a whole in \nthe future. We cannot afford to be caught off guard again by obvious \nweaknesses in our system because no one is responsible for taking a \nbroad view.\n  Again, it is not going to stop everything, but we did not have this \nability in the past. Again, Mark Warner and Bob Corker have worked very \nhard on a resolution mechanism and systemic risk and all of us owe them \na debt of gratitude for their efforts.\n  Third, we bring transparency and accountability to the exotic \ninstruments, such as derivatives and credit default swaps, things that \nare rather arcane to most Americans, to put it mildly, but have been \nlurking too long in the dark and were able to cause untold damage to \nour economy because they lacked transparency and regulation. We change \nthat in this bill. That is our hope anyway, if we get to the conclusion \nof it.\n  We have to regulate these activities that left investors and our \neconomy open to the tremendous risks they did not even know existed. \nLiterally, billions of dollars being traded--frankly, gambled--behind \nclosed doors drove our economy to the verge of collapse. Senator Jack \nReed of Rhode Island, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, and their \nstaffs have been working on this issue over many weeks to try and come \nup with an intelligent, thoughtful, well-drafted set of proposals on \nthese exotic instruments, particularly derivatives. I thank them for \nthe job they have done, and I am confident when our colleagues have had \na chance to be briefed about their efforts, there will be broad-based \nsupport for what is included in our bill.\n  We have to rein in these crazy compensation packages that have \noutraged the public and hurt companies by rewarding short-term profits \nand wild risk-taking. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, Senator Mike \nCrapo of Idaho, and their staffs have been working on governance \nissues. More work needs to be done on this issue. I thank both our \ncolleagues, again a Democrat and Republican, for trying to come up with \nideas on governance issues that will avoid some of the problems with \nwhich we are all too familiar.\n  We create--and one that has attracted the most attention because of \nthe issues involved--a strong and independent consumer protection \nwatchdog, one that has never existed but has come to financial \nservices. It is somewhat ironic we have a Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, so if we buy a toy for our children or a product or an \nappliance and it does not work or it causes us great harm or danger, \nthere is a place called the Consumer Product Safety Commission which \nwill protect us from these hazardous appliances.\n  Yet when it comes to financial services, we have had no place to go \nto get a similar kind of protection. That analogy has been drawn by \nothers in the past, and I think it is an appropriate one.\n\n[[Page S1222]]\n\n  We have undertaken this effort. It is controversial because I think \nthere are a lot of fears people have about what we are trying to \nachieve with all this. Yet if you look back and you watch what has \nunfolded over the last couple years, and particularly where you see \nsome of these barons of the financial services sector reaping millions \nof dollars in bonuses after their companies have been shored up through \ntaxpayer efforts, and yet the very people who had their homes, their \njobs, their retirement, their health care, their life savings put at \nrisk, what do they get, having come up with the tax dollars to protect \nthese industries? We want to see to it that we never have again the \nconsumer of financial products be unprotected when we start examining \nthese issues.\n  We are working on this issue to put together what I set out as \nprinciples that should be included in a consumer protection watchdog. \nThe failure to protect consumers, as I think most people know, led to \nsome of the dangerous practices we saw and put our economy at so much \nrisk. People were given mortgages they did not understand and could not \nafford. To ensure strong consumer protection, the real question is: \nWill this office have the independence and the authority it needs to \nget the job done to take care of consumers?\n  I focused on four principles from the very beginning of this debate \ninvolving this consumer protection idea we hope to produce. One, that \nit have an independent head appointed by the President of the United \nStates and confirmed by this body, the Senate; second, that it have an \nindependent budget so the office will have the resources it needs to do \nthe job; third, that it have the autonomy to craft rules to protect \nconsumers; and fourth, an ability to enforce those rules as well.\n  With these features, the office, I think, can act to protect \nconsumers from the kinds of abuses we have seen, such as skyrocketing \ncredit card interest rates, an explosion in checking account fees or \npredatory lending by the mortgage industry. Where rent space is less \nimportant--not unimportant, less important--what power and authority it \nhas is the critical question.\n  Obviously, we want to do this in a way that does not jeopardize the \nsafety and soundness of institutions. I do not believe there \nnecessarily is any conflict, although some suggest there may be.\n  We are trying to provide, as well, a mechanism to resolve when, in \nfact, we have some conflict between safety and soundness and consumer \nprotection. I understand that concern. We are trying to accommodate \nthat while simultaneously maintaining the independence and autonomy of \nthis agency.\n  Our goal is to end the status quo, as I said earlier--words I am \ngetting tired of using, but doing nothing is unacceptable--and to \ncreate a system where honest businesses, large and small, can thrive on \na level playing field, where middle-class families can find work, \ninvest with confidence, and achieve the dreams they have for themselves \nand their children.\n  Today, I am pleased to report that good work has been done by \nDemocrats and Republicans both on the Banking Committee to put \nfinancial reform in a strong position. While we do not have a \nbipartisan agreement yet at all, we are trying to. I don't know if it \nwill happen. I am optimistic it can happen. I have been around here \nlong enough to know these things can fall apart easily. It is fragile. \nComplex issues you think you resolved can produce unintended \nconsequences. Most importantly, getting it right--while I would like to \nget it done soon, I want to make sure we do it correctly and properly.\n  This is one of the hardest tasks I have been asked to undertake in my \nyears here, to try and fashion these proposals in a way that can bring \nbroad support in this institution. We do not have an agreement yet, but \nbecause I have colleagues, such as the ones I mentioned on the \nDemocratic side, such as Jack Reed, Mark Warner, Chuck Schumer, Tim \nJohnson--I can go down the list of those who worked on the issues--and \nI also have colleagues such as Bob Corker, Dick Shelby, Judd Gregg, and \nothers to make an effort on that side to see if we can make agreements.\n  I know everything we are hearing about Congress these days, that \nnothing seems to be working here, but we are making an effort to come \nup with a proposal that will achieve those goals, a good, strong bill \nand one that will enjoy good, strong support in this institution.\n  I hope I have not talked too long, but I wished to give at least a \nflavor of where things are today. As I said, we are not done yet. We \nare in a pretty strong position to achieve a good, strong bill and one \nwe can be proud of in this institution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to spend a minute talking about some \nremarks I made this morning, especially in light of how they are being \nirresponsibly mischaracterized by those seeking to score political \npoints.\n  Today, we learned that 36,000 Americans lost their jobs in February. \nThose families don't need today's Department of Labor report or anyone \nelse in Washington to tell them what that means for putting food on the \ntable or making car payments or utility payments or affording their \nhealth care. It is devastating news. If we are going to discuss the \nstate of our economy and the direction in which it is going, if we are \ngoing to talk about it like adults, let us take a step back and put the \nnumber into context.\n  Economists, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News \nWire, and other publications believed that 75,000 to 80,000 Americans \nwere going to lose their jobs last month. That is more than double what \nthe actual number turned out to be. That number, of course, is still \ntoo high. But I was glad this morning when I heard the unemployment \nnumber proved the pundits wrong by some 50 percent. Those economists \nthought the employment rate was going to go up. Well, it didn't. But \nthe unemployment rate is still too high, and anyone from Nevada can \ntell anyone who wants to listen about that fact.\n  We could ask the 40,000 Americans who economists thought were in the \nline of fire but who still had a job to go to this morning, and they \nwill tell you that they were relieved February wasn't as bad as \nexpected. And remember, if you compare where we were last year and \nwhere we are today, if you compare where we were before the Recovery \nAct and where we are now, there is no question we stopped a terrible \nsituation from getting even worse.\n  In the 3 months before the Recovery Act, 750,000 to 800,000 people \nlost their jobs--in those 3 months alone. Then the Recovery Act kicked \nin, and in the last 3 months, that number is down from 750,000 to \n36,000. That is not all. In the quarter before the Recovery Act, the \neconomy shrank by more than 6 percent. In the last quarter, the economy \ngrew by 6 percent. Expert after expert has said as many as 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion people who have jobs today would not have them had we not had \nthe Recovery Act. Expert after expert has said our recession would have \nbecome another depression if we had done nothing, as some urged. Going \nfrom 750,000 to 800,000 job losses to 36,000 is not the end, but it is \na step in the right direction. Taking our economy from a 6-percent \ncontraction to 6 percent growth is not the end, but it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  People should start looking literally at the glass being half full \nrather than half empty. People should start betting on the success of \nthis country, not the failure, as some have done.\n  The President said this morning that the 6-percent growth we had last \nquarter is not the end, but it is a step in the right direction. And as \nhe said this morning, it is still more than we should tolerate. We \ndon't pretend for a minute it is enough. I know Nevada's families and \nbusinesses are hurting, and that is why we are doing even more to put \npeople back to work and why we worked so hard to pass a jobs bill last \nmonth that the House passed yesterday. That is so important.\n  The jobs bill is going to be great for small businesses. It will save \na million highway jobs, allow small businesses to hire people who have \nbeen off work for 60 days, give small businesses an incentive to buy \nthings and write them off for up to $250,000. They do not have to \ndepreciate it. And the Buy America Bonds, one of the premier successful \nissues in our Recovery Act that Governors and local officials wanted, \nis in the bill we passed. I was at the White House, along with others, \nyesterday where the President signed a bill that rewards businesses \nwith tax cuts for keeping jobs here at home and not sending them \noverseas.\n  But again, let us put this in context. What was the response from my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle? It is incredible. We have been \ntold that the bill will create more than 200,000 jobs--the Travel \nPromotion Act. What did my friends on the other side say? They agreed \nwith some of the ideas in the bill, but they decided to play politics \nand they voted against it anyway, with rare exception.\n  It is why we fought so hard to extend unemployment health benefits \nfor those thrown out in the streets by the Republican recession. What \nwas the response of our Republican colleagues to preserve unemployment \ncompensation with unemployment health benefits? The response from my \nRepublican colleagues, even though they said they agreed with helping \nthose who had lost their jobs through no fault of their own, was they \ndelayed and delayed and let the benefits expire. And when thousands \nwere told to go home from their jobs without pay, and with many more at \nrisk, they sat silently by.\n  That is why we passed the Travel Promotion Act, which the President \nsigned yesterday--a bill that would create jobs and cut the deficit by \n$\\1/2\\ billion. It is a bill that will bring foreign tourists to the \nUnited States so they can spend their money all across our country. But \nhow did the Republicans react? They delayed it for months and months \nand months and months, only to vote for it in the end.\n  We will keep going. We will pass a long-term extension of \nunemployment insurance, health benefits for the unemployed and tax cuts \nfor small businesses. We will create incentives for companies to invest \nin renewable energy--projects that will make States\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nsuch as Nevada the leaders of the new clean energy economy, with green \njobs from coast to coast that can never be outsourced. It is why we \nwill finish the job on health care reform, which both bodies of \nCongress have already passed--a plan with contents my State and the \ncountry overwhelmingly support.\n  Fixing our broken health care system will save lives, save money, and \nsave Medicaid and Medicare, but it will also save jobs--as many as 34 \nmillion over the next decade. The reason each of these steps is \nimportant--the Recovery Act, our jobs bill, extension of unemployment \nand health benefits, promoting tourism, tax cuts and incentives, and \nhealth care reform--is because they each add certainty and security to \nour businesses, our States, and our country. They each represent a \nstrong new brick along the road to recovery that we need to build.\n  Yet for some reason, those on the other side simply can't bring \nthemselves to admit what we are doing is working. We are nowhere \nfinished with that work, but the people of Nevada and the rest of the \nAmerican people know that the emergency steps we took and the ones we \nwill take have turned us around and now we are facing in the right \ndirection. We have a long way to go, as the President said, and we will \nmove past this.\n  So I encourage my Republican friends to remember this critical \ncontext before their political reflections lead them to make claims \nthey know to be false. I warn them once again that this country has no \nplace and no patience for those who root for failure.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, March 11, 2010, the people of Lithuania \ncelebrate the 20th anniversary of the reestablishment of the State of \nLithuania.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed a resolution that I, along with Senator \nCardin and Senator Wicker, submitted to commemorate this occasion.\n  An ancient and noble state, mentioned as far back as 1009, \nLithuanians have long revered their independence. On February 16, 1918, \nthe Act of Independence of Lithuania led to the establishment of \nLithuania as a sovereign and democratic state.\n  During World War II, under the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, \nCooperation and Demarcation, Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into \nthe Soviet Union in violation of preexisting peace treaties. During 50 \nyears of Soviet occupation of the Baltic States, the United States \nCongress consistently refused to legally recognize the incorporation of \nLatvia, Estonia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union.\n  On March 11, 1990, the Republic of Lithuania was restored, and \nLithuania became the first Soviet republic to declare independence. A \nlittle over a year later, the U.S. Government formally recognized \nLithuania as an independent and sovereign nation. This year the U.S. \nGovernment and the Government of Lithuania celebrate 88 years of \ncontinuous diplomatic relations.\n  Lithuania is a strong, free market democracy and a full member of the \nUnited Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \nIn 2009 Lithuania assumed Presidency of the Community of Democracies.\n  Lithuania also plays an important part in maintaining international \npeace and stability in Europe and around the world and participates in \ninternational civilian and military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, \nBosnia, Kosovo and Georgia.\n  When I traveled to Lithuania again last year, I was proud not only of \nmy heritage, but to see how far Lithuania has come, despite the many \ndifficulties it endured in the last century. My congratulations to \nPresident Dalia Grybauskaite, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius, and the \npeople of Lithuania on this historic occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1225-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1225-S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PEACE CORPS WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in the early 1960s, President John F. \nKennedy inspired Americans to serve their country in the cause of peace \nby living and working in developing countries throughout the world. \nFrom that inspiration grew an agency devoted to world peace and \nfriendship. The Peace Corps has become an enduring symbol of our \nNation's commitment to encourage progress, create opportunity, and \nexpand development at the grass-roots level in the developing world. In \ngratitude of the nearly 200,000 volunteers who have made significant \ncontributions to improve the lives of people in over 139 countries \nduring the last 49 years, I would like the Senate to recognize the \nPeace Corps and its celebration of National Peace Corps Week.\n  National Peace Corps Week is being held from March 1 through March 7, \n2010. During this time, celebratory and educational events will occur \nacross the country to pay tribute to the Peace Corps' positive \ninfluence on communities here at home and abroad. Thousands of current \nand former Peace Corps volunteers will participate in activities that \nadvance the Peace Corps'\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\ngoals of improving Americans' understanding of other peoples and \nimproving other peoples' understanding of Americans in countries where \nthe Peace Corps serves. The momentous work of Peace Corps volunteers \ntoward these goals represents a legacy of service that has become a \nsignificant part of America's history and positive image abroad.\n  Throughout its history, the Peace Corps has adapted and responded to \nthe issues of the times. In a constantly changing world, Peace Corps \nvolunteers have met new and difficult challenges with creativity, \ndetermination, innovation and compassion in places such as Africa, \nAsia, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Europe, the Pacific \nIslands and the Middle East. Volunteers have made momentous and \nenduring contributions in agriculture, business development, \ninformation technology, education, the environment, health and HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention. Peace Corps volunteers are able to make these \ntremendous contributions through learning more than 250 languages and \ndialects and receiving extensive cross-cultural training that enables \nthem to function effectively at a professional level in different \ncultural settings.\n  It should be noted that in the area of HIV/AIDS awareness and \nprevention, Peace Corps volunteers provide hope and meaningful \nassistance to those affected by this terrible disease. The tireless \nefforts and dedication of volunteers have made the Peace Corps a key \npartner in the global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Peace Corps \nvolunteers are uniquely suited to work in HIV/AIDS awareness and \nprevention because they are trained in the local language, live and \nwork in the communities where they serve, and know how to share \ninformation in a culturally appropriate way.\n  The Peace Corps and its volunteers continue the tradition of making a \ndifference to improve the lives of millions of people around the world. \nPeace Corps volunteers will arrive in Indonesia in the spring of 2010 \nand will work as English teachers in high schools and at teacher \ntraining institutions. In mid-2010, Peace Corps volunteers will return \nto Sierra Leone after a 16-year absence to focus on secondary education \nand work with their host communities on grassroots initiatives and \ncommunity development projects.\n  In conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to personally thank \nthe nearly 7,700 Peace Corps volunteers who are currently making \nsignificant and lasting contributions in 76 countries. Among them I \nwant to recognize the 29 Peace Corps volunteers from the State of \nHawaii who are serving in such diverse places as Zambia, Botswana, \nMicronesia, China, Morocco and Kyrgyzstan. I am extremely proud of \ntheir service and contribution.\n  I take great pleasure in recognizing the achievements of the Peace \nCorps, honoring its volunteers, and reaffirming our country's \ncommitment to helping people help themselves throughout the world.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate National \nPeace Corps Week and to honor the thousands of Americans who serve as \nPeace Corps volunteers throughout the world.\n  The Peace Corps was founded on the ideal that each of us has the \nresponsibility to serve our country and leave our world in a better \nplace than we found it. Peace Corps volunteers provide innovation, \ncreativity, determination, and compassion in an ever-changing world, \nadvancing U.S. interests and the global good. These volunteers \nexemplify the true meaning of service to a greater cause and \ncontributing to the well-being of those in need around the world.\n  Since the Peace Corps' founding in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, \nnearly 200,000 U.S. citizens have chosen to serve their country as \nPeace Corps volunteers in 139 countries around the world. Today, nearly \n8,000 Peace Corps volunteers serve abroad in 76 different countries, \nproviding critical education, expertise, and development assistance to \nthe poor and impoverished across the globe. Their willingness to \ndedicate themselves toward the laudable goal of assisting those in need \nand strengthening the image of America makes them deserving of our \nrespect and admiration.\n  In my own home State of New Hampshire, 48 volunteers have heard the \ncall and are currently devoting their time, energy, and lives to \nfulfilling the vision of President Kennedy and serving abroad in the \ncause of peace. They are placed throughout the developing world--from \nCambodia to Guatemala to Kazakhstan--making significant and lasting \ncontributions toward the health, education, and development in the \nplaces where these things are often needed most.\n  I seek recognition of each of these citizen ambassadors and the many \nPeace Corps volunteers from New Hampshire that have served since 1961. \nIn honor of their efforts, I will ask consent that the attached list of \ncurrent New Hampshire volunteers be printed in the Congressional \nRecord. New Hampshire is proud of your service, and we will continue to \nstand behind you and express thanks for your assistance.\n  In today's interdependent world, American security and prosperity are \ninextricably linked to the security and prosperity of people in the \ndeveloping world. Peace Corps volunteers work on the front lines in our \nbattle for hearts and minds around the globe. They serve as teachers, \nbusiness professionals, health educators, agricultural and \nenvironmental specialists, management and information technology \nadvisors, and mentors and friends to citizens across the globe. As the \nadministration plans to double the size of the Peace Corps in the years \nto come, it is critical to remember that these unofficial ambassadors \nhave become enduring symbols of our nation's commitment to progress, \nopportunity, and grass-roots development in the far corners of the \nworld.\n  Upon the completion of their service abroad, these volunteers then \nreturn home to promote a better understanding here in America of the \nculture, language and viewpoint of those they have served. In our 21st \ncentury world, where the threats and challenges that confront America \nand the global community cannot be overcome by the might of our \nmilitary alone, Peace Corps volunteers are laying the foundation for a \nmore secure, prosperous, and compassionate world. In honor of National \nPeace Corps Week and in celebration of the Peace Corps' 49th \nanniversary, I would like to recognize those volunteers from New \nHampshire, as well as all past and current Peace Corps volunteers, for \ntheir commitment to fostering a better world for future generations.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the chair \nof the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, I will work \nwith our allies and friends throughout the world in the development of \nan American foreign policy that matches the passion and commitment to \nservice of our Peace Corps volunteers abroad.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the list of current \nNew Hampshire volunteers to which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                SWORN-IN VOLUNTEERS IN THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n                                             Senator: Jeanne Shaheen\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Volunteer name                Country of service     Start of service date      Projected COS date\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbrams, Hillary H....................

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate all of the \nathletes who competed in the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia. The Olympics was a spectacular and awe-inspiring \nevent that captured the attention and imagination of people across the \nglobe. While the athletes often come from very different backgrounds \nand cultures, they share a bond that will last forever: each has earned \nthe title of Olympian. Indeed, it was heartwarming to watch these \nathletes come together to showcase their talents in peaceful \ncompetition over a two week span.\n  The United States was represented by an extraordinary group of \nathletes. As a team, these talented and determined competitors brought \nhome 37 medals, the most medals ever for the United States in the \nWinter Games. There were many breathtaking moments and several firsts \nfor the U.S. team. Michigan was well represented with close to two \ndozen athletes competing in a range of sports. I am proud of each \nperson that represented the United States, and I am particularly proud \nof those with ties to Michigan. In fact, leading the parade of American \nathletes and holding the American Flag during the opening ceremonies \nwas Michigan's own Mark Grimmette, a luger who competed in his fifth \nand last Olympic Games.\n  Michigan continued its long tradition of hosting and facilitating the \ntraining of world-class athletes for the Winter Games. More than three \ndozen athletes sharpen their skills at the Olympic Education Center, \nOEC, at Northern Michigan University in Marquette. In fact, the entire \nU.S. short track speed skating team trained at some point at the OEC \nleading up to the Games. This wonderful facility has provided for the \ntraining of athletes in a number of Olympic disciplines and has been an \nintegral part of the success of many Olympic athletes since its \ninception in 1985.\n  Shani Davis, who became the first African-American speed skater to \nwin gold in an individual event in the Winter Games in 2006, displayed \nthe skill and speed that has become his hallmark. This Northern \nMichigan University Alumnus secured gold in the 1,000 meters, setting \nyet another milestone by becoming the first person to win this event in \nback to back Olympic Games. Travis Jayner from Midland earned bronze as \npart of the U.S. 5,000 meter relay team at the Games. Long track speed \nskater Ryan Bedford from Midland also had a solid performance, placing \n12th in the 10,000 meter race in his first Olympic appearance. \nJilleanne Rookard, a speed skater from Woodhaven, competed in three \nindividual and one team event. Her best finish was fourth in the team \npursuit. Competing in her second Winter Games, Kimberly Derrick, a \ngraduate of Northern Michigan University, competed in the 1,500 meter \nindividual race.\n  The United States men's hockey team won silver in Vancouver, a \nremarkable performance that captivated Americans, whether they were \ndedicated hockey fans or newcomers to the sport. The men's journey to \nthe gold medal game was buoyed by goaltender Ryan Miller from East \nLansing, MI. Miller, a Michigan State University alumnus, earned Most \nValuable Player honors for his phenomenal play throughout, which \nenabled the young American team to make a run for the gold. There were \nseveral members of the men's team with ties to Michigan that \ncontributed to the hockey team's success, including Tim Thomas from \nFlint, Tim Gleason from Clawson, Jack Johnson from Ann Arbor, Ryan \nKesler from Livonia and Brian Rafalski from Dearborn, who now plays for \nthe Detroit Red Wings of the NHL. In fact, 14 of the 25 member U.S. \nroster are either from Michigan or played organized hockey at some \npoint in Michigan.\n  The men's gold medal game was one of the great hockey games I have \nseen--and I have seen a lot. The U.S. hockey team tied the score in the \nfinal, hectic seconds of regulation to send this thrilling game into \novertime. While the team ultimately lost in overtime, the heart they \ndisplayed was forever etched in our minds.\n  A number of Red Wings players represented their home countries at the \nWinter Games, including Mike Babcock, head coach of the Canadian team; \nPavel Datsyuk of Russia; Valtteri Filppula of Finland; and Johan \nFranzen, Niklas Kronwall, Nicklas Lidstrom, and Henrik Zetterberg of \nSweden.\n  The U.S. women's hockey team matched the men's success by securing \nsilver in Vancouver. Their dominating performance throughout the \nOlympics culminated in a fierce battle against Canada in the gold-medal \ngame. The lone Michiganian on the team, Angela Ruggiero from Harper \nWoods, played well throughout, scoring three goals and an assist in the \ntournament. In a demonstration of the respect this four-time Olympian \nhas earned, her fellow athletes from around the world selected Ruggiero \nto serve as one of the athletes' representatives to the International \nOlympic Committee.\n  In Ice Dancing, Meryl Davis and Charlie White from West Bloomfield \nand Dearborn, respectively, skated with grace and precision to secure \nthe silver medal. Their performance was truly stunning. Joining them on \nthe medal podium were Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue of Canada. Both teams \ntrain in Canton, MI, at the Arctic Figure Skating Club. Emily Samuelson \nand Evan Bates, who train at the Ann Arbor Figure Skating Club, skated \nbeautifully and finished 11th overall. All three pairs were a joy to \nwatch, and to have three teams that train in Michigan perform so well \nis a tribute to Michigan's commitment to the sport. Along with being a \npart of the 2010 Olympic Team, Meryl, Charlie, Emily, and Evan also are \nstudents at the University of Michigan. Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, \nthe 2006 Torino silver medalists who formerly trained in Canton, MI, \nalso skated well and placed fourth. The two-time United States Men's \nChampion Jeremy Abbott from the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield \nHills placed 9th in the tough and spirited men's individual figure \nskating contest.\n  There were many other dramatic moments and personal triumphs by \nOlympians from Michigan during the 2010 Winter Games. Bobsledder \nMichelle Rzepka from Novi, a graduate of Michigan State University, put \nforth a strong effort and finished sixth overall. Nick Baumgartner from \nIron River competed with style and abundant flair in Snowboardcross in \nVancouver. Caitlin Compton, a Northern Michigan University graduate, \ndisplayed great endurance and perseverance in competing in three cross \ncountry events, with a top finish of sixth in the team sprint free.\n  I know I speak for all Michiganians in expressing appreciation and \ncongratulations to all of the athletes, coaches, and administrators who \ntook part in the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. It is with particular pride \nthat I salute the athletes from Michigan. The commitment, drive, and \ncompetitive spirit of these athletes were on full display for the world \nto witness. The feats of these gifted and determined athletes have \ninspired us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1227-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2968.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nindividuals who are pursuing programs of rehabilitation, education, or \ntraining under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto receive work-study allowances for certain outreach services provided \nthrough congressional offices, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to right a \nbureaucratic wrong that has prevented capable and qualified veterans \nfrom serving their home States as work-study students in Congressional \noffices.\n  For years, veterans have served in the office of their representative \nor senator as a vital part of an office's constituent service efforts. \nThese student veterans gain employment experience while providing \nvaluable expertise to our offices. Student veterans work together with \nour staffs to assist other veterans from their home State wade through \nthe often confusing and lengthy process of receiving benefits from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. Congressional offices benefit by \nproviding better services to their constituents without having to hire \na disproportionate number of people to assist with veterans affairs. \nVeteran work-study students also benefit the VA by shouldering up-front \nsome of the administrative burdens of claims processing.\n  Congressional offices have served as qualified work sites for VA \nwork-study students for over 25 years. Student veterans have worked in \ncongressional offices during my time in both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. In recent months, however, Oregon \ncongressional offices were notified that they would no longer be \neligible sites for VA work-study programs.\n  I am deeply troubled that the proud tradition of student veterans \nserving fellow veterans in Oregon congressional offices is in jeopardy. \nAt a time when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the \nnumber of veterans seeking our help with VA benefits and services, the \ninstability of the program is particularly unfortunate. Moreover, my \nconcerns are heightened due to the reduction in work-study positions \navailable to Oregon veterans during an economic recession that has sent \nunemployment rates over 12 percent in some areas.\n  I share the VA's hope to provide high quality, prompt, and seamless \nservice to veterans and their dependents, through the VA work-study \nprogram. That is why I am introducing legislation today to return these \ntalented student veterans to Congressional offices. These student \nveterans provide an invaluable resource to our staffs. I hope that we \nare able to pass this legislation quickly to provide valuable \nemployment opportunities for our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3082\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPANSION OF WORK-STUDY ALLOWANCE TO INCLUDE \n                   CERTAIN OUTREACH SERVICES CONDUCTED THROUGH \n                   CONGRESSIONAL OFFICES.\n\n       Section 3485(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(G) The following activities carried out at the offices \n     of Members of Congress for such Members:\n       ``(i) The distribution of information to members of the \n     Armed Forces, veterans, and their dependents about the \n     benefits and services under laws administered by the \n     Secretary and other appropriate governmental and non-\n     governmental programs.\n       ``(ii) The preparation and processing of papers and other \n     documents, including documents to assist in the preparation \n     and presentation of claims for benefits under laws \n     administered by the Secretary.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 3083. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe expensing of certain real property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we got some numbers this morning. \nUnemployment seems stuck at 9.7 percent nationally. We lost more jobs. \nIn my home State of Utah, unemployment is at a 23-year high at 6.8 \npercent. I know there are States represented by Senators here that \nwould love to have 6.8 percent as their unemployment rate, but we in \nUtah do not like it.\n  I want to talk about one aspect of the unemployment rate that I think \nhas been ignored in the debate we have had around the country. The \nPresident says we are out of the woods, not far out of the woods, to be \nsure, but that we have turned around, that the recession has started to \nfade, and we are starting to come back. He looks at macronumbers and \nmakes that statement with respect to GDP and all of the rest of that. \nHe is missing a very important fact I want to highlight here today in \nthe introduction of this bill.\n  The economy is driven by a variety of forces. But the one thing we do \nknow about economic activity is that jobs are created primarily by \nsmall businesses. When I say small, I mean really small. Over 7 million \njobs have been lost since the beginning of the recession. We must ask, \nHow many of those have been lost in small businesses? The answer is, \nover half of that number. Over 3.5 million of the jobs that have been \nlost have been lost in small businesses.\n  We hear and look at the reports that are in the newspaper about big \ncompanies that have had layoffs and big companies that have stopped \nhiring. But it is the small businesses in the United States that have \nbeen the engine of economic growth and the engine of hiring all the way \nthrough.\n  I have talked before about my own experiences as a small businessman, \nand I will revisit that here for a moment to put this in context.\n  I have been involved in the creation of a number of businesses. Most \nof them have failed. That is the norm for small businesses. People get \nan idea. People get excited. They get caught up in the idea of having \ntheir own business. They start their own business, and they find it is \nmuch harder than they thought. They find the challenge is much more \ndifficult than they thought or they simply run into challenges that are \nbeyond their control and they end up failing.\n  It is all summarized in a comment made by a woman who attended a \nmeeting of Inc. magazine. Inc. magazine every year chooses the \n``Entrepreneur of the Year'' across the country in the various States. \nI was honored enough to be chosen as the ``Entrepreneur of the Year'' \nwhen I was CEO of a business in Utah, and as a reward for that we went \nto this convention down in Miami Beach. A panel was being held of small \nbusinesspeople.\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\nJust prior to the panel, they announced that after the panel was over \nthere would be a wine and cheese tasting event to be held on the patio \nof this hotel. Then they turned to the panel, and one of the women on \nthe panel said: Entrepreneurs do not drink wine. Entrepreneurs drink \nvodka, neat. We can't do with this gracious living stuff. We are caught \nup in the tremendous pressure of trying to keep our businesses open.\n  I do not drink wine or vodka, but I identified with her comments and \nher sentiments about how tough it is.\n  Well, the President may think the GDP numbers show we have turned the \ncorner. The people in small business recognize that in their part of \nthis economy, we have not. Let me quote from an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal regarding the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness' small business optimism survey. It was in December of last \nyear, and author noted:\n\n       Small-business owners grew even more pessimistic in the \n     final month of 2009, capping off what was a trying year for \n     their businesses. . . .\n       Regular borrowers--those accessing capital markets at least \n     once a quarter--also continued to report difficulties in \n     arranging credit at the highest frequency since 1983, \n     according to the report.\n\n  Mr. President, 1983, for those of us who remember, was the depth of \nthe recession that followed the great inflation of the Jimmy Carter \nyears, as President Reagan and the Congress were dealing with the \ndreaded double dip. We came out of the Jimmy Carter years with a \nrecession, a recovery, and then another recession--the dreaded double \ndip or the ``W-shaped'' recession. Mr. President, 1983 was a very \nchallenging year. I was running a small business at that time as well \nand I remember it very well. All right--the worst attitude with respect \nto their opportunities in small business since 1983, according to \npeople who were on the firing line in small business.\n  So what do we need to try to help small business recover and start \ncreating jobs again? Again, the point I made earlier: More than half of \nthe jobs that are created in America are created with small business, \nand these are small businesses that are doing less than $5 million a \nyear. As I say, I have been involved in creating many of these \nbusinesses. Many of them failed. Fortunately, the small businesses I \nwas involved in creating that did not fail earned enough money to repay \nme for all that I lost in the ones that did and created enough jobs to \novercome the loss of jobs in the ones that failed, and the small \nbusiness we created for which I won the award at Inc. magazine \nultimately went to the New York Stock Exchange and employed 4,000 \npeople. Not bad for a small business that started in somebody's \nbasement with originally four full-time employees. I was No. 5 in that \nbusiness.\n  So I have seen it happen on both sides--the failure side and the \nsuccess side--and I know what it takes. I can tell you, the kinds of \nthings the President is talking about and we have been doing here in \nthis Chamber are not the things small business needs to survive. Let me \ntalk about some of those, and they are in the bill I am offering today.\n  One of the first things we have to recognize is that the worst thing \nthat can happen to a small business financially is to earn a profit. \nYou say: Now wait a minute, obviously you want to earn a profit. Yes, \nyou want to earn a profit. But the worst thing that can happen to you \nis--as you are struggling on a cashflow basis to keep this business \ngoing and you cross the line into profits--the government shows up and \nsays: We want half your profit immediately, and we want it in cash.\n  You want your profit invested in inventory. You want your profit \ninvested in accounts receivable. You want your profit invested in the \ncapital investments that will allow your business to survive, and the \ngovernment says: No. You have earned a profit and we want it in taxes \nand we want it in cash, and we won't take a percentage of your \ninventory and hold it to let you make the business grow. You have to \nliquidate that inventory to pay your taxes in cash.\n  So the first thing that is in my bill will provide a 10-year net \noperating loss carryback provision for qualifying businesses whose \naverage gross revenue per year is $5 million or less.\n  You struggle with the business; you lose money the first year. You \nstruggle with the business; you lose money the second year. You \nstruggle with the business; you lose money the third year. But you keep \nit afloat, and in the fourth year, you start to earn money. And there \nis the government saying: We want our share of your profits, and we \ndon't care that you have been losing money while you have been building \nthis business--you have been losing money on an accrual basis while you \nhave been borrowing from your brother-in-law and your credit card and \nyour bank, and whoever would give you money to cover those losses, and \nnow you are finally at the point where you are making a little profit--\nwe won't give you any consideration for all of those losses you have \nput into building this business. We are going to take our tax bite out \nof this year's profits, and that can be enough to sink the business.\n\n  So this has a net operating loss carryback provision for qualifying \nbusinesses whose average gross revenues are $5 million or less.\n  This is not a break for American Airlines. This is not a break for \nGeneral Motors. This is a break for the person who is trying to \nduplicate the success I was lucky enough to be involved in--where we \nstart something in a basement or a garage and see it grow to the point \nwhere it can go to the New York Stock Exchange.\n  You could say: Well, Senator Bennett, you didn't need this net loss \ncarryback provision when you did that business. That is true because we \ngrew that business in what the New York Times and other publications \ncalled the decade of greed. It was the years of Ronald Reagan when the \ntop marginal tax rate was 28 percent, which meant even paying taxes, we \ngot to keep 72 cents out of every dollar we generated in profit. That \nwas enough to allow us to fund the growth of that business. Today, the \ntop marginal tax rate is over 40 percent. There is a great deal of \ndifference. If we had had to try to grow that business in today's tax \nenvironment--and it went up to that level when Bill Clinton became \nPresident--we probably would not have been able to grow the business \nand we would not have created those jobs and we would not have been \nable to ultimately build a company big enough to go to the New York \nStock Exchange.\n  All right. I can't deal with the marginal tax rate. We don't have \nenough votes to do that. If I could, I would like to get it back to the \n28 percent it was with Ronald Reagan. If we are going to have the tax \nrate where it is, we need at least some kind of relief for small \nbusiness. The 10-year net operating loss carryback provision is a way \nto give them some kind of relief in this time of great economic stress.\n  No. 2--and this gets a little technical--I want to expand the \ndefinition of section 179 expensing to include structural changes to \nthe physical property and make the current $250,000 deduction limit \npermanent.\n  When you are making an investment in your business of a capital good \nthat you need, whether it is a lathe in a machine shop or whether it is \na warehouse and something that requires you to stockpile with material \nbefore you send it out to retailers, whatever it might be, you don't \nwant to have to start paying taxes on the money you put into that \ncapital good. You need the deduction for expensing that right now. That \nis another way to hold your taxes down.\n  This second provision is tied to the first. The first gives you the \nnet operating loss carryback provision. This one says you can expense \nin a much better fashion the money you are putting in up front for your \nstructural activity.\n  Then, No. 3: It sounds very minor, but to a business of the size we \nare talking about it can be significant. I want to increase the current \nstartup cost deduction from $5,000 to $20,000. This will encourage \nentrepreneurs to invest right now rather than wait for the economy to \nimprove.\n  These are the three primary things that will be in the bill I am \nsending to the desk and introducing today.\n  I wish to conclude with these comments. As I move around my State, \nand as I move around the country talking about the state of business--\nback to the reference to the NFIB and their survey about optimism or \npessimism among small business owners. I have\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nnever seen a time of more pessimism than we have now. Even back in the \n1980s when I described the businesses that I was involved in then and \nthe dreaded ``double dip,'' businessmen were not as pessimistic as they \nare now. They still had hope we could come out of this. Now, even while \nthe national GDP numbers are looking good to the people at the White \nHouse, to the people on Main Street it doesn't look so good.\n  This is what I hear: The venture capitalists tell me we are not \nmaking venture capitalist investments anymore. Why? Because the venture \ncapitalist is there to capitalize and to finance the startup, and then \nthe system is supposed to take over and finance the growth. We pick the \nentrepreneur who has the widget or the gadget, whatever it might be \nthat is going to change the world.\n  We say: Yes, your widget is marvelous, and we are going to fund that \nso you can get that going. But once you get it going, the system takes \nover. The banks give you the tools you need for your capital \ninvestment. Other investors come in who are not taking as big a risk as \nwe are because they see now that your widget really does work. So the \nlevel of risk is lower, the system takes over, and we can take our \nventure capital and go out and look for the other entrepreneur who has \na new invention. That is how the whole thing works.\n  They tell me: We discover now the system doesn't take over. We \ndiscover now the money we have put into the widget, the entrepreneur, \nthe inventor, isn't followed on by additional funding. If this \ninvestment we have put in is going to survive, we have to double down \nour bets.\n  Instead of our venture capital now going to the inventor and the \nentrepreneur, our venture capital is going to places where it has never \nbeen required before. As a result, we don't have any left over for the \ntrue venture capital, and the whole system is shutting down in terms of \njob creation. We are getting to a circumstance where new jobs are not \ncoming as a result of venture capital activity. This job creation I \ntalked about and these small businesses are being stifled. That is the \nfirst part of the pessimism.\n  The second part of the pessimism, of course, is that the stimulus \nmoney we have put into the system isn't getting down to small \nbusinesses at all. I received a letter from a small businessman in \nUtah. I identify with him because he has created a business of the same \nkind I have tried to create over my career before I came here.\n  He says: I am writing because I am frustrated. I own a small business \nhere in Utah--he names it. We employed 20 people.\n  In the macro of the world, 20 people aren't very much, not enough to \nreally worry about; except this fellow and his 20 people are \nrepresentative of more than half of the job creation that is going on \nin this country historically.\n  He says:\n\n       I have a small business here in Utah that employs 20 \n     people. Now I am down to 4 people as I can't get financing. I \n     put close to $2 million in technology development.\n\n  There is the venture capitalist side of it.\n\n       We are ready to launch our new system and services, but \n     have run out of funds and can't find investor groups that \n     would be willing to take a risk on technology at a relatively \n     new company. Why can't some of the stimulus money come to us? \n     I would hire 25 to 30 new people if I could receive funding \n     that I need to launch my product and services. Banks won't \n     lend, individuals are holding on to cash, VC groups are \n     looking for companies that have been around a few more years. \n     I don't want to violate SEC rules. Raising funds is \n     difficult.\n\n  I don't have a solution to everything he is saying, but I do believe \nthe kinds of reforms that are in the bill I am introducing will create \na better environment for small business and make it easier for him and \nothers like him to go to investors and say: Look, if you put some money \ninto our business, we would not have to pay taxes as soon as it turns \nthe corner because we will have this net operating carryback for 10 \nyears. We can expense some of the capital investments we make so we \nwould not have to worry about paying taxes on it, and we have a current \nstartup tax deduction that has gone to $20,000.\n  These are very modest kinds of proposals, but they are the kinds of \nproposals that are rooted in real experience in Main Street rather than \nWall Street; from real people who are creating jobs, have created jobs, \nwho are hurting the most in this economy, and upon whom we depend \nprimarily for the new job creation.\n  As I said at the outset, we have bad numbers today. Unemployment has \nnot come down in the Nation. More jobs have been lost. In my home State \nof Utah, we have hit a 23-year high in unemployment. We must look to \nwhere the jobs come from, and the answer to that is small business, and \nwe must do everything we can to try to help small business get started \nand get going and get growing, and that is a way we will get out of \nthis recession.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I value the Senator's views on these issues so much. I \nrecall when the Senator chaired the Joint Economic Committee, the \nSelect Committee of the House and Senate. He was our chairman. Since \nthen he has been known as one of the authoritative voices on our \neconomy, as well as Senate business.\n  I guess I would first say that I am very intrigued by your \nlegislation. It sounds as though it is something that is exactly what \nwe need. I don't, I guess, want to be in a political tit for tat, but I \nremember and recall the Senator from Utah opposing the stimulus package \nthat was on the floor and voting against that and raising concerns \nabout it. I think the general concern most often raised was one that \nNobel Prize Laureate Gary Becker raised: It wasn't one that creates \njobs.\n  I guess I would ask, based on the Senator's experience in the Senate, \nthe amount of money that went into that bill--the purpose was supposed \nto be to create jobs--give us your honest evaluation of how well it has \nperformed.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Alabama for his kind words. My \nown impression is that the stimulus package has created a few jobs with \na very marginal kind of effect. Most of the money, it seems to me, has \nbeen spent in efforts aimed at research, which may or may not produce \njobs 3 years, 4 years, 8 years, 10 years from now.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee we held a hearing just \nyesterday with the Department of Energy and looked at the amount of \nstimulus money that was going into fund research in the Department of \nEnergy and pointed out to the Secretary of Energy that only 7 percent \nof the stimulus money had been spent. To get ready for the energy \nresearch they were going to do, they had to hire new people. It, \nperhaps, has created some government jobs to get ready to examine all \nof the grants and look at all of the proposals and so on. I am not \nopposed to research, but this is not an immediate creation of jobs in \nthe middle of a recession to be spending stimulus money in this \nfashion.\n  I have also come to the conclusion that the jobs that have been \ncreated or saved, as this administration tries to add that word to it, \nhave primarily been government jobs.\n  I don't object to people working for the government. We have many \ncivil servants who provide great value added in the work they do for \nthe government. But the long-term projection of jobs that will add to \nthe economy create new jobs and create new wealth. I do not see that \nthe stimulus has produced any significant difference in that arena.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Utah for those thoughts. What \na tragedy that is. I don't think people realize how much $800 billion \nis.\n  So the Senator's legislation would be far less expensive and would \nimmediately help small businesses create jobs without a government \nbureaucracy telling them what to do. Is that fair to say?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would say to the Senator that is the whole purpose of \nthis. Let entrepreneurs who are taking the risks--drinking vodka neat, \nif you will--have the opportunity to create their businesses without \nthe government showing up immediately and saying: By the tax law, we \nare going to punish you for getting your initial beginnings of success. \nInstead, we are going to delay the impact of the taxes on you until you \nhave a sound financial footing under you. When you have that\n\n[[Page S1233]]\n\nfinancial footing under you, you can afford to pay the taxes and, more \nimportant, you can afford to hire more people who, as a result of their \njobs, will also pay taxes.\n  We must understand a very large reason we are having this deficit is \nnot just the spending, as important as that is; it is the drop in \nrevenue, and the drop in revenue comes because the economy is so bad. \nWe must understand around here that revenue does not come from the \nbudget.\n  Revenue comes from the economy. We can budget any kind of revenue \nnumber we want, but if there are no profits and there are no jobs, that \nmeans there is no income, and the income tax, by definition, is \ndependent on income before it produces any revenue. We will not have \nthe money we need to run the government because the economy will not be \nproducing that revenue.\n  I learned in business you cannot cost-cut your way to profitability. \nCost-cutting is important in a business, and you should make sure you \nare not doing stupid things--and there are businesses that can spend \nthemselves into bankruptcy--but you cannot cost-cut your way into \nprofitability. The top line, the sales, the growth of the company is \nwhat creates profitability.\n  The same principle applies to this economy. Yes, we must cut costs, \nwe must cut spending in the Congress, but the way for a vital country \nis to grow the economy, and the biggest engine of growth in the economy \nhas been and remains small business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/05/senate-section/article/S1233-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3429.
