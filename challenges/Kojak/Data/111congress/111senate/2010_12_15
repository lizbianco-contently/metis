Mr. President, following the remarks of Senator McConnell \nand myself, we will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. \nwith Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. At 10 \no'clock this morning, Senator Bayh will deliver his farewell remarks to \nthe Senate, and at 10:30 a.m. Senator Voinovich will deliver his. I \nspoke yesterday about Senator Bayh and what an outstanding person he is \nand how much we will miss him. I will have something to say in a few \nminutes about Senator Voinovich.\n  At 11 a.m. today, the Senate will resume consideration of the House \nmessage with respect to H.R. 4853, the vehicle for the tax compromise. \nThere will be 1 hour for debate prior to a series of up to four \nrollcall votes. There will be votes on three motions to suspend rule \nXXII, and the last vote will be on the motion to concur with the Reid-\nMcConnell amendment.\n  Following this series of votes, the Senate will resume morning \nbusiness until 2:15. At that time, we intend to move to executive \nsession for the purpose of considering the START treaty. Senators \nshould expect a rollcall vote to proceed to executive session, and for \nthe information of all Senators that is simply a majority vote.\n  Following the vote to proceed to executive session, Senator Lincoln \nwill be recognized to deliver her farewell speech to the Senate. Upon \nconclusion, the Senate will resume executive session.\n  We have Christmas, which is a week from Saturday. We have a lot of \nthings to do. I have talked about that before, but let me just briefly \nsay again what we have to do.\n  We are going to finish this tax bill within the next couple of hours. \nIt is a tremendous accomplishment. Whether you agree with all of the \ncontents of the bill or not, everyone should understand this is one of \nthe major accomplishments of any Congress where two parties, \nideologically divided, have agreed on a major issue for the American \npeople. It will go directly to the House of Representatives. They will \ntake it up quickly.\n  We are going to move to the START treaty. I hope we can have a good, \nfair debate. No one needs to be jammed on it. There is lots of time for \npeople to do what needs to be done. If people want to offer amendments, \nthey can do that. This treaty has been around since April or May. Even \na slow reader could finish every word of that many different times. I \nwould hope no one will require us to read the treaty. What a colossal \nwaste of time. So I hope that is not going to be necessary.\n  We then are going to move to the spending bill, which is so important \nto get done for our country. We will move to that as quickly as we can. \nWe will see how things go with this treaty. But it is clear, I have \nspoken on many occasions with the Republican leader, we are going to be \nin session this Sunday. There is work to do. We hope we can complete \nwhat we have to do a day or two after Saturday. We want to complete the \nthings I have just mentioned. We are going to have to have a vote on \nthe DREAM Act. We have the 9/11 issue. We are working on nominations to \ncomplete the work we need to do this Congress.\n  Unless the House sends us something I am not aware of at this stage, \nI think I have pretty well lined out what we need to do. On \nnominations, the Republican leader knows the President is very \nconcerned about having somebody at the Attorney General's Office. We \nneed somebody to be second in command. The Deputy there has been going \na long time. There has been one Senator holding that up, and we hope \nthat matter can be resolved. The lands bill, we are trying to work it \nout, and we hope we can get that done. It is a bipartisan bill. That is \ncertainly possible.\n  So we have a lot to do, and we need everyone's cooperation to get it \ndone so we can get out of here as quickly as we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10236-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to say a brief word about George \nVoinovich. I have watched him for many years. He has an outstanding \nrecord. He is a Senator from the State of Ohio who came to Washington \nwith as many credentials as anyone could have: a member of the State \nlegislature, the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio, mayor of the \ncity of Cleveland, and now a U.S. Senator. He has a wonderful family.\n  The thing George Voinovich brought to Washington a lot of people \ndon't recognize because of his quiet manner is his work ethic. He gets \nup very early every morning and works on what is necessary in the \nSenate. He studies the bills. He is aware of the issues that are before \nthe Senate on any given occasion. Nothing gets past him. He always is \nup to date on everything we are doing.\n  I haven't agreed with Senator Voinovich on lots of different issues, \nbut he has a quality that we all need to have: You never have to guess \nwhere he stands on an issue. He will always tell you how he feels. That \nhas been a tremendous help to me. There have been occasions when his \nvote has been so very important for, I believe, the Senate, the State \nof Ohio, and certainly the country. He always tells you how he feels, \nwhat he is going to do, and once he makes up his mind that is what he \nis going to do. I admire him very much.\n  I have had such good feelings about people coming from Ohio. I had \nthe good fortune to serve here when John Glenn, a man we all know, one \nof America's all-time great leaders. Ohio produces very good people, at \nleast from my experience in the Senate--Senator Metzenbaum, and now \nSherrod Brown with us. I will not run through a list of everyone.\n  I certainly want the Record to reflect, prior to Senator Voinovich's \nfinal speech today, how much I respect him as a legislator and as a \nperson. I appreciate his friendship and hope in the years to come we \ncan still work together on issues for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10236-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday Democratic leaders unveiled \nan omnibus spending bill that some have described as one last spending \nbinge for a Congress that will long be remembered for doing just that. \nThe Senate should reject it.\n  It appeared to some of us we were making good progress on the economy \nwhen lawmakers in both parties agreed Monday to let taxpayers keep more \nof their own money. But yesterday Democrats unveiled a 2,000-page \nspending bill that repeats all of the mistakes voters demanded that we \nput an end to on election day.\n  Americans told Democrats last month to stop what they have been \ndoing: bigger government, 2,000-page bills jammed through on Christmas \nEve, wasteful spending. This bill is a monument to all three. It \nincludes more than $1 billion to fund the Democratic health care bill. \nFor those of us who have vowed to repeal it, this alone is reason to \noppose the omnibus. It is being dropped on us with just a few days to \ngo before the Christmas break, ensuring that no one in Congress has a \nchance to examine it thoroughly before the vote, and ensuring Americans \ndon't have a chance to see what is in it either. This, too, is reason \nenough to oppose it.\n  For 2 years Republicans have railed against the Democrats for rushing \nlegislation through Congress, but this is, without a doubt, one of the \nworst abuses of the process yet.\n  The voters made an unambiguous statement last month. They don't like \nthe wasteful spending, they don't want the Democratic health care bill, \nand they don't want lawmakers rushing staggeringly complex, \nstaggeringly expensive bills through Congress without\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nany time for people to study what is buried in the details.\n  This bill is a legislative slap in the face to all the voters who \nrejected these things.\n  For the first time in the modern era--for the first time in the \nmodern era--Congress hasn't passed a single appropriations bill--not \none, not one single appropriations bill. Democrats have been too \nfocused on their own leftwing wish list to take care of the very basic \nwork of government.\n  Now, at the end of the session, they want to roll all of these bills \ntogether, along with anything else they haven't gotten over the past 2 \nyears, and rush it past the American people just the way they jammed \nthe health care bill through Congress last Christmas. We all remember \nbeing here every single day throughout the month of December last year \nfor a 2,700-page health care bill passed on Christmas Eve. This is \neerily reminiscent of the experience last December, and I predict the \nAmerican people have the same reaction to this bill as they did to the \nhealth care bill a year ago.\n  A more appropriate approach is available to us. We could pass a \nsensible, short-term continuing resolution that gets us into next year \nwhen the new Congress will have the opportunity to make a determination \non how best to spend the taxpayers' money. The government runs out of \nmoney, by the way, this Saturday. Congress should pass a short-term CR \nimmediately. We need to pass this tax legislation we voted on earlier \nthis week. And we should accomplish the most basic function of \ngovernment. We can at least vote to keep the lights on around here. I \nmean, the deadline for funding the basics of government was last \nOctober, and here we are on December 15 proposing treaties--treaties. \nWe ought to pass the tax legislation and keep the lights on. Everything \nelse can wait.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10237-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are soon going to vote on \nthe bipartisan compromise on extending the expiring tax cuts and \nunemployment benefits. Although, as I described yesterday, it is a \nbitter pill to swallow because of the extended funding that will cause \nthe deficit to rise, I doubt there is anybody in this Chamber who wants \nthe alternative; that is, inaction or a political stalemate which is \ncertainly not an option.\n  Job growth remains anemic. For many of our constituents who are \nstruggling to make ends meet in the midst of this jobless economic \nrecovery, unemployment benefits have already expired. Without action, \non January 1, those fortunate enough to have a job would see a \nsignificant drop in their paychecks as the middle-class tax cuts \nenacted 10 years ago also expire, with the effect that the taxes would \nbe going up all across the income spectrum.\n  So out of this stark reality facing us on January 1, this is when \npeople of good will have come together--people of good will who have \ndifferent opinions, and who, as I said, have to swallow hard on some of \nthe parts of this package. It is my intention, as we vote in just a few \nhours, to vote for this package. It does provide relief that is \ncritical for middle-class families.\n  For example, for a family making $63,000 a year, if we didn't pass \nthis bill, and the existing tax law expired, then that income level, a \nfamily earning $63,000--their taxes would go up by $2,000. This bill \nprevents that. These middle-class tax cuts are extended in this \nlegislation for a period of 2 years, and that includes the 10-percent \nincome tax bracket, the $1,000 child tax credit, an increase in the \nstandard deduction for married couples, and an expansion of the 15-\npercent tax bracket for married couples. The bill rewards work by \ncontinuing provisions in the 2009 Recovery Act that expanded the \nearned-income tax credit and the refundable tax credit.\n  The bill also continues the tax credit that allows taxpayers to claim \na $2,500 tax credit for all 4 years of their higher education. In my \nState of Florida, 600,000 Florida taxpayers benefited from that tax \ncredit.\n  It also has significant consequences for everybody across the board. \nFor example, without an extension of the unemployment benefits through \nthis coming year, 7 million unemployed workers would lose one of the \nlast lifelines available to them. This bill is going to breathe life \ninto the private sector through a payroll tax reduction of 2 percent \nfor 1 year. What that does is put more money into people's pockets, \nwhich they will then go out and spend. That spending will turn over in \nthe economy and that will produce jobs.\n  The bill includes provisions of particular importance to my State. \nOur State is one of six that does not have an income tax. As you know, \nwhen you calculate your Federal income tax, you can deduct your State \nincome tax. For those six States, we finally got a provision in 6 years \nago--whereas we don't have an income tax in Florida, we have a State \nsales tax. We put that in, and that is a deductible item, comparable to \nother States that have an income tax--to deduct that in the calculation \nof the Federal income tax. I am pleased that this agreement extends \nthat deduction.\n  The bill also has an extension of section 1603, which is the Treasury \ngrant program for renewable energy projects, to convert tax credits for \nthe production of renewable electricity into an upfront investment tax \ncredit, and to receive a grant in lieu of the investment tax credit. \nCertainly, as we are trying to move to renewable energy, that keeps \nthat alive. It is badly needed. But what it illustrates is that there \nwere some 20 to 25 Senators out here on the floor yesterday who were \ntalking about our commitment to roll up our sleeves going into the next \nyear, to try to do something about the reduction of spending and, \ntherefore, reduction of the deficit, at the same time reforming a Tax \nCode that has gotten so complicated and so fraught with special \ninterest provisions that it is crying out for reform. One way or \nanother, we are going to have to make it happen. I believe that what we \nare going to vote on this afternoon is the first step of a badly needed \neffort toward restoring trust and confidence and starting to get our \neconomy moving again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we look at the bill we are going to be \nvoting on today, it is an interesting perspective if you are outside of \nAmerica looking at it. Here is what people are saying. You are going to \nstimulate the economy with a 2-percent reduction in payroll taxes. You \nare not going to raise income tax rates. Then you are going to spend \nanother $136 billion. But for all this you are going to borrow the \nmoney.\n  We spent 8 months on a deficit commission addressing the very real \nproblems that are about to become acute for our country. I have no \ndisregard for those who bring this bill to the floor. But to bring this \nbill to the floor without the opportunity to cut wasteful Washington \nspending to at least pay for the outflows that are going to come as a \nresult of this bill, which will be the $136.4 billion I mentioned--\nwithout an opportunity to at least make an effort for the American \npeople to see we understand that part of the waste and duplication and \nlow priority items that the Federal Government is presently\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\nenabling to happen--to not offer and have the opportunity to offer a \nway to not charge that to our children and grandchildren denies the \nreality of everybody else in the world that is looking at our country.\n  This afternoon, or later this morning, I will be offering an \namendment that will suspend the rule, including any requirements for \ngermaneness, and we will have a vote. We are going to have an amendment \nthat cuts $156 billion from the Federal Government to pay for the $136 \nbillion that is actually going to go out the door in the next 11 or 12 \nmonths. It is not an easy vote. But the world is going to be looking to \nsee if we get it.\n  Not only are the people in this country disgusted with our actions, \nthat we continue to borrow and steal and beg from future generations, \nbut the world financial markets are going to see this. You saw the \nreaction of Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who worked for 8 months \ntrying to drive an issue to get us back on course and create a future \nfor us that will allow us to control our destiny rather than someone \nelse doing it.\n  This is just a drop in the bucket--this amendment--to the waste, \nduplication, and the fraud. We are going to run trillion dollar \ndeficits as far as the eye can see right now, with no grownups in the \nroom to say we are going to quit doing that. We are going to continue \nto do that.\n  What are some of the things in this amendment? A congressional pay \nfreeze; a cut in the executive branch and congressional budget of 15 \npercent; a freeze on the salaries and the size of the Federal \nGovernment; limiting what the government can spend on planning, travel, \nand new vehicles; selling unneeded and excess Federal property; \nstopping unemployment benefits to people who are millionaires--by the \nway, we are sending unemployment benefits to people who are unemployed \nand have assets in excess of $1 million; collecting unpaid taxes \ncurrently in excess of $4 billion owed by Federal employees and Members \nof Congress; force consolidation of duplicative programs; preventing \nfraud, taking some of the $100 billion that is defrauded from Medicare \nand Medicaid every year, and preventing that from happening by the FAST \nAct; streamlining defense spending and reducing foreign aid, including \nvoluntary excess contributions to the United Nations.\n  The people of the world are astounded that we would spend another \n$136 billion and make no attempt to get rid of the excesses, waste, and \nduplication in our Federal Government. Because we are not allowed under \nthe regular order to offer amendments--and I understand the purpose for \nthat--this amendment will require 67 votes.\n  The American people are going to be looking, and they are going to \nsay: Does the Senate get it? Do they understand the severity and the \nurgency of the problems that face our fiscal future?\n  When the Joint Chiefs of Staff of our entire military say that the \ngreatest problem facing America is not our military challenges but our \ndebt, it should give us all pause to consider the reality and impact of \nour excess.\n  I yield for Senator Chambliss.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby my good friend from Oklahoma. America is today at a crossroads--a \ncrossroads where we have the opportunity as policymakers to go in the \ndirection that the people of America said we should go in on November 2 \nor to have the opportunity to go down the road of continuing to spend \nmoney by this body and the body across the Capitol, without paying for \nthe money we are spending.\n  These amendments are pretty simple and straightforward. What they say \nis that we as policymakers have an obligation to listen to the people \nwho sent us here, listen to the people who said, by golly, we don't \nlike the way you are running the financial resources that we send to \nWashington. And here we are, the minority leader, Senator McConnell \njust sat down from saying and talking about an omnibus bill that goes \nin the wrong direction--a direction that is totally opposite of what \nthe people of America said they wanted on November 2.\n  Now we are going to have a vote today on the tax package that, in my \nopinion, is a good package. Only in Washington is a package which says \nthat if you continue to tax people at the rate they are being taxed \ntoday, it adds to the deficit. There is another part to that. There are \nadditions to that tax package that do provide for additional spending--\nspending that can be paid for, without any feeling on the part of the \noffsets, or the people who are going to be affected by the offsets, as \nSenator Coburn has proposed.\n  These amendments make common sense, they make business sense, and \nthey certainly make the kind of sense that the people in America want \nus to start reacting to and providing for.\n  Mr. President, America's finances are on an unsustainable path, and \nwe cannot ignore this fact by continuing to pass legislation that we \nhave not paid for.\n  The amendments offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, \nare an opportunity for this body to act responsibly so that America's \nfuture prosperity is not stifled by insurmountable debt.\n  All of us in this Chamber believe some portion of this bill should be \npaid for. Here is a chance to show we mean just that. These amendments \nprovide billions of dollars of savings by eliminating wasteful \nspending, and by consolidating duplicative programs.\n  Moreover, these proposals are bipartisan, having been recommended by \nthe President's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. In \naddition, the amendments include ideas put forth by Presidents George \nW. Bush and Barack Obama to terminate certain Federal programs.\n  We are all aware of the tepid, seemingly unstable economic recovery \nfrom the financial crisis of the past few years. Raising taxes in the \nface of high unemployment and volatile economic times would injure what \nslow growth our economy has, in fact, achieved.\n  However, despite almost unanimous support for extending the emergency \nunemployment insurance benefits, they are still unpaid for in this \nlegislation.\n  If we cannot figure out a way to pay for something that nearly \neveryone in this body supports, how will we ever truly address our \ncurrent spending and debt levels? When will we turn and face the \nunavoidable hard choices?\n  There is no better time than now. These amendments provide $46 \nbillion in savings this year, and $156 billion 5 years.\n  Much of the savings can be accomplished by cleaning up our own house. \nSpecifically, this amendment proposes a congressional pay freeze and a \n15-percent reduction in Congress's budget; a freeze on how much can be \nspent on the salaries for Federal employees and a reduction in the \nnumber of government bureaucrats; limiting the amount that the \ngovernment can spend on printing, travel and new vehicles; selling \nunneeded and excess Federal property.\n  In the interests of strengthening America's financial future, we have \nto make the tough choices. These amendments do just that.\n  We must show the American people that we have the good faith, the \ncourage, and the will to confront the challenges before us by working \ntoward sound fiscal decisionmaking, by managing our debts and paying \nour bills just as millions of American families have to do month after \nmonth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will close with the following comment. \nThe Gallup organization came out today with the latest approval rating \non Congress. Do you know what it is? It is 13 percent. Thirteen percent \nof the people in this country have confidence in what we are doing and \n87 percent do not.\n  I side with the 87 percent. I think they have it right. If we \ncontinue with the omnibus package, and we continue to have our \nearmarks, and we continue to pass expenditures by not reducing \nexpenditures elsewhere, it is going to sink even lower.\n  What does that really mean, that only 13 percent of the people in \nthis country have confidence in us? What it really means is that the \nlegitimacy of our positions and our power is in question. Everybody \nrecognizes the problems in front of us. The question is, Will you make \nthe hard choices and do the tough part to get us out of the problems we \nhave? We can no longer borrow money we don't have to spend on things we \ndon't need.\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and welcome the comments of the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if I could be permitted a few moments of \npersonal privilege before I begin my formal remarks, there are so many \npeople I need to express my heartfelt gratitude to today, starting \nwith, of course, my wonderful wife Susan. I know we are not supposed to \nrecognize people in the gallery, but I am going to break the rules for \none of the first times here to thank my wife. We have been married for \n25 wonderful years, and frankly, Mr. President, I wouldn't have been \nelected dog catcher without Susan's love and support.\n  I often remember a story during my first campaign where I met an \nelderly woman who took my hand, looked up into my eyes, and said: Young \nman, I am going to vote for you.\n  I was curious and asked her why.\n  She said, with a twinkle in her eye: Well, I have met your wife. It \nseems to me you did all right with the most important decision you will \never make. I will trust you with all the other ones too.\n  It is not uncommon in our State, as Senator Lugar could attest, that \npeople say they really vote for Susan's husband.\n  Darling, I can't thank you enough.\n  She was a wonderful first lady, is a phenomenal mother, and is the \npartner for my life.\n  Next, I would like to express my gratitude to my parents. Even though \nthey were very busy, I never doubted for a moment that I was the most \nimportant thing in their lives. There is no question that my devotion \nto public service stems from their commitment--something, Mr. \nPresident, I think you can relate to as well. I have always admired my \nfather's selfless commitment to helping our State and Nation. I am \nproud to follow in his footsteps here in the Senate and to share his \nname. My mother taught me that even from the depths of adversity can \ncome hope. She was diagnosed with cancer at age 38, passed from us at \nage 46--an age I now recognize to be much, much too young. I miss her, \nbut I suspect, as so often in my life, she is watching from on high \ntoday.\n  Next, to my wonderful sons, Nick and Beau. They came into our lives \nwhen I was still Governor and were barely 3 when I was sworn in to the \nSenate. They are the joys of my life. I hope that one day they will \ndraw inspiration, as I did, from their upbringing in public service and \nwill choose to devote themselves in some way to making our country and \nState better places.\n  I am so proud of you, my sons.\n  Next, to my devoted staff and to the staff who serves us here in the \nSenate. My personal staff has had the thankless task for 12 years of \nmaking me look better than I deserve, and in that, they have performed \nheroic service. They have never let me down. To the extent I have \naccomplished anything on behalf of the public, it is thanks to their \ntireless efforts and devotion. Each could have worked fewer hours and \nmade more money doing something else, but they chose public service.\n  It has been an honor to work with you. I will miss each of you and \ncan only hope we will remain in touch throughout the years. No one has \nbeen privileged to have better support than I have.\n  To the men and women who work in the Senate and make it possible for \nus to do our jobs, I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude. You have \nalways been unfailingly courteous and professional. The public is \nfortunate to have the benefits of your devotion. And on behalf of a \ngrateful nation and a thankful Senator, let me express my appreciation.\n  Next, to my colleagues. More about each of us later, but let me \nsimply say it has been my privilege, the privilege of my lifetime, to \nget to know each of you. There is not one of you who is not exceptional \nin some way or about whom I do not have a fond recollection. Each of \nyou occupies a special place in my heart.\n  I am especially fortunate to have served my career in the Senate with \nSenator Richard Lugar. I have often thought Congress would function \nbetter if all Members could have the kind of relationship we have been \nblessed to enjoy. He has been unfailingly thoughtful and supportive. \nEven though we occasionally have differed on specific issues, we have \nnever differed on our commitment to the people of our State or to the \nstrength of our friendship.\n  Dick, thanks to you and Char for so much. You are the definition of a \nstatesman.\n  Finally, to the wonderful people of Indiana, for whom I have been \nprivileged to work almost an entire adult life. Hoosiers are hard \nworking, patriotic, devout, and full of common sense. We are Middle \nAmerica and embrace middle-class values. The more of Indiana we can \nhave in Washington, frankly, the better Washington will be.\n  To my fellow Hoosiers, let me say that while my time in the Senate is \ndrawing to a close, my love for you and devotion to our State will \nremain everlasting.\n  As I begin my final formal remarks on this floor, my mind goes back \nto my first speech as a U.S. Senator. It was an unusual beginning. I \nwas the 94th Senator to deliver remarks in the first impeachment trial \nof a President since 1868. The session was closed to the public; \nemotions ran high; partisan divisions were deep. It was a \nconstitutional crisis, and the eyes of the Nation and the world looked \nto the Senate.\n  My first day as Senator, I was sworn in as a juror in that trial. \nThere were no rules. All 100 of us gathered in the Old Senate Chamber. \nThe debate was hot, but we listened to each other. We all knew that the \nfate of the Nation and the judgment of history--things far more \nimportant than party loyalty or ideological purity--were in our hands.\n  Consensus was elusive. Finally, we appointed Ted Kennedy--John \nKerry's esteemed colleague--a liberal Democrat, and Phil Gramm, a \nconservative Republican, to hammer out a compromise. And they did. \nTheir proposal was adopted unanimously.\n  The trial of our chief magistrate, even in the midst of a political \ncrucible, was conducted in accordance with the highest principles of \ndue process and the rule of law. The constitutional balance of powers \nwas preserved and the Presidency saved. The Senate rose above the \npassions of the moment and did its duty.\n  Three years later, the Senate was once more summoned to respond in a \nmoment of crisis. The country had been attacked and thousands killed in \nan act of suicidal terror. This building had been targeted for \ndestruction and death, and that would have occurred but for the \nuncommon heroism of ordinary citizens. I was told not to return to my \nhome for fear assassins might be lying in wait. So I picked up my sons \nfrom their school, and we spent the night with a neighbor.\n  Two days later, those Senators who could make it back to Washington \ngathered in the Senate Dining Room. There were no Democrats or \nRepublicans there, just Americans. Without exception, we resolved to \ndefend the Nation and to bring to justice the perpetrators of that \nhorrible crime. The feeling of unity and common purpose was palpable.\n  Fast-forward another 7 years. In October 2008, I was summoned, along \nwith others, late at night to a meeting just off this floor. The \nfinancial panic that had been gathering force for several months had \nattained critical mass.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, spoke first. He turned \nto the new head of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and said: Ben, \ngive the Senators a status report.\n  Bernanke, in his low-key, professorial manner, said: The global \neconomy is in a free fall. Within 48 to 72 hours, we will experience an \neconomic collapse that could rival the Great Depression. It will take \nmillions of jobs and thousands of businesses with it. Companies with \nwhich all of you are familiar will fail. Trillions of dollars in \nsavings will be wiped out.\n  There was silence. We looked at each other, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and asked only one question: What can be done?\n  The actions that emanated from that evening helped to avoid an \neconomic catastrophe. The jobs of millions and millions of people were \nsaved, businesses endured. But the measures required were unpopular. My \ncalls were running 15,000 to 20,000 opposed and\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\nonly about 100 to 200 in favor of acting. The House initially voted \ndown the measures. The economy teetered on the edge of the precipice, \nbut Senators did our duty. Some sacrificed their careers that evening. \nThe economy was saved.\n\n  I recount these moments of my tenure to remind us of what this body \nis capable of at its best. When the chips are down and the stakes are \nhigh, Senators, regardless of party, regardless of ideology, regardless \nof personal cost, doing their duty and selflessly serving the Nation we \nlove are capable of great things.\n  On my office wall hangs a famous print--the Senate in 1850. There is \nHenry Clay; there is Daniel Webster, Thomas Hart Benton, John C. \nCalhoun, William Seward, Stephen Douglas, James Mason, and Sam Houston. \nGiants walked the Senate in those days. My colleagues, they still do.\n  In ``Profiles in Courage,'' John Kennedy tells the stories of eight \nU.S. Senators whose actions of selflessness and fortitude rescued the \nRepublic in times of trial. Serving in this body today are men and \nwomen capable of equal patriotism if given a chance--new profiles in \ncourage waiting to be written. It shouldn't take a constitutional \ncrisis, a terrorist attack, or a financial calamity to summon from each \nof us and from this body collectively the greatness of which we are \ncapable, nor can America afford to wait.\n  We are surrounded today by gathering challenges that, if unaddressed, \nwill threaten our Republic--our growing debt and deficits, our \nunsustainable energy dependence, increasing global economic \ncompetition, asymmetric national security challenges, an aging \npopulation, and much, much more. Each of these challenges is difficult, \neach complex. The solutions will not be universally popular, but all \ncan be surmounted, and I am confident they will be with the right \nleadership from us and the right ideas. I am confident because I know \nour history and I know our people. I know all of the challenges we have \novercome--the wars, the economic hardships, the social turmoil. I know \nthe character of the American people--our resiliency, our innate \ngoodness, and our courage--and I know we can succeed. But it will not \nbe easy, and it will not happen by itself. It is up to us.\n  America is an exceptional nation because each generation has been \nwilling to make the difficult decisions and, yes, the occasional \nsacrifices required by their times. America is a great nation not \nbecause it is preordained but because our forebears, both here in the \nSenate and across the Nation, made it so. For 10 generations, the \nAmerican people have been dedicated to the self-evident truth that all \nof us are created equal and have been endowed by our creator with \ninalienable rights.\n  From the beginning, it is freedom that has been the touchstone of our \ndemocracy--freedom not from the benevolence of a king, not by the \nforbearance of the majority, not by the magnanimity of the State, but \nfrom the hand of Almighty God; the freedom to enjoy the fruits of our \nlabors, the freedom to speak our minds and worship God as we see fit, \nthe freedom to associate with those of our own choosing and to select \nthose who would govern us.\n  From the hillsides of ancient Athens to the fields of Runnymede, to \nthe village greens of Lexington and Concord, to the Halls of this great \nSenate, it has always been the same: The innate human longing for \nindependence now finds its truest expression in the American \nexperiment. We are the guardians of that dream.\n  Each generation of Americans has been called to renew our commitment \nto that ideal, often in blood, always with sacrifice. Now is our time. \nNow is the time for us to keep faith with those who have come before \nand to do right by those who will follow, to lift high the cause of \nfreedom in all of its manifestations within its surest sanctuary--this \nU.S. Senate.\n  All of this was put into perspective for me one day on a visit to \nWalter Reed Army hospital. I was visiting wounded soldiers. There was a \nyoung sergeant from Georgia. He had been married 3 weeks before \ndeploying to Iraq. He was missing his left arm and both legs. His wife \nsat by his side. A look of dignified calm was upon his face. I asked if \nhe was receiving the care he needed. Yes, he said, he was. I asked if \nthere was anything I could do. No. No, there was not. Anything he \nneeded? No.\n  I had never felt so helpless or so insignificant.\n  I left his room and made my way to the hospital front door and walked \noutside into the bright sunshine, sat upon the curb, and cried.\n  All I could think of was what can I do--what can I do to be worthy of \nhim? What can each of us do? Look at what he sacrificed for America. \nWhat are we prepared to give? Is it too much to think that while \nsoldiers are sacrificing limbs on our behalf, that we can look across \nthe aisle and see not enemies but friends, not adversaries but fellow \ncitizens?\n  With service men and women laying down their lives, can we not lay \ndown our partisanship and rancor but for a while? Can we not remember \nwe are but ``one nation under God,'' with a common heritage and common \ndestiny? Let us no longer be divided into red States and blue States \nbut be united once more into 50 red, white, and blue States. As the \ncivil rights leader once reminded us: ``We may have arrived on these \nshores in different ships, but we are all in the same boat now.''\n  My friends, the time has come for the sons and daughters of Lincoln \nand the heirs of Jefferson and Jackson to no longer wage war upon each \nother but to instead renew the struggle against the ancient enemies of \nman: ignorance, poverty, and disease. That is why we are here. That is \nwhy. If I have been able to contribute even a little to reconciliation \namong us, then I have done my duty.\n  My prayer is that in the finest traditions of this Senate--both in my \ntime and my father's time and in days before--we may once again serve \nto resolve our differences, meet the challenges that await us, and in \nso doing forge an American future that is worthy of our great past. So \nthat when our children's children write the history of our time, they \nmay truly say of us: Here were Americans and Senators worthy of the \nname.\n  I thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to speak for the next 5 minutes. I \nunderstand Senator Voinovich is on his way, but I would like to speak \nfor the next 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this Senate is not going to be the same \nplace without the Senator from Indiana. In fact, it will be a lesser \nplace because he has been such an outstanding Senator. I wish to let \nhim know he will be very much missed. He contributed enormously, in his \nvery quiet and dignified but powerful way, to many important issues, \nboth domestic and international. We look forward to hearing a lot more \nfrom Governor Bayh and Senator Bayh in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10240-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10240-S10241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LOW INCOME HOUSING FIX\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the leadership on both sides for \ngiving me an opportunity, in just a few minutes, to have a portion of \nthe time when it comes to the discussion of the bill we are going to be \nvoting on at noon. But I thought before I got to that time I had been \nallotted in the unanimous consent agreement--and I am very grateful to \nthe leadership on both sides for giving me that opportunity--I would \ntake a minute to give a preview while there was no one on the floor \nasking for time now.\n  This massive tax bill has been negotiated by many people of good \nwill. I see the Senator from Montana, the Finance Committee chair, who \nhas been at the table in these negotiations, and Senator McConnell and \nSenator Kyl and Senator Reid--men who have truly worked very hard. \nThere were representatives from the White House in these negotiations. \nI know in their minds they did their very best. I have had some serious \nissues with portions of the package. I have expressed those on the \nfloor of the Senate on behalf of the constituents I represent. I think \nI have made my points. I think they have been very clear. I appreciate \nthe\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nopportunity, as a Senator, to be able to voice those complaints.\n  I am not on the floor right now to talk about the major pieces of \nthat tax package with which I strongly disagree. I intend to vote for \nit. I signaled that in the vote 2 days ago. I am unhappy with many \npieces of it, but that is not why I am here to speak today. I am here \nto ask the Members of this Senate to consider, when I ask unanimous \nconsent later this morning, to grant unanimous consent to fix a \nmistake. I am going to ask, in just a few minutes, for the Senate to \nfix a mistake that was made in the negotiations. I am going to need all \n100 Senators to say yes in order to fix this mistake.\n  Senator Vitter, Senator Shelby, Senator Sessions, Senator Cochran, \nand Senator Wicker--all the Senators from both parties in all the Gulf \nCoast States that are affected by this amendment--join me in this \nrequest. There is not any difference of opinion among those of us who \nrepresent these States. Only these States are affected by this \namendment. It is very narrowly crafted. It has to do with a placed-in-\nservice date for low-income housing; that is all, low-income housing.\n  We lost, as many people will recall, 6 years ago, over 250,000--not \n5,000, not 25,000, not 50,000 but 250,000--homes in the aftermath of \nKatrina, Rita, and the great flood that ensued. It is only 6 years ago \nthat happened so, of course, we are still trying to build housing, \nprivate, stand-alone, single-family housing, multifamily housing, \nhousing for seniors. It is a huge work. In fact, it may be the largest \nsingle residential building program going on in this century, maybe not \nafter World War II--I don't have the figures--but it has been a huge \nresidential rebuilding program.\n  This GO Zone package was crafted with the help of almost every \nSenator in the aftermath, and we are grateful. It had basically three \nmain components, what I call bonds for big infrastructure project \ndevelopment, bonds for historic credits, because many of these \nneighborhoods--particularly Waveland, New Orleans, some of these \nhistoric places along the gulf coast--were destroyed. We wanted to \npreserve, when we rebuilt, the historic nature, so we asked the Senate \nand were granted historic preservation credits: the low-income housing \ntax credits to replace the thousands of low-income units for seniors, \nfor the disabled and for the poor and the working poor. In this \npackage, the negotiators got everything, but they forgot and left out--\nout of the total $800 million for the GO Zones for all the Gulf Coast \nStates, for everything I just described--they forgot to extend the \nplaced-in-service date for the low-income housing projects.\n  As a result, and I see Senator Voinovich on floor--and I know he is \nin line to speak--as a result, if we do not fix this today--it is not \ntruly an amendment, it is a correction to the underlying bill--these \nprojects will come to a halt. There are 77 of them. They are narrow. It \ndoes not open Pandora's box. It fixes a mistake. I have testimony from \nthe Senator from Montana, I have testimony from the White House, I have \ntestimony from the Republican leadership that it was not their \nintention and that they did not understand clearly enough that if this \nplaced-in-service date was not extended, these projects--they thought \nthey could go on. They cannot. They will come to a halt.\n  It is only low-income housing projects, only in the gulf, and there \nare only 77 of them. Not all of them will collapse, but the largest \nwill because they cannot be corrected. They cannot be built in this \nyear alone. We need to give them 2 years to be built. If we can do \nthat, the great redevelopment of the city of New Orleans and the region \nwill continue.\n  Please, in the next hour, my colleagues, contemplate this. I am going \nto ask for your unanimous consent. I hope I can get it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I know there is an order for the Senator from Ohio to \nspeak. I would ask for the Senator's indulgence for maybe 15 or 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Sure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have discussed this matter with the \nSenator from Louisiana. She is right. These projects cannot be built \nfast enough. There is just not enough time. The placed-in-service date \nshould be extended an extra year. It is not expensive at all. I hope we \ncan find some way to accommodate this need.\n  The people in Louisiana and the whole gulf coast need this extended \nservice date because, otherwise, these homes will not be built. I hope \nwe can find some way to pass what the Senator from Louisiana is \nsuggesting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

At this \nstage in my life, I look back on my 44 years in public service and I \ncannot help but thank God for the immeasurable blessings he has \nbestowed upon me. Each time I walk the steps of the Senate, I look up \nat the Statue of Freedom on the top of our Capitol dome, and I think of \nmy grandparents who came to America with nothing but the clothes on \ntheir back. They could not read or write and spoke only a few words of \nEnglish.\n  I have to pinch myself as a reminder that this has not been just a \nwonderful dream. The grandson of Serbian and Slovenian immigrants who \ngrew up on the east side of Cleveland is a U.S. Senator. Only in \nAmerica.\n  Truly none of us should take for granted the economic and political \nfreedoms we have. My dad used to say the reason we have more of the \nworld's bounty is because we get more out of our people because of our \nfree enterprise and educational systems. Mr. Gudikuntz, my social \nstudies teacher, said: A democracy is where everyone has an equal \nopportunity to become unequal.\n  So during my final days in the Senate, I think of the people in my \nlife who have gotten me up the steps to this hallowed Chamber: My wife \nof 48 years Janet is God's greatest blessing to me. She has never \npulled or pushed me, but she has always been at my side; my three \nchildren on Earth, George, Betsy and Peter, and my angel in Heaven, \nMolly, and my eight grandchildren, my siblings and their extended \nfamilies. It is not easy to have a father, brother, or uncle in this \nbusiness. The people of Ohio who have facilitated my election to seven \ndifferent offices, who have stuck with me even though on occasion they \nhave not agreed with me, have my deep appreciation. I can never thank \nthem enough. I hope they know that every decision I have made and every \npolicy I have crafted, although not always the easiest or most popular \nat the time, was aimed to improve and make a positive difference in our \nlives. I am very humbled to have been given the privilege to serve them \nthrough the years.\n  Here in the Senate, my wonderful staff, both in Ohio and in \nWashington, I am so proud of what they have done for me and the people \nof Ohio. I take fatherly pride in having had the chance to touch their \nlives and see them grow. I also think of our colleagues in the other \nSenate offices who have helped and cooperated with them as we worked \ntogether to solve our Nation's problems, meet challenges, and seize \nopportunities. My colleagues and I should be most humble; for all we \nare is a reflection of these wonderful, loyal, hard-working \nindividuals.\n  I also thank all of you in this Chamber for your courtesies you have \nextended to me. I miss my first 2 years when I presided over the \nSenate, the first one to get to 100 hours in the chair. It was a \nwonderful time, and thank you all for what you have done for me over \nthe years.\n  The folks in the Attending Physician's Office have taken care of me \nphysically. Our two great Chaplains, Lloyd Ogilvie and Barry Black, \nalong with the wonderful priests at St. Joseph's on the Hill have \nhelped me grow spiritually. I have to mention Jim Inhofe, hosting our \nBible study each\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\nweek. He honored me by inviting me to a codel to Africa this year. \nThere is no one in this Senate who has done more for public diplomacy \nfor the United States in Africa than Jim Inhofe.\n  I have learned in my life that you cannot do anything alone. So, of \ncourse, I think of my colleagues in the Senate whom I have learned to \nknow and respect. I have been blessed to call them friends. The \nAmerican people have made it clear that they are not happy with \npartisanship in Washington. But the fact is, there are some great \npartnerships here, and those partnerships and relationships result in \naction.\n  I do not think many people outside Washington understand that a lot \ngets done here on a bipartisan basis. Many Americans think the only \naction in the Senate is on the floor of the Senate. But much of the \naction in the Senate is in the committees and meetings with other \nMembers off the floor, as well as through unanimous consent.\n  Once a bill gets through committee, perhaps one or two people might \nhave a problem with it, but we work it out, call them, go see them, it \ngets done. But it is never reported in the paper about how we are \nworking together on so many pieces of legislation.\n  I am proud of the contribution I have made to the country in the area \nof human capital and government management. The fact is, though, \nwithout my brother, Dan Akaka--and he is my brother--the changes never \nwould have occurred. There is nobody who has done more to reform the \nway we treat our Federal workers, to make us more competitive and work \nharder and smarter and do more with less than what Dan and I have tried \nto do over the years, 12 years of working at it. It is an area that is \nneglected by most legislators because they do not appreciate how \nimportant the people are that work in government. I call them the A-\nTeam. Any successful organization has to have good finances and good \npeople.\n  I am also proud of my work in helping to relaunch the nuclear \nrenaissance, which will help deliver baseload energy for America, \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and reignite our manufacturing \nbase in Ohio and in our country. I could not have done this without \nSenator Tom Carper, who has been both a friend and a colleague since \nour days as Governor. Tom's leadership was key to organizing our recent \nsuccessful Nuclear Summit in Washington, and Tom has taken the baton \nfrom me and will carry nuclear energy to the finish line as part of the \nfuture of America's energy supply, along with Mike Crapo, Jim Risch, \nLamar Alexander, and others.\n  I also recall the passage of the landmark PRO-IP bill, a bill to \nprotect our intellectual property, by the way, the last bastion of our \nglobal competitiveness. It was a multiyear process that would not have \nsucceeded without the work of the business community and my friend, \nEvan Bayh, whom I first met when we were Governors of neighboring \nStates.\n  As many of you know, I have been an ardent champion for my brothers \nand sisters in Eastern Europe, the Baltic States, and the countries of \nthe former Yugoslavia. As such, I am proud to have led the effort to \nexpand NATO and increase membership in the Visa Waiver Program. These \ntwo accomplishments would not have happened without the bipartisan \nleadership of Dick Lugar and Joe Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the help of Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins on the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee.\n\n  I pray that the bipartisanship that I have witnessed and enjoyed in \nboth foreign relations and homeland security will continue. I must also \nacknowledge Senator Jeanne Shaheen for her keen interest in southeast \nEurope. We traveled together to the region in February of this year, \nand I am heartened that she has picked up the mantle on our mission to \nensure the door of NATO and European Union membership remains open to \nall states in the Western Balkans, which is key, I believe, to our \nnational security.\n  I have also championed the cause of monitoring and combatting anti-\nSemitism, making it a priority within the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe and our State Department. The progress that has \nbeen made over the years could not have happened without the leadership \nof Senator Ben Cardin, Congressman Chris Smith, and the late \nCongressman Tom Lantos.\n  One of the highlights of my career was the passage of the global \nanti-Semitism bill, which created a special envoy at the State \nDepartment to monitor and combat global anti-Semitism. These are just a \nfew examples of great bipartisan work going on in the Senate. But much \nof the time this is blurred because of the media's addiction to \nconflict.\n  Even though I do not agree with the bipartisan resolution on \nextending the Bush tax cuts, I compliment the President and leaders in \nCongress for sitting down and working together to find a compromise.\n  One of my frustrations after working so hard to find common ground on \nsignificant issues over the past 12 years has been that it does not \nhappen often enough. The American people know that even when members of \na family get along, it is difficult to get things done. So they most \ncertainly know that when we are laser focused on fighting politicking \nand messaging, their concerns and plight are forgotten, and nothing \ncontroversial gets done.\n  There is a growing frustration that Congress is oblivious to their \nproblems, anxieties, and fears. Frankly, I think one action leaders \ncould take at the beginning of each Congress is to assess the issues at \nhand. What are the items that Republicans and Democrats agree should \nget done to make our Nation more competitive and make a difference in \npeople's lives, and set a common agenda. By setting collective goals, \nby an agreement from leadership, I believe that will set the \nenvironment for committee chairmen and ranking members for the year.\n  Think about it. What kind of planning do we do? Most successful \ncorporations have 5-year plans: Where are we going? What are our \npriorities? What are the things we agree upon? Let's not spend time on \nthose things where we disagree.\n  Additionally, an unacceptable amount of time is spent on fundraising. \nIt is my estimate that 20 to 25 percent of a Senator's time is spent on \nraising millions of dollars, and with it comes the negative fallout in \nterms of the public view of Congress, bowing to contributions from \nspecial interests. In addition to this negative impression, the time \nspent raising money too often interferes with the time we need for our \nfamilies, our colleagues, and, most importantly, doing the job the \npeople elected us to do. My last 2 years have been my most productive \nand enjoyable because I have not had to chase money at home and around \nthe country. None of us like it, but nothing seems to get done about \nit--nothing seems to get done about it.\n  Ideological differences aside, it is necessary for us to have good \nworking relationships if we are going to get anything done for the \npeople who elected us. I know it is possible from my personal \nexperience. As mayor of Cleveland, I worked side by side with George \nForbes, the most powerful Democratic city councilman in Cleveland's \nhistory. My entire city council was Democrats. George and I first met \nwhen our children attended the Mayor Works Program in the Cleveland \nPublic Schools System. Who would have guessed that we would become the \ntag team that turned Cleveland around after it became the first major \ncity to go into bankruptcy?\n  I was pummeled by the media on occasion in regard to who was actually \nrunning city hall. My answer was, both of us. Forbes and I worked \ntogether as friends and partners. One of the great satisfactions when I \nleft the job of mayor was that USA Today highlighted both of us: The \ntall African-American Democrat, Big George, and the short White \nRepublican, Little George, working together to bring about Cleveland's \nrenaissance.\n  In Columbus, I found a worthy adversary when I was Governor in \nDemocrat Vern Riffe, who was speaker of the house for my first 4 years \nas Ohio Governor. My office was on the 30th floor of the building named \nafter Riffe while he was still alive and serving an unprecedented 22 \nyears as speaker.\n  Well, every day when I went over to the Riffe Tower, I had to \ngenuflect before his bust. But, somehow, Vern and I decided we were \ngoing to figure out how we could work together and move Ohio forward \nand become good friends.\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\n  Needless to say, folks, I was dismayed when I learned this year that \nPresident Obama had held only a single one-on-one meeting with Mitch \nMcConnell. One meeting. When I was Governor, I met with Vern Riffe and \nStan Aranoff, who was president of the senate, every 2 weeks, \ndeveloping good interpersonal relationships and a trust which allowed \nus to move Ohio forward, from the Rust Belt to the Jobs Belt.\n  I am hoping we have entered a new era in the relationship between the \nPresident and leadership in Congress. Our situation today is more \ncritical--more critical--than at any time in my 44 years in government. \nHow we work together will determine the future of our country. We must \nalso recognize that if we diminish the President in the eyes of the \nworld, it is to the detriment of our Nation's international influence \nand will impact our national security. We are on thin ice, and we need \nthe help of our allies. They need our help as well.\n  For example, the START treaty. Although I have had some reservations \nabout it, they have been satisfied. It is vitally important to get done \nthis year or, alternatively, we must make it clear the Senate will \nratify the treaty as soon as the 112th Congress convenes. To not do so \nwill do irreparable harm to America's standing with our NATO allies and \nwould be exploited by our enemies, particularly those factions in \nRussia that would like to break off communication and revert back to \nour Cold War relationship. There are plenty of them over there still \nsmarting from the fact that the wall went down, NATO expanded, and we \nencroached on their area of influence.\n  Two weeks ago Janet and I attended a farewell dinner hosted by Mitch \nMcConnell. Although I have had differences with Mitch, I have to credit \nhim with keeping the Republican team together. There is no one more \nstrategic than Mitch, Jon Kyl, and Lamar Alexander. Still, I share the \nconcern of many of my colleagues that too often the herd mentality has \ntaken over our respective conferences. At the dinner Mitch hosted, I \nshared with my Republican colleagues what Ohio State University coach \nJim Tressel defines as success in his book ``The Winners Manual.''\n\n       Success is the inner satisfaction and peace of mind that \n     come from knowing I did the best I was capable of doing for \n     the group.\n\n  Success is a team sport. Hopefully, this will become the Senate's \ndefinition of success, because finding common ground and teamwork is \nwhat it will take to confront the problems facing our Nation.\n  My colleague Senator Chris Dodd hit the nail on the head when he \nsaid:\n\n       It is whether each one of the 100 Senators can work \n     together--living up to the incredible honor that comes with \n     the title, and the awesome responsibility that comes with the \n     office.\n\n  We do have a symbiotic relationship, and I am encouraged that more \nand more of my colleagues understand that. I was quite impressed with \nthe fact that 60 percent of the Senate representation on the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform supported the \nrecommendations of the chairmen, including Tom Coburn, Mike Crapo, Judd \nGregg, Kent Conrad, and Dick Durbin. As far as I am concerned, they are \ntrue patriots.\n  As our colleague Tom Coburn said just before the commission vote:\n\n       The time for action is now. We can't afford to wait until \n     the next election to begin this process. Long before the \n     skyrocketing cost of entitlements cause our national debt to \n     triple and tax rates to double, our economy may collapse \n     under the weight of this burden. We are already near a \n     precipice. In the near future, we could experience a collapse \n     in the value of our dollar, hyperinflation or other \n     consequences that would force Congress to face a set of \n     choices far more painful than those proposed in this plan.\n\n  Here we are, in a situation where we are on an unsustainable fiscal \ncourse caused by explosive and unchecked growth in spending and \nentitlement obligations without funding. We have an outdated Tax Code \nthat does not sufficiently encourage savings and economic growth, a \nskyrocketing national debt that puts our credit rating in serious \njeopardy and should give all of us great pause.\n  For Fareed Zakaria posed questions that should haunt all of us in \nMonday's Washington Post.\n\n       So when will we get serious about our fiscal mess? In 2020 \n     or 2030, when the needed spending cuts and tax hikes get much \n     larger? If we cannot inflict a little pain now, who will \n     impose a lot of pain later? Does anyone believe that \n     Washington will one day develop the political courage it now \n     lacks? And what if, while we are getting around to doing \n     something, countries get nervous about lending us money and \n     our interest rates rise?\n\n  I believe the American people get it. They recognize that our fiscal \nsituation is in the intensive care unit on life support.\n  As I walk down the steps of the U.S. Capitol for the last time, I \npray the Holy Spirit will inspire my colleagues to make the right \ndecision for our country's future and work together to tackle our \nfiscal crisis. You have the future of our Nation and the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren in your hands.\n  I have already spoken too long. If my wife Janet were here, she would \nbe scratching her head. That is the signal she always gives me. I got \nyour signal, dear.\n  But I would like to finish with a reading from ``One Quiet Moment,'' \na book of daily readings from the former Senate Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie \nwhich I read every day for inspiration and proper perspective. Perhaps \nsome of my colleagues are familiar with his writings. This was his \nelection day admonition:\n\n       . . . May the immense responsibilities they assume, and the \n     vows they make when sworn into office, bring them to their \n     knees with profound humility and unprecedented openness to \n     You. Save them from the seduction of power, the addiction of \n     popularity, and the aggrandizement of pride. Lord, keep their \n     priorities straight: You and their families first; the good \n     of the Nation second; consensus around truth third; party \n     loyalties fourth; and personal success last of all. May they \n     never forget they have been elected to serve and not to be \n     served.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, as Ohio's junior Senator, I wish to \nadd my remarks, as well as I am able, to the comments of Senator \nVoinovich. He didn't talk much about himself and his career, and I will \ndo that for a moment.\n  In his almost 50 years of public service, he always has been his own \nman, whether as a State legislator, county auditor, a county \ncommissioner of Cuyahoga County, Lieutenant Governor, as mayor of \nCleveland, Governor of Ohio, and now his 12 years in the Senate. He has \nalways been his own man. He was rewarded in some sense when, as a 1958 \ngraduate of Ohio University, the school created the Voinovich School of \nLeadership in Public Affairs. It is not often that a State university \nor any public entity names something after someone still in office, \nparticularly something as prestigious as the Voinovich School of \nLeadership. I have visited it many times. There are always stimulating \ndiscussions that are uplifting to the public discourse. I thank Senator \nVoinovich for that.\n  No matter how high George Voinovich rose, he always lived with his \nwife Janet and his children and grandchildren nearby in Collinwood, OH, \nin the same house, the same neighborhood in Cleveland, never forgetting \nwhere he came from. That tells me a lot about him as a public official.\n  He likes to say, reflecting on our State's tremendous potential, \n``the rust is off the belt,'' as people used to refer to Cleveland as \nthe rust belt but now see it as so much more. It is going be the first \nplace in the Nation with a field of wind turbines on the fresh water of \nLake Erie. Clearly, this city has turned around. This is, in some \nsignificant measure, due to the efforts of Mayor and Governor and \nSenator George Voinovich.\n\n  There are four things I particularly think of when I think of George \nVoinovich. One is Janet. Janet often travels back and forth with \nGeorge, and I see both of them on our flight from Cleveland to \nWashington. Janet has always been at his side, whether as first lady or \nas his loving life's partner. The relationship they have is inspiring \nto Connie and me and many others. We thank you most importantly for \nthat, George.\n  When I think about the career of George Voinovich, I think of what he \nbrought to this body--the perspective of an executive, of a Governor \nand a mayor. That is something many of us look to--Governor Shaheen, \nnow Senator Shaheen, and soon-to-be Governor\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\nBrownback. It helps in our deliberations that someone has had the \nexperience as a big city mayor in challenging times, and Governor of \nOhio and, perhaps a less challenging time but a challenging time \nnonetheless, from the perspective that George Voinovich has brought as \na chief executive coming to the Senate, sharing those thoughts and \nideas with legislators.\n  The second thing I think of is Lake Erie. If you live in northern \nOhio or in the right places in Wisconsin and Minnesota and Michigan and \nIndiana and Illinois and New York and Pennsylvania, you think about the \ngreat lake you live near. In northern Ohio there is an old story. I \ngrew up about 75 miles from the lake, and George grew up much closer. \nThere is something about people who have grown up within 10 miles of \nLake Erie. You can ask them wherever they are, which way is north, and \nthey always seem to know.\n  From what he has done with Asian carp and his belief in the \nimportance of our greatest national resource, the five Great Lakes, his \ncommitment is always to maintaining the pristine quality of that lake \nin terms of recreation, in terms of drinking water, in terms of \nindustry, in terms of all the things that the Great Lakes, especially \nLake Erie, do for Cleveland and everything in between. George Voinovich \ngets much credit for that.\n  I think about George Voinovich in that he is always elevating the \ndiscussion about the quality of the Federal workforce. The term \n``public servant,'' unfortunately, doesn't mean in the public's mind \nwhat it used to; partly deserved, perhaps, because of some people's \nmissteps or worse, but mostly because people run campaigns against the \ngovernment, whatever the reasons there. The term ``public servant'' is \nso important to George Voinovich, and he has done more than just mouth \nthe words and compliment workers, which he has done often and \ndeservedly. I applaud him for that. He has played a major role in \nshining the light on how we improve our Federal workforce. How do we \ngive them opportunities for advancement, how do we do training, attract \nthe right people to public service. I still think we have a terrific \npublic workforce. Whether it is at the city, county, State, or Federal \nlevel, it is of high quality. And, in the great majority of cases, that \nis because of a few--and I say a very few--public servants such as \nGeorge Voinovich who has kept the public spotlight on government \nservice. I know Ralph Regula, the Congressman from Canton who retired \nin 2008, has shared a lot of those thoughts and ideas and continues to \nin his retirement with Senator Voinovich.\n  Whether it is his work on Lake Erie or his contributions here, he has \ncertainly made the Senate of the United States a better place. He has \nmade the United States of America a better country. I thank him for \nthat, as my senior Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague. \nWhat a great gentleman. This is an august body, a wonderful place, a \ndelightful place to serve. It has great issues before it. There are \npeople who are gentlemen and gentleladies in it who conduct themselves \nin one of the highest regards and highest abilities. And when I think \nof that, I think of George Voinovich. He is a really good guy, a real \ngentleman in the Senate, and a man who lives his faith, believes it, \nwhich is tough to do in this body. It is tough to do in any position in \nlife. Yet he does it and has done it for over four decades in public \nservice to the people in the State of Ohio and the people of the United \nStates. That is quite a tribute.\n  He and his wife I get to see often. When I think of the expression \n``two people becoming one,'' I don't know if I could describe it any \nbetter than the Voinovichs, how two become one.\n  The smile is the same. The look is the same. The attitude is just a \nwonderful togetherness that the two of them live. At a time when \nmarriages have a lot of difficulties, it is great to see an example of \nsomebody in high office who has lived in public life for over four \ndecades and then has this oneness in their marital relationship. I \nthink they both have served in that capacity, whether it is for their \nfamily or for the people of Ohio or the United States.\n  Living publicly the right way and living privately the right way are \nboth beautiful attributes and difficult things to be able to get done, \nand it is great to be able to see it happen. For that, I give great \ntribute to a wonderful American, George Voinovich.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The time allotted for morning \nbusiness has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \norder for perhaps 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, George Voinovich and I served as Governors together \nfor 6 years. He chaired the National Governors Association, and he was \ngood enough to let me be his vice chairman. I got here and, lo and \nbehold--in fact, for a while he chaired a national dropout prevention \nprogram called Jobs for America's Graduates. I was his vice chairman. I \ngot here, and he chaired a subcommittee on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety, and \nI got to be his vice chairman. So I am used to being his second banana. \nBut I love the guy, and I have learned an enormous amount from him.\n  He is one of those people who really, every day, try to say: What is \nthe right thing to do--not the easy thing to do, not the expedient \nthing to do, but what is the right thing to do? And he tries to do it. \nHe is the kind of person where we go to the Bible study group that \nmeets about every Thursday with the Chaplain and some of our \ncolleagues, and we are always reminded by Barry Black that the Golden \nRule is treat other people the way we want to be treated. It is the \ncliff notes of the New Testament, and George really personifies that. \nHe treats everybody the way he would want to be treated.\n  He is a person who focuses on excellence in everything he has done--\nas mayor, as Governor, and here in the U.S. Senate--and he is always \nlooking for ways to do better what he does and calls on the rest of us \nto do the same.\n  Finally, this guy is tenacious. He does not give up. If he thinks he \nis right and he knows he is right, just get out of the way, and you \nknow he is going to prevail.\n  He has wonderful folks on his staff who are here with him today, and \nwe salute all of you. He knows how to pick--you are--good people and \nturn them loose and really to inspire them and us.\n  I do not think Janet is here today. Maybe she is watching on \ntelevision. I hope so. But to her and their family, thanks very, very \nmuch for sharing with us an extraordinary human being.\n  We love you, George.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10244-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have \nno opportunity under regular order to offset that with less priority, \nless important items. So we have an amendment for the Senate to vote \non. It is not pain free. It is painful. But it cuts $150 billion from \nFederal expenditures to pay for the additional Federal expenditures \nthat will go out the door as a result of this bill.\n  I actually believe every one of my colleagues in the Senate \nunderstands the jam we are in. Where I am confused is that when we \nbring cuts to the floor, not only do they not vote for the cuts, they \ndo not offer alternative cuts. And you really cannot have it both ways. \nYou cannot say you recognize the significant difficulty our country is \nin and turn around and vote against somebody making an effort to get us \nout of that jam and not offer other additional spending cuts for which \nto pay. We do not have that privilege any longer. So either the \nrecognition of the problem is real or it is not.\n  Let me describe what has happened just in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. We \nhave run a budget deficit for now 27 straight months, including this \nmonth. The 2009 budget deficit, as reported, was $1.4 trillion. It was \nactually $1.6 trillion when you include the money we actually stole \nfrom trust funds and other items--in 2010, $1.3 trillion. On the basis \nof how we are going now, our budget deficit will probably be, in real \nterms--not what is reported to the American people but the actual fact \nof how much the debt will increase--probably $1.6 trillion to $1.7 \ntrillion. How long can we continue to do that? As a matter of fact, the \nlargest monthly budget deficit ever reported was October--$291 billion.\n  The time to act is now. If you do not like what I have put up, then \nput something else up. Let's have a debate about it. Let's have an \nhonest discussion about the problem and the possible solutions. That is \nwhat the deficit commission was trying to do. That is what a group of \nus, including the President pro tempore, are trying to do on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  There is no longer a debate on whether we are going to have to cut \nspending in our country. Almost everybody agrees to it. The question \nis, When will we start? I will tell you, if this amendment passes, we \nwill send a notice to the world that we get it. The international \nfinancial community will start seeing us acting as adults and no longer \ndelaying the time at which we will start chipping and stop digging. We \nhave a hole so deep we may not climb out of it now. The last thing we \nwant to do is make that hole deeper.\n  So, Mr. President, I move to suspend rule XXII, including any \ngermaneness requirements, for the purposes of proposing and considering \namendment No. 4765, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will reoffer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent to use the general time, not my own 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no general debate time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Can I ask to use my leadership time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have leader time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. Then I will use 1 minute of my time out of the 10 I \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In just a few minutes--sometime before the hour of 12--I am going to \nbe asking for unanimous consent to correct a mistake that was made in \nthe final negotiations of this tax package, which contains, as you \nknow, $890 billion worth of items. It is a big bill. It was negotiated \nwith the White House and the Republican leadership primarily, and then \nthe Democratic leaders had some input into it as well.\n  What happened was--and, Mr. President, please stop me in a minute and \na half--there was a misunderstanding, a terrible misunderstanding when \nit came down to the GO Zone housing credits. All of the GO Zone package \nwas put in the bill except for the $42 million--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used a minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. OK. I will take 30 more seconds of my time--except for \nthe $42 million that applies to low-income housing tax credits. So the \nentire GO Zone package--$800 million for the gulf coast--was put in. \nThis little $42 million was left out. It was a mistake. The only way to \nfix that today is to get unanimous consent. I will be asking for that \nin just a few minutes.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield back and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to call up my amendment No. 4787 to the \nmotion to concur in the House amendment.\n  My amendment would restore the estate tax exemption level and top \nestate tax rates to their 2009 levels of $3.5 million and 45 percent, \nrespectively. It would leave all the other modifications to the estate, \ngift, and so-called generation-skipping transfer taxes the same as they \nappear in the underlying amendment.\n  Raising the estate tax exemption level to $5 million and lowering the \nrate to 35 percent is not the responsible thing to do given our current \nfiscal situation, and it would only exacerbate widening wealth \ninequality in America. Only 3 of every 1,000 decedents have estates in \nexcess of $3.5 million.\n  At a time when some people are seriously discussing cutting Social \nSecurity, which is relied upon by so many millions of Americans, how \ncan Congress consider this action to benefit the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent of the population?\n  While we don't have an estimate of the savings to the Treasury from \nthis amendment, we do know it would save our Treasury tens of billions \nof dollars, which we need to help continue unemployment insurance, \nSocial Security, and other critical programs.\n  Whether one agrees with this amendment or not, this is an amendment \nwhich should be debated. The Senate should have an opportunity to \ndebate this issue. Unless we get unanimous consent, the way this is \ncurrently structured, the Senate will be denied this opportunity. \nWhether people support it, oppose this estate tax change or don't know, \nthe way the Senate ought to operate is we should have a chance to vote \non this amendment.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  So I now ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up my \namendment No. 4787 to the motion to concur in the House amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if at the end of \n9\\1/2\\ minutes you could alert me, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by adding Senators \nWhitehouse and Begich as cosponsors of this amendment No. 4809.\n  As I think many people know, I have been extremely critical of the \nagreement struck between the President and the Republican leadership. I \nhave spoken out against it and I voted against cloture just yesterday. \nIt is one thing to be critical of a proposal; it is another thing to \ncome up with a better alternative, and I think I have done that today.\n  I believe the amendment I am offering is a significant improvement \nover the agreement struck between the President and the Republican \nleadership, and I hope very much we can get strong bipartisan support \nfor it. Let me very briefly tell my colleagues what it does.\n  First, as I think most Americans appreciate, at a time of a \nrecordbreaking deficit and a $13.7 trillion national debt, it makes \nvery little sense to be\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\nproviding huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country. It \ndrives up the national debt and forces our kids to pay higher taxes in \nthe future to pay off that national debt. This amendment ends--it \nends--all the Bush tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans \nbeginning on January 1 of this year.\n  What does it do with the savings? That is perhaps the most important \npoint I wish to make. Over the long term, this amendment would devote \nhalf the revenue raised by this provision--by eliminating the tax \nbreaks for the top 2 percent--to reduce the deficit. Half that money \ngoes to deficit reduction, which I hope appeals to many of my \nRepublican friends who have consistently and appropriately talked about \nhigh deficits and the danger of those high deficits to this country. \nHalf the savings by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy goes to \ndeficit reduction. What does the other half go to? It seems to me that \nwhile we should be and must be concerned about the deficit, we must \nalso understand we continue to be in a major recession. Millions of our \nfellow Americans are unemployed. We have to do everything we can to \ncreate decent-paying jobs and put those people back to work.\n  What the other half of the savings does is invests in our \ninfrastructure. I don't have to tell anybody here our infrastructure is \ncrumbling. So it will go to repairing our roads, our bridges, schools, \ndams, culverts, housing, and transforming our Nation's energy sector. \nWe need to put billions of dollars into building a 21st century rail \nsystem. When we do that, we not only create jobs now--and this is the \nfastest way I know to create jobs--we make our country more productive \nand internationally competitive in the future. If we do not build our \ninfrastructure, if it continues to crumble--and the engineers out there \ntell us we need trillions of dollars of investment--we are going to \nlose our place in the global economy. So we have to invest in \ninfrastructure. Half the savings does just that.\n  In addition, this amendment replaces the payroll tax holiday with a \n1-year extension of the Making Work Pay credit. In other words, we are \ngiving targeted tax breaks to the middle class, not reducing payroll \ntaxes for millionaires and Members of Congress. This proposal would not \nendanger Social Security and, in fact, it would go to the people who \nmost need it. It would be a lot fairer because lower income people \nwould do better. Upper income people would not get it.\n  It also addresses a concern I think many Americans have; that is, \ndiverting money away from the payroll tax endangers the long-term \nsolvency of Social Security. As Eric Kingson, the cochair of the \nStrengthen Social Security campaign, an organization representing tens \nof millions of senior citizens and workers, recently said:\n\n       Extending and expanding the Making Work Pay tax credit is \n     far superior to the payroll tax cut for most Americans. The \n     Making Work Pay tax credit is more stimulative, fairer in \n     distribution, imposes no new administrative costs to \n     employers and includes over 6 million public sector employees \n     who will receive nothing from the payroll tax cut. And it \n     doesn't run the risk of undermining Social Security's \n     financing and the economic security of working Americans . . \n     .\n\n  So it addresses that issue as well.\n  Third, this amendment addresses another issue I know a lot of people \nin this country have concern about; that is, the estate tax giveaway in \nthe underlying bill, by inserting in its place the 2009 estate tax rate \nfor 2 years. Let's be clear. The estate tax only applies to the top \nthree-tenths of 1 percent. What we are doing now is not lowering estate \ntax and raising exemptions which only benefit the very wealthiest \npeople in this country; what we are doing now is bringing us back to \nthe 2009 estate tax rates for 2 years.\n  Further, this amendment addresses an issue that, to me, is very \nimportant, and I know to many Members here, because we had a lot of \nsupport for it when I brought up this amendment last week. As the \nPresiding Officer well knows, our seniors who are on Social Security \nand disabled vets have not received a COLA in the last 2 years. A lot \nof those folks are trying to get by on $14,000, $15,000, $16,000 a \nyear. What this amendment also includes is a $250 COLA for over 57 \nmillion American senior citizens, veterans, and persons with \ndisabilities. Without this provision, seniors, as I mentioned, would be \ngoing through their second year without a COLA, and I think that is \nunfair.\n  Further, of course, this amendment would keep all of what I consider \nto be the positive aspects of the President's agreement with the \nRepublicans. Obviously, it would extend middle-class tax cuts for 98 \npercent of Americans. It would extend unemployment insurance for 13 \nmonths. It would extend the child tax credit, earned-income tax credit, \ncollege tax credit expansions included in the Recovery Act.\n  So I think what we are doing is bringing forth a far better proposal \nthan the agreement struck between the Republicans and the President.\n  Let me summarize. It ends tax breaks for the rich, uses half that \nmoney for deficit reduction and half that money to create millions of \njobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. It would replace the \npayroll tax holiday, which many people have concerns about; diverting \nmoney away from Social Security with a 1-year extension of the Making \nWork Pay credit--much more targeted to low- and moderate-income people, \nnot to Members of Congress and the richest people in this country and \nnot threatening Social Security.\n  This amendment would strike the estate tax proposal in the underlying \nbill, and insert the 2009 estate tax rates for 2 years. That is a much \nfairer proposal than giving even more tax breaks for the very \nwealthiest people in this country.\n  Lastly, this amendment would provide a $250 COLA for over 57 million \nAmerican senior citizens and disabled veterans and people with \ndisabilities. It also includes an extension of the middle-class tax \ncuts for 98 percent of Americans, an extension of unemployment \ninsurance for 13 months, an extension of the child tax credit, the \nearned income tax credit, and the college tax credit expansion.\n  This is the alternative many Americans wish to see. It creates jobs, \ncuts the deficit, and it is much fairer than the underlying bill we \nwill vote on.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  With that, I move to suspend rule XXII for the purposes of proposing \nand considering amendment No. 4809 to the House message to accompany \nH.R. 4853, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes under the \nleader's time.\n  The Senate is about to pass a bill that should significantly bolster \nour economic recovery. The bill we are about to pass will cut rates for \nfamilies. It will reauthorize unemployment insurance. It will extend \nthe child tax credit and the college tuition tax deduction. It will \nextend the research and development tax credit and accelerate \ndepreciation for businesses. It will cut payroll taxes for workers.\n  These are important provisions. But the bipartisan leadership did not \ninclude several other important items which I think deserve special \nattention.\n  I worked hard to include these provisions in the bill we just passed. \nBut some on the other side of the aisle worked to prevent their \ninclusion. These are commonsense provisions and, frankly, I cannot \nimagine how any Senator could oppose them.\n  One provision I want to highlight this morning is the provision to \nrepeal the 1099 reporting requirements. Small businesses across America \nwere disappointed that this provision was not included in the bill. I \nam talking about the repeal of the recently expanded form 1099 \ninformation reporting requirements. Surprisingly, some on the other \nside of the aisle blocked inclusion of a provision to repeal these \nrequirements.\n  I included a repeal of these requirements in the tax alternative the \nSenate voted on earlier this month. Senator Schumer included repeal of \nthis provision in his alternative, as well.\n  Several measures to repeal the new rules have received bipartisan \nsupport. Frankly, repeal of this reporting requirement ought to be a \nno-brainer.\n  The new rules take effect at the beginning of 2012. That means many\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\nsmall businesses will soon begin spending money to gear up for them. \nSmall businesses in Montana and across this Nation should not need to \nspend their time and money to fill out more government paperwork. \nInstead, we should let them focus on staying in business, growing their \nbusiness, and creating jobs.\n  Many small business owners have contacted me about this provision. \nMany are puzzled that some Republicans now appear to oppose repeal in \nprivate, after having advocated repeal in public. I can understand why \nsmall businesses are puzzled and, frankly, I don't see how any Senator \ncan oppose repeal. I intend to keep working on behalf of America's \nsmall businesses to see that this unrealistic reporting requirement is \nrepealed.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4849\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged of H.R. 4849; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the Senate agree to the Baucus amendment to repeal \nthe form 1099 reporting requirements, which is at the desk; that the \nbill, as amended, be read the third time and passed; that the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that this all occur without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as the \nChairman knows, Senator Johanns of Nebraska has proposed a Republican \nalternative on this issue. Would the Senator amend his request to \nsubstitute the Johanns language?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Wyoming. I \ncannot agree to amend my request in that way because of the excessive \ncuts in appropriated spending in the Johanns amendment. It is way \nbeyond repeal of the 1099 requirements. It is a totally different \nanimal. Therefore, I cannot agree.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see Senator DeMint here. I know he has \ntime allocated to him. I also have 8\\1/2\\ minutes left. I want to make \nsure I will be able to retain my 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to retain that 7 minutes after Senator DeMint \nspeaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in a moment, I will move to suspend the \nrules for the purpose of offering my motion to permanently extend the \ncurrent individual income tax rates, finally repeal the death tax once \nand for all, and permanently patch the alternative minimum tax.\n  I know a lot of work has gone into this tax compromise. I appreciate \nthe fact that both sides have worked so hard to strike a deal. While I \nappreciate the efforts that have been made, I am concerned that the \nbill currently under consideration does not permanently extend tax \nrates and, thus, will have a marginal, if any, benefit to our economy.\n  Temporary rates make for a temporary, uncertain economy. My \nsubstitute amendment ensures a long-term stable economic environment \nfor Americans to create jobs, buy a home, invest their assets, save for \nretirement, and preserve their family farm or business.\n  We need to stop and consider what we are doing to our country and to \nour economy. We are the premier free market economy in the world. Yet \nalmost all of our Federal tax rates are temporary. I have been in \nbusiness most of my life, and I understand a lot about how free markets \nwork, how businesses plan--usually in a 5- or 10-year window, looking \nat their bottom line. How many people can they afford? Can they build a \nnew plant? Now they are looking at whether or not to do it in the \nUnited States or all over the world.\n  But now in our country, we have a temporary, uncertain Tax Code that \nmakes it very difficult for businesses to plan. And it is not just with \nthe Tax Code. For the last several years, we have waited until December \nto tell doctors what we are going to pay them to see Medicare patients \nthe next year. How do they plan their staff and their offices? We know \nsome have already laid people off, not knowing what they are going to \nget paid next year.\n  Free markets, free enterprise works within a framework of a rule of \nlaw, where people know what their taxes will be, what the laws will be, \nwhat the regulatory environment will be. But in America today, if we \ntake this compromise, almost all of the tax rates are either 1 year or \n2 years, and then people can expect them to go up or change.\n\n  We cannot operate the world's largest economy in this type of \nenvironment. Washington does not have a tax revenue problem, it has a \nspending problem. We must let all working Americans keep their hard-\nearned money, not just for a year or two, but allow people actually to \nlook out and see, can they make those car payments for 4 or 5 years? \nCan they make those house payments for 15, 20, or 30 years? They need \nto know what their tax rates are going to be.\n  We must repeal the immoral death tax once and for all. It is zero \nthis year, but the proposed compromise will have it at 35 percent for \nany estate over $5 million next year. That may sound like a much better \ndeal than we would have had. But even with that, the estimates are that \nthis could cost 850,000 jobs to let this tax re-emerge.\n  We must commit ourselves to recovering from our years of \noverspending, overtaxing, and overreaching. The American people deserve \nbetter. They told us so in the November elections.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  According to rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I move to \nsuspend rule XXII for the purpose of proposing and considering \namendment No. 4804 to permanently extend the 2001 and 2003 individual \nincome tax rates, permanently repeal the estate tax, and permanently \npatch the alternative minimum tax. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I will take two of them now and then reserve the \nremainder of my time. We only have, under the agreement arrived at \nbetween Leader Reid and Leader McConnell, 15 minutes to correct this \nmistake. At 12 o'clock, we are going to have to vote on several issues. \nThis is not one of them because this is not an amendment; this is a \nmistake. I only have 15 minutes to correct it. I will try to explain \nagain how important it is.\n  There are $890 billion worth of amendments and projects in the bill \nwe are about to vote on. Within that, there is a package of $800 \nmillion in GO Zones, which was put together by me and my colleagues \nfrom the Gulf Coast. We fashioned it and created it. We are proud of \nit. It was supposed to be part of this much larger package. Lo and \nbehold, all of it found its way in--except for $42 billion for low-\nincome housing. That was the only thing left out of the GO Zones. \nSenator Vitter, myself, Senator Shelby, Senator Sessions, Senator \nWicker, and Senator Cochran have cosponsored a one-line provision. This \nisn't an amendment to the bill; it is a provision to fix a mistake that \nhas been acknowledged by the Finance chair, and actually by the \nRepublican negotiators. They meant to include it, but they didn't \nbecause in order to include it, the low-income housing tax credits to \nbuild these units have to go to 2012. Everything else in the bill is \n2011. But they knew if they didn't extend it to 2012 that we can't \nbuild these projects, and these projects and their financing will be in \njeopardy.\n\n  There are 77 projects across the gold coast for seniors, for the \ndisabled, and for the working poor. These projects are transforming the \ncity of New Orleans, the gulf coast, Waveland, and Biloxi, not just for \nthe people living there\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nbut for the neighborhoods surrounding them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Tim Geithner supports this as does Secretary \nDonovan support it.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve my time in hopes that before my time is \nup we can get this fixed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Montana, the Finance Committee \nchair on the Senate floor, along with Mr. Kyl, the Senator from \nArizona, who has been one of the chief negotiators on the package, and \nthe Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter. Before we get to the time \nallotted for voting, I would like to say again how important it is to \ntry to get this provision and the underlying bill corrected. It is a \ntechnical correction that we are asking for to allow a placed-in-\nservice date to be extended from January 1, 2012, to January 1, 2013--a \n1-year extension to finish the low-income housing projects that are \nunderway not only in New Orleans but along the gulf coast.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Times-Picayune editorial dated today in support of this and a New \nYork Times editorial of March 2, as well as a letter of support from \nSecretary Donovan and Secretary Geithner testifying to the importance \nof these projects.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Picayune, Dec. 15, 2010]\n\n                         Extend Go Zone to 2012\n\n       New Orleans and other parts of South Louisiana will likely \n     lose important recovery projects, including thousands of \n     prospective housing units, if Congress fails to extend the \n     Gulf Opportunity Zone tax credits for two more years.\n       The credits, which were created after Hurricane Katrina to \n     foster investment in our region, require housing financed by \n     Go Zone bonds to be ``placed in service'' by Dec. 31. But the \n     collapse of credit markets in 2008 and delays in public and \n     private financing meant that many important projects could \n     not get under way early enough to meet that deadline.\n       The tax compromise negotiated this month by the Obama \n     administration and congressional Republicans would extend \n     portions of the Go Zone credits, but only for one year That's \n     not enough to make many projects viable.\n       Metro area officials and housing advocates say about 2,800 \n     housing units could be at risk in metro New Orleans alone if \n     only a one-year extension is granted. That includes plans to \n     redevelop some of the former Big Four housing projects, which \n     have been demolished and are set to be replaced by mixed-\n     income, lower-density housing. That would not only leave many \n     low-income New Orleanians without housing options, it also \n     would cost construction jobs.\n       Louisiana Sens. Mary Landrieu and David Vitter are trying \n     to change the extension in the tax compromise from one year \n     to two. The White House and congressional leaders from both \n     parties should support their efforts.\n       President Obama and congressional leaders have pledged to \n     support the rebuilding of our region, and our region needs \n     the two-year extension of Go Zone credits to make sure \n     important recovery projects get done. The White House and \n     Congress need to make sure the extension to 2012 is approved.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 2, 2010]\n\n                            An Essential Fix\n\n       The recession dealt a devastating blow to the post-Katrina \n     rebuilding effort in the Gulf states, where scores of \n     affordable housing projects have been placed in jeopardy. \n     Congress can revive the rebuilding effort by extending the \n     deadline for a tax credit program that is supposed to \n     encourage developers and investors to take on these \n     desperately needed projects.\n       Nearly all affordable rental housing in this country is \n     built with federal tax credits. After Hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita, Congress allotted Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama \n     more than $300 million in low-income housing tax credits, \n     slightly more than two-thirds of which has been used. At \n     first, these credits, and projects, were hotly sought after. \n     Demand dropped sharply as corporate profits fell and \n     businesses had smaller and smaller tax liabilities.\n       As the economy has improved, interest in the credits seems \n     to be picking up in many places--but not in the Gulf. That's \n     partly because of a provision in the Gulf Opportunity Zone \n     law that requires projects in the region to be ready for \n     occupancy by the end of this year. That leaves just 10 \n     months--instead of the 18 months that investors like to see--\n     for the deals to be sealed and the housing built. Projects \n     that miss the ready-for-occupancy date, because of all-too-\n     common weather delays or construction problems, would lose \n     the tax credit.\n       Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, has \n     introduced an amendment that would extend the occupancy date \n     by two years. Unless Congress moves quickly to pass it, the \n     Gulf states could potentially lose financing for more than 70 \n     housing projects and 6,000 units of affordable housing. The \n     loss would be especially devastating for New Orleans, which \n     is desperately short of housing for the low-income workers \n     who are essential to the city's service economy.\n       The more Congress dithers, the more likely it becomes that \n     tax credit investors will look outside the Gulf states for \n     places to put their money. This is an easy fix--and a \n     critical one.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 2, 2010.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for your letter of \n     February 25, 2010, regarding the extension of the Gulf Coast \n     Opportunity Zone (GO Zone) Low Income Housing Tax Credit \n     (LIHTC) placed-in-service date. Please be assured that the \n     Administration understands the critical need for the \n     extension of the GO Zone tax credits, and also the negative \n     impact that failing to extend the credits would have on New \n     Orleans and other communities impacted by Hurricanes Katrina \n     and Rita as they continue recovery efforts. You should also \n     be assured that the Administration supports an extension of 2 \n     years to December 31, 2012, of the GO Zone placed-in-service \n     date and is committed to working with Congress to see that \n     the extension is enacted as soon as possible.\n       As you mentioned in your letter, the economic activity \n     spurred by the GO Zone credits has played an important \n     simulative role in the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. These \n     tax credits have fostered development in devastated areas and \n     have enabled the return of people who love their communities \n     and who are the drivers of local economies throughout the \n     Gulf Coast. GO Zone projects have created jobs and stimulated \n     the economic recovery in these areas. In New Orleans, \n     specifically, the tax credits have played a central role in \n     leveraging the financing needed to complete the rebuilding of \n     the Big Four public housing developments: St. Bernard, C.J. \n     Peete, Lafitte, and B.W. Cooper. The revitalized developments \n     have not only spurred activity surrounding construction and \n     will restore essential affordable housing, but have also \n     encouraged the establishment of new businesses and improved \n     civic life around these developments.\n       Since the beginning of the Administration, President Obama, \n     Vice President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, 13 other members of the \n     Cabinet, and numerous agency heads, assistant secretaries, \n     and other senior level administration officials have visited \n     New Orleans and the wider Katrina- and Rita-impacted area to \n     see firsthand the scale of the recovery challenges that \n     remain. Our respective agencies have made significant \n     investments of staff and funding to support the recovery \n     efforts. Many of these programs continue to provide \n     meaningful resources to disaster survivors and the \n     communities being rebuilt. Through these visits, we have come \n     to recognize the dire impact that failing to extend this tax \n     credit would have on Gulf Coast communities and individual \n     families, many of whom were the hardest hit by Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita and the recent recession. Not extending the \n     GO Zone placed-in-service date would result in a major \n     setback for the recovery, and would impact public housing \n     residents, business, and communities. It would be \n     unconscionable to let the work that has created so much \n     progress, and so much hope, go unfulfilled.\n       We will continue to urge members of Congress to extend the \n     GO Zone placed-in-service date and stand firmly behind such \n     an extension. We are confident that with your help we will \n     see the extension signed into law, and with it, continued \n     economic activity and community revitalization in the Katrina \n     affected Gulf Coast.\n           Sincerely,\n     Timothy F. Geithner,\n       Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Shaun Donovan,\n       Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time if \nSenator Baucus and then Senator Kyl and then Senator Vitter might \ncomment--I see them on the Senate floor--about the importance of \ngetting this fixed and the likelihood of us doing it today and what \nmight happen as we move forward.\n  Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think our colleague has the floor to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair, and I certainly join my colleague from \nLouisiana in stressing the importance of this second year of a GO Zone \nextension and look forward to continuing to work with all of these \nfolks in getting that done absolutely as soon as possible in 2011.\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\n  I emphasize one major point, which is that this is not a new benefit \nto fund new projects which were never envisioned when the GO Zone was \ninitially created. This is simply an extension to fund those crucial \nprojects which were at the center of this provision from the very \nbeginning and that have taken longer than was initially forecast \nbecause of labor and other shortages after Hurricane Katrina. So this \nis simply a time extension to get the very same crucial projects done, \nnot to add on to that list.\n  These projects are extremely important, including the wholesale \nrenovation and reconstruction of four major housing projects in New \nOrleans post-Katrina that are being done using a dramatically different \nand better model--mixed income, lower density--not the old-style \nhousing projects from the 1940s and 1950s which were, in my opinion, a \nhorrible social experiment.\n  So I certainly join this effort, and I have been working with all of \nthese folks to try to get this second year extension in this tax bill. \nUnfortunately, we weren't able to do that because of a general decision \nthat was apparently made that none of the extenders would go beyond the \nend of 2011. But working with these folks, and particularly Senator \nKyl, we came to an agreement that we would absolutely work to include \nthis in the first possible technical corrections or other measure that \nwould be keyed up in early 2011.\n  I thank everyone, particularly my Republican colleague, John Kyl, for \nthat willingness and that commitment, and I look forward to getting \nthat done at the earliest possible moment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like that time charged to the \nother side.\n  Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, both the Senators from Louisiana have \nstated the case very well and, frankly, this is not a typical extender. \nThis is just a very important proposal where the placed-in-service date \nhas to be changed because projects beyond the year could not be put in \nplace the second year. So it is not a traditional extender where we \nextend for 1 or 2 years some other provision. This is more in the \nnature of what was started in the first year gets accomplished in the \nsecond year, and that is why this 1-year add-on is so important.\n  I will work with the Senators and the Finance Committee, when we \nbring up legislation next year, to do our very best to make sure this \nprovision is included so we can help these people who are desperately \nin need of housing in Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Does the Senator have any idea about the time? I would \nlike to see if Senator Kyl can say a word on this because his views are \nvery important.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will add that my view would be at the earliest possible \nopportunity. I don't know when that is exactly, but it is something \nthat should be placed high up, near the very top.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Sometime in January or February?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, I hope. The Senator knows how this place operates, \nbut it is certainly very, very, very early.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Senator Kyl?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleagues for bringing this issue to the \nattention of the Senate. Senator Vitter brought this matter to my \nattention as the bill was being wrapped up, as a matter of fact, and I \ntold him at that time that while we could not provide an extension \nlonger than the one in the tax bill, I would work with him early in \n2011 to help these projects obtain the necessary extension. I say the \nvery same thing to the senior Senator from Louisiana today.\n  I also share the confidence of the chairman of the Finance Committee \nthat we will find an appropriate tax bill early in 2011 to include this \nchange, which I agree we all view as a technical change, that will \nallow this special financing to be used as Congress intended it.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a question for Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is it his understanding now, having had several \nconversations with Senator Vitter and myself, that this technical \ncorrection is perceived only to be limited to the 77 low-income \nhousing, mixed-income projects through the gulf coast? Is that his \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Louisiana \nthat I don't know technically whether it is 77 or 42 or whatever, but \nwe have all discussed the fact that it is limited to those projects \nthat are started but couldn't be completed within the 1-year extension \nand, therefore, would require the second extension, and it is limited \nto this area, yes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And is it the Senator's intention to push for a tax \nbill? He was so successful in pushing this tax bill forward. Is it his \nintention to do that in early January, mid-January, early February?\n  Mr. KYL. I would say to my colleague that I asked the chairman of the \nFinance Committee: How quickly do you think we could do this? He gave \nme the same answer he just gave you: Yes, as soon as we can, but it is \nhard to make a commitment about a tax bill coming to the floor.\n  As I also told the senior Senator from Louisiana, there are some \nother reasons we have to act quite quickly next year in dealing with \nsome technical fixes to other aspects of the tax bill. So there are \nother reasons to act quickly as well as this particular situation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Well, I would just say--with about 30 seconds left--\nthat I am encouraged, Mr. President, from what I have heard from the \nSenate Finance Committee chair and the chief negotiator on tax issues \non the Republican side that they recognize this is a technical \ncorrection. They recognize it is limited to low-income housing. They \nrecognize the importance of these projects, and they have committed to \nworking on fixing this as early as possible in the next Congress. I \nthink that gives it a glimmer of hope.\n  We would not get unanimous consent today because there remain \nobjections on the other side of the aisle, but I think we can move \nforward with confidence knowing Senator Kyl is good on his word and \nSenator Baucus is good on his word and they will try to fix this at the \nearliest possible date.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Motion to Suspend\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to suspend rule XXII, including any \ngermaneness requirements, for the purposes of proposing and considering \namendment No. 4765, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's motion is pending. Is there a \nsufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \nsubsequent votes after the first vote be 10 minutes in duration; \nfurther, that prior to the vote on the motion to concur there be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this amendment is based on the absurd \npremise that the unemployment insurance benefits piece alone must be \npaid for, lest we contribute to the deficit. Never mind that this \nentire package contributes $858 billion to the deficit, of which only \n$51 billion is accounted for by the UI extension provision. It is clear \nthat this amendment is not about deficit reduction; rather, it is about \nattacking programs that make a real difference to the everyday lives of \nour constituents. Meanwhile, this amendment leaves the tax benefits to \nthe wealthiest Americans, those who need the least assistance, \ncompletely intact.\n  Let me be clear. There are a few ideas proposed in this amendment \nthat make some sense. However, as part of the Appropriations \nCommittee's annual and ongoing oversight responsibilities, the \ncommittee has already rescinded unobligated balances from those \nprograms or reduced their funding for fiscal year 2011 as part of the \nfiscal year 2011 omnibus, which the Senate will consider this week. \nEvery recommendation in the omnibus was made in collaboration with \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S10250]]\n\nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, based on a detailed analysis. \nThese decisions were not made rashly, nor because they might sound good \nin a press release.\n  Too often when the Senate debates cuts in unobligated balances, the \nproponents want to ignore the consequences of their recommendations and \nfocus on broad generalizations. But in reality these cuts can cause \nserious problems. Accordingly, let me highlight the impact of a few of \nthe programmatic cuts proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  For example, this amendment would require each Department to cut its \nworkforce by 10 percent over 10 years, without considering the impact \nof the cuts. It seems as though Federal workers have become the newest \npunching bag for a few of our colleagues. FDA staff, necessary to \nensure that the food we eat and the drugs we take are safe and \neffective, would be cut by nearly 1,000. The staff of the Food Safety \nand Inspection Service would be cut by an additional 1,000. These cuts \nare irresponsible and would put the American public at unnecessary risk \nat a time of breakthrough medical research when important new drugs are \nbeing produced and must be monitored. When more of our food supply is \ncoming from around the world, preventing contamination is more \nimportant than ever.\n  More than 95 percent of the 280,000 employees of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs either work for the Veterans Health Administration or \nthe Veterans Benefits Administration. To reduce the VA's overall \nemployees by 28,000 over 10 years would mean that doctors, dentists, \nhospital administrators, and benefits claims processors would have to \nbe reduced. As more and more of our veterans are returning home from \nIraq and Afghanistan, this is not the time to be cutting their service \nproviders.\n  This amendment would require a reduction of 600 to 800 Government \nAccountability Office staff, as well as a reduction in travel that is \nnecessary for the GAO to conduct audits and evaluations. Travel is \ncritical to GAO's ability to meet the requirements of Congress.\n  Rescinding funds from the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Marshals will not \nprevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Instead, cutting funding for these \nagencies means cutting agents who are serving on the front lines \nkeeping our Nation safe from terrorist threats and cyber attacks, \nreducing the flow of drugs, and combating gun-related violence along \nthe southwest border, strengthening immigration enforcement, and \nkeeping children safe from sexual predators. That is the real impact of \nthis proposal.\n  The 15-percent budget cut to the Executive Office of the President \nmight sound reasonable, but it would cut key staff of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, the National Security Council, and the Homeland \nSecurity Council. This would severely hamper the President's ability to \ncoordinate critical economic security and national security programs \nacross the entire Federal Government. It would be particularly \ndevastating considering that the rest of the Federal Government would \nalso be shedding a significant number of staff under the Coburn \namendment, leaving agencies currently managing the economic crisis and \nour national and homeland security programs not only short-staffed but \nalso in chaos due to minimized leadership.\n  The Coburn amendment also would eliminate the State grant for the \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Program. The Congressional Budget Office has \npreviously recommended this action. However, this suggestion comes a \nyear too late. The Committee on Appropriations removed $295 million in \nfunding for the State formula grant funding from the 2010 \nappropriations bill. There is no funding for the State grants program \nin the 2011 bill. The Appropriations Committee has already made this \ncut.\n  The Coburn amendment would also rescind $4 billion in fiscal year \n2011 for U.S. development and humanitarian programs in the world's \npoorest countries, from Haiti to Afghanistan. This would cut funding \nfor programs for refugees and victims of natural disasters from Darfur \nto Pakistan; it would affect global health programs including HIV/AIDS \nprevention and treatment that mean life or death for millions of \npeople; and it would weaken programs to support food security and \nnutrition, clean water, sanitation, and basic education, and to combat \nhuman trafficking, in countries where 95 percent of new births are \noccurring and over 2 billion people barely survive on less than $2 per \nday. The short-term effects of such a reduction in funding would be \nsevere, the long-term effects would be devastating, and ultimately it \nwould exacerbate global problems that directly affect U.S. security.\n  The amendment proposes to rescind funds focused on returning \ncontaminated sites to productive use. The Brownfields Program has a \ntrack record of successfully restoring damaged properties--often in \nphysically and economically distressed neighborhoods--to sources of \neconomic growth, creating jobs for lower income people in the process. \nMany of our cities are among those communities hardest hit by the \neconomic recession. Now is not the time to stall the cleanup of \nbrownfields.\n  This amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Army in consultation \nwith other Federal agencies to determine the definition of ``low \npriority'' Army Corps projects. This appears to be code for those \nprojects not requested in the President's budget. Since when has the \nadministration been the only source of wisdom for determining funding \ndecisions? If there is surplus funding available, we should ask the \nCorps to identify those funds and propose them for rescission. However, \nit would become quickly apparent that this strategy is penny wise and \npound foolish. These are all ongoing projects, previously funded by \nthis or prior Congresses. It would not make economic sense to stop \nthese projects. Demobilization costs and costs to make these \nconstruction sites safe for the public could end up costing more than \ncontinuing the projects.\n  These are just a few examples of the damage that would be done if \nthis reckless amendment was actually agreed to. But I would conclude by \nsaying that every Member of this Chamber who supports the tax cut deal \nshould vote against the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma for the simple reason that it seeks to change the tax package, \nwhich reflects an agreement between the Republican leader and the \nPresident of the United States. The Republican leadership signed off on \nthis deal because many of the provisions they wanted were included in \nexchange for a 13 month extension of unemployment insurance benefits \nwith no offset. I would certainly hope that they will stand by their \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would do serious damage to many \nnecessary government programs. Unobligated does not mean excess or \nunnecessary. I urge all my colleagues to reject the Coburn amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am voting for the Coburn motion to \nsuspend the rules to allow the Senate to consider his amendment to \noffset extension of unemployment benefits because we must be able to \ndiscuss ways to start bringing down the deficit. Senator Coburn's \namendment provides a fiscally responsible way to extend unemployment \ninsurance for out-of-work Americans and to pay for other costs \ncontained in the tax bill.\n  With the underlying agreement in the tax bill to extend current tax \nrates for 2 years, individuals and businesses will have more certainty \non tax policy. This is needed to spur economic growth and job creation. \nSenator Coburn's amendment takes the next important step to begin \nreducing spending to deal with the deficit. The Senate deserves an \nopportunity to debate and vote on the Coburn amendment so that we can \nbegin this process.\n  I spoke with Senator Coburn about an item in his amendment that would \nrescind NASA funding for Constellation systems. I strongly oppose this \nprovision, which would significantly disrupt the authorization law we \npassed in September. NASA is expressly continuing some elements of the \nConstellation program such as the crew exploration vehicle in order to \nshorten the time for building the new launch vehicle that will propel \nhuman space exploration beyond Earth orbit. Terminating those contracts \nbefore they can be transitioned to support the new direction Congress \nhas mandated would force NASA to start over, delaying development of \nthe new launch vehicle, greatly increasing its costs to\n\n[[Page S10251]]\n\nthe American tax payer. It could also jeopardize the full use of the \nspace station for scientific research. Senator Coburn has agreed to \nrevisit this provision in the future, in an effort to assure scientific \nintegrity.\n  All time has expired. The question now is on agreeing to the Coburn \nmotion to suspend with respect to amendment No. 4765. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I rise today to provide a brief \nexplanation of my absence during the vote on the motion to proceed to \nthe Reid-McConnell Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization \nand Job Creation Act of 2010 on December 13.\n  I was not in the Senate Chamber for the vote because I was traveling \nback from Oregon, where I had a previous commitment earlier in the day \nto participate in a major summit of the leading businesses and \npolitical leadership of Oregon looking at ways to revive the Oregon \neconomy.\n  As I stated publicly prior to the vote, had I been present I would \nhave voted against moving forward on the tax cut proposal under the \ncircumstances. The package that was brought to the floor will add \nnearly $1 trillion to the national debt and includes major components--\nparticularly bonus tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires--that the \nCongressional Budget Office has found to be one of the least effective \nmeans of creating jobs. I could not support moving to this flawed \npackage without an opportunity to offer amendments to fix it.\n  I continue to strongly support tax cuts for working families and the \nreauthorization of unemployment benefits, and other provisions in this \nbill that would be useful to create jobs and help families and small \nbusinesses. But I cannot support a bill that forces those same working \nfamilies and small businesses to shoulder responsibility for billions \nmore in debt while continuing too many of the policies that drove our \nNation into record deficits and caused financial distress for millions \nof working families.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I have always pledged to the people of \nUtah that I would fight any tax increase that gives Washington more of \ntheir hard-earned money to spend. Allowing middle-class families, small \nbusinesses, and investors to keep more of what they earn, while denying \nthis government hundreds of billions in new tax revenue to spend, is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Opposing this bill is tantamount to supporting massive tax increases \nthat threatens our economic future. If this tax relief expires, Utah \nwould lose an average of 6,200 jobs each year and household disposable \nincome would drop by $2,200. Over 150,000 Utah families would be hit \nwith the alternative minimum tax. Small businesses would see their \nmarginal tax rates go up by as much as 24 percent and our GDP would \ntake almost a 2 percent hit.\n  I say to my colleagues in the House who want to change this proposal \nto impose more taxes on American families, you act not only at your own \nperil, but that of the American people. You had 4 years to stop these \ntax hikes, but refused. If you change this package for the worse now, \nwith only 2 weeks left in this Congress, I will do everything in my \npower to ensure your changes never pass the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S10252]]\n\n  Some argue, why not wait until after January when Republicans control \nthe House to get a better deal. I appreciate that position, but that is \na gamble I am not willing to take. Democrats will retain control of the \nWhite House and the Senate they will simply drag their feet while \nblaming conservatives. The collateral damage of inaction will be hard-\nworking families who will see lower paychecks starting on January 1. \nExperts point to the damage to the economy, but I am as concerned about \nthe damage to the budgets of Utah families. In this case, tax relief \ndenied to all those families, if delayed indefinitely, could be tax \nrelief denied.\n  I also want to mention the death tax--an insidious tax that \ndisproportionately hits small businesses and family farms. This year it \nwas fully phased out. From my viewpoint, that is the right policy. But, \nif we don't act, on January 1 it goes back up to what it was in 2000--a \n$1 million threshold and a top rate of 55 percent. The proposal before \nus today includes the bipartisan Lincoln-Kyl compromise.\n  That bipartisan proposal puts in place a $5 million threshold--$10 \nmillion per couple--and a top rate of 35 percent. When Republicans were \nin control in 2006, we couldn't even get this proposal through \nCongress. So this is a pretty good deal and to my friend from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl, I applaud his efforts. If Congress fails to act, on \nJanuary 1, 10 times the number of estates will be hit, including 13 \ntimes as manner farm-heavy estates.\n  If I had my way, all the income tax rates would be made permanent--\nthat is the kind of certainty our economy and job creators need. \nFurthermore, I would never extend some of the so-called temporary tax \nprovisions that look like tax relief, but in reality are little \ndifferent than welfare through the Tax Code. Far too much new spending \nis mislabeled as tax relief. Thankfully, some of those provisions were \ndropped, like the so-called build America bonds tax credit. We also \nshould pay for this extension of unemployment insurance so it doesn't \nadd to the debt.\n  Lastly, to those who believe that instead of this proposal, we should \nbe undertaking wholesale tax reform: you are absolutely right. We need \nto reform our Tax Code to broaden the base while lowering rates to make \nour economy more competitive. But we don't have time to reform the code \nbefore January 1. As the next lead Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I will lead the fight to simplify the Tax Code, and cut back \non out-of-control Washington spending. Once we stop these tax hikes, we \ncan then begin the long-overdue national discussion about how best to \noverhaul our overly burdensome and inefficient tax system.\n  The bottom line is that this package is not perfect. But it does at \nleast one very important thing it allows the American people to keep \nmore of their hard-earned money and not hand it over to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the debate over the bill we have before \nus can be boiled down to one simple thing: jobs. Extending middle-class \ntax cuts will help create jobs. Not extending middle-class tax cuts \nwould cost jobs. Jobs must be our No. 1 priority. And so we must pass \nthis bill.\n  We know cutting taxes for middle-class families is one of the most \neffective ways to grow our economy. When working folks keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money, they pump it back into our economy and support \njobs.\n  This bill also includes a number of other important provisions \ndesigned to create jobs, and I would like to take a moment to focus on \none of those provisions--the 1603 grant program that makes resources \navailable for renewable power development.\n  The 1603 grant program provides renewable energy companies with money \nup front to cover 30 percent of the costs of renewable power \nfacilities, such as wind farms and solar projects, and that means jobs.\n  According to a study by the independent Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory, the 1603 grant program is responsible for saving 55,000 \nAmerican jobs in the wind industry alone.\n  It is estimated that 1603 is responsible for helping to produce as \nmany as 2,400 megawatts of wind power--about a quarter of all wind \npower installed in 2009. This includes projects such as the Glacier \nWind Farm near Shelby, MT.\n  Before 1603, producers had to rely on Wall Street investors to fund \ntheir renewable energy projects through a complex system known as tax \nequity financing. Through tax equity financing, Wall Street firms would \ninvest in renewable power projects in exchange for tax credits. When \nWall Street collapsed in 2008, this system of financing collapsed along \nwith it, threatening the future of American renewable power.\n  So we created 1603 grants in the Recovery Act to bypass Wall Street \nand provide cash directly to renewable power developers. As a result, \nmost experts have credited the 1603 program with saving the wind \nindustry--and the good-paying American jobs that go along with it.\n  The tax equity financing market has begun to recover. But tax equity \nfinancing is still much more expensive than that provided under 1603, \nand 1603 also provides a greater bang for our taxpayer buck. By cutting \nout expensive Wall Street middlemen, 1603 provides grants directly to \nenergy developers to support energy projects and jobs. And 1603 \nsupports smaller projects that wouldn't have otherwise been financed by \nWall Street.\n  Industry experts predict that extending the 1603 grant program will \nresult in 45,000 new American jobs in 2011 in the wind and solar \nindustries alone and many more in the geothermal and biomass.\n  Supporting renewable power also helps put America back in control and \nputs the United States on a path toward energy independence. And \nsupporting renewable power projects today supports even more jobs \nmanufacturing wind turbines and solar panels tomorrow. That is why I am \nworking hard with leaders in my State to bolster long-term growth in \nthe wind sector by bringing wind manufacturing jobs to Montana. Today, \nMontana is poised to begin a significant expansion of the generation \ncapacity of our wind resources. Montana's wind energy resources rank in \nthe top 5 in the United States, but our State is ranked No. 18 in \ninstalled capacity. The extension of the 1603 grant program will make \nMontana's wind-generation expansion possible, creating an ideal \nsituation for a wind turbine or component manufacturing facility.\n  Madam President, we need an energy policy that puts America back in \ncontrol. Extension of the 1603 grant program is just one example of a \ncommonsense policy that will create jobs, ramp up American energy \nproduction, and help us build a wind energy industry in Montana, and \nacross America, that will be a cornerstone of our Nation's energy \nindependence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, when the Senate invoked cloture on this \nbill yesterday evening, and adopted the procedure used after cloture, \nthose of us who oppose portions of this bill lost any opportunity to \naddress the problems we see and seek to repair them. I voted against \nthe motion to invoke cloture because I hoped that, if the cloture \nmotion failed, the Senate would have a chance to consider a better \nbill, and to improve it through the traditional method of debate and \namendment.\n  That did not happen.\n  I have spoken, as have others, about the defects of this proposal. \nIts tax cuts are unwisely skewed toward the wealthy, including an \nestate tax provision that would benefit a few thousand of our most \nfortunate taxpayers at great cost to the Treasury. These benefits for \nthe wealthiest among us will not, despite the claims of our Republican \ncolleagues, help our economic recovery. Nearly everyone says that \nshould be our top priority, and it should be. As a host of economists \nacross the ideological spectrum have demonstrated, tax cuts for the \nwell-to-do have little impact on economic growth.\n  It is not just that these benefits for the wealthiest will have no \npositive impact on our economy. What is worse, the upper income tax \ncuts and estate tax provisions that Republicans support would add more \nthan $100 billion to the national debt over the next 2 years. \nRepublicans in this Chamber repeatedly tell us that the 2010 election \nwas a call for more fiscal restraint. Yet their most significant action \nfollowing that election has been to insist upon tax cuts for the \nwealthy paid for with billions of dollars in borrowed money.\n  It is not just the inconsistency of our Republican colleagues that I \nfind so\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\ntroubling. It is that in pursuit of their goal, they are holding \nhostage progress for the American people, not just on tax cuts, but on \na range of other crucial issues. They tell us they will not support tax \nprovisions that help working families unless we also include huge \ngiveaways for the wealthy. They tell us we cannot continue emergency \nunemployment benefits unless we also give several times the cost of \nthose benefits to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. They tell us \nwe cannot provide tax relief to help businesses grow and add workers \nunless we also give away more borrowed money to the wealthy.\n  And there is more. Republicans have filibustered the defense \nauthorization bill, crucial legislation for the good of our troops and \ntheir families, because we have not yet passed tax cuts for the \nwealthy. They blocked consideration of the New START treaty, a treaty \nsupported by past presidents and secretaries of state of both parties, \na treaty that will make our Nation and the entire globe safer and more \nsecure. In an extraordinary letter, all 42 Senate Republicans have said \nthey will not allow the Senate to consider any legislation, no matter \nhow important, until we give billions in borrowed money to the wealthy \nin the form of tax cuts.\n  Despite the flaws in this bill and the process by which it comes \nbefore us, it has a number of strengths. Greatest among them is the \nextension of emergency unemployment benefits. In my State and others, \nthousands of Americans are without work through no fault of their own, \nand they and their families are depending on us to give them the \nsupport they need. These benefits are not just critical to those \nfamilies, but they also have a highly stimulative impact on the \neconomy. Extending the UI program is the right thing to do. We need to \ndo it, and we can do it yet this year, if we stay here and continue \nworking, as we should, right through to the new year.\n  But even some of the positives in this legislation have significant \ndrawbacks. The 2 percent payroll tax cut would be welcomed by working \nfamilies, and could help the economy grow. But it would also cost the \nTreasury more than $110 billion in borrowed money next year. While some \nargue that might still be an acceptable price for boosting economic \ngrowth, I believe it is very unlikely that Congress will have the will \nto let that tax cut expire next year. Already, some of our Republican \ncolleagues are talking of making the cut permanent. That money, \notherwise lost to the Social Security trust fund, must come from \nsomewhere, and I am concerned that it will come from cuts to Social \nSecurity or other essential programs.\n  We can support middle-class families, job-producing businesses and \nthe unemployed without unleashing the damage this legislation would do \nto our budget and to economic justice.\n  I cannot accept the price Republicans want to extract from us. We \nneed not accept it if we have the will to debate and amend this \nlegislation and are willing to stay through the end of this year to do \nit. The damage to our fiscal situation and to Social Security, and the \ndamage done by continued inequality these tax cuts would perpetuate, is \nunacceptable. Beyond that, I believe it would be a mistake to allow \nRepublicans to succeed in their irresponsible brinkmanship, blocking \naid to working families and the important other business before the \nSenate in order to secure benefits for the wealthiest Americans.\n  I fully expect that my Republican colleagues will soon be urging this \nbody to rein in the debt. Already, we have seen proposals that would \nseek to remedy our Nation's fiscal crisis by dramatically cutting \ncrucial programs, including Social Security. It is not a stretch to \nsuggest that the cost of this bill alone will lead some to argue that \nCongress must enact more and deeper cuts to essential programs, \nincluding Social Security--all so that we can give away money the \ngovernment does not have to the wealthiest few.\n  We must stand up and fight against an approach that would sacrifice \naid to the vast majority of Americans on the altar of unaffordable tax \ncuts for the wealthiest among us. I believe that time should be today. \nAnd so I will vote against this legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on Monday, the Senate took an important \nstep toward extending critical tax relief for all Americans by \napproving cloture on the Reid-McConnell amendment, by an overwhelming \nvote. This bipartisan vote is encouraging and demonstrates that Members \nof this body can work together, with the President, to do what is \nreasonable and right to address the economic challenges our Nation \ncontinues to face.\n  As with any compromise, however, the bill is not perfect, and I would \nlike to note for the record several--although not all--of the items I \nbelieve should have been handled differently.\n  First, I am concerned about the failure to include an extension of \nthe production tax credit for existing open-loop biomass facilities. \nThis credit is critical for preserving renewable energy and forestry \njobs in Maine and across the United States, and an extension of this \ncredit was included in previous tax proposals. According to the \nAmerican Forest & Paper Association and the Biomass Power Association, \nsince the start of 2008, at least 35 paper mills have permanently \nclosed and more than 75 other facilities have experienced market-\nrelated downtime. In the biomass sector this year, six facilities have \nclosed, three in Maine and three in California, and more are under the \nthreat of closure.\n  The bill would be improved by extending the tax credit period for \nexisting open-loop biomass facilities, as called for by Senator Bill \nNelson's amendment, which I have cosponsored. This amendment would \nallow these facilities to remain competitive with other forms of \nrenewable energy, saving jobs that are seriously at risk.\n  Second, I am concerned that the decision by the drafters to strike \nlanguage added to the Tax Code by the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act could lead to unnecessary confusion regarding certain \nwood stoves.\n  For example, the bill strikes language that I sought in ARRA to \nclarify how the thermal efficiency of residential wood and wood-pellet \nstoves should be measured for purposes of the tax credit in section \n25C. That tax credit was created by the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008, which did not specify a methodology for \ndetermining thermal efficiency. The IRS has issued guidance directing \nthat the ``lower heating value'' methodology should be used, which is \nconsistent with industry practices and with our intent to ensure that \nthe credit is available for efficient and clean-burning wood and wood-\npellet stoves.\n  Removing the reference to the ``lower heating value'' from the code \nserves little purpose. Certainly, however, it does not mean that this \ncommonsense methodology is precluded, nor does it require the IRS to \nrevisit its methodology. I hope that my comments today will help avoid \nconfusion about the use of the ``lower heating value'' methodology with \nrespect to this tax credit.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the bill does not hold the line on a \ntax credit for corn-based ethanol and some other special interest \nprovisions. The corn-based ethanol tax break is extraordinarily \nexpensive, costing some $6 billion in subsidies from taxpayers annually \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. Over recent years we have \nalso seen food and feed prices rise as crops have been diverted to \nfirst generation biofuel production. In addition, corn-based ethanol \nmandates present an environmental concern as they could result in \nenergy efficiency losses and increased emissions of air pollutants, \nbecause mechanical failures can jeopardize the effectiveness of \nemission control devices and systems installed on engines.\n  Of course, a bill without these flaws would have been preferable, but \nwith the economy still weak, and with unemployment persisting at nearly \n10 percent nationally, now is not the time to be raising taxes, and \nthis bill averts one of the largest tax increases in history. America \nneeds jobs--not higher taxes.\n  In September, I first urged my colleagues and the administration to \ncome together around this 2-year compromise that will get us through \nthe recession and send a strong signal to the business community to \ninvest and create jobs. I am pleased that the Senate has acted to give \nfamilies some confidence and business owners some certainty.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the Congress and the President to use \nthis\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n2-year period to undertake comprehensive tax reform to make our system \nfairer, simpler, and more progrowth.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to support the tax cut package \nbefore us today to help middle-class families and workers hit hardest \nby this economy, and that is exactly what this bill will do. It will \nensure that middle-class taxes don't go up January 1, that laid-off \nworkers can provide for their families while they continue to look for \nwork, that an average household in my home State will receive $1,400 in \npayroll tax relief, and it will protect 1.6 million middle class New \nJerseyans from a surprise alternative minimum tax hike of up to $5,600.\n  This is an important moment for the middle class in America.\n  This is a time to come together, like the Senate did last night, to \nensure this bill passes and our economic recovery continues. Many \nfamilies are sitting around the kitchen table at night wondering how \nthey can afford to feed and clothe their children, much less buy gifts \nfor them during this holiday.\n  Middle class families are wondering how they are going to pay the \nmortgage. How they are going to pay the tuition for their college-bound \nchildren next semester.\n  I will vote for this package, not because I agree with every \nprovision, particularly those that give bonus tax breaks to the \nwealthiest and most able to sacrifice during this economic recession, \nbut because it will help families in my State and across this country \nwho really do need our help.\n  I will vote for this package because, at its core, it is a middle-\nclass tax relief package.\n  I will vote for it because it extends tax relief of more than 3,000 \nfor a typical working family and doubles the child tax credit from $500 \nto $1,000.\n  I will vote for it because the $120 billion payroll tax cut is an \neffective way to create jobs and increase the consumer demand sorely \nneeded by our Nation's businesses.\n  I will vote for it because it includes a 2-year extension of the \nalternative minimum tax relief legislation, which I sponsored, so 1.6 \nmillion New Jerseyans will not face an additional tax bill of up to \n$5,600.\n  I will vote for this package because it preserves transit benefits to \nNew Jersey commuters. This provision, which was not included in the \noriginal deal, but I worked hard to restore, will allow commuters to \nreceive up to $230 in transit benefits tax free.\n  It extends the low-income child tax credit and earned-income tax \ncredit to ensure that a working family with three children could \ncontinue to receive a tax cut of more than $2,000.\n  It helps students and their parents by extending the partially \nrefundable American opportunity tax credit, worth up to $2,500, that \nhelps 8 million students and their families cover the cost of tuition.\n  It helps save and create green jobs by extending what's known as the \n1603 Treasury grant program, widely credited with maintaining strong \ngrowth in the renewable energy sector in 2009 and 2010, despite the \nsevere economic downturn, and has saved tens of thousands of jobs in \nthe wind and solar industries.\n  I worked hard to restore this particular provision because it has \nprovided more than $66 million in grants to fund 155 solar projects in \nNew Jersey alone.\n  And most importantly, for those who are unemployed, it includes a \nlong-overdue 13-month extension of Federal support for 99 weeks of \nunemployment insurance for workers who have lost their jobs during this \neconomic downturn, something our Republican colleagues fought against \nall year, a helping hand they refused to extend unless the rich got \neven more in tax cuts, even though extending unemployment benefits is a \npolicy that most economists agree is one of the most effective measures \nto create jobs.\n  It helps small business owners by creating the largest temporary \ninvestment incentive in American history by allowing businesses to \nexpense all of their qualified investments in 2011.\n  Estimates from the Treasury Department indicate this could generate \nmore than $50 billion in additional investment in the U.S. next year.\n  The bill includes a provision I cosponsored to incentivize restaurant \nowners to upgrade their facilities by extending for 2 years a provision \nthat allows them to write off their costs much faster than they could \notherwise, 15 years as opposed to 39 years.\n  And it helps small business owners by extending for 2 years the \nresearch and development tax credit which incentivizes companies to \ncreate jobs in America by giving them a tax credit for qualified \nresearch spending.\n  The R tax credit is truly a jobs credit with 70 percent or more of \nthe credit attributable to salaries and wages of U.S. workers \nperforming research in the United States. I have cosponsored \nlegislation to make this credit permanent, and I hope we will.\n  Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle decided \nthat if we were going to pass a bill to help the middle class, it could \nnot move without additional benefits for the wealthiest.\n  In order for us to help the middle class, we are being asked by our \nRepublican colleagues to give millionaires an additional windfall.\n  In order to pass an extension of desperately needed unemployment \nbenefits as emergency spending, we must also pass a windfall for \nestates worth more than $5 million.\n  Yes that is correct, apparently now Republicans believe you must \noffset help for laid-off workers with estate tax cuts for the heirs of \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  Now, people who have worked hard and built personal wealth should be \napplauded for their success. Their hard work, their creativity, their \ningenuity should be applauded and admired.\n  People who work hard and prosper, they love their country too, and \nthey are in the best position to be helpful to our nation in this tough \neconomic time.\n  Many of them are willing to contribute if we ask, and we know from \nexperience that reverting to the tax rates the wealthiest and most \nsuccessful paid during the Clinton era of prosperity did not hurt our \neconomy.\n  This package certainly is not ideal. Let me be perfectly clear, I do \nnot think we should be giving the wealthiest Americans, those who are \nthe most able to share in the sacrifice needed in today's economy, even \nmore in tax cuts just to keep taxes from increasing on the middle \nclass. But that is the hand we have been dealt. We had votes on \nextending middle class tax cuts, and we could not garner enough \nRepublican support to pass them.\n  Now the decision is not whether or not to support tax cuts for the \nwealthy. The decision before us today is whether we are going to stand \nup for the middle class and protect them from the tax increase that is \nlooming 2 weeks from now.\n  The bottom line is that this package meets our priority on this side \nof the aisle, of making a real difference in the lives of middle class \nfamilies affected by layoffs, families struggling to make ends meet, \nand, in the process, help further stimulate our fragile economy, rather \nthan allow it to slide back into recession.\n  If we can achieve that, then this compromise is well worth it.\n  I hope that those on the other side who have shamelessly stood for \nputting more money in the pockets of millionaires and billionaires \nregardless of the cost, regardless of the fact that doing so has failed \nto create jobs, will not come back a year or 2 years from now and have \nthe audacity to blame this administration or members on this side of \nthe aisle for fiscal irresponsibility, that we will never again be \nlectured about deficits by those who demand billions of dollars in \ndeficit spending for the heir of estates worth more than $5 million.\n  That is what a Republican world looks like. It is a world of blue \nsmoke and mirrors in which they tell us we can see castles, kingdoms, \nan economy that is not real and jobs that are not there.\n  The negotiations to get to this point revealed much about the \npriorities of each party, and frankly the tactics employed by my \nRepublican colleagues do not sit well with me and many of my fellow \nDemocrats.\n  But the bottom line is that most of my colleagues recognize, as I do, \nthat this package will make a real difference in the lives of middle \nclass families struggling in difficult economic circumstances.\n  And I believe it will have strong support, that it will benefit \nmillions of average Americans who simply want us to do what is right \nfor them.\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n  It is my hope that this package is the last time we will be forced to \ncut a deal for the wealthy just to protect middle-class families.\n  I listened with great interest to the words of the President when he \nspoke about tax reform recently. We have an opportunity to reform the \nTax Code, to simplify what has become a nightmare for millions of \nAmericans, to get rid of so much preferential treatment for special \ninterests currently in the code, and to lower income tax rates for \neverybody.\n  We should have a Tax Code that reflects the general interests of the \nAmerican people, not one that forces the less politically connected to \npay more in taxes than those with powerful allies.\n  And I expect that the next time this issue comes up, we will not be \ndiscussing whether or not to extend the failed tax policies of the Bush \nadministration, but how to best simplify the Tax Codes so tax rates for \neverybody can be reduced permanently and responsibly.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in times like these, we cannot afford to \nplay games with the economic security of middle-class families in \nNevada, and across America.\n  This bill is not perfect, but it gives those families the boost they \nso desperately need. It will create 2 million jobs, according to an \nestimate by the Center for American Progress. For Nevadans, the energy \ntax cut provisions will create as many as 2,500 jobs in Nevada alone, \nat a time when jobs are so badly needed.\n  This bill will cut taxes for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses. It contains a $120 billion payroll tax reduction, which \nwill give the average middle-class family a tax cut of $1,200. It \nextends the college tax credit to help more Americans get the education \nand skills they need to compete. And it will ensure that Americans who \nare still looking for work will continue to have the safety net they \nrely on to make ends meet.\n  It is unfortunate that my Republican colleagues drew this process out \nso long. While we ultimately were able to reach a compromise, there was \none point that Republicans refused to compromise on: they were dead set \non delivering huge tax breaks to people who do not need them, no matter \nwhat.\n  Warren Buffett recently came forward and said, I don't need a tax \ncut. Give it to the person who's serving lunch. This is just common \nsense. In tough times, we should concentrate our efforts on helping the \npeople who need it most. Not only will it help them more, but they are \nmore likely to spend the money and help grow our economy.\n  Unfortunately, this debate also revealed that my Republican \ncolleagues would rather talk about the deficit than actually do \nanything to bring it down. The giveaways to millionaires that they \nfought for will add $700 billion to our deficit. My Republican friends \nlove to talk about the deficit, but when it came time for them to make \na decision, cutting the deficit took a back seat to giving tax breaks \nto people who do not need them.\n  In the future, I hope my Republican colleagues will match their \nactions to their rhetoric, and start working with us to bring down the \ndeficit.\n  Clearly, we Democrats disagree with our Republican colleagues about \nwhere we should be focusing our efforts in this tough economy. We think \nwe should be focusing on the middle class, they think we should be \ngiving more benefits to the wealthiest among us, even if those benefits \nadd to the deficit.\n  But despite our disagreements, we were able to reach a compromise. \nBecause that is what the American people want us to do: find common \nground, and reach solutions that will benefit our middle class.\n  The framework agreed upon by President Obama and Senate Republicans \nmight not be the approach I would have taken. But with millions of \nAmerican families still struggling to make ends meet, it is our \nresponsibility not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I know \nour counterparts in the House will pass this bill quickly so that we \ncan get it to the President's desk as soon as possible, and give \nmiddle-class Americans a little more peace of mind this holiday season.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Requests\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we proceed to this important final \nvote, there are two provisions I strongly believe ought to be in this \nbill. They are bipartisan provisions. I came to the floor yesterday to \noffer a unanimous consent on both of those. Unfortunately, our \nRepublican colleagues were not on the Senate floor, so out of a \ncourtesy I did not proceed. But I will now at this point.\n  The advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, 48C--a strong \nbipartisan effort to make sure we are making things in America, \ncreating over 17,000 jobs in 43 States across the country, leveraging \n$7.7 billion in private investment,--should be included in this bill so \nwhen we talk about energy and new innovation, we are making it in \nAmerica.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the second-degree \namendment to the Reid-McConnell substitute to offer amendment No. 4775, \nan amendment to extend the 48C advanced energy manufacturing tax \ncredit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I have a second unanimous consent \nrequest. I also spoke last night about the urgent need to fix an IRS \nreporting provision for small business----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent for another 10 seconds to offer \na unanimous consent request in order to set aside the second-degree \namendment to the Reid-McConnell substitute to offer an amendment No. \n4773 that would repeal the 1099 reporting requirement for small \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, with our vote today on the Tax Relief, \nUnemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, \nwe have passed legislation that will have profound short- and long-term \nconsequences for our nation. I supported\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\nthis measure once it became the only available option to provide much-\nneeded help to American families. I, however, have deep concerns with \nother aspects of this bill, and I extend my support for it with strong \nreservations.\n  Our economy has not yet recovered from the downturn that began over 2 \nyears ago. Hawaii's foreclosure rate in October of this year was the \n12th highest in the Nation. In November, Hawaii saw a 49-percent \nincrease in consumer bankruptcy filings compared to the same month in \n2009, the second largest increase in the country. These are strong \nindications that people in Hawaii cannot sustain an increase in their \ntax obligations. We cannot allow taxes to rise on the workingclass when \nso many homeowners are already unable to afford their mortgages and \nconsumers are unable to meet their outstanding debt obligations.\n  One major cause of these problems is unemployment, and I would not \nhave been able to support this legislation had it not included a 13-\nmonth extension of unemployment benefits. Families and individuals \nacross Hawaii and the Nation need these benefits to help pay their \nrents and mortgages while they search for a job, and parents need this \nassistance to put food on the table and provide for their children. I \nrefuse to abandon these people. That is why I supported this bill.\n  I regret that we were unable to provide permanent tax relief for \nworking-class Americans, families, and small businesses because their \nfinancial well-being has been haplessly tied to tax cuts for \nmillionaires and billionaires since the beginning of this tax debate. \nEarlier this month, we considered two fair and reasonable tax \nproposals--one to permanently extend the expiring tax cuts for families \nearning under $250,000, followed by a compromise that included \nAmericans earning up to $1 million a year. These were good-faith \nefforts to provide help where it is most needed--to families and small \nbusinesses that, unlike the millionaires and billionaires out there, do \nnot have the financial security to weather the recession. \nUnfortunately, both were defeated by a minority of my colleagues and \ninstead we have been forced to maintain fiscally irresponsible Bush-era \ntax policies through the legislation that we have just passed.\n  When these tax cuts were enacted at the beginning of this decade, I \ncalled it ``irresponsible fiscal policy.'' I correctly predicted that \nthe upper income tax breaks would lead to an explosion of the deficit \nand leave a mountain of debt for future generations. At the time, I \nlobbied for targeted tax cuts that would stimulate economic growth and \nemployment while preserving fiscal discipline.\n  The national debt now stands above $13.8 trillion. Our budget \nsurpluses have long since turned into deficits. Difficult budget \nchoices are now before us. We will have the opportunity to reexamine \nthese tax cuts for the richest Americans that we have just imprudently \nextended, as well as the temporary estate tax and payroll tax holiday \nprovisions in the bill. Fiscal discipline must be maintained. I am \nprepared to make hard choices to restore and preserve our country's \nlong-term economic security. Until then, I am pleased that we were able \nto help the unemployed and working-class through this extension of \nexpiring tax provisions and unemployment benefits, and that is why I \nsupported this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10256-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD HOLBROOKE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is with deep sadness that I speak in \nmemory of a dear friend, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who died Monday \nat the far-too-early age of 69.\n  I first met Dick years and years ago, long before he held his most \nrecent post of Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. We had so \nmany conversations, meetings, and trips over the years, as his career \nprogressed, particularly during the war in the former Yugoslavia.\n  Dick's skillful diplomacy that ended the siege of Sarajevo and \nfinally ended that war is legendary. Nobody else could have done what \nhe did. He was motivated above all by compassion, intent on stopping \nthe suffering of innocent people who were being terrorized for no other \nreason than their ethnicity.\n  He combined the force of his convictions with the force of his \npersonality, along with his boundless energy, to do what others had \nbeen unable to do. Ambassador Holbrooke did not accept no for an \nanswer.\n  I remember meeting Dick in 1999. We had planned a meeting. I was in \nMacedonia, and he was in Kosovo. It was a very foggy, rainy day. We \ncould not travel by helicopter, as we planned, so we met on a slippery, \nnarrow road, with a several-hundred-foot cliff on one side. We sat \ntogether on the hood of a car and he described what he had observed. He \ntold me what he believed needed to be done. It was fascinating because \nDick put everything into perspective as only he could.\n  It is fair to say we took advantage of that unlikely meeting to \nreminisce and laugh about other times and places, some of which were \njust as unlikely. This was one of those rare conversations that makes \nan unforgettable impression on you--most of all because it was Dick \nHolbrooke. He was so passionate, so animated, yet with a determination \nand a sense of humor that made the challenge of solving the thorniest \nof problems hard to resist.\n  It was in his latest position that I heard most often from Dick, when \nhe would call to keep me apprised of his efforts to try to get the most \nout of our aid to Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was not an easy task. He \ncalled me on weekends at my home in Vermont, and we would talk about \nit.\n  Dick led the reshaping of U.S. policy in South Asia during a \ndifficult transition period. He charged headfirst into the maelstrom of \nAfghanistan and Pakistan 7 years after the conflict began, raising key \nand sometimes unpopular questions about our efforts there. Not \ninfrequently, the press would report about his combative style and \nanother heated exchange with some foreign leader. But in Dick's final \nhours, his wife Kati Marton received calls of sympathy from Afghan \nPresident Karzai and Pakistani President Zardari, which says a lot \nabout Dick.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Kati and Dick's sons and \nstepchildren and with Dick's loyal staff at the Department of State \nduring this sad time. I and others here have lost a dear friend. The \nAmerican people have lost one of the greatest diplomats of our time, an \nextraordinary man who loved this country and devoted his life to it as \nmuch as any person could.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10256-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to echo the comments \nof Senator Leahy on Ambassador Holbrooke. My sense was, Ambassador \nHolbrooke was a remarkable diplomat and public servant. I got to see \nhim both when he was in his public position and a private position. He \nwas always dedicated to peace in the world. I remember reading his \nbook, ``To End a War,'' which was about the Balkans, and sharing it \nwith my father and my father having discussions with him on the phone. \nHe said: This diplomat, Richard Holbrooke, is a remarkable guy.\n  If you read that book, it is a classic about bringing peace to a very \ndifficult situation. I express my heartfelt condolences to his wife \nKati Marton and his two children, David and Anthony Holbrooke. I tell \nthe family we will miss him very much on the international scene.\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10257-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10257-S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           WAR IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise to discuss the \nPresidential review that is taking place on the war in Afghanistan.\n  We are approaching another signpost in the conflict that has kept our \nmilitary men and women in harm's way longer than any other in our \nhistory--109 months and counting. That is longer than the wars in \nVietnam or Iraq. It is even longer than the Soviet occupation of \nAfghanistan in the 1980s.\n  The signpost I wish to speak of is one President Obama posted when he \nordered the troop increase in Afghanistan last December.\n  In his orders, he also called for a review of our war strategy to be \nconducted 1 year later. That review was to include:\n\n       The security situation and other conditions, including \n     improvement in Afghan governance, development of Afghan \n     National Security Forces, Pakistani actions and international \n     support.\n\n  That review is due this month.\n  I commend our President for his foresight in calling for this review. \nBut in recent months, I have read troubling statements from \nadministration and military leaders. These statements lead me to \nbelieve this review is seen as nothing more than a check in the box.\n  In a Washington Post article, an Under Secretary of Defense said as \nmuch when he stated that the review will not go into much more detail \nthan what is already provided to the President during his monthly \nstatus updates.\n  General Petraeus was also quoted in the same article as saying: ``I \nwould not want to overplay the significance of this review.''\n  I think this approach to this review would be another tragic mistake \nin what I fear is an ongoing series of them.\n  After 9 years and $455 billion, the unfortunate reality is, we are \nstill not anywhere near where we want to be or should be in \nAfghanistan. Anything less than a thorough and unflinching review is \nunacceptable. It is unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable to the \nAmerican people.\n  A famed military author, Carl von Clausewitz, wrote a book titled \n``On War,'' which is required reading for any military professional. In \nthat book, he wrote:\n\n       The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of \n     judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to \n     establish . . . the kind of war on which they are embarking; \n     neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into, \n     something that is alien to its nature. This is the first of \n     all strategic questions and the most comprehensive.\n\n  Today, our struggles in Afghanistan necessitate that we again follow \nvon Clausewitz's advice. We must answer the big questions about the \nkind of war we set out to fight and the kind of war we are fighting.\n  Everyone knows the big question when it comes to Afghanistan. That is \nwhy it is the big question: Is our prolonged involvement in Afghanistan \nworth the costs we as a nation are paying for it? Is it worth the human \ncost? Thousands of Americans have been maimed or killed in this war so \nfar, and thousands more stand in harm's way as we speak. Is it worth \nthe fiscal cost? Our wars in the last decade have left us with huge \ndeficits. And for the last decade, wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq \nwent unpaid for. Instead of rallying the Nation during a time of war, \nasking for sacrifices from everyone, Congress and two Presidents chose \nto pass this massive debt on to future generations--the first time we \nhave done so in modern times.\n\n  The real issue is not what we are spending to protect our Nation but \nwhether that spending is making us safer, which leads to the question: \nIs our continued involvement in Afghanistan worth the cost to our \nlarger national security priorities? Our commitment in Afghanistan is \npulling time, energy, and funds from other equally important national \nsecurity priorities, priorities such as energy independence, \ncounterproliferation, and countering terrorist activities in Yemen, \nSomalia, and many other places around the world.\n  That is why this review is so critical. We have to decide as a Nation \nif our prolonged involvement in Afghanistan is worth it, and we must \ndecide on an exit strategy. We have a responsibility to answer that big \nquestion with a thoroughness and honesty that honors the sacrifices of \nour military men and women.\n  I believe we answer that question by using this signpost--by using \nthis review--to address four key issues that will ultimately mean the \ndifference between our success and our failure in Afghanistan. To me, \nthose four issues are: our timeline for an exit strategy, an \naccelerated transition to an Afghan-led security operation, corruption \nin the Karzai government, and safe havens in Pakistan.\n  Let me take them one at a time. First, our timeline for an exit \nstrategy. This review should provide an honest assessment of where we \nare in the timeline that President Obama laid out last year. In his \nspeech at West Point last December, President Obama rightly dropped the \nopen-ended guarantee of U.S. and NATO involvement. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The absence of a time frame for transition would deny us \n     any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. \n     It must be clear that Afghans will have to take \n     responsibility for their security and that America has no \n     interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\n\n  His order last year for the military mission was clear and included a \ntimeline based on a ``accelerated transition.'' In that order--quoting \nfrom the order--he focused on:\n  Increasing the size of the ANSF and leveraging the potential for \nlocal security forces so we can transition responsibly for security to \nthe Afghan government on a time line that will permit us to begin to \ndecrease our troop presence by July 2011.\n  July 2011. That is a little more than 6 months from now. The American \npeople deserve to know if July 2011 is still a realistic timeframe to \nbegin our exit from Afghanistan; and, if not, what has happened to \ncause a delay and how long will that delay be? What will be the \nadditional costs, both human and budgetary?\n  The bottom line is this: Without an aggressive timeline for reducing \nU.S. military support in the region--a timeline that the Afghans \nbelieve is rock solid--there is no incentive for them to defend their \nvillages and cities. With the U.S. and NATO as guarantors of security, \nthe people of Afghanistan could rely on our forces to provide security \nindefinitely.\n  Chairman Levin, our Armed Services chairman here in the Senate, has \ngiven careful thought to the issue of a timeline. In a recent speech to \nthe Council on Foreign Relations, he said:\n\n       Open-ended commitments encourage drift and permit inaction. \n     Firm time lines demand attention and force action.\n\n  Without an aggressive timeline, there is no exit strategy.\n  Issue No. 2, and directly related to No. 1, the accelerated \ntransition to the Afghan people. This must be an Afghan-led security \neffort. This month's report should update the American people on our \nprogress or lack thereof in turning over security duties to the Afghan \nNational Army, the Afghan National Security Forces, and the Afghan \nNational Police.\n  The famed British officer T. E. Lawrence, known to many as Lawrence \nof Arabia, once said, with regard to the Arab insurgency against the \nOttoman Empire:\n\n       Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the \n     Arabs do it tolerably than they do it perfectly. It is their \n     war, and you are there to help them.\n\n  This quote is also mentioned in the Army Field Manual on \ncounterinsurgency. In Afghanistan, I believe the same approach can be \napplied.\n  The Afghan security forces are not doing their job perfectly, nor \nshould we expect the Afghan forces to match the might of the U.S. \nmilitary. But to echo T. E. Lawrence, they are beginning to do it \ntolerably, and I believe it is better that the Afghans continue to \nbuild on their new success.\n  Combined, an aggressive timeline and an accelerated transition to the \nAfghans will help us achieve two equally important goals: first, the \ntimely handover of security helps prove to the international community \nthat the American people do not have imperial ambitions in Afghanistan. \nAs President Obama said at West Point:\n\n       We have no interest in occupying your country.\n\n  And second, a timely handover allows the United States and its allies \nto bring our heroes home, and it allows us\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nto begin the important work of reducing our deficits, investing in our \nNation and our people so we can remain strong and build a more \nprosperous Nation.\n  This brings me to issue No. 3: Corruption in the Karzai government. \nThere is no doubt our Armed Forces have the ability to conduct the \ndifficult counterinsurgency work of clearing and holding. The question \nis whether the Afghan Government has the ability to build their nation \nand to be ready for a timely transition. That is why in his order to \nthe military President Obama was clear when he said:\n\n       Given the profound problems of legitimacy and effectiveness \n     with the Karzai government, we must focus on what is \n     realistic. Our plan for the way forward in dealing with the \n     Karzai government has four elements: Working with the Karzai \n     government when we can, working around him when we must; \n     enhancing sub-national governance; strengthening corruption \n     reduction efforts; and implementing a post-election compact.\n\n  There is no doubt that corruption is rampant throughout Afghanistan \nand, in particular, within the Karzai administration. For years, \nindependent daily press reports from Afghanistan, as well as official \nU.S. Government reports, confirm corruption at all levels of Afghan \nsociety. A recent leak of diplomatic cables reveals the severity of the \nproblem.\n  First, let me stress I do not condone these recent leaks. They have \nneedlessly put our military and diplomatic corps at risk. But these \ndocuments pull back the curtain on the scale of the corruption in \nAfghanistan.\n  One example in particular illustrated the tremendous difficulty we \nface in our search for an honest, reliable partner. That was the \naccount in the New York Times of former Afghanistan Vice President \nAhmed Zia Massoud. Massoud was detained after he brought $52 million in \nunexplained cash into the United Arab Emirates. He was allowed to keep \nthe $52 million.\n  Let me say that again: $52 million. That is a lot of money, \nespecially when you consider that his government salary was a few \nhundred dollars a month.\n  Not only is corruption rampant in Afghanistan--with the reports of \nKarzai's own brother involved in double dealing and unscrupulous \nactions--but basic government functions are suffering because of \nKarzai's inability to manage his own government.\n  In Kandahar, our military has made this former Taliban stronghold a \nmuch more secure city. But despite that progress, the Washington Post \nhas reported multiple vacancies in key government positions. As an \nunnamed U.S. official stated:\n\n       We are acting as donor and government. That is not \n     sustainable.\n\n  We cannot be expected to indefinitely shoulder the security or \ngovernmental burdens in Afghanistan. Having a firm timeline will put \nPresident Karzai on notice that he must step up his efforts to make \nthis an Afghan-led effort. Our goal must be to transition \nresponsibility and authority for the future of Afghanistan to the \nAfghan people, and this month's review should include a report to the \nAmerican people on our progress and how he is making that happen.\n  This brings me to the fourth and final issue: safe havens in \nPakistan. For years, safe havens have been permitted to exist in \nPakistan for insurgent and terrorist forces, enabling them to operate \nfreely. This has been one of the worst kept secrets in the region, \nwhich is why President Obama stated during his West Point speech:\n\n       We will act with the full recognition that our success in \n     Afghanistan is inextricably linked to our partnership with \n     Afghanistan. We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from \n     once again spreading through that country. But this same \n     cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. \n     That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of \n     the border.\n\n  Since 2001, the United States has sent more than $10.4 billion to \nPakistan to support humanitarian and security operations. Despite these \nexpenditures, radical militant groups such as the Quetta Shura Taliban \nand the Haqqani Network have continued to leverage their freedom of \nmovement to kill, maim and disrupt our efforts and those of our NATO \nallies.\n  These insurgent activities are nearly textbook--something that the \nArmy Field Manual on counterinsurgency describes in detail as having \noccurred throughout the history of insurgent warfare.\n\n       The issue of sanctuaries thus cannot be ignored during \n     planning. Effective COIN operations work to eliminate all \n     sanctuaries.\n\n  With such military advice in mind, I must ask: How do we expect to \ndefeat an insurgency that is being supported by elements of the \nPakistani military and intelligence service on the other side of the \nKhyber Pass?\n  After 9 years, why are we tolerating these safe havens? Mullah Omar, \nthe leader of the Taliban insurgents, is in exile in Pakistan. His \nfollowers regroup and rest in Pakistan only to cross the border and \nfight our troops once again. Insurgent fighters have increased their \nattacks by 53 percent over the last quarter. And when both ISAF and \nU.S. forces are unable to infiltrate their base of operation, how can \nwe expect to maintain an adequate level of security for the future?\n  President Obama's order specifically spelled out assessment criteria \nfor Pakistan. The assessment was intended to include the following \nquestion:\n\n       Are there indicators we have begun to shift Pakistan's \n     strategic calculus and eventually end their active and \n     passive support for extremists?\n\n  Thus far, Pakistan's ``strategic calculus'' has been overly focused \non India and toward turning a blind eye to radical groups in Waziristan \nand other regions near the Afghan border.\n  Furthermore, the current position of the Pakistani Government has \nonly led to a host of crazed conspiracy theories about the United \nStates and its involvement in the region, giving fuel to the \nrecruitment efforts of our enemies.\n  Because of double-dealing by some in Pakistan and a Pakistani \nGovernment that has not fully supported our efforts, we are sending our \nmen and women to fight in Afghanistan without a true partner. We are \nasking them to fight with one hand tied behind their back.\n  These challenges I discussed are not a secret. Each and every one of \nthem has been debated, discussed, dissected, and yet the answers remain \nelusive. We invaded Afghanistan as a justifiable military response to \nthe tragic attacks of September 11, 2001. This response was \noverwhelmingly supported by Congress--including myself, the public, and \nthe international community. But I believe today, after 109 months of \nfighting, after more than 1,400 American military deaths in Operation \nEnduring Freedom, almost 10,000 American military men and women \ninjured, after $455 billion and counting expended, a good, hard, \nrealistic assessment of our mission is needed.\n  If our plan to succeed in Afghanistan is not yielding the results we \nseek, then we must also reevaluate our plan and mission. Make no \nmistake, I am proud of our brave men and women in uniform and what they \nare doing there. I am equally proud of our diplomatic workers, aid \nworkers, and civilians who are working hard to improve the livelihoods \nof Afghan people.\n  I had an opportunity to meet many of them earlier this year on a \nCODEL led by my colleague Senator Carper of Delaware. These are some of \nthe finest men and women our Nation has to offer to the Afghan people. \nBut it is not their job that is in question--it is ours, the Congress, \nthe President, his administration, the military leadership. It is up to \nus to find the answers, to ensure we have a clear, achievable mission \nfor our soldiers to carry out.\n  Today I am not sure that is the case. I am looking forward to hearing \nthe conclusions of the review the President called for 1 year ago. I \nalso look forward to hearing the President reaffirm his July 2011 \ndeadline for an accelerated transition to the Afghans.\n  We all must be prepared to ask the hard questions and demand honest \nanswers, regardless of the political consequences. Our military men and \nwomen deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask consent to speak for 15 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first let me commend my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Thomas Udall, for a thoughtful presentation on a \nchallenge we face as Americans regardless of political affiliation. It \nis\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nthoughtful in that he reflected not only on our mission and our \nresponsibility but thoughtful in that he reflected on the cost, the \ncost in human lives and the cost in dollars and the challenge we face \nin Congress to make sure those dollars are well spent and no American \nlife is wasted. I thank my colleague for that thoughtful presentation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10259-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10259-S10260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last night I was on a conference call. \nIt was an unusual one. There were 8,000 people on this conference call. \nI have never been on a conference call like that. They were from all \nacross the United States of America. We spoke for a few minutes and \nthen took questions.\n  A young woman came on. She didn't give her name but she said, I want \nto tell you who I am. I am a person who is about to graduate from a \nmajor university in California with a degree in pharmacy and I have \nnowhere to go.\n  You see, she is a Hispanic who came to the United States at an early \nage, brought here by her parents. She defied the odds by finishing high \nschool. Half of the Hispanic students do not. She did. Then she defied \nthe odds even more by going to college. Only one in twenty in her \nstatus actually attends college in America. Then she stuck around for 5 \nyears-plus to get her degree in pharmacy science.\n  We know for a fact we need pharmacists desperately across America, \neverywhere, in North Carolina and New Mexico and Illinois--we need \npharmacists. Why aren't we using the talent of this ambitious, \nenergetic, successful, young woman? Because she has no country. She is \nin America but she is not an American. She has no status.\n  The DREAM Act, which I introduced 10 years ago, addresses this \nchallenge across America. Children, brought to America without a vote \nin the process, children who came here and made their lives here, grew \nup in America, as Senator Menendez has said on the floor, standing up \nand proudly pledging allegiance to that flag, standing up and singing \nthe Star Spangled Banner at baseball and football games--but they know \nand we know that they are not Americans. They feel like Americans. Many \nof them have never seen and don't know the country they came from. This \nis their country. But because they were brought here not in legal \nstatus, undocumented, they have nowhere to turn.\n  The first time I heard about this issue was when a Korean woman \ncalled me in Chicago. She was a single mom with three kids. She ran a \ndry cleaners and her older daughter was a musical prodigy, in fact so \ngood she had been accepted at the Julliard School of Music in New York. \nBefore she went to school she filled out the application form and came \nto a box which said ``nationality/citizenship.'' She turned to her mom \nand she said: U.S. nationality, right? Her mom said: No, we brought you \nhere at the age of 2 and we never filed any papers. Her daughter said: \nWhat are we going to do? Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin. So \nthey called my office and we called the Immigration Service and when \nthe conversation ended it was very clear. Our government said to that \nyoung girl: You have one choice--leave. Go back to Korea.\n  After 16 years of living successfully in the United States and making \na great young life, our laws told her to leave because she was illegal. \nThat is a basic injustice. It makes no sense to hold children \nresponsible for any wrongdoing by their parents, children at the age of \n2 who are now going to be penalized the rest of their natural life \nbecause their mother did not file a paper? Penalized because we have no \nprocess for her to have an opportunity to be part of the United States?\n  So I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act says if you have been \nhere for at least 5 years and came below the age of 15 and completed \nhigh school, no serious criminal record, a person in good moral \nstanding ready to be interviewed, speaking English, paying all the \ntaxes and fines and fees that are thrown your way, then if you are \nwilling to do one of two things we will give you a chance to be legal \nin the United States. No. 1, enlist in the military. If you are willing \nto risk your life and die for America, I think you are deserving of an \nopportunity for citizenship. Second, if you complete 2 years of \ncollege--which, as I say, defies the odds; it is a small percentage who \nwould be able to do this--if you are able to complete 2 years of \ncollege, then here is what the bill says: We will put you in a 10-year \nconditional immigrant status.\n  Let me translate. For 10 years you have no legal rights to any \ngovernment programs in America--not Medicaid if you get sick, not Pell \ngrants if you go further in college, no student loans--nothing. You can \nstay here legally but you cannot draw one penny from this government \nduring 10 years after you have finished high school and qualify under \nthis act; 10 years.\n  Along the way we are going to keep an eye on you. If you stumble and \nfall--criminal record--you are gone. No exceptions; for felons, they \nare gone. Basically, we will continue to ask hard questions of you as \nto how you are doing.\n  In the version of the bill we are going to vote on, you are going to \npay a fee, $500 at the outset and more later. Under that House \nprovision, those students struggling to get by with no right to \ngovernment assistance by our bill will have to spend 10 years in this \ncountry. If they make it--2 years in the military or 2 years of college \nand they finish their 10 years--then they get in line and wait 3 to 5 \nyears more before they can ever have a chance to be citizens.\n\n  It is a long, hard process that not many Americans today could \nsurvive. Some of these kids will because they have made it thus far. \nThey are determined, they are idealistic, they are energetic. They are \njust what America needs.\n  Do you know what Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, said about \nthis:\n\n       They are just the kind of immigrants we need to help solve \n     our unemployment problem. Some of them will go on to create \n     new small businesses and hire people. It is senseless for us \n     to chase out the home-grown talent that has the potential to \n     contribute so significantly to our society.\n\n  Will these DREAM Act students be a drag, then, once they are part of \nAmerica? Not according to the Congressional Budget Office. They \nconcluded that the DREAM Act would produce $2.2 billion in net revenues \nover 10 years. How can that be? Because these DREAM Act students would \ncontribute to our economy by working and paying taxes. These are \nstudents who are destined to be successful.\n  Who believes they will be successful? Start at the Pentagon. \nSecretary of Defense Gates has asked for us to pass the DREAM Act. He \nhas said that these bright, young, dedicated people will be great in \nservice to America. He knows that many of them come from cultural \ntraditions of service to their country and he wants that talent in the \nU.S. military and he wants that diversity in our military. Fifteen \npercent of America today is Hispanic. The number is growing. Almost 10 \npercent of the people who vote in America are Hispanic and we want to \nmake certain our military is as strong as it can be and reflects \nAmerica as it is and what we want to it be.\n  We will have a chance to vote. Senator Harry Reid, the majority \nleader, has said we are going to vote on the DREAM Act this year--and \nwe must, we absolutely must. We owe it to these young people, we owe it \nto their families, and we owe it to this country to rectify this \nterrible injustice.\n  There comes a time occasionally in the history of this country where \nwe have a chance to right a wrong. We fought for decades over righting \nthe wrong of slavery, the mistreatment of African Americans. We fought \nfor decades to right the wrong of discrimination against women--denied \nthe right to vote under our original Constitution. We fought for \ndecades for the rights of the disabled in America. Each generation gets \nits chance to expand the definition of freedom and liberty and expand \nthe reach of citizenship and the protection of our laws. This is our \nchance. This is a simple matter of justice.\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues on the other side who do not \nsupport it and they have said, if we would spend more money on border \nsecurity, then maybe, just maybe I would be willing to give these young \npeople a chance.\n  First, if there were no border security, it would not enlarge the \nnumber\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\nof people protected here. You have to have been in the United States \nfor 5 years in order to qualify here so any newcomers to the United \nStates are not going to be eligible anyway. But let's get to the point. \nI support border security. We need a strong border. We need to make \nsure those who are illegal, undocumented, do not come across that \nborder. I have voted for the money, I voted for the fences, I voted for \nthe walls, I voted for everything they called for, and we have \ndramatically under this President increased the border security in \nAmerica and I will vote for more. I will vote for more. I give my word \nto my colleagues I will.\n  I have said to Senators from those border States: Count on me to be \nwith you. But don't hold these children hostage to that demand. Don't \nhold them hostage to that demand because border security in and of \nitself has nothing to do with justice for them.\n  Others have argued we want to make sure at the end of the day they \ncan never become legal citizens of the United States. Never? After \nliving their lives in this country, never? I would say: Go to the back \nof the line. And they should. Wait in line patiently, even if it takes \n15 years. That is only fair. But never?\n  Others have said we should give them the military option. If they \njoin the military, then we will let them become citizens. I don't think \nthat is right and I don't believe the military would support that \neither because many would be applying for the military who are not \ninspired to serve in the military but are only doing it for the purpose \nof this law. Let's let those who are not going in the military have \ntheir own avenue, their own path to legalization by education and \nachievement in this society, not in the military.\n  I would also say to my friends and colleagues, some have argued it is \na little too close to Christmas for us to worry about an issue such as \nthis. We ought to go home. These young people are home and they are \nasking for us to pass the DREAM Act so that home will welcome them.\n  America is the only home they have ever known. I am willing to stay a \nday or two or more, whatever it takes, so we can pass this bill, right \nthis injustice, and give these young people a chance.\n  The House has done its part. They passed a bill last week. \nCongressman Luis Gutierrez and Congressman Howard Berman did a \nwonderful job in passing this legislation. It is good legislation. We \nhave had 57 votes on the floor of the Senate but because of our rules \nyou need 60. All I am asking is some of the Republicans who have told \nme in their heart of hearts they support this and worry about it \npolitically, to put themselves in the shoes of our predecessors in the \nSenate who, when given a chance to expand the civil rights--of African \nAmericans, of women, of the disabled--said that justice trumps \npolitics. We will stand on the side of justice and let history be the \njudge. That is the challenge we have with the DREAM Act.\n  I urge my colleagues, support the DREAM Act. Let's give these young \npeople a chance to make America an even greater nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to briefly discuss the so-\ncalled omnibus spending package that is apparently headed this way. \nThis budget-busting, trillion-dollar spending behemoth is nearly 2,000 \npages in length, and it is laden with over 6,000 earmarks for various \nspecial interests.\n  This is a debacle that could have been avoided. Today is the 349th \nday of this year. There are only 16 days until the end of the year. \nThere are only 10 days until one of the most sacred Christian \nholidays--Christmas. Yet the majority waited until just now to unveil \nour first real appropriations bill that will be considered on the \nSenate floor in the entire year.\n  The fiscal year began on October 1 of this year. Yet we have waited \nover 2 months to even consider a fiscal year 2011 spending bill. How \ncould anybody claim this is responsible management of our citizens' tax \ndollars? There is no way to sugarcoat it. Congress has been derelict in \nits duty to produce any of the 12 annual appropriations bills for the \nfiscal year.\n  We did not even bother to debate or pass a budget resolution this \nyear to at least create the notion that Congress wanted to constrain \nspending. While Americans across this country are taking a hard look at \ntheir finances, prioritizing their spending, their government continues \nto max the taxpayer credit card. This one is a doozy: 1,924 pages, \n$1.27 trillion in spending, $9 billion more than even last year's \nunacceptable spending levels, over 6,000--let me repeat that--over \n6,000 earmarks that were funded more on geography and political \ninfluence than on anything to do with merit. That is $8 billion worth \nof earmarks when the American people are crying out for transparency \nand thought they had sent a strong message in November.\n  While we should have been considering how to constrain spending, the \nauthors of this legislation were busy behind closed doors seeing how \nmuch pork they could return to their States. This ``you get yours and I \nwill get mine'' mentality is one of the reasons we have the budgetary \nhole we have dug. Yet we see 6,000 earmarks tucked away in this \nlegislation.\n  Let me just give three of the priorities, according to these \nearmarks: $200,000 of somebody's hard-earned tax dollars for beaver \nmanagement; $1.5 million of somebody's hard-earned tax dollars for \nmosquito trapping; $300,000 of somebody's hard-earned tax dollars for \nthe Polynesian Voyaging Society.\n  The list goes on and on. I could be here for the next 24 hours going \nthrough the list.\n  When I was Secretary of Agriculture, we proposed a budget, and we \nwould not have a single earmark in it. But after the logrolling \noccurred on Capitol Hill, we would get our funding back, and it would \nbe absolutely stuffed with earmarks, spending somebody's hard-earned \ntax dollars.\n  It is a sad commentary that a few million dollars in home State pork \ncan often convince someone to swallow $1 trillion of government \nspending. Yet that is where we end up too often. It looks to me like \nthis is greased, and it is going to happen again. The authors of this \nlegislation simply missed the message of November 2. We should be \npassing appropriations bills that actually rein in spending instead of \ndoubling down, spending more, and adding to the era of big government. \nYet this massive bill is laden with end-of-the-year gifts.\n  One supporter of the spending bill actually admitted it was the \nChristmas tree of all time, adorned by spending somebody else's hard-\nearned tax dollars. This spending juggernaut is simply not what \nAmericans want or deserve.\n  While we are faced with numerous challenges, none is greater than \ntackling this growing spending in our national debt. In fact, a \nbipartisan group of almost 20 Senators came to the floor yesterday--and \nI was part of that group--to pledge our commitment to address the \nnational debt.\n  How ironic that this massive spending bill is being discussed the \nvery next day. Maybe actions speak louder than words. It is time for us \nto actually back up the rhetoric on controlling spending. A look at the \nlast appropriations bills just since I arrived a couple of years ago \nshows spending is growing by 17 percent. The sad truth of that number \nis there is no economy--no economy--that can grow the revenues fast \nenough to keep up with the spending appetite of Washington, DC.\n  In fact, in a few years we will be spending more on finance charges \nthan the entire defense budget. It is like a family running up the \ncredit card and then looking for more credit cards. But, unfortunately, \nit is now commonplace to pass bills that spend $1 trillion when our \ncitizens are saying: Please stop. Unfortunately, the spending has not \nstopped.\n  I will oppose this bill, and I will do all I can to advocate that my \ncolleagues do the same. Government spends too much. We need to keep \nmore at home with the people.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, as a Christian, no one has to remind me of \nthe importance of Christmas for all of the Christian faith, all of \ntheir families all across America.\n  I do not think any of us, and I do not need to hear the sanctimonious \nlectures of Senators Kyl and DeMint to remind me of what Christmas \nmeans.\n  My question is, Where were their concerns about Christmas when they \nled filibuster after filibuster on major pieces of legislation during \nthis entire Congress--not once but 87 times, taking days and days of \nthe people's time in the Senate on wasteful delay?\n  Senate Republicans need look no further than themselves in casting \nblame for the predicament we are in right now. In this Congress, I \nrepeat, Republicans have waged 87 filibusters. They have used every \nprocedural trick in the book to delay legislation that is important to \nthe American people.\n  We have been able to work through most of that and have what, in the \nmind of Norm Ornstein, the most successful Congress watcher in decades \nsays is the most successful, productive Congress in the history of the \ncountry. We have done that in spite of all of the roadblocks that have \nbeen thrown in our way.\n  In just a few minutes, we are going to proceed to the START treaty. I \nam told the Republicans are going to make us read the entire treaty in \nan effort to stall us from passing it. Isn't that wonderful. That \ntreaty has been here since April or May of this year--plenty of time to \nread it.\n  These are additional days of wasted time that we could be using to \npass legislation to get home for the holidays. Yet some of my \nRepublican colleagues have the nerve to whine about having to stay in \naction and do the work the American people pay us to do. We make large \nsalaries. We could work, as most American do, during the holidays.\n  Perhaps Senators Kyl and DeMint have been in Washington too long \nbecause in my State, Nevadans employed in casinos and hotels and \nthroughout the State of Nevada--on our ranches, basically everyplace--\nhave to work hard on holidays, including Christmas, to support their \nfamilies.\n  The mines do not shut down in Nevada on Christmas. People work. They \nget paid double time a lot of times when they have good contracts. But \nthey work on Christmas holidays. Most people do not get 2 weeks off at \nany time let alone Christmas week. These people who are lucky enough to \nhave a job in these trying times need to work extra hard just to make \nends meet.\n  So it is offensive to me and millions of working Americans across \nthis country for any Senator to suggest that working through the \nChristmas holidays is somehow sacrilegious or disrespectful.\n  The path to finishing this year lies in the hands of Senators such as \nSenators Kyl and DeMint and any other Senate Republican who is trying \nto run out the clock or run out the door without finishing the American \npeople's business. If they decide to work with us, we can all have a \nhappy holiday. If they do not, we will continue until we finish the \npeople's business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10261-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTREATY WITH RUSSIA ON MEASURES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF \n              STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have had a number of conversations in the \nrecent minutes with the Republican leader. I think we would be well \nadvised--and we are going to proceed along this avenue unless someone \nhas an objection--that for the rest of the day and the evening, however \nlong people want to visit, we will be in a period of morning business. \nAs soon as Senator Lincoln finishes her remarks, we will be in a period \nof morning business, and Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 15 \nminutes. I put that in the form of a consent request.\n  We have a number of Senators over here and on the Republican side who \nwant to speak on the START treaty, but people are not going to be \nrestricted to that. They can speak about anything they want. Then \ntomorrow morning we will return to the START treaty.\n  So this afternoon, I again ask unanimous consent that we be in a \nperiod of morning business and that Senators be allowed to speak for up \nto 15 minutes each during this period of morning business, with the \nunderstanding that tomorrow morning, at a reasonable hour, we will \nreturn to the START treaty and begin debate directly on that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. And part of that agreement is that today will be for debate \nonly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I am \ncertainly not going to object, I want to thank the majority leader. I \nthink it is a good way to go forward. There was some suggestion that \nsome on this side of the aisle wanted to read the treaty. Our view is \nthat that is not essential.\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nWe do encourage our members--I know Senator Lugar, our ranking member \non Foreign Relations, is here and Senator Kyl, who has been deeply \ninvolved in this issue. We would encourage them to begin the debate on \nthe treaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also, if I could respond to my friend, I \nknow Senator Lugar has spent lots of time on this treaty, as has \nSenator Kyl, as has Senator Kerry and others. Everyone, we will be very \ngenerous with time. If Senator Lugar, who is one of the wizards of \nforeign policy in the history of our country, needs more time, no one \nis going to stand in the way of that. So everyone should understand \nthat we did put a 15-minute limitation on it, but there will be \nconsents granted for people to speak longer if, in fact, it is \nnecessary.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the leader \nwith respect to that question. I wonder if the order might predicate at \nthe outset that Senator Lugar--he has asked me for 40 minutes as an \nopening. I know Senator Kyl would probably want to be able to speak an \nequal amount of time. I would like to, obviously, make an opening, \nappropriately a little longer. So if we could perhaps make the order 40 \nminutes to Senator Lugar, 40 minutes to Senator Kyl. I would like a \nhalf hour. And we have some other Senators from there. And we could \nvary this as we go. Is that possible?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. So the consent request is that Senator Lugar be recognized \nfor 40 minutes, Senator Kyl for 40 minutes, Senator Kerry for 30 \nminutes; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not sure \nI will be speaking for 40 minutes or any particular timeframe here. I \nwant to focus for the moment on the omnibus and a continuing \nresolution, so my remarks probably would be relevant to that, and \ntherefore I probably should not join in the unanimous consent request \nat this time.\n  Mr. REID. OK. So, Mr. President, I am glad we clarified that. But, as \nI said, anyone can talk about anything they want. So why don't we have \nthe consent request amended that Senator Lugar be recognized for 40 \nminutes, Senator Kerry for 30 minutes, and then the rest of the time \nwill be jump ball for people to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. And I conferred with Senator McConnell. There will be no \nrollcall votes the rest of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, I hope there is not too \nmuch order because it will make me feel a little bit out of place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will please come to \norder. Take conversations off the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Thank you, Mr. President. As I said, I hope there is \nnot too much order. I do not want this place to change too much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10262-S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am glad to be here with my colleagues \nto express my gratitude for the incredible, blessed life's journey I \nhave experienced thus far and the wonderful contributions this place \nhas made to that. I have been enormously blessed by the people of \nArkansas to have represented them in the U.S. Congress, first as a \nMember of the House of Representatives and finally now as a U.S. \nSenator. Today, I rise as the daughter of two amazing parents, Martha \nand the late Jordan Lambert, the proud daughter of a seventh-generation \nArkansas family, dirt farmers--not to be confused, we didn't farm dirt, \nbut we were hardworking farmers who were not afraid to get dirty, to \nget our hands into the Earth and to do what it was we have done for \ngenerations in Arkansas. I am also the proud wife of Dr. Steve Lincoln \nand the very proud mother of two incredible young men, Reece and \nBennett--great boys. You all have watched them grow up. It is the many \nunique life experiences each of us brings to this place and to this job \nthat really and truly contribute to the mark we leave on this \ninstitution.\n\n  When I came to the Senate, my boys were 2 and we were about to \ncelebrate their third birthday. We didn't have any friends up here, so \nI looked around the Senate to see who had children, who could bring \ntheir kids to our birthday party, and there were a few. We kind of had \nto rent out some kids to come to the Moonbounce to have a great party \nand it was fun. I realized how important that experience was for me to \nbring to this body, to share with people. Patty Murray knows--she has \nbeen there--Mary Landrieu, Amy Klobuchar, and so many others who have \nhad their children here in the Senate. What a difference that makes in \nyour perspective on what you are doing here. It makes a big difference.\n  Birthdays were a big deal when we first got here. In my household, \nyou are allowed to celebrate your birthday for an entire week, and it \nis always a great time. My first birthday I celebrated in the Senate \nwas unusual. We had just moved. My husband had moved his practice. The \nboys were here. They had just turned 3. It was hectic. It was a new \nCongress. We had all just come through an impeachment trial. There were \nmany things going on. When my birthday came around, it kind of came and \nwent. My husband noticed that. So we had gone to a spouse dinner \nshortly after my first birthday in the Senate. My good friend, Joe \nBiden, who was my seatmate before he left to become Vice President, and \nhis wife Jill had reached out to us to make us feel comfortable. We \nwere young parents. We had small children. We were both working very \nhard.\n  The first spouse dinner we went to, we were sitting with Joe and \nJill, and Jill produced a lovely birthday gift. It was a monogrammed \nbox, obviously something that was thought about. It wasn't something \nshe picked up and regifted from her closet at home. It meant so much to \nmy husband and to me, that we were a part of a family who realized what \nwe were going through--not just what they were going through but what \nwe were going through. I looked at Jill and told her: You couldn't have \ndone anything to make me or my husband more happy than to think of \nsomething that was important in our lives, and they did that. I have \nbeen a part of this family, and it has been a great time.\n  As I glance back on my time here, I do so with great pride, knowing \nthat each of my votes and actions were taken with the best interests of \nthe people of Arkansas in mind. I have always attempted to conduct \nmyself in a manner that would make Arkansans proud, and my tears today \nI hope are not going to affect that. Living by my mother's rule as we \ndid growing up, if it was rude or dangerous, it was not allowed, and I \nhope I have definitely met that rule because Mother sent us off with \nit.\n  As a farmer's daughter, I am honored to have helped craft three farm \nbills that were crucial to the economy of Arkansas. I was able to \npersuade my colleagues to understand the regional differences in \nproduction agriculture in our country but, most of all, I am proud I \nwas able to impress upon my colleagues and others, hopefully, across \nthis great Nation of ours the enormous blessing our Nation receives \nfrom farm and ranch families, what they bestow upon us, what they allow \nus and all the rest of the world to do each and every day; that is, to \neat, to sustain ourselves, and to be able to grow.\n  I am particularly honored to have become the first woman and the \nfirst Arkansan to serve as the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. It has been a wonderful year I \nhave had, and I will always be proud of what we have accomplished in \nthat committee this year and certainly in years past.\n  We passed historic child nutrition legislation. As a result, each \nmeal served in schools will meet nutritional standards our children and \nfuture generations deserve, putting them on a path to wellness instead \nof obesity. As a result, we will see an increase in the reimbursement \nrate for schools for the\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nfirst time since 1973--since I was in junior high, younger than my own \nchildren today--and we did so by not adding one penny to the national \ndebt as well as doing it in a bipartisan way.\n  We produced historic Wall Street reform legislation. When I became \nchairman of the committee, our economy was on the brink of collapse. \nOur legislation targeted the least transparent parts of the financial \nsystem and will bring them not only within the plain view of regulators \nbut also in the view of hardworking Americans who want to know what is \ngoing on in our economy and in the marketplace.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have fought hard on behalf of \nrural communities and families. In the House, sitting next to Ed Markey \non the Energy and Commerce Committee, he always called me Blanche \n``Rural'' Lambert. He said: Blanche, every time your mouth opens, it \nsays rural. I said: That is where I grew up, that is whom I represent, \nand you will always hear me speaking on behalf of the families in rural \nAmerica.\n  I wrote the legislation establishing the Delta Regional Authority, \nthe only Federal agency designed to channel resources, aid, and \ntechnical assistance for economic development in the rural and \nimpoverished Mississippi Delta region.\n  I fought for tax relief for hardworking low- and middle-income \nArkansas families, and I am most proud of the refundable child tax \ncredit I worked on with Senator Olympia Snowe. I have also fought for \nthe certainty for farmers and ranchers and small businesses in Arkansas \nwith fair estate tax reforms with Senator Jon Kyl.\n  I am proud of my work on behalf of Arkansas and our Nation's seniors, \nincluding my work on the prescription drug program for seniors, working \nwith Senator Baucus and others on the Finance Committee; the Elder \nJustice Act that is now law, the first Federal law ever enacted to \naddress elder abuse in a comprehensive manner. I was honored to be \njoined in that effort by Senators Orrin Hatch and Herb Kohl and the \nhard work we put toward that.\n  Growing up in a family of infantrymen, I am proud to have fought for \nArkansas servicemembers, veterans, and their families, specifically \nfighting for funding increases for the VA and the creation of the VA's \nOffice of Rural Health, as well as better access to quality mental \nhealth care for all our veterans.\n  I came to Congress to fight on behalf of our Nation's children, \nfamilies, veterans, small businesses, and farmers, and I am honored and \nhumbled that in each of these areas, I was able to achieve legislative \nsuccess on their behalf.\n  But as my mother would say, straighten up and pay attention to what \nthis is about. This speech is not about yesterday, and it is not about \ntoday. What I would like for people to remember about this speech is \nthat it was about our Nation's future and what we can achieve together. \nWe have great work to do, great work. I may be leaving this body, but \nthat doesn't mean I give up on my country. You all have much work to \ndo.\n  Colleagues, we have approached a fork in the road. This is not the \nfirst, nor do I suspect it will be the last, but we have within \nourselves the ability in this Nation to choose a positive and uplifting \npath. Harry Reid teases me all the time: Do you smile at everything? \nYou know what. There is a lot to smile about. We have great \nopportunities ahead of us in this country, but they are not going to \nhappen by themselves. We have the opportunity to choose a path that \nrespects differences of opinion. We have the opportunity to choose a \npath that sets aside short-term political gains, a path that maintains \nthis body's historic rules that protect the views of the minority but \nalso puts results ahead of obstruction.\n  Again, I grew up in a family of four kids, and I am the youngest. You \nall wonder why I am so tough. I have been beat up on all my life. But \nmy dad always said: It is results that count. It is what you finish and \nwhat you accomplish. It is not these little battles we fight; it is the \nwar we are going to win, and it is not a war we are going to win \nwithout the Republicans or without the administration or without our \nconstituents. It is a war on behalf of our Nation, and it has to be \ndone together.\n  Many of my colleagues have had the wonderful opportunity of meeting \nmy husband. My husband doesn't like crowds a lot. I love crowds because \nI love being together. I love being a part of things. I love being a \npart of a team. My team is here, my Lincoln team. It is a great team. \nThey have been a wonderful group to work with. You are a part of my \nteam. You are my family in the Senate. Being together and working \ntogether is an incredible blessing, and we have to make sure we realize \nthat.\n  Our country is certainly at its best when we are collectively working \ntogether for a goal. All you have to do is listen to your parents or \nyour grandparents talk about victory gardens or rationing nylons or \nanything else that happened during the war when people were working \ncollectively together.\n  Our country is facing many challenges. There is no doubt the American \npeople are frustrated. They are frustrated with our lack of \nproductivity, and they are so anxious to be a part of the solution that \nneeds to happen here--the coming together, the finding of solutions to \nthe problems we face and the results we need to have. I am confident \nthat, together, we can overcome all these differences and continue to \nbe the leader of the rest of the world as we have been and should be. I \nleave this body with confidence that we can provide our citizens with \nthe type of government they deserve: a government that provides results \nand certainty about the future they so longingly want to be a part of \nand that they want to protect for their children, rather than \nobstruction and sound bites and confusion.\n\n  With teenage children at home, it is a true blessing that we live in \na day and in an age where information is available at a moment's \nnotice. I have watched my children--I had to go borrow the encyclopedia \nfrom my cousins next door. My kids click on the computer and \nimmediately there are incredible volumes of information. They teach me: \nMom, come look at this. Did you ever know this? It is amazing what is \navailable to us. It is equally as important, though, that we, the \nAmerican people, take the time that is necessary to understand the \nsolutions to the challenges and not succumb to the convenience of \nmodern technologies to take the place of our own good judgment. We \ncannot do that. The minds of the people of this country, the minds of \nthe body of this institution ensure that we use the good sense God has \ngiven us to know what those right solutions are. To all of America, \nmyself included, we must all discern carefully the information that is \nprovided to us. It is all extremely convenient, but convenience is not \nwhat this is about. It is not about convenience. It is all about doing \nthe right thing. So I call on not only our good judgment but our \ncollective love for this country so we can meet the challenges our \nNation faces. I know I am teaching my children that at home. I am also \nblocking some of the things they can get on the Internet. But I am also \nteaching them to use their own minds, their own thoughts: What is it \nyou would have for your fellow man? How would you want people to \nbehave? It is absolutely critical in this day and age.\n  To my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle, I implore each \nof you to set the example for our country by working together to move \nour Nation forward. We must start practicing greater civility toward \none another, both privately and publicly. I can't forget when I first \ncame to the House of Representatives, I called my colleague and \nneighbor, Bill Emerson from southern Missouri. I told him, I said: \nBill, you know when you move into a new place, where I come from you \nbring somebody a cake or a pie, a batch of rolls or something. I said: \nI am not a bad cook, but I don't have a lot of time on my hands. I want \nto visit with you. You are a Republican, I am a Democrat, but you are \nmy neighbor, and I am willing to bet you we agree on far more than we \ndisagree on. As we visited for 45 minutes in that very first \nintroduction, we came to the conclusion that we agreed far more on the \nsame things than we disagreed. We decided to start the civility caucus. \nIt lasted 3 months.\n  The fact is, there is much work to be done there, and we can do it.\n  Taking advantage of political gusts of wind is not what our \nconstituents\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nexpect of us nor is it what they deserve. I urge you to have the \ncourage to work across party lines. There is simply no other way to \naccomplish our Nation's objectives, nor should there be. Although you \nrun the risk of being the center of attention for both political \nextremes, it is a far greater consequence to put personal or political \nsuccess ahead of our country, and I know firsthand.\n  We must have the courage to come out of our foxholes--the foxholes we \ndig into--to the middle, where the rest of America is and discuss our \ncollective path forward. I am counting on each of you to do so in a way \nthat respects the temporary position we have all been granted here and \nrespect this institution of ours that we have been blessed to inherit. \nIt is an amazing place. Each of you has seen it in your own right and \nyou know it.\n  To the young people of America, I think this is so important. I came \nhere as the youngest woman in the history of our country to ever be \nelected to the Senate. I did so because I believed so strongly in the \ndifference I could make. I still do. That is what this country is \nabout. It is about making a difference, not for yourself but for \nothers. I continue that journey now, as I leave this place, knowing \nthere are still so many ways I will make a difference. But to those \nyoung people out there in this country, do not think this place is \nreserved just for age or experience. It is here that you could make a \ndifference, whether you are elected or whether you are one of the \nincredible and phenomenal staff that helps to run this place, or \nwhether you just simply choose to be out there and engaged in what is \ngoing on. There are many contributions to be made to this Nation by the \nyoung people of this country.\n  I leave this body with no regrets and with many incredible \nfriendships. You know the old adage, ``If you want a friend in \nWashington, get a dog.'' You all know I have a very large dog. But I \nalso have some wonderful friends, and I am very grateful for those \nfriendships.\n  When I first arrived, my friend Mary Landrieu had been in the \nhospital. I showed up at her house with a chicken spaghetti casserole, \na bag of salad, and a bottle of wine.\n  She said: What are you doing here?\n  I said: You know, where I come from, when your neighbor or friend is \nsick, you take them dinner.\n  She said: Blanche, we don't do that up here.\n  I said: Let me tell you, if we forget where we come from, there is a \nbig problem.\n  I am grateful. I will not attempt to go one by one through each of \nyou, but know that every one of you all have a special place in my \nheart. You have taught me something. You have enriched my life in such \na way, it is amazing. You also know--many of you personally--that I \nfollow in some very large footsteps, between so many Arkansans, most \nrecent being McClellan and Fulbright, David Pryor, and Dale Bumpers, \nwho is my immediate predecessor. I thank Dale for the incredible mentor \nhe has been to me and for the wonderful things he has done for our \nState.\n  I leave you with an unbelievable Senator, and that is my good friend \nMark Pryor. He is a statesman. He follows in the footsteps of all of \nthose giants from Arkansas. I am enormously grateful to him for his \nfriendship and, more importantly, for his great service to the people \nof Arkansas. So I leave you in good hands, without a doubt, with my \ngood friend, Senator Mark Pryor.\n  I have been surrounded, both in the past and currently, by an \nunbelievably dedicated, loyal, and hard-working staff, in my personal \nSenate office both in Arkansas and Washington, and certainly in the \nAgriculture Committee. To my staff, they know how much I love them. Our \nState and this institution are better because of their hard work and \ndedication. Without a doubt, they are smart and they are a great group \nof people. I am so blessed to not only know them but to have worked \nwith them.\n  I have always been blessed with a loving and supportive family who \nhave been my inspiration and bedrock all my life, and they continue to \nbe.\n  Finally, let me, once again, say thanks to the people of Arkansas. My \nroots have been and always will be in Arkansas. That will never change. \nWhen Steve and the boys and I left after Thanksgiving to come back for \nthe lameduck session--of course, as you all know, traveling with your \nfamily and just getting back in time--we left at 5 in the morning. We \ndrove to Memphis because it was faster. We were halfway between. We had \nbeen at the cabin duck hunting and celebrating Thanksgiving with \nfamily. We were headed to the Memphis Airport, and the Sun was rising \nover the Arkansas delta.\n  Now, I am sure many of you all have never seen that, but it is a \nmagnificent view. It reminded me of all of the great things I came here \nto do. It made me feel blessed with all of the things I was able to \naccomplish. But to know that I could go back to that same home and see \nthat sunrise, it is unbelievable.\n  I will always treasure the experiences of this chapter in my life and \nthe thousands of Arkansans I have come to know and love. They are a \ngreat group of people. I thank you again from the bottom of my heart.\n  To the people of Arkansas and this body, my good friends, I yield the \nfloor.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me mention a very abbreviated list of \nBlanche Lincoln's accomplishments: First woman to chair the Senate \nAgriculture Committee; first woman to chair the Finance Subcommittee on \nSocial Security Pensions and Family Policy--in fact, the first woman to \never chair a Finance subcommittee--chair of the rural outreach for the \nSenate Democratic caucus; chair of the Senate hunger caucus; cofounder \nand cochair of the Third Way; creator of the Delta Regional Authority; \nauthor of the 2010 child nutrition bill; a key writer of the 2008 farm \nbill; author of the refundable child tax credit.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on, but most of her accomplishments \nand contributions cannot be measured. As she worked on the Agriculture \nCommittee, the Finance Committee, the Aging Committee, and the Energy \nCommittee, on a countless number of occasions, on amendments and bills, \nshe became the Senator who was the key to passage or defeat. A couple \nof years ago, I watched a bill that was making its way through the \nSenate Finance Committee, and there were a lot of people outside of \nthis Chamber who had a vital interest in the outcome of that \nlegislation. Everywhere I would go I would be stopped and asked: Is \nthis bill going to pass? Will it come out of the committee? Will it get \nthrough the floor?\n  What I told the folks who asked that back then turned out to be true: \nAs Blanche goes, so goes the Finance Committee, because she was that \nway on all of her committees. She was the swing vote, the key vote to \ngetting things done in the Senate.\n  Blanche is a role model for many people, especially young women who \nare interested in government.\n  I remember sitting down with one of my good friends earlier this year \nand his teenage daughter. We talked about the Senate and politics, \nhistory, and Arkansas. As we were winding up the conversation, my \nfriend asked his teenage daughter: Who is your favorite politician? Of \ncourse, I sat there and straightened my tie because I thought I knew \nwhat the answer would be.\n  Then she said: Blanche Lincoln. And I know why. It is because Blanche \nrepresents the best in Arkansas. She represents the best in Arkansas in \npolitics and in government. She is a workhorse, not a showhorse.\n  Blanche gets things done. The other night, with my teenage daughter, \nI watched some of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' As I was watching it, I was \nstruck that the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion were looking for \nthree things that Blanche has, and what every Senator needs in large \nquantities: a brain, a heart, and courage.\n  One of Senator Lincoln's role models she refers to often is Hattie \nCaraway. Hattie Caraway is not exactly a household name in American \npolitics, but her portrait hangs just outside this Chamber, in the \ncorner, opposite the Ohio Clock. Hattie Caraway of Arkansas was the \nfirst woman ever elected to the Senate. There is much to admire about \nHattie Caraway as a Senator and as a person, but the one thing that \nBlanche inherited from Hattie is the pioneer spirit.\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n  Even in the first decade of the 21st century, Blanche is the owner of \nmany ``firsts.'' Even though we don't like to admit it, and we are \nreluctant to talk about it, there is a double standard in politics for \nwomen. There just is. I am proud to serve with the largest number of \nwomen this Senate has ever seen, and that goes double for my 8 years \nwith Senator Blanche Lincoln.\n\n  Let me say a brief word about her family. Her husband Steve is an old \nfriend of mine. We trace our roots back to Little Rock Central High \nSchool and the University of Arkansas. The Lord has blessed Blanche and \nSteve with two bright, energetic, athletic, and even sometimes well-\nbehaved sons--and they are great--who are currently freshmen at \nYorktown High School in Arlington. They bring their parents much joy. \nThey are also extremely proud of their mother. I have seen firsthand \nwhat a wonderful mother she has been and is. I stand in awe.\n  In fact, Blanche is not only a good Senator and a good mother and a \ngood wife--she is much more. She is a good daughter to her mother, who \nbasically runs Phillips County, AK. She is a good sister in her very \nlarge family. She is a good member of her community, helping friends, \nneighbors, and those in need. Blanche is very faithful in her \nrelationship with God, which has given her strength and kept her \ngrounded in good times and in bad. She follows the Golden Rule and puts \nher faith into action every single day. Simply put, she is a good \nperson.\n  Lastly, Blanche is a good boss. She has drawn to her a very talented \nand hard-working staff in Washington, DC, and in Arkansas. I know they \nwill always be proud to tell people they worked for Senator Blanche \nLincoln.\n  Before I get carried away, there is one minor matter that I believe I \nneed to address. On occasion--rarely, but every so often--Blanche runs \na little late. I know many of you are shocked to hear this. Let me tell \nyou why that is. It is because people love Blanche and Blanche loves \npeople, and she is never too busy to stop, to notice, and to \nlisten. She is never too busy to talk to the Capitol Police or to the \njanitor here or to that family from Idaho who can't figure out the \nDirksen building. She takes time for people. And that is one of her \nattributes that makes her so special, because those people are as \nimportant to her as the most powerful Members of the Congress. That is \nwhat makes Blanche special.\n\n  It is hard to find just one word to describe Senator Lincoln--kind, \nsmart, fearless, persistent, knowledgeable, no nonsense, and I could go \non. But the one word I would like to focus on today is friend. There \nare 99 Senators today who consider her a friend. They like her, they \nlike working with her, and they respect her. I have had many \nRepublicans and Democrats say how much they hate to see her leave \nbecause she makes this place better.\n  There is a passage in the Bible that says: ``Well done, thou good and \nfaithful servant.'' This applies to Blanche, but not only to the job \nthat she has done here in Senate. It applies to her as a person. There \nis a lot more to Blanche than just being a Senator. In January, she \nstarts a new chapter. And as much as she will be missed around here, we \nall have confidence there are many more great things to come.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10265-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the new START \ntreaty. We undertake this debate at a time when almost 100,000 American \nmilitary personnel are fighting a difficult war in Afghanistan. More \nthan 1,300 of our troops have been killed in Afghanistan, with almost \n10,000 wounded.\n  Meanwhile, we are in our seventh year in Iraq--a deployment that has \ncost more than 4,400 American lives and wounded roughly 32,000 persons. \nWe still have more than 47,000 troops deployed in that country. \nTensions on the Korean peninsula are extremely high, with no resolution \nto the problems in North Korea's nuclear program. We continue to pursue \ninternational support for steps that could prevent Iran's nuclear \nprogram from producing a nuclear weapon. We remain concerned about \nstability in Pakistan and the security of that country's nuclear \narsenal. We are attempting to counter terrorist threats emanating from \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, east Africa, Yemen, and many other locations. We \nare concerned about terrorist cells in allied countries, and even in \nthe United States. We remain highly vulnerable to disruptions in oil \nsupplies due to national disasters, terrorist attacks, political \ninstability, or manipulation of the markets by unfriendly oil-producing \nnations.\n  Even as we attempt to respond to these and other national security \nimperatives, we are facing severe resource constraints. Since September \n11, 2001, we have spent almost $1.1 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWe are spending roughly twice as many dollars on defense today as we \nwere before 9/11. These heavy defense burdens have occurred in the \ncontext of a financial and budgetary crisis that has raised the U.S. \nGovernment's total debt to almost $14 trillion. The fiscal year 2010 \nbudget deficit registered about $1.3 trillion, or 9 percent of GDP.\n  All Senators here are familiar with the challenges I have just \nenumerated. But as we begin this debate, we should keep this larger \nnational security context firmly in mind. As we contend with the \nenormous security challenges of the 21st century, the last thing we \nneed to is to reject a process that has mitigated the threat posed by \nRussia's nuclear arsenal.\n  For 15 years, the START treaty has helped us to keep a lid on the \nU.S.-Russian nuclear rivalry. It established a working relationship on \nnuclear arms with a country that was our mortal enemy for 4\\1/2\\ \ndecades. START's transparency features assured both countries about the \nnuclear capabilities of the other. For us, that meant having American \nexperts on the ground in Russia conducting inspections of nuclear \nweaponry.\n  Because START expired on December 5, 2009, we have had no American \ninspectors in Russia for more than a year. New START will enable \nAmerican teams to return to Russia to collect data on the Russian \narsenal and verify Russian compliance. These inspections greatly reduce \nthe possibility that we will be surprised by Russian nuclear \ndeployments or advancements.\n  Before we even get to the text of the new START treaty and the \nresolution of ratification, Members should recognize what a Senate \nrejection of new START would mean for our broader national security. \nFailure of the Senate to approve the treaty would result in an \nexpansion of arms competition with Russia. It would guarantee a \nreduction in transparency and confidence-building procedures, and it \nwould diminish between cooperation and Russian defense establishments. \nIt would complicate our military planning.\n  A rejection of new START would be greeted with delight in Iran, North \nKorea, Syria, and Burma. These nations want to shield their weapons \nprograms from outside scrutiny and they want to be able to acquire \nsensitive weapons technologies. They want to block international \nefforts to make them comply with their legal obligations. Rogue nations \nfear any nuclear cooperation between the United States and Russia \nbecause they know it limits their options. They want to call into \nquestion our own nonproliferation credentials and they want Russia to \nresist tough economic measures against them.\n  If we reject this treaty, it will be harder to get Russia's \ncooperation in stopping nuclear proliferation. It could create \nobstacles on some issues in the United Nations Security Council, where \nRussia has a veto. It might also reduce incentives for Russia to \ncooperate in providing supply routes for our troops in Afghanistan. It \nwould give more weight to the arguments of Russian nationalists who \nseek to undermine cooperation with the United States and its allies. It \nwould require additional satellite coverage of Russia at the expense of \ntheir use against terrorists.\n  With all that we need to achieve, why would we add to our problems by \nseparating ourselves from Russia over a\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\ntreaty that our own military wants ratified? Our military commanders \nare anxious to avoid the added burden and uncertainties of an \nintensified arms competition with Russia. They know such competition \nwould detract from other national security priorities and missions. \nThat is one reason they are telling us unequivocally to ratify this \nagreement. They also have asserted that the modest reductions in \nwarheads and delivery systems embodied in the treaty in no way threaten \nour nuclear deterrent.\n  Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff ADM Mike Mullen have testified that they have no doubts the new \nSTART treaty should be ratified. GEN Kevin Chilton, who is in charge of \nour strategic nuclear forces, has said the treaty `` will enhance the \nsecurity of the United States.'' GEN Patrick O'Reilly, who is in charge \nof our missile defenses, endorsed the treaty saying flatly that it'' \ndoes not constrain our plans to execute the United States missile \ndefense program.''\n  Moreover, seven former commanders of Strategic Command--the military \ncommand in charge of our strategic nuclear weapons--have backed the new \nSTART treaty. Members of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nhave taken pride in supporting the military and respecting military \nviews about steps necessary to protect our Nation.\n  Rejecting an unequivocal military opinion on a treaty involving \nnuclear deterrence would be an extraordinary position for the Senate to \ntake. The military is supported in this view by the top national \nsecurity officials from past administrations. To date, every Secretary \nof State and Secretary of Defense who has expressed a public opinion \nabout the new START treaty has counseled in favor of ratification. This \nhas included 10 Republicans and 5 Democrats. All five living Americans \nwho served Ronald Reagan as Defense Secretary, Secretary of State, or \nWhite House Chief of Staff have endorsed the new START treaty. The list \nof endorsers includes: President George H. W. Bush, George Shultz, Jim \nBaker, Jim Schlessinger, Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, Colin \nPowell, Condoleezza Rice, Steven Hadley, Howard Baker, Lawrence \nEagleburger, and Frank Carlucci. Many of these officials served at a \ntime when the stakes related to Russian nuclear arms were even higher \nthan they are today.\n  During the Cold War uncertainty over Russia's intentions and weapons \nadvances--and this cost us tens if not hundreds of billions of \ndollars--an academic industry developed that was devoted to parsing \nSoviet military capabilities. This was one of the biggest, if not the \nbiggest, expenses of our intelligence budget each year. The fact that \nwe could not accurately judge Soviet military capabilities led us to \nelevate our spending on weaponry out of a sense of caution. These times \nwere dominated by contradictory risk assessments and rumors about \ndangerous new Soviet weapon systems. We were constantly worried about \nmissile gaps, destabilizing arms deployments, or Soviet technology \nbreakthroughs. And all of this came at a tremendous cost to the \nAmerican taxpayer and the psyche of a nation which lived under the \nthreat of mutual assured destruction.\n  I firmly believe our staunch opposition to an aggressive Soviet state \nwas absolutely necessary and led directly to the achievement of freedom \nfor tens of millions of people in Eastern Europe. It also set the stage \nfor dramatic breakthroughs in international cooperation. But that does \nnot mean the Cold War was a benign experience or that we want to revive \nnuclear competition, carried out in an environment without verification \nor basic limits on weapons.\n  I am not suggesting that we are on the brink of returning to the Cold \nWar. Reality is far more complicated than that. But we should not be \ncavalier about allowing our relationship with Moscow to drift or about \nletting our knowledge of Russian weaponry atrophy. Few Americans today \ngive much thought to the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. \nAmericans have not had to be concerned in the same way as they were \nduring the Cold War years. But large elements of that arsenal still \nexist and still threaten the United States. Whether through accident, \nmiscalculation, proliferation, or any number of other scenarios, \nRussian nuclear weapons, materiels, and technology still have the \ncapability to obliterate American cities. That is a core national \nsecurity problem that commands the attention of our government and this \nbody.\n  I relate these thoughts about where we have been in part because most \nSenators entered national public service after the Cold War ended, and \neven fewer were serving in this body when we were called upon to make \ndecisions on arms treaties.\n  Only 21 current Members were here in 1988 to debate the INF Treaty. \nOnly 15 current Members were serving in the Senate during the Geneva \nSummit between President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. \nOnly 11 Members were here in March 1983 when President Reagan delivered \nhis so-called ``evil empire'' speech. And only 7 of us were here when \nthe Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. In a few weeks, these numbers \nwill decline even further.\n  The fundamental question remains as to how we manage our relationship \nwith a former enemy and current rival that still possesses enormous \ncapacity for nuclear destruction. What the START process has done, \nsince it was initiated by President Reagan, is manage an adversarial \nrelationship that previously had been cloaked in volatile uncertainty \nand accompanied by enormous financial costs to our own society.\n  One can take the view, I suppose, that unrestrained competition with \nRussia is the best way to ensure our security in relation to that \ncountry. But that has not been the view of the American people and \nthere is no indication that this is what Americans were voting for in \nNovember.\n  It certainly was not Ronald Reagan's view. It was President Reagan \nwho began the START process. His team coined the term ``START,'' \nstanding for ``Strategic Arms Reduction Talks,'' to reflect President \nReagan's intent to shift the goal of nuclear arms control from limiting \nweapons build-ups to making substantial, verifiable cuts in existing \narsenals. On May 8, 1982, President Reagan made the first START \nproposal during a speech at Eureka College in Illinois, calling for a \none-third reduction in nuclear warheads. For the rest of his \nPresidency, he engaged the Russians on numerous arms control proposals \nthat reduced weaponry an established tough verification measures to \nprevent cheating. He personally conducted five summits with Russian \nleaders, which primarily focused on arms control. He produced the INF \ntreaty, signed in 1988, which greatly reduced nuclear weapons in \nEurope. His efforts also led to the original START Treaty which was \nsigned during the first President Bush's term in 1991.\n  The cornerstone of President Reagan's arms control agenda was \nverification. His interest in verification is frequently summed up by \nhis oft-quoted line ``trust but verify.'' But what the United States \nand Russia have done through the START process is far more than just \nverification. START has provided the structure and transparency upon \nwhich unprecedented arms control and nonproliferation initiatives have \nbeen built, most notably, the Nunn-Lugar program. The stability that \ncame with a long-term agreement and the commitment implicit in a treaty \napproved by both the Russians an American legislatures, has been \nindispensable to the success of Nunn-Lugar and other nonproliferation \nendeavors with Russia.\n  Over the course of almost two decades, the Nunn-Lugar program has \njoined Americans and Russians in a sustained effort to safeguard and \nultimately destroy weapons and materials of mass destruction in the \nformer Soviet Union and beyond. The destruction of thousands of weapons \nis a monumental achievement for our countries, but the process \nsurrounding this joint effort is as important as the numbers of weapons \neliminated. The U.S.-Russian relationship has been through numerous \nhighs and lows in the post-Cold War era. Throughout this period, START \ninspections and consultations and the corresponding threat reduction' \nactivities of the Nunn-Lugar program have been a constant that has \nreduced miscalculation and has built respect. This has not prevented \nhighly contentious disagreements with Moscow, but it has meant that we \nhave not\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\nhad to wonder about the make-up and disposition of Russian nuclear \nforces during periods of tension. It also has reduced, though not \neliminated, the proliferation threat posed by the nuclear arsenal of \nthe former Soviet Union,\n  This process must continue if we are to answer the existential threat \nposed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Every \nmissile destroyed, every warhead deactivated, and every inspection \nimplemented makes us safer. Russia and the United States have the \nchoice whether or not to continue this effort, and that choice is \nembodied in the New START Treaty before us.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees held 18 \nhearings on the treaty with national security leaders who have served \nin the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George \nW. Bush, and Obama administrations. These hearings were supplemented by \ndozens of staff and Member briefings, as well as nearly 1,000 questions \nfor the record.\n  We know, however, that bilateral treaties are not neat instruments, \nbecause they involve merging the will of two nations with distinct and \noften conflicting interests. Treaties come with inherent imperfections \nand questions. As Secretary Gates testified in May, even successful \nagreements routinely are accompanied by differences of opinion by the \nparties.\n  The ratification process, therefore, is intended to produce a \nResolution of Ratification for consideration by the whole Senate. The \nresolution should clarify the meaning and effect of treaty provisions \nfor the United States and resolve areas of concern or ambiguity.\n  On September 16, 2010, the Foreign Relations Committee approved a \nResolution of Ratification for the New START treaty by a vote of 14-4 \nwith important contributions from both Democratic and Republican \nmembers. This resolution incorporates the concerns and criticisms \nexpressed over the last several months by committee witnesses, members \nof the committee, and other Senators. It will be further strengthened \nthrough our debate in the coming days.\n  With this in mind, I would turn to specific concerns addressed in the \nResolution of Ratification.\n  First of all, missile defense.\n  Some critics of the New START treaty have argued that it impedes U.S. \nmissile defense plans. But nothing in the treaty changes the bottom \nline that we control our own missile destiny, not Russia. Defense \nSecretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and GEN Patrick O'Reilly, who is in \ncharge of our missile defense programs, have all testified that the \ntreaty does nothing to impede our missile defense plans. The Resolution \nof Ratification has explicitly reemphasized this in multiple ways.\n\n  Some commentators have expressed concern that the treaty's preamble \nnotes the interrelationship between strategic offense and strategic \ndefense. But preamble language does not permit rights nor impose \nobligations, and it cannot be used to create au obligation under the \ntreaty. The text in question is stating a truism of strategic planning \nthat an interrelationship exists between strategic offense and \nstrategic defense.\n  Critics have also worried that the treaty's prohibition on converting \nICBM and SLBM launchers to defensive missile silos reduces our missile \ndefense options. But General O'Reilly has stated flatly that it would \nnot be in our own interest to pursue such conversions because \nconverting a silo costs an estimated $19 million more than building a \nmodern, tailor-made missile defense interceptor silo. The Bush \nadministration converted five ICBM test silos at Vandenberg Air Force \nBase for missile defense interceptors, and these have been \ngrandfathered under the New START treaty. Beyond this, every single \nprogram advocated during the Bush and Obama administrations has \ninvolved construction of new silos dedicated to defense on land--\nexactly what the New START treaty permits. General O'Reilly said a U.S. \nembrace of silo conversions would be ``a major setback'' for our \nmissile defense program.\n  Addressing whether there would be utility in converting any existing \nSLBM launch-tubes to a launcher of defensive missiles, GEN Kevin P. \nChilton, Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, stated ``[T]he missile \ntubes that we have are valuable, in the sense that they provide the \nstrategic deterrent. I would not want to trade [an SLBM] and how \npowerful it is and its ability to deter, for a single missile defense \ninterceptor.'' Essentially, our military commanders are saying that \nconverting silos to missile defense purposes would never make sense for \nour efforts to build the best missile defense possible.\n  A third argument concerning missile defense centers on Russia's \nunilateral statement upon signature of New START, which expressed its \nright to withdraw from the treaty if there is an expansion of U.S. \nmissile defense programs. Unilateral statements are routine to arms \ncontrol treaties and do not alter the legal rights and obligations of \nthe parties to the treaty. Indeed, Moscow issued a similar statement \nconcerning the START I treaty, implying that its obligations were \nconditioned upon U.S. compliance with the ABM Treaty. Yet, Russia did \nnot in fact withdraw from START I when the United States withdrew from \nthe ABM Treaty in 2001. Nor did it withdraw when we subsequently \ndeployed missile defense interceptors in California and Alaska. Nor did \nit withdraw when we announced plans for missile defenses in Poland and \nthe Czech Republic.\n  Russia's unilateral statement does nothing to contribute to its right \nto withdraw from the treaty. That right, which we also possess, is \nstandard in all recent arms control treaties and most treaties \nconsidered throughout U.S. history.\n  The Resolution of Ratification approved by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee reaffirms that the New START treaty will in no way inhibit \nour missile defenses. It contains an understanding that the New START \ntreaty imposes no limitations on the deployment of U.S. missile \ndefenses other than the requirement to refrain from converting \noffensive missile launchers. It also states that Russia's April 2010 \nunilateral statement on missile defense does not impose any legal \nobligations on the United States and that any further limitations would \nrequire treaty amendment subject to the Senate's advice and consent. \nConsistent with the Missile Defense Act of 1999, it also declares that \nit is U.S. policy to deploy an effective national missile defense \nsystem as soon as technologically possible and that it is the paramount \nobligation of the United States to defend its people, armed forces, and \nallies against nuclear attack to the best of its ability.\n\n  In a revealing moment during Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhearings on the Treaty, Secretary Gates testified:\n\n       The Russians have hated missile defense ever since the \n     strategic arms talks began, in 1969 . . . because we can \n     afford it and they can't. And we're going to be able to build \n     a good one . . . and they probably aren't. And they don't \n     want to devote the resources to it, so they try and stop us \n     from doing it. . . This treaty doesn't accomplish that for \n     them. There are no limits on us.\n\n  I would paraphrase the Secretary's blunt comments by saying simply, \nthat our negotiators won on missile defense. If, indeed, a Russian \nobjective in this treaty was to limit U.S. missile defense, they \nfailed, as the Defense Secretary asserts. Does anyone really believe \nthat Russian negotiating ambitions were fulfilled by nonbinding \nlanguage in the Preamble? Or by a unilateral Russian statement with no \nlegal force? Or by a prohibition on converting silos, which costs more \nthan building new ones? These are toothless, figleaf provisions that do \nnothing to constrain us.\n  Moreover, as outlined, our resolution of ratification states \nexplicitly in multiple ways that we have no intention of being \nconstrained. Our government is investing heavily in missile defense. \nStrong bipartisan majorities in Congress favor pursuing current missile \ndefense plans.\n  What the Russians are left with on missile defense is unrealized \nambitions. At the end of any treaty negotiation between any two \ncountries, there are always unrealized ambitions left on the table by \nboth sides.\n  This has been true throughout diplomatic history.\n  The Russians might want all sorts of things from us, but that does \nnot mean they are going to get them. If we constrain ourselves from \nsigning a treaty that is in our own interest on the basis\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\nof unrealized Russian ambitions, we are showing no confidence in the \nability of our own democracy to make critical decisions. We would be \nsaying that we have to live with the end of START inspections and other \nnegative consequences of rejecting this treaty to prevent a U.S. \nGovernment in the future from bowing to Russian pressure on missile \ndefense. If one buys into this logic, it becomes almost impossible to \nseek cooperation with Russia on anything.\n  Let us be absolutely clear, the President of the United States, the \nU.S. Congress, and the executive branch agencies on behalf of the \nAmerican people control our own destiny on missile defense. The \nRussians can continue to argue all they want on the issue, but there is \nnothing in the treaty that says we have to pay any attention to them.\n  The New START treaty's verification regime has also been the subject \nof considerable debate. The important point is that, today, we have \nzero on-the-ground verification capability given that START I expired \non December 5, 2009, more than 1 year ago. Under START, the United \nStates conducted inspections of weapons, their facilities, their \ndelivery vehicles and warheads, in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and \nBelarus. These inspections fulfilled a crucial national security \ninterest by greatly reducing the possibility that we would be surprised \nby future advancements in Russian weapons technology or deployment. \nOnly through ratification of New START will U.S. technicians return to \nRussia to resume verification.\n  Under New START, the United States and Russia each will deploy no \nmore than 1,550 warheads for strategic deterrence. Seven years from its \nentry into force, the Russian Federation is likely to have only about \n350 deployed missiles. This smaller number of strategic nuclear systems \nwill be deployed at fewer bases. It is likely that Russia will close \ndown even more bases over the life of the treaty.\n  Both sides agreed at the outset that each would be free to structure \nits forces as it sees fit, a view consistent with that of the Bush \nadministration. As a practical economic matter, conditions in Russia \npreclude a massive restructuring of its strategic forces.\n  The treaty, protocol and annexes contain a detailed set of rules and \nprocedures for verification of the New START treaty, many of them drawn \nfrom START I. The inspection regime contained in New START is designed \nto provide each party confidence that the other is upholding its \nobligations, while also being simpler and safer for the inspectors to \nimplement, less operationally disruptive for our strategic forces, and \nless costly than START's regime.\n  Secretary Gates recently wrote to Congress that ``The Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Chiefs, the Commander, U.S. Strategic \nCommand, and I assess that Russia will not be able to achieve \nmilitarily significant cheating or breakout under New START, due to \nboth the New START verification regime and the inherent survivability \nand flexibility of the planned U.S. strategic force structure.'' We \nshould not expect that New START will eliminate friction, but the \ntreaty will provide for a means to deal with such differences \nconstructively, as under START I.\n  The Resolution of Ratification approved by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee requires further assurances by conditioning ratification on \nPresidential certification, prior to the treaty's entry into force, of \nour ability to monitor Russian compliance and on immediate \nconsultations should a Russian breakout from the treaty be detected. \nFor the first time in any strategic arms control treaty, a condition \nrequires a plan for New START monitoring.\n  Some have asserted that there are too few inspections in New START. \nThe treaty does provide for fewer inspections compared to START I. But \nthis is because fewer facilities will require inspection under New \nSTART. START I covered 70 facilities in four Soviet successor states, \nwhereas New START only applies to Russia and its 35 remaining \nfacilities. Therefore we need fewer inspections to achieve a comparable \nlevel of oversight. New START also maintains the same number of ``re-\nentry vehicle on-site inspections'' as START I, 10 per year. Baseline \ninspections that were phased out in New START are no longer needed \nbecause we have 15 years of START I Treaty implementation and data on \nwhich to rely. Of course, if New START is not ratified for a lengthy \nperiod, the efficacy of our baseline data would eventually deteriorate.\n  New START includes the innovation that unique identifiers or ``UIDs'' \nbe affixed to all Russian missiles and nuclear-capable heavy bombers. \nUIDs were applied only to Russian road-mobile missiles in START I. \nRegular exchanges of UID data will provide confidence and transparency \nregarding the existence and location of 700 deployed missiles, even \nwhen they are on non-deployed status, something that START I did not \ndo.\n  The New START treaty also codifies and continues important \nverification enhancements related to warhead loading on Russian ICBMs \nand SLBMs. These enhancements, originally agreed to during START I \nimplementation, allow for greater transparency in confirming the number \nof warheads on each missile.\n  Under START I and the INF Treaty, the United States maintained a \ncontinuous, on-site presence of up to 30 technicians at Votkinsk, \nRussia to conduct monitoring of final assembly of Russian strategic \nsystems using solid rocket motors. While this portal monitoring is not \ncontinued under New START, the decision to phase out this arrangement \nwas made by the Bush administration in anticipation of START I's \nexpiration. With vastly lower rates of Russian missile production, \ncontinuous monitoring is not crucial, as it was during the Cold War.\n  For the United States, the New START treaty will allow for flexible \nmodernization and operation of U.S. strategic forces, while \nfacilitating transparency regarding the development and deployment of \nRussian strategic forces.\n  With regard to warhead counting, New START improves on the rules used \nin both START I and the Moscow Treaty. Under START I, each deployed \nmissile or bomber was attributed a maximum number of weapons, for which \nit always counted. Each launcher of a missile or weapon also counted \nregardless of whether it still performed nuclear missions or contained \nmissiles. This resulted in inaccurate counts of warheads, missiles, and \nlaunchers. Under the Moscow Treaty, there was never agreement on what \nconstituted an operationally deployed strategic nuclear warhead. \nConsequently, the parties used their own methodology for counting which \nwarheads fell under the Treaty's limits. Under New START, one common \nset of counting rules will be used by both parties regarding deployed \nand non-deployed IBCMs, SLBMs and bombers, and deployed warheads on \nmissiles and bomber weapons, so that the data exchanged under this \ntreaty will more accurately reflect modern deployment of the parties' \nstrategic forces.\n  New START's bomber counting rules are also different from START I. \nUnder New START, each heavy bomber is attributed one nuclear weapon, \ndespite the aircraft's ability to carry more, which reflects the modern \nfact that neither party maintains bombers loaded with nuclear weapons \non a continual basis.\n  This rule is not an invention of New START. It is consistent with \nPresident Reagan's negotiating position. He proposed that bombers not \nbe counted at all because they are not first-strike weapons and, thus, \nnot destabilizing. It was a concession to Moscow to include heavy \nbombers as strategic offensive arms in START I, but President Reagan \nnever agreed to count their maximum capacity, as the Soviets sought. \nThose who have inexplicably criticized New START's bomber counting \nrules are advocating the historic position of the Soviet Union, not our \nown.\n  The Department of Defense plans to maintain up to 60 nuclear-capable \nbombers under the New START treaty, including a large number of B-52s, \neach capable of carrying up to 20 ALCMs. Maintaining this standoff \ndelivery capability will enable the United States to field a \nsubstantial number of penetrating weapons in the bomber leg of our \ntriad. Flexible counting of one weapon per each B-52 gives us immediate \nand powerful deployment flexibility, something President Reagan \nprotected, as does New START.\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\n  Some opponents of New START also contend that the treaty should not \nbe ratified because tactical nuclear weapons are not covered. But \nrejection of this treaty would make future limitations on Russian \ntactical nuclear arms far less likely.\n  Some critics have overvalued the utility of Russia's tactical nuclear \nweapons and undervalued our deterrent to them. Only a fraction of these \nweapons could be delivered significantly beyond Russia's borders. \nPursuant to the INF Treaty, the United States and Soviet Union long ago \ndestroyed intermediate range and shorter range nuclear-armed ballistic \nmissiles and ground-launched cruise missiles, which have a range \nbetween 500 and 5,500 kilometers. In fact, most of Russia's tactical \nnuclear weapons have very short ranges, are used for homeland air \ndefense, are devoted to the Chinese border, or are in storage. A \nRussian nuclear attack on NATO countries is effectively deterred by \nNATO conventional superiority, our own tactical nuclear forces, French \nand British nuclear arsenals, and U.S. strategic forces. In short, \nRussian tactical nuclear weapons do not threaten our strategic \ndeterrent. Our NATO allies that flank Russia in Eastern and Northern \nEurope understand this and have strongly endorsed the New START treaty.\n\n  It is important to recognize that the size differential between \nRussian and American tactical nuclear arsenals did not come to pass \nbecause of American inattention to this point. During the first Bush \nadministration, our national command authority, with full participation \nby the military, deliberately made a decision to reduce the number of \ntactical nuclear weapons we deployed. They did this irrespective of \nRussian actions, because the threat of massive ground invasion in \nEurope had largely evaporated due to the breakup of the former Soviet \nUnion. In addition, our conventional capabilities had improved to the \nextent that battlefield nuclear weapons were no longer needed to defend \nWestern Europe. In this atmosphere, maintaining large arsenals of \nnuclear artillery shells, landmines, and short range missile warheads \nwas a bad bargain for us in terms of cost, safety, alliance cohesion, \nand proliferation risks.\n  In my judgment Russia should make a similar decision. The risks to \nRussia of maintaining their tactical nuclear arsenal in its current \nform are greater than the potential security benefits that those \nweapons might provide. They have not done this, in part because of \ntheir threat perceptions about their borders, particularly their border \nwith China.\n  An agreement with Russia that reduced, accounted for, and improved \nsecurity around tactical nuclear arsenals is in the interest of both \nnations. Rejection of New START makes it unlikely that a subsequent \nagreement concerning tactical nuclear weapons will ever be reached. The \nResolution of Ratification encourages the President to engage the \nRussian Federation on establishing measures to improve mutual \nconfidence regarding the accounting and security of Russian \nnonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n  Finally, I would like to turn to the nuclear modernization issue.\n  The New START treaty will not directly affect the modernization or \nthe missions of our nuclear weapons laboratories. The treaty explicitly \nstates that ``modernization and replacement of strategic offensive arms \nmay be carried out.'' Yet Senate consideration of New START has \nintensified a debate on modernization and the stockpile stewardship \nprograms.\n  Near the end of the Bush administration, a consensus developed that \nour nuclear weapons complex was at risk due to years of underfunding. \nIn 2010, the Senate approved an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill requiring a report to Congress, known as the 1251 report, for a \nplan to modernize our nuclear weapons stockpile. The 1251 report \nsubmitted by the administration committed to an investment of \napproximately $80 billion over a 10-year period to sustain and \nmodernize the United States nuclear weapons complex, which according to \nSecretary Gates, was a ``credible'' program for stockpile \nmodernization. Pursuant to this report, the administration submitted a \nfiscal year 2011 request for $7 billion, a nearly 10 percent increase \nover fiscal year 2010 levels. The 1251 plan was recently augmented by \nan additional $5 billion in funding. The directors of our National \nLaboratories wrote on December 1 that they were ``very pleased'' with \nthe updated plan, which provides ``adequate support to sustain the \nsafety, security, reliability, and effectiveness of America's nuclear \ndeterrent'' under New START's central limits.\n  The resolution of ratification passed by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee declares a commitment to ensure the safety, reliability, and \nperformance of our nuclear forces through a robust stockpile \nstewardship program. The resolution includes a requirement for the \nPresident to submit to Congress a plan for overcoming any future \nresource shortfall associated with his 10-year 1251 modernization plan. \nThe resolution also declares a commitment to modernizing and replacing \nnuclear weapons delivery vehicles.\n  In closing, it is imperative that we vote to provide our advice and \nconsent to the New START treaty.\n  Most of the basic strategic concerns that motivated Republican and \nDemocratic administrations to pursue nuclear arms control with Moscow \nduring the last several decades still exist today. We are seeking \nmutual reductions in nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles that \ncontribute to stability and reduce the costs of maintaining the \nweapons. We are pursuing transparency of our nuclear arsenals, backed \nup by strong verification measures and formal consultation methods. We \nare attempting to maximize the safety of our nuclear arsenals and \nencourage global cooperation toward nonproliferation goals. And we are \nhoping to solidify U.S.-Russian cooperation on nuclear security \nmatters, while sustaining our knowledge of Russian nuclear capabilities \nand intentions.\n  Rejecting New START would permanently inhibit our understanding of \nRussian nuclear forces, weaken our nonproliferation diplomacy \nworldwide, and potentially reignite expensive arms competition that \nwould further strain our national budget.\n  Bipartisan support for arms control treaties has been reflected in \noverwhelming votes in favor of the INF Treaty, START I, START II, and \nthe Moscow Treaty. I believe the merits of New START should command \nsimilar bipartisan support.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, be recognized at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask to rescind that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. And that at such time that the other side has had an \nopportunity to speak, Senator Feinstein be recognized for 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10269-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10269-S10273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW START TREATY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate takes up an \nissue that is critical to our Nation's security, and we have an \nopportunity, in doing so, to reduce the danger from nuclear weapons in \nvery real and very measurable terms. We have an opportunity to fulfill \nour constitutional obligation that requires the Senate to provide a \ntwo-thirds vote of the Members present who must vote in favor of a \ntreaty.\n  The Constitution, by doing that, insists on bipartisanship. It \ninsists on a breadth of support that is critical to our foreign policy \nand to the security\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\ndefinitions of our country. That obviously requires that we put \npolitics aside and act in the best interests of our country.\n  I am confident that in the next days the Senate will embrace this \ndebate in the substantive way it deserves to be embraced, and we look \nforward to welcoming constructive amendments from our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. We will, obviously, give them time to be able \nto make those suggestions, and we certainly look forward to having an \nimportant discussion about the security of our Nation.\n  We have been working together for a lot of months now to get us to \nthis point in time, and I think it is indisputable that we have worked \nin good faith on our side of the aisle to try to provide enormous \nlatitude to colleagues who have had questions about this treaty, some \nof whom have opposed this or other treaties from the beginning but who \nwanted to engage in the process.\n  I think the administration, to their credit--Secretary Gottemoeller \nand others who have negotiated the treaty--has been available \nthroughout the process. There have been an enormous number of briefings \nand discussions, dialogs, phone calls. There has been a very open \neffort, as open, incidentally, as any I can remember in 25 years in the \nSenate--and I have been through this treaty process with President \nReagan, President Bush, President Clinton, and others--and I think this \nhas been as open and as accessible and as in-depth and, frankly, as \naccommodating as any of those, if not significantly more.\n  I wish to begin by thanking my colleague in this effort, my friend \nand a longtime knowledgeable advocate on behalf of nuclear common \nsense, Senator Lugar. We all know he is one of the world's foremost \nexperts on the subject of threat reduction and proliferation reduction. \nThere are very few Senators who can look out and see a program that has \nbeen as constructive in reducing the threat to our Nation that bears \ntheir name--the Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction Program--and it has been an \nhonor for me to work with Senator Lugar and to have his wise counsel in \nthis process and, equally important, to have his courage in being \nwilling to stand for what he believes in so deeply and what he knows \nwill advance the cause of our Nation.\n  I might comment to my colleagues that what we are doing in these next \nhours and days, providing advice and consent, is a responsibility that \nis obviously given only to the Senate. The Founding Fathers intended \nthat the Senate be able to rise above the pettiness of partisan \npolitics. As our friend Chris Dodd said in his valedictory speech:\n\n       The Senate was designed to be different, not simply for the \n     sake of variety but because the Framers believed the Senate \n     could and should be the venue in which statesmen would lift \n     America up to meet its unique challenges.\n\n  ``Statesmen,'' that is the word we need to focus on in these next \ndays. Too often in recent months--the American people signaled that in \nthe last election--the Senate has been unable to lift America to meet \nits challenges. Too often we became one of those challenges, and rather \nthan cooperating or compromising, we saw blockade after blockade and an \ninability to be able to address a number of issues.\n  As Senator Dodd said: What determines whether this institution works \nis whether the 100 of us can work together.\n  So with the New START treaty, we have the opportunity to do that and \nto demonstrate our leadership to the world. I would say to my \ncolleagues that just 2 days ago the Foreign Relations Committee had the \nprivilege of welcoming the entire United Nations Security Council, \nwhich came to Washington with our Ambassador, Dr. Susan Rice. Much on \ntheir minds was this question of: Could the Senate rise? Would the \nSenate accomplish this important goal, which has meaning not just to us \nbut to them because they have joined with us in resolution 1929 in \norder to put pressure on Iran, not to mention the long-term efforts we \nhave made with respect to North Korea.\n  So what we do is going to be an expression of our opportunity, of our \nability to be able to provide leadership to the American people.\n  Let me clarify one thing at the outset of this discussion. We have \nenough time to do this treaty. To anybody who wants to come out here \nand claim: Oh, no, we do not have time; we cannot do it; it is right \nbefore Christmas, and so forth, let me just remind people the original \nSTART agreement, which was passed back in 1992, was a far more dramatic \ntreaty than the New START.\n  The original START treaty was formulated in the aftermath of the \ndemise of the Soviet Union. There was huge uncertainty in Russia at \nthat point in time. The Soviet Union had just collapsed. Yet despite \nall the uncertainty, despite the complexity of going from some 10,000 \nnuclear warheads down to 6,000, the full Senate needed only 5 days of \nfloor time in order to approve the treaty by a vote of 93 to 6.\n  The START II treaty, which followed it about 4 years later, took only \n2 days on the floor of the Senate. It was approved 87 to 4.\n  The Moscow Treaty, which actually resulted in the next further big \nreduction--because START II was ratified by the Senate but not approved \nby Russia because of what had happened with the ABM Treaty, the \nunilateral pullout of the United States; so in their pique at that, it \nwas not ratified--but we managed to go to the Moscow Treaty, and it \nresulted in further reductions to some 1,700 to 2,200 weapons, a very \ndramatic reduction. That treaty, which did not have any verification \nmeasures in it at all--no verification--that treaty took only 2 days on \nthe floor of the Senate, and it was approved 95 to 0.\n  So we have time to do this treaty. If we approach it seriously, if we \ndo not have delay amendments and delay amendments, I believe we have an \nopportunity to embrace the fact that this New START treaty is a \ncommonsense agreement in the next step to reduce down to 1,550 warheads \nand to enhance stability between two countries that together between \nthem possess some 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.\n  It will limit Russia over the next 10 years to those 1,550 deployed \nwarheads, 700 deployed delivery vehicles, and 800 launchers. It will \ngive us flexibility in deploying our own arsenal. We have huge \nflexibility in deciding what we put on land, what we put in the air, \nand what we put at sea. At the same time, it will allow us to eliminate \nsurplus weapons that have no place in today's strategic environment. \nNew START's verification provisions are going to deepen our \nunderstanding of Russia's nuclear forces.\n  For the past 40 years, the United States, often at the instigation of \nRepublican Presidents, has used arms control with Russia to increase \nthe transparency and the predictability of both our nuclear arsenals, \nand this has built trust between our two countries. It has reduced the \nchances of an accident. It stabilized our relationship during times of \ncrisis. It has provided for greater communication and greater \nunderstanding and, as everybody knows, in making military decisions and \nstrategic decisions, one's understanding of the legitimacy of a \nparticular threat and the immediacy of that threat and knowing what the \nintentions and actions of a potential adversary might be is critical to \nbeing able to make wise judgments about what reaction might best be \nentertained.\n\n  Frankly, that trust is exactly why President George H.W. Bush signed \nthe START I and the START II treaties. That is why these treaties \npassed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  New START simply stands on the shoulders of those two START \nagreements. It is not new. There are a few new components of it, a few \ntwists in terms of the verification, other things, but they are not \nfundamentally new. They also stand on the trust and the fact of the \nlegitimate enforcement of that treaty over all the years that START has \nbeen in effect.\n  So we are not beginning from scratch. We have a 1992 until today \nrecord of cooperation and of knowledge and increased security that has \ncome to us because of the prior agreements. That is, frankly, why I was \nso pleased President Bush--George Herbert Walker Bush--last week, \nissued a statement urging the Senate to ratify this treaty.\n  In addition to stabilizing the United States-Russia nuclear \nrelationship, New START has a profound impact on our ability to be able \nto work to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons in states such as \nIran. I might point out that in the 7 months since President\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\nObama signed this agreement, Russia has already exhibited a greater \ncooperative attitude in working with the United States on a number of \nthings, not the least of which is in supporting harsher sanctions \nagainst Iran, and they have suspended the sale of the S-300 air defense \nsystem to Tehran. That is critical.\n  We were struggling a couple years ago to try to strengthen the \nsanctions against Iran. There is not a Member of this body who did not \narticulate, at one point or another, the need to move to the Iran \nSanctions Act. We finally did that, but we did not have a partnership. \nNeither China nor Russia, who are permanent members of the Security \nCouncil, were joining in that effort, so we could not get the United \nNations even to move.\n  Now we have, and there is nobody who has watched the evolution of \nthis restart with Russia who does not understand that cooperation has \nbeen enhanced by our signing of this treaty. To not ratify it now would \nbe a very serious blow to that cooperative effort and, in fact, \naccording to many experts, could ignite an opposite reaction that would \nmove us back into the kinds of arms race we have struggled so long to \nget out from under. So the fact is, we need to understand that \nrelationship.\n  I might add, I think Steve Forbes, in Forbes magazine, wrote an \narticle just the other day urging the Senate to ratify START because he \nsaid it does not just have an implication in terms of the security \ncomponent of it, the nuclear side, it has a very strong economic \ncomponent. He is arguing for greater economic engagement between Russia \nand the United States and Russia and the West. He said the restart \nrelationship is critical to that increased commerce, to that increased \neconomic strengthening between our countries. I hope my colleagues will \nlook carefully at a strong conservative voice such as his that urges \nthe ratification of this treaty.\n  In addition to the Russian component of the relationship, New START \nwill help us keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. One \nof the greatest fears of our security community is that terrorists may \nnot necessarily get what we strictly call a nuclear bomb, but they may \nbe able to get nuclear material through back channels and through the \nblack market because it has not been adequately guarded and because we \nhave not reduced the numbers of missiles and the amount of material and \nso they could get a hold of some of that material and make what is \ncalled a dirty bomb; that is, a bomb that does not go off in nuclear \nreaction but which, because of the nuclear material that explodes with \nit, has a very broad toxic impact on a very large community. That is a \nlegitimate concern and one of the reasons why we drive so hard to \nreduce the nuclear actors in the world.\n\n  The original START agreement was, frankly, the foundation of the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. That is, simply put, \nthe most successful nonproliferation effort of the last 20 years. As \nJames Baker, former Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State, \nsaid:\n\n       I really don't think Nunn-Lugar would have been nearly as \n     successful as it was if the Russians had lacked the legally \n     binding assurance of parallel U.S. reductions through the \n     START treaty.\n\n  So the New START is going to strengthen our ability to continue to \nsecure loose nuclear materials, and without New START, absolutely, to a \ncertainty, that ability to contain those materials will be weakened.\n  In short, New START is going to help us address the lingering dangers \nof the old nuclear age while giving us important tools to be able to \ncombat the threats of the new nuclear age, and the sooner we approve it \nthe safer we will become.\n  That is why there is such an outpouring of support for this treaty. \nEvery single living former Secretary of State, Republican and Democrat, \nsupports this treaty. So do five former Secretaries of Defense and the \nChair and the Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission. So do seven former \ncommanders of our nuclear forces and the entirety of our uniformed \nmilitary, including Admiral Mullen and the service chiefs, and our \ncurrent nuclear commander. All support this treaty as well. It is \ndifficult to imagine an agreement with that kind of backing from so \nmany individuals who contributed so much to our Nation's security, \nalmost all of whom know a lot more about each of these arguments than \nany Senator--myself, everybody here. They have been in the middle of \nthis, and over the last weeks every single one of them has spoken out \nin favor of this treaty.\n  Some have suggested we shouldn't rush to do this, but I have to tell \nmy colleagues, only in the Senate would a year and a half be a rush. We \nstarted working on this treaty a year and a half ago. Senators have had \nunbelievable opportunity to be able to do this. I think the question is \nnot why would we try to do it now, it is why would we not try to do it \nnow. For what reason within the four corners of the actual treaty--not \ntalking about modernization; that is not in the four corners of the \ntreaty--notwithstanding that, the administration has allowed delay \nafter delay after delay in order to help work with Senator Kyl and \nprovide adequate increases in modernization, so much so that the \nmodernization is way above what it was under President Bush or any \nprior administration. But that is not in the four corners of the \ntreaty. That is something you do because you want to maintain America's \nnuclear force, and we all want to do that, which is why we have worked \nhard to be able to provide that funding.\n  I believe the importance here is to recognize it has been more than a \nyear since the original START treaty and its verification provisions \nexpired. It has been more than 1 year since we had inspectors on the \nground in Russia without access to their nuclear facilities. Every day \nfor the past year our knowledge of their arsenal or whatever they are \ndoing begins to diminish, one step, one small amount at a time, \ncumulatively over time, which is why our entire national intelligence \ncommunity has come out and said this treaty, in fact, will advance \nAmerica's security and assist us to be able to know what Russia is \ndoing.\n  Let me point out 2 weeks ago James Clapper, the Director of National \nIntelligence, urged us to ratify the New START and he said: ``I think \nthe earlier, the sooner, the better.'' That is our National \nIntelligence Director.\n  Others have tried to suggest again that this is a squeeze in the last \ndays here, but let me say respectfully I have already given the \ntimeframe. START took 5 days; START II, 2 days; Moscow, 2 days. So if \nwe work diligently, there is nothing to stop us from finishing this in \nthe time we have. We just have to stay here and make it clear we are \ngoing to stay here, and the President wants us to, and Harry Reid has \nsaid we will, until we get this done. The fact is that starting in June \nof 2009, over a year ago--a year and a half ago--the Foreign Relations \nCommittee was briefed at least five times during the talks with the \nRussians. We met downstairs in the secure facilities with the \nnegotiators while they were negotiating. We met with them before they \nnegotiated. We gave them parameters we thought they needed to embrace \nin order to facilitate passage through the Senate. We met with them \nwhile they were negotiating at least five times--Senators from the \nArmed Services Committee, Senators from the Intelligence Committee, \nSenators from the Senate's National Security Working Group, which I \ncochair along with Senator Kyl. Whenever Senator Kyl wanted to meet \nwith that group, we called a meeting with that group. We met and called \nin Rose Guttemoeller and others and we sat and talked. The Select \nCommittee on Intelligence did its work. In the end, if you count them, \nmore than 60 Senators were able to follow the negotiations in detail \nover a 1-year period. Senators also had additional opportunities to \nmeet with the negotiating team and a delegation of Senators even \ntraveled to Geneva, which the administration helped to make happen in \norder to meet with the negotiators while the negotiations were going \non.\n  So even though the New START was formally submitted to the Senate in \nMay, the fact is Congress knew a lot about this treaty before it was \neven signed. The President made certain we were continually being \nbriefed and that the input of the Senate was taken into account in the \ncontext of those negotiations. No other Senate--not next year's \nSenate--could come back here and replicate what this Senate has\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\ngone through in preparing for this treaty. We can't replicate those \nnegotiations. They are over. They can't go back and give advice to the \nnegotiators at the beginning. That is done. We did that. It is our \nresponsibility to stand up and complete the task on this because we \nhave put a year and a half's work into it. We have done the \npreparation. We have the knowledge. It is our responsibility.\n  The fact is over the last 7 months, this Senate has even become more \nimmersed in the treaty. We have had briefings. Documents have been \nsubmitted. Nearly 1,000 formal questions were submitted to the \nadministration and they have been answered. We have volumes of these \nquestions, all of which were asked by Senators, completely within their \nrights, totally appropriate in the ratification process. We welcome it. \nI think it has produced a better record and a stronger product.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee conducted 12 open and classified \nhearings. We heard from more than 20 witnesses. The Armed Services \nCommittee and the Intelligence Committee held more than eight hearings \nand classified briefings of their own. We heard from Robert Gates, the \nSecretary of Defense; from ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff; GEN Kevin Chilton, the Commander of the Strategic \nCommand; LTG Patrick O'Reilly, the Director of the Missile Defense \nAgency, who incidentally repeated what every single person involved in \nthis, from Secretary Gates all the way through the strategic command, \nhas said:\n\n       This treaty does nothing to negatively impact America's \n     ability, or to even impact it in a way that prevents us from \n     doing exactly what we want with respect to missile defense.\n\n  We also heard from the directors of the Nation's nuclear \nlaboratories, the intelligence officials who are charged with \nmonitoring the threats to the United States, and we heard, as I \nmentioned previously several times, from the negotiators of the \nagreement. We heard from officials who served in the Nixon \nadministration, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43. \nWe heard from officials in every one of those administrations, and you \nknow what. Overwhelmingly, they told us we should ratify the New START.\n  As I said, some of the strongest support for this treaty comes from \nthe military. On June 16 I chaired a hearing on the U.S. nuclear \nposture, modernization of our nuclear weapons complex and our missile \ndefense plans. General Chilton, Commander of the U.S. Strategic \nCommand, who is responsible for overseeing our nuclear deterrent, \nexplained why the military supports the New START. He said:\n\n       If we don't get the treaty, A, the Russians are not \n     constrained in their development of force structure; and \n     B, we have no insight into what they are doing. So it is \n     the worst of both possible worlds.\n\n  That is the head of our Strategic Command telling us if you don't \nratify this treaty, it is the worst of both possible worlds.\n  This treaty may have been negotiated by a Democratic President, but \nsome of the strongest support for this treaty comes from Republicans. \nTwo weeks ago, five former Republican Secretaries of State--five--Henry \nKissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Colin \nPowell--wrote an article saying they support ratification of New START \nbecause it embraces Republican principles such as strong verification. \nLast week, Condoleezza Rice published an op-ed which said that the New \nSTART treaty deserves bipartisan support when the Senate decides to \nvote on it. As Secretary Rice wrote, approving this treaty is part of \nour effort to ``stop the world's most dangerous weapons from going to \nthe world's most dangerous regimes.''\n  So if some think we haven't somehow considered this treaty carefully, \nI encourage them to revisit the voluminous record that has been \nproduced over the last year and a half, and I look forward to reviewing \nit here as we debate New START in the coming days.\n  In the end, I am confident we are going to approve this treaty just \nas the Senate approved the original START treaty in 1992. At that time \nthere were also Senators who insisted on delay. There were Senators who \nsuggested that serious questions remained unanswered. That is their \nprivilege. There were Senators who drafted dozens and dozens of \namendments. But in the end, within 5 days, the Senate came together to \napprove the treaty 93 to 6.\n  So what is important that we pay attention to as we look at the big \npicture here and to the national imperative, the security imperative \nbehind this treaty and what our military leaders and civilian leaders \nare urging us to think about, both past and present? Well, if you pay \nattention to the facts, you can come to only one conclusion, and that \nis we have to ratify this treaty.\n  Some of our colleagues have said they could support the treaty if we \naddressed certain issues in a resolution of ratification. Well, again, \nI hope they are listening. We have addressed the issues they raised in \nthe resolution of ratification. I think many people may not even be \naware of how much we have put into the resolution of ratification and \nhow much we have done over the last 7 months to respond to the concerns \nraised during the consideration of the treaty.\n  The draft resolution is 28 pages long. It contains 13 conditions, 3 \nunderstandings, 10 declarations, and the conditions will require action \nby the executive branch. The understandings are formally communicated \nto the Russians, and the declarations express clear language of what we \nin the Senate expect to happen in the next years. That is the \ndistinction between each of those categories.\n  This resolution currently addresses every serious topic we have \naddressed over the course of the last 7 months. For example, on the \nissue of missile defense, our military has repeatedly and unequivocally \nassured us that the New START does nothing to constrain our missile \ndefense plans. The Secretary of Defense says it does nothing to \nconstrain our missile defense plans. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff says it does nothing to constrain our missile defense plans. \nThe commander of our nuclear forces says it does nothing to constrain \nour defense plans. Indeed, the man who probably knows more about these \nplans in the greatest detail--much more than any Senator--LTG O'Reilly, \nthe head of the Missile Defense Agency, testified that in many ways, \nthe treaty reduces constraints on our missile defense testing. Get \nthat. The head of missile defense says this treaty reduces the \nconstraints on our missile defense testing.\n  He also testified that the Russians signed the treaty full knowing \nthat we are committed to the phased adaptive approach in Europe. He \nsaid:\n\n       I have briefed the Russians personally in Moscow on every \n     aspect of our missile defense development. I believe they \n     understand what it is and that those plans for development \n     are not limited by this treaty.\n\n  Now, if the head of our missile defense sees no problem with this \ntreaty, I don't understand the concerns being expressed. But if a \nSenator is still worried about the New START missile defense treaty, \nnotwithstanding his comments, then they ought to read condition 5, \nunderstanding 1, and declarations 1 and 2, all of which speak directly \nto that issue.\n  We have also addressed the issue of what resources are needed in \norder to sustain our nuclear deterrence and modernize our nuclear \nweapons infrastructure. This is not an issue that falls within the four \ncorners of the treaty, as I mentioned. But as a matter of good faith, \nin an effort to sort of accelerate the ability of people to support \nthis treaty, every step of the way the administration, in good faith, \nhas worked to provide Senator Kyl and others with the full knowledge of \nhow that program is going to go forward from their point of view.\n  Obviously, the administration doesn't control what a Republican House \nis going to do next year. I don't know. But Senator Inouye has given \nhis assurances. Senator Feinstein has given her assurances. We have \nshown a good-faith effort to guarantee that there is knowledge of the \nfunding going forward--the 1251 program, which lays out the spending \ngoing forward and has been made available ahead of schedule, in a good-\nfaith effort to try to make certain every base is covered.\n  The Obama administration proposed spending $80 billion over the next \n10 years. That is a 15-percent increase over the baseline budget, even \nafter accounting for inflation. It would have been much more an amount \nthan was spent during the Bush administration. Notwithstanding that \ncommitment,\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\nstill last month some Senators expressed further concerns. So guess \nwhat. The administration responded even further and put up an \nadditional $5 billion over the next 10 years. In response, the \ndirectors of our three nuclear weapons laboratories sent me a letter \nsaying they were ``very pleased with the new plan,'' and they said:\n\n       We believe that the proposed budgets provide adequate \n     support to sustain the safety, security, reliability, and \n     effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent within the limit \n     of the 1,550 deployed strategic warheads distinguished by the \n     new START Treaty with adequate confidence and acceptable \n     risk.\n\n  Last week, the person responsible for running our nuclear weapons \ncomplex, who was originally appointed by George W. Bush, told the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       I can say with certainty that our nuclear infrastructure \n     has never received the level of support we have today.\n\n  That is a ringing endorsement, Mr. President, one that is completely \npersuasive--or ought to be--to any reasonable mind with respect to this \nissue. If Senators are still concerned, then I suggest they go see \ncondition 9 of the resolution of ratification. It says if any of this \nfunding doesn't materialize in the coming years, the President is \nrequired to report to Congress as to how he or she will respond to that \nshortfall.\n  Every other issue that has been raised is also addressed in the \nresolution as well. If you are worried about modernizing our strategic \ndelivery vehicles, declaration 13 gets at that concern. Conventional \nprompt global strike capabilities--look at conditions 6 and 7, \nunderstanding 3, and declaration 3.\n  Tactical nuclear weapons are likewise covered in the resolution. \nVerifying Russian compliance is also covered. Even the concern raised \nabout rail mobile missiles has been addressed in the resolution of \nratification.\n  Obviously, there is room for someone else to come in and say you need \nto do this or that; not everything has been covered. We completely \nremain open to any reasonable and legitimate efforts to improve on or \nguarantee some safeguard that somehow is not included in a way that it \ncan be without obviously trying to scuttle the treaty itself.\n  I have reached out to colleagues. We have had terrific conversations. \nI thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have sat with \nus in a lot of efforts and inquired and helped us to navigate this \nprocess. But make no mistake, we are not going to amend the treaty \nitself. We are willing to accept resolutions that don't kill the \ntreaty, but we are not going to get into some process after all that \nhas been said and done by all of the different bipartisan voices that \nhave inspected this treaty and found it one that we should ratify.\n  Mr. President, I have been through all the folks who signed and \nendorsed it, et cetera. I simply say I hope in the next hours we will \nhave a healthy debate. I hope we can also work out--everybody knows the \nholiday is upon us--I hope we can work out reasonable time periods on \namendments. We are certainly not going to prolong debate. I think most \nSenators have a sense of where they feel on most of these issues.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues in a very constructive \nway to try to expedite the process for our colleagues. We have other \nbusiness before the Senate, as well, and we are cognizant of that.\n  This is truly a moment where we can increase America's hand in \nseveral of the greatest challenges we face on the planet. First and \nforemost, obviously, if we are truly committed to a nonnuclear Iran, if \nthe United States can turn away from reducing weapons with Russia in a \nway that sends a message to them about our bona fides and clean hands \nin this effort, it would be a tragedy if we didn't take this \nopportunity in order to strengthen the President's and the West's and \nthe U.N.'s hands in trying to deal with this increasingly threatening \nissue.\n  I hope our colleagues will warmly rise to that challenge in the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that is very \nimportant to Louisianians and folks along the gulf coast and very \nimportant to the entire country, which is continuing the de facto \nmoratorium--the ``permatorium'' is what many folks have called it--in \nterms of drilling, energy production in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  There is one particular headline I want to point out in this context \nthat is very frustrating and baffling. If it weren't so serious, it \nwould be comical. Over the last several months, Louisianians have grown \nincreasingly frustrated with the Interior Department in particular--and \nin particular, what used to be called MMS but is now the Bureau of \nOcean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement or BOEMRE. \nLouisianians have come to pronounce that ``bummer.'' That is because \nthat agency hasn't been doing its work to issue permits to get \nAmericans back to work to produce American energy.\n  Related to that, earlier this week I publicly announced a hold on Dr. \nScott Doney to be chief scientist at NOAA until Interior and BOEMRE \nshow that it is capable of responding to a letter I had sent it about \nthis ``permatorium,'' the sad state of affairs, and until they are \nwilling to explain to Congress findings in an IG report I had requested \nback in June.\n  Since June of this year, not a single new exploration plan or \ndeepwater permit to drill has been approved by these bureaucracies--not \na single one--idling billions of dollars of assets and forcing \ncompanies to cut their 2011 investment in the gulf to one-third of what \nit was a year ago.\n  Time and again we have heard from BOEMRE and Interior Secretary \nSalazar that they don't have enough people to issue permits. They need \nmore staff and they need to dedicate resources. They need more money \nand they need to focus on this permitting program. I have also been \ntold that Interior needs more money--specifically $100 million \nadditional.\n  In light of all these claims, all of these requests--more people and \nmore money--and in light of the enormous frustration we feel in \nLouisiana and in the gulf, I want to get to this little newspaper \nheadline I referenced a few minutes ago. It came out yesterday, and it \nreads: ``BOEMRE Team Returns from Papua, New Guinea Visit After Sharing \nTechnical Expertise with Officials.''\n  It reads:\n\n       Experts from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, \n     Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) recently completed a \n     technical assistance workshop on offshore oil and gas \n     regulatory programs for the Government of Papua, New Guinea. \n     The workshop was sponsored by the U.S. Department of State's \n     Energy Governance and Capacity Initiative.\n\n  This is the same Interior Department that can't get a single \nexploration plan, not a single deepwater permit to drill out the door; \nthe same Interior Department and BOEMRE that claims they need more \nmoney to hire more staff to get this job done.\n  Apparently, they have plenty latitude and staff and money for a 3-day \nworkshop in Papua, New Guinea, to discuss offshore permitting, which \nthey can't get done in the United States.\n  I think we need to take a little time to explain to the Government of \nPapua, New Guinea, that the last thing in the world they want to do, \nassuming they are interested in creating jobs at home through a \nworkable permitting process, is to talk to these folks. These are the \nsame folks who can't get a single deepwater permit or a single \nexploration plan out the door.\n  As I said, this would be comical except it is not because it is dead \nserious, and it is losing American jobs and it is exporting economic \nactivity from our country overseas.\n  The Interior Department is crushing domestic energy production that \nis destroying good-paying jobs, losing revenue for the Treasury, and \nmaking America more energy insecure. If I can give one simple \nrecommendation to BOEMRE this holiday season in regard to expediting \nthe permitting process, maybe they should keep their staff planted in \ntheir seats at home. Maybe they should pass on the next trip to Papua, \nNew Guinea, and the next workshop with our partners around the globe. \nMaybe they should focus on getting the first exploration plan and the \nfirst new deepwater permit out the door. Maybe they should get that job \ndone and put Americans back to work\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nproducing American energy before more of these outrageous trips and \nexpenses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the START treaty is going to be \nbefore us soon. I realize we had a motion to proceed to that today. I \nthink I have indicated a willingness to support the treaty if all the \nt's are crossed and the i's are dotted on modernization. I know there \nare a number of commitments that are forthcoming from the White House \nand other places regarding modernization.\n  My hope is the same on missile defense. I am very concerned we are \ndoing this in the middle of an omnibus, which is a 1,924-page omnibus. \nI am very concerned about a treaty of this substance, this seriousness, \ndealing with nuclear arms, being taken up in such a disconcerted way.\n  I voted against the motion to proceed. I do hope, as the leaders \nindicated, all of those who wish to offer amendments--and I know there \nwill be a number of serious and thoughtful amendments that matter--will \nbe heard. I am still skeptical that can be done in an appropriate way.\n  Again, I think this treaty, with the t's crossed and i's dotted, with \nthe appropriate time allotted, whether it is now or it ends up being in \nFebruary, and if the resolution is not weakened in any way, is still \nsomething I will plan to support. But I am very skeptical we can do \nthat appropriately during this lameduck session, with this omnibus \nbefore us.\n  Let me turn to the omnibus because that is what the American people \nare most focused on today. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am that \nan appropriations bill of this size--one that has an increase in \nspending and over 6,000 earmarks--as a matter of fact, I know the Chair \nis aware of this because we had a great conversation this morning about \nspending. We had a large number of people on the Senate floor yesterday \ntalking about our concern for fiscal issues. But the bill is 1,924 \npages long. These are just the earmarks. These are just the earmarks, \nnot the bill itself I am holding.\n  I am stunned that, after the message that was sent during this last \nelection, Congress will basically say--or many Members--to the American \npeople: We understand you are very upset and that you have concerns \nthat are true concerns about the country's fiscal condition. Yet we \ndon't really care.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that what will happen is that saner \nheads will prevail and that what we will do is pass a short-term CR--a \ncontinuing resolution, for those who may be listening in and don't know \nwhat that is. That would give us the ability to operate the government \nthrough February or March so that people such as the Presiding Officer, \nwho was just elected, and myself and others who care so deeply about \nthe fiscal issues of our country would have the ability to put spending \nconstraints in place.\n\n  I think everyone knows our country faces--and these are not \nrhetorical issues--a crisis as it relates to these issues. The world \nmarkets are watching us. I think we have seen our interest rates on our \nbonds rise pretty dramatically even since the tax bill came out. And \nthat was a tough vote for me because, again, in order to create \ncertainty and to ensure that the economic prosperity of this country \nresumed and that we continue on the pace we are on today, I felt it was \nimportant to go ahead and get that behind us.\n  But I always thought and I hoped--and still do--that what we would \nmove to very quickly is really driving down spending in relation to our \ncountry's gross domestic output. I have offered an amendment to do just \nthat, as I did that on the tax bill. I plan to offer the same on this \nparticular discussion we are having now. But I am unbelievably \ndisappointed that we would even consider punting the spending issue for \na year. That is what we would be doing. In essence, if this omnibus \nbill were to pass, we would be passing a huge spending bill.\n  Again, let me go back. Typically, appropriations are handled one bill \nat a time. There are typically 12 appropriations bills. What happens \nwhen we do that is we are able to pick out wasteful programs here on \nthe floor and maybe defund those, and we are able to really scrutinize \nall of the programs of government, which is what the American people \nwant us to do. Instead of that--especially in a climate where the \nAmerican people almost revolted at the polls, and I know you know this \nvery well--instead of carefully considering our spending, what we are \nbeing asked to do is to vote on 1 bill that has all 12 of those \nappropriations bills packed into it, again with 6,000 earmarks, and we \nare asked to vote on that here in the next few days. I think it is \nreprehensible, and I say that respectfully.\n  I know people on our Appropriations Committee have worked together in \na very serious way over the last year. I know they have. And I know the \nAppropriations Committee is a committee that probably has the most \nbipartisan spirit of any committee in the Senate. So I can understand \ntheir desire to want to finish their work. But it is being done \ninappropriately. This is not the way serious people conduct their \nbusiness. They take up these bills one at a time. Sometimes there are \ntwo or three, when they are very small appropriations bills, that are \nbanded together. That is called a ``minibus,'' if you will. But to do \nthis all at once flies in the face of everything we know to be good \ngovernment. All of us know this is not the right way to fund \ngovernment.\n  A much better way for us would be to pass a short-term continuing \nresolution bill, as I just mentioned, to kick this down to February or \nMarch and allow us to look at something like the amendment I have \noffered where we take spending that is at an alltime high of 24 percent \nof our gross domestic product today and over the next 10 years take it \ndown to our 40-year average of 20.6 percent. Claire McCaskill and I are \ncosponsoring, in a bipartisan way, a bill or an amendment--depending on \nhow it is offered--to do just that, and there may be other things.\n  We know the deficit reduction commission just spent a tremendous \namount of time--and I know the Presiding Officer has talked personally \nto leaders multiple times--they spent a tremendous amount of time this \nyear looking at what we as a government need to do to be responsible; \nto make sure people around the world view our credit as something in \nwhich they are willing to invest; to really make sure that, for these \npages who sit in front of me and who work so hard here, we are not, in \nessence, living a life and layering debt upon debt on top of the \nbalance sheet they will have to deal with.\n  I cannot believe that, in the atmosphere of just having that report \ncome forward, having us look at how Draconian the problem is and some \nof the tough decisions a courageous Congress would need to make to put \nour country back on the right path, we would even consider passing this \nmassive piece of legislation that, in essence, would kick the can down \nthe road for a year and basically let the wind out of this momentum \nthat has been building for us to actually do the right thing. I can't \nimagine we would do that.\n  I know the Chair knows our debt ceiling vote is going to be coming up \nsoon. It is going to happen sometime in April, maybe May. Maybe it will \ndrag out as long as the first week in June. That is a vote where we \nvote to raise the amount of debt this country can enter into. I know a \nlot of people say it is irresponsible not to vote for a debt ceiling \nincrease because we have already spent the money. It would be like \ngoing out and running up a credit card bill and then not paying it. But \nI think it is irresponsible not to act responsibly prior to taking that \nvote.\n  What I am so disappointed in is that a vote on this omnibus bill \nbefore us probably prevents us from going ahead and doing some things \nthis spring that we know are responsible and will really drive down the \ncost of government to an appropriate level.\n  So I know there is a lot of pressure, probably, in the caucuses--\nmaybe the caucus on the other side of the aisle that meets at lunch; I \nknow there is a meeting again tomorrow--I know there is a lot of \npressure to get this out of the way. But I know with every cell of my \nbody that passing this omnibus right now is absolutely the wrong thing \nto do for the country from the\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nstandpoint of good government, and I absolutely know it is the wrong \nthing to do to all of those citizens across this country who became \ninvolved in this.\n  I know there are people on both sides of the aisle who care deeply \nabout the future of this country, and I know there are people on both \nsides of the aisle who have some commonality as to what the path \nforward is in making sure this country lives up to its obligations to \nthe American citizens, that we don't just live for today. That is what, \nby the way, we would be doing by passing this--living for today and \npassing on those obligations to the future.\n  I hope that by the time we take the vote on this bill, it will be \ndefeated and that people who deeply care about the future of this \ncountry will come together, pass a short-term continuing resolution--\nwhich I think most of us in this body know is the responsible thing to \ndo--and that we will begin to work after the first of next year, when \nthis lameduck session ends, doing the things this country needs most, \nand that is all of us having the courage to make those cuts and do what \nis necessary to get our country back on a sound footing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I would like to address the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty--called New START--that is now before the Senate for \nratification.\n  This treaty has been carefully vetted. I am confident the Senate will \ncome to the conclusion that this treaty is in our national interest and \nwill cast the necessary votes for ratification. I strongly support \nratification.\n  Before speaking about intelligence issues related to this treaty, it \nis important to remind ourselves about the extraordinary, lethal nature \nof these nuclear weapons.\n  I was 12 years old when atomic bombs flattened both Hiroshima and \nNagasaki. The Hiroshima bomb, estimated to have been 21 kilotons, \nkilled 70,000 people outright. You can see from this chart the absolute \ndevastation this bomb caused in Hiroshima. The Nagasaki bomb, at 15 \nkilotons--somewhat less--killed at least 40,000 people immediately. \nThis is Nagasaki. Another 100,000 or so who survived the initial blasts \ndied of injuries and radiation sickness. By the end of 1945, an \nestimated 220,000 people had lost their lives because of these two \nbombs.\n  The horrible images of disfigured bodies and devastating ruins have \nstayed with me all my life. I was part of the generation of youngsters \nbeing raised who hid under our desks in drills about atomic bombs and \natomic weapons being unleashed.\n  So here is Nagasaki before the bomb, and here is Nagasaki after the \nbomb. It gives you a very good look at what it was like.\n  Today, we live in a world with far more nuclear weapons and even more \npowerful destructive capabilities. In May of this year, the Pentagon \nmade a rare public announcement of the current U.S. nuclear stockpile--\n5,113 nuclear warheads, including deployed and nondeployed and not \nincluding warheads awaiting dismantlement. According to the Federation \nof American Scientists, Russia's stockpile includes 4,650 deployed \nwarheads--deployed warheads--both strategic and tactical. Including \nnondeployed warheads, the estimate of Russia's arsenal is 9,000 \nwarheads, plus thousands more waiting to be dismantled.\n  Many--and here is the key--many of these weapons are far in excess of \n100 kilotons or more than five times the size of the bombs dropped on \nHiroshima and Nagasaki. Some are far, far larger. Many of these weapons \nare on high alert, ready to be launched at a moment's notice, and their \nuse would result in unimaginable devastation.\n  So I ask my colleagues during this debate to reflect carefully on the \nextraordinary, lethal nature of these weapons as we consider this \ntreaty.\n  This treaty is actually a modest step forward, not a giant one. It \ncalls for cutting deployed strategic nuclear warheads by 30 percent \nbelow the levels established under the 2002 Moscow Treaty to 1,550 \neach. It cuts launch vehicles, such as missile silos and submarine \ntubes, to 800 for each country. Deployed launch vehicles are capped at \n700--more than 50 percent below the original START treaty.\n  According to the unanimous views of our Nation's military and \ncivilian defense officials, this will not erode America's nuclear \ncapability, our strategic deterrent, or our national defense.\n  The United States will still maintain a robust nuclear triad, able to \nprotect our country and our national security interests.\n  As GEN James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and former head of the United States Strategic Command, stated:\n\n       I think we have more than enough capacity and capability \n     for any threat that we see today or that might emerge in the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  Additionally, these reductions in this New START treaty won't have to \nbe completed until the treaty's seventh year, so there is plenty of \ntime for a prudent drawdown. But while its terms are modest, its \nimpacts are broad, and I wish now to describe some of the benefits of \nratification.\n  I begin with the ways in which this treaty enhances our Nation's \nintelligence capabilities. This has been the lens through which the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence has viewed the treaty, and I \nbelieve the arguments are strongly positive and persuasive. There are \nthree main points to make, and I will take them in turn.\n  They are, No. 1, the intelligence community can carry out its \nresponsibility to monitor Russian activities under the treaty \neffectively. No. 2, this treaty, when it enters into force, will \nbenefit intelligence collection and analysis. And No. 3, intelligence \nanalysis indicates that failing to ratify the New START treaty will \ncreate negative consequences for the United States.\n  My comments today are, of course, unclassified, but I would note that \nthere is a National Intelligence Estimate on monitoring the New START \nTreaty available to Senators. I have written a classified letter to \nSenators Kerry and Lugar that spells out these arguments in greater \ndetail. Members are welcome to review both documents.\n  Following President Reagan's advice to ``trust but verify,'' and in \nline with all major arms control treaties for decades, New START \nincludes several provisions that allow the United States to monitor how \nRussia is reducing and deploying its strategic arsenal, and vice versa.\n  The U.S. intelligence community will use these treaty provisions and \nother independent tools, such as the use of national technical means, \nfor example, our satellites, to collect information on Russian forces \nand whether Russia is complying with the treaty's terms. These \nprovisions include on-the-ground inspections of Russian nuclear \nfacilities and bases--18 a year; regular exchanges on data on the \nwarhead and missile production and locations; unique identifiers, a \ndistinct alphanumeric code for each missile and heavy bomber for \ntracking purposes; a ban on blocking national technical means from \ncollecting information on strategic forces, and other measures I will \ndescribe later in these remarks.\n  Without the strong monitoring and verification measures provided for \nin this treaty, we will know less about the number, size, location, and \ndeployment status of Russian nuclear warheads. That is a fact.\n  As General Chilton, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, recently \nsaid:\n\n       Without New START, we would rapidly lose insight into \n     Russian nuclear strategic force developments and activities, \n     and our force modernization planning and hedging strategy \n     would be more complex and more costly. Without such a regime, \n     we would unfortunately be left to use worst-case analyses \n     regarding our own force requirements.\n\n  That is what a ``no'' vote on this treaty means.\n  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin made the same point earlier \nthis month. He said that if the United States doesn't ratify the \ntreaty, Russia will have to respond, including augmentation of its \nstockpile. That is what voting ``no'' on this treaty means.\n  So these monitoring provisions are key, as are the trust and \ntransparency they bring, and the only way to get to these provisions is \nthrough ratification.\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\n  In fact, we have not had any inspections or other monitoring tools \nfor over a year, since the original START treaty expired, so we have \nless insight into any new Russian weapons and delivery systems that \nmight be entering their force. The United States has essentially gone \nblack on any monitoring, inspection, data exchanges, telemetry, and \nnotification allowed by the former START treaty.\n  Last November, Senator Kyl and I traveled to Geneva to meet with \nUnited States and Russian negotiating teams. We met at some length with \nRose Gottemoeller, the Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control, \nVerification, and Compliance, who led the U.S. negotiating team. We \nalso met with the senior members of her team, including her deputy, \nAmbassador Marcie Ries, Ted Warner, Mike Elliot, Kurt Siemon, and Dick \nTrout, who led the drafting efforts and represented the Departments of \nDefense and Energy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  These officials and many of the other members of the U.S. team were \nvery impressive in their professionalism and experience. Several had \nparticipated in the negotiation of the original START treaty or the \nIntermediate Range Nuclear Forces treaty, the INF treaty. Several were \ninspectors who had conducted on-the-ground inspections in Russia under \nSTART and INF, or were weapons system operators who had been \nresponsible for hosting Russian inspectors at U.S. bases.\n  This team was not composed of the uninitiated or of neophytes. They \nhad both background and skill. They were acutely aware of the lessons \nlearned over the past decades of arms control and negotiated this \ntreaty with an understanding of what monitoring and compliance \nverification mean.\n  Senator Kyl and I also met two or three times during our trip to \nGeneva with the Russian delegation led by Russian Ambassador Anatoly \nAntonov, who is an experienced diplomat and negotiator. His delegation \nincluded representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and \nDefense, the General Staff, and key agencies such as RosAtom and \nRosKosmos. Like the U.S. delegations, the Russian delegation had among \nits members inspectors and weapons systems operators, including those \nfrom the Strategic Rocket Forces, the Navy, and the Air Force.\n  The treaty was still being negotiated at that time, but the rough \noutlines were very much coming into focus. I mentioned to the U.S. and \nRussian delegations that it would be difficult to get 67 votes in the \nSenate for a resolution saying the sky is blue. In order to get an arms \ntreaty through the Senate, it would have to have strong monitoring \nprovisions.\n  In a lengthy conversation over lunch with Russian Ambassador Antonov, \nI said that, as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I would \nhave to walk onto this very floor and assure my colleagues that the \nprovisions in this treaty are sufficient for the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity to perform its monitoring role. I believe that Ambassador \nAntonov clearly understood that, and 1 year later I am able to say on \nthis floor that the Intelligence Committee has reviewed the question of \nmonitoring the New START treaty at length. It is adequate.\n  After the treaty was submitted to the Senate on May 13, 2010, 7 \nmonths ago, the committee began its review of its provisions and annex. \nWe reviewed past intelligence community analyses on monitoring previous \ntreaties and the tools available to monitor Russian behavior under this \nNew START.\n  The intelligence community completed drafting its NIE on its ability \nto monitor the treaty's limits in June, 6 months ago. We received a \ncopy on June 30, allowing members to review it before and after the \nFourth of July recess. The committee held a hearing on the NIE with \nsenior intelligence officials in July. Not a single one of them \nquestioned the validity or the judgments of the estimates.\n  Following the hearing, the committee submitted more than 70 questions \nfor the record and received detailed responses from the intelligence \ncommunity. Those are obviously classified, but they can be seen.\n  In addition, the committee undertook its own independent review of \nthe NIE and the treaty's implications for the intelligence community. \nCommittee staff participated in more than a dozen meetings and \nbriefings on a range of issues concerning the treaty, focusing on \nintelligence monitoring and collection aspects.\n  Based on the committee's review, after reading the NIE and other \nassessments, and having spoken to Directors of National Intelligence \nDennis Blair, David Gompert, and Jim Clapper, it is clear to me that \nthe intelligence community will be able to effectively monitor Russian \nactivities under this treaty.\n  For the record, I wish to describe the monitoring provisions in this \ntreaty, many of which are similar to the original START treaty's \nprovisions.\n  No. 1, the treaty commits the United States and Russia ``not to \ninterfere with the national technical means of verification of the \nother Party.'' That means not to interfere with our satellites and \n``not to use concealment measures that impede verification.''\n  This means that Russia, as I said, agrees not to block our satellite \nobservations of their launchers or their testing. Without this treaty, \nRussia could take steps to deny or block our ability to collect \ninformation on their forces.\n  Let me make clear, they could try, and perhaps block our satellites.\n  Like START, New START requires Russia to provide the United States \nwith regular data notifications. This includes information on the \nproduction of any and all new strategic missiles, the loading of \nwarheads onto missiles, and the location to which strategic forces are \ndeployed. Under START, these notifications were vital to our \nunderstanding. In fact, the notification provisions under New START are \nstronger than those in the old START, including a requirement that \nRussia inform the United States when a missile or warhead moves into or \nout of deployed status.\n  Let me repeat that. There is an obligation that Russia inform us when \na missile or a warhead moves into or out of deployed status.\n  Third, New START restores our ability to conduct on-the-ground \ninspections. There are none of them going on, none have been going on, \nfor over a year. New START allows for 10 so-called type one on-site \ninspections of Russian ICBMs, SLBMs, and bomber bases a year. The \nprotocols for these type one inspections were written by U.S. \nnegotiators with years of inspections experience under the original \nSTART treaty. Here is how they work.\n  First, U.S. inspectors choose what base they wish to inspect. Russia \nis restricted from moving missiles, launchers, and bombers away from \nthat base.\n  Second, when the inspectors arrive they will be given a full briefing \nfrom the Russians, to include the numbers of deployed and nondeployed \nmissile launchers or bombers at the base, the number of warheads loaded \non each bomber--this is important--and the number of reentry vehicles \non each ICBM or SLBM.\n  Third, the inspectors choose what they want to inspect. At an ICBM's \nbase, the inspectors choose a deployed ICBM for inspection, one they \nwant to inspect. At a submarine base they choose an SLBM. If there are \nany nondeployed launchers, ones not carrying missiles, the inspectors \ncan pick one of those for inspection as well.\n  At air bases, the inspectors can choose up to three bombers for \ninspection.\n  Fourth, the actual inspection occurs, with the U.S. personnel \nverifying the number of warheads on the missiles or on the bombers \nchosen. As I mentioned earlier, each missile and bomber is coded with a \nspecific code, both numerically and alphabetically, so that you know \nwhat you have chosen, and they cannot be changed.\n  Under this framework, our inspectors are provided comprehensive \ninformation from the Russian briefers. They are able to choose \nthemselves how they want to verify that this information is accurate.\n  The treaty also provides for an additional eight inspections a year \nof nondeployed warheads and facilities where Russia converts or \neliminates nuclear arms.\n  Some people have commented that the number of inspections under New \nSTART, that is, the total of 18 I have just gone through, is smaller \nthan the 28 under the previous START treaty. This is true. But it is \nalso true that there are half as many Russian facilities to inspect as \nthere were in 1991 when START was signed.\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\n  In addition, inspections under New START are designed to cover more \ntopics than inspections under the prior START agreement. In testimony \nfrom the Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, \nKenneth Myers, the agency doing these inspections, said:\n\n       Type One inspections will be more demanding on both DTRA \n     and site personnel, as it combines the main parts of what \n     were formerly two separate inspections under START into a \n     single, lengthier inspection.\n\n  That is important. The inspections are going to be better. So while \nthe absolute number of inspections is down from 28 to 18, the ability \nto monitor and understand Russian forces is not lessened. I am \nconfident we can achieve our monitoring objectives with 18 inspections \na year. I also urge my colleagues to review the New START National \nIntelligence Estimate which addresses these issues in detail.\n  Let me discuss a couple of monitoring provisions that were included \nin the expired START treaty but are not in the treaty we are now \nconsidering. First, under START, the U.S. officials had a permanent \npresence at the Russian missile production facility at Votkinsk. You \nwill hear about Votkinsk.\n  Inspectors could watch as missiles left the plant and were shipped to \nvarious parts of the country. New START does not include this \nprovision. In fact, the Bush administration had taken this provision \noff the table in its negotiations with the Russians prior to leaving \noffice.\n  New START does, however, require Russia to mark all missiles, as I \nhave been saying, with unique identifiers so we can track their \nlocation and deployment status over the lifetime of the treaty, so it \nis not necessarily to have a permanent monitoring presence at Votkinsk.\n  The treaty also requires Russia to notify us at least 48 hours before \nany missile leaves a plant. So we will still have information about \nmissile production without the permanent presence. Our inspectors and \nother nuclear experts have testified that these provisions are, in \nfact, sufficient.\n  Secondly, START required the United States and Russia to exchange \ntechnical data from missile tests--that is known as telemetry--to each \nother but not to other countries. That telemetry allows each side to \ncalculate things such as how many warheads a missile could carry. This \nwas important as the START treaty attributed warheads to missiles. If a \nRussian missile could carry 10 reentry vehicles, the treaty counted it \nas having 10 warheads. Information obtained through telemetry was, \ntherefore, important to determine the capabilities of each delivery \nsystem.\n  New START, however, does away with these attribution rules and counts \nthe actual number of warheads deployed on missiles; no more guessing \nwhether a Russian missile is carrying one or eight warheads. With this \nchange, we do not need precise calculations of the capabilities of \nRussian missiles in order to tell whether Russia is complying with the \ntreaty's terms. So telemetry is not necessary to monitor compliance \nwith New START.\n  Nonetheless, as a gesture to transparency, the treaty allows for the \nexchange of telemetry between our two countries only, up to five times \na year if both sides agree to do so.\n  In fact, it should be pointed out that if the treaty included a \nbroader requirement to exchange telemetry, the United States might have \nto share information on interceptors for missile defense, which the \nDepartment of Defense has not agreed to do.\n  Third, there has been a concern raised about Russian ``breakout'' \ncapability, a fear that Russia may one day decide to secretly deploy \nmore warheads than the treaty would allow, or to secretly build a vast \nstockpile that it could quickly put into its deployed force. I do not \nsee this as a credible concern.\n  According to public figures, Russian strategic forces are already \nunder or close to the limits prescribed by New START, and they have \nbeen decreasing over the past decade, not just now but over the past \ndecade.\n  So the concern about a breakout is a concern that Russia would \nsuddenly decide it wants to reverse what has been a 10-year trend and \ndeploy more weapons than it currently believes are needed for its \nsecurity. They would also have to decide to do this secretly, with the \nsignificant risk of being caught. Because of the monitoring provisions, \nthe inspections, our national technical means and other ways we have to \ntrack Russian nuclear activities, Moscow would have a serious \ndisincentive to do that.\n  Moreover, instead of developing a breakout capability, Russia could \ndecide instead to simply withdraw from the treaty just as the United \nStates did when President Bush withdrew from the antiballistic treaty.\n  Finally, even in the event that Russia did violate the treaty and \npursue a breakout capability, I am confident that our nuclear \ncapabilities are more than sufficient to continue to deter Russia and \nto provide assurances to our allies. The bottom line is that the \nintelligence community can effectively monitor this treaty. If you vote \n``no'' on this treaty, there will be no monitoring.\n  As I noted earlier, a second question relevant to New START is \nwhether ratifying the treaty actually enhances our intelligence \ncollection and analysis. This is above and beyond the question of \nwhether the intelligence community will be able to fulfill its \nresponsibility to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty's terms.\n  While I am unable to go into the specifics, the clear answer to this \nquestion is, yes. The ability to conduct inspections, receive \nnotifications, enter into continuing discussions with the Russians over \nthe lifetime of the treaty, will provide us with information and \nunderstanding of Russian strategic forces that we simply will not have \nwithout the treaty. If you vote ``no,'' we will not have it.\n  The intelligence community will need to collect information about \nRussian nuclear weapons and intentions with or without a New START \ntreaty, just as it has since the beginning of the Cold War. But absent \nthe inspector's boots on the ground, the intelligence community will \nneed to rely on other methods.\n  A November 18 article in the Washington Times noted that:\n\n       In the absence of a U.S.-Russian arms control treaty, the \n     U.S. intelligence community is telling Congress it will need \n     to focus more spy satellites over Russia that could be used \n     to peer on other sites, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, to \n     support the military.\n\n  Put even more simply, the Nation's top intelligence official, \nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper, was recently asked \nabout ratification of the New START treaty. He responded:\n\n       I think the earlier, the sooner, the better. You know my \n     thing is: From an intelligence perspective only, are we \n     better off with it or without it? We're better off with it.\n\n  So Members should realize that if they vote ``no'' to ratify this \ntreaty and lose out on its monitoring provisions, that means we are \ngoing to have to spend much more, and it is going to be much more \ndifficult if not impossible to get certain information about Russian \nforces.\n  The final intelligence-related question on the New START treaty is, \nwhat impact ratification--or failure to ratify--will have on our other \nforeign policy objectives. I think this is important. We live in a \ndifferent world today where there are nonstate actors, where there are \ntwo nations, Iran and Korea, moving to develop a nuclear weapon, and it \nis very important to be able to achieve a working relationship with the \nlarge powers that give confidence to other nations to stand with us.\n  This question can be addressed largely through open source \nintelligence. There have been numerous news reports and press \nconferences in the recent weeks about the broader effects of ratifying \nNew START. Many supporters of the New START treaty have noted that \nratification is a key achievement and symbol of the ``reset'' in \nRussian relations that Presidents Obama and Medvedev have sought.\n  But beyond generalities of an improved relationship, the Senate's \nrejection of New START would not only undermine our understanding of \nRussia's strategic forces, it could derail or disrupt a host of other \nU.S. policies objectives.\n  In Russia today, there is a heated debate over whether Moscow is \nbetter served by domestic reforms and engagements with the West, or by \nhard-line behavior that rejects cooperation\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\nwith the West. Russians view New START as a signature product of the \nreforms. This is the signature product of Russian reform and the new \nRussian President. They view the fate of New START in this Senate as a \ncrucial test of the reformists' claim that Russia and America can work \ntogether. If we, the Senate, reject this treaty, we can confirm what \nRussian hard-liners have been saying all along, the United States is \nnot a viable partner.\n  Here are a few real-world examples. Russia has been allowing the \nUnited States and other members of the International Security \nAssistance Force in Afghanistan to transport material into Afghanistan \nover Russian territory. This has assisted our war efforts, especially \nin light of recent attacks against convoys crossing through Pakistan.\n  Russia has withheld delivery of the S-300 advanced air defense system \nto Iran and supported the United Nations Security Council sanctions \nagainst Tehran. Tehran wanted to buy this sophisticated air defense \nmissile defense system. Russia was going to sell it to them. Russia has \nwithheld that sale.\n  That is a major achievement. Also, Russia and NATO partners agreed at \nthe recent summit in Lisbon to a new missile defense system in Europe. \nThis is an agreement for a missile defense system which Russia has \nfought violently over the past decade.\n  At that same summit, Foreign Ministers from Denmark, Lithuania, \nNorway, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Hungary spoke out in support of the New \nSTART treaty. As neighbors to Russia and the former Soviet Union, they \npraised New START as necessary for the security of Europe but also as \nan entrance to engage in tactical nuclear weapons treaties which pose \nan even greater threat from state or nonstate use.\n  There is no quid pro quo here. Russia has not agreed to support \ninitiatives of the United States around the world if only the Senate \nwould ratify the New START treaty. But as every Senator knows, when we \nare trying to get things done, relationships matter.\n  The relationship between the United States and Russia has been \ncritical since we fought together in World War II and it will continue \nto be so. This is an unparalleled opportunity to enhance that \nrelationship and to say, by signature and by ratification of this \ntreaty, that, yes, the United States of America wants to work with \nRussia; yes, the United States and Russia have mutual goals; and, yes, \nwith respect to Iran and other trouble spots, the United States and \nRussia can, in fact, stand together.\n  Let me move on to the nonproliferation reasons to ratify this treaty. \nNew START demonstrates to the world that the two nations possessing \nmore than 90 percent of the planet's nuclear weapons are capable of \nworking together on arms reduction and nonproliferation. A ``no'' vote \nsays we are not capable of doing that.\n  I believe this will pave the way for more multilateral efforts to \nstop the spread of nuclear weapons as well as restrictions on tactical \nnuclear warheads that could fall into the hands of terrorist \norganizations.\n  Let us not forget the centerpiece of our nuclear nonproliferation \nregime, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It is based on a clear \nbargain. Those with nuclear weapons agree to eventually eliminate them, \nand those without nuclear weapons agree to never acquire them. With the \nsigning of the New START treaty, the Presidents of the United States \nand Russia are showing the other parties to the NPT that we are living \nup to our end of the bargain. Without New START, with a ``no'' vote on \nNew START, we do not do this.\n  This will strengthen the resolve of other nations to maintain their \ncommitments and uphold the credibility of the nuclear nonproliferation \nregime, to hold violators such as Iran and North Korea accountable and \nsubject to sanction.\n  In fact, we are already seeing the benefits of commitments made in \nthe New START agreement. The latest review conference of the NPT in May \nof this year ended with 189 parties recommitting themselves to the NPT \nafter the 2005 conference collapsed. On June 9, the United Nations \nSecurity Council passed a fourth sanctions resolution on Iran for its \nviolations of its commitments under the treaty with the support of \nChina and Russia.\n  Ratification of New START also opens the door to further arms control \nagreements, both to further arms reductions and to address tactical \nnuclear warheads--the smaller yield devices that are in some ways more \ndangerous than the strategic weapons with which we are dealing now.\n  Ratification moves us down the path to a world without nuclear \nweapons as envisioned by Presidents Obama and Reagan. For years, the \nidea of a nuclear-free world was ridiculed as a fantasy. This may now \nbe beginning to change. Don't turn it down. Republicans as well as \nDemocrats have come around to the idea that eventual nuclear \ndisarmament is not only desirable, but it is, in fact, doable and is \nconsistent with our national security interests. Former Secretaries of \nState George Shultz and Henry Kissinger have joined forces with former \nSenator Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry to make \nthis case.\n  In a January 4, 2007, op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, they called \nfor U.S. leadership in building a ``solid consensus for reversing \nreliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital contribution to \npreventing their proliferation into potentially dangerous hands, and \nultimately ending them as a threat to the world.''\n  We can now do our part to build that consensus and help ensure that \nwe never again see the destruction caused by nuclear weapons.\n  Once again, I return to these charts. I was 12 years old when I saw \nthese pictures. I was 12 years old when I realized what a 21-kiloton \nand a 15-kiloton bomb can do. Many of the bombs in the U.S. and Russian \narsenals are well in excess of 100 kilotons today. The number is \nclassified but, trust me, they are well in excess. We can destroy the \nplanet Earth with these weapons.\n  They are deployed and they are targeted. This treaty gives us the \nopportunity to reduce our arsenals--the U.S. and Russian stockpiles \nthat now make up 90 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world. It is \na big deal. To say no to this treaty is, in fact, to say we want to go \nback to the days of suspicion, of not working together, of the Cold War \nethos that we will succumb to the Russian hardliners and take this \nfirst major test of Russian reform and effectively trash it. We must \nnot do that.\n  Mr. President, with the months of debate over this Treaty, a small \nnumber of objections have been raised. I would like to address them \nnow.\n  First, some Senators infer that our nuclear weapons will become \nunreliable over time. They say they won't vote for this treaty unless \nit is linked to modernization of the arsenal.\n  Let's be clear. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \nEnergy have certified that our arsenal is safe and reliable in each of \nthe past 14 years. The head of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, Tom D'Agostino has assured me of the surety of the \nstockpile. Our top scientists have told us that these weapons will \nremain safe and reliable for decades to come.\n  In fact, an independent group of scientists known as the JASONs, who \nadvises the government on nuclear weapons, has reported that the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration is successfully ensuring the \narsenal's safety and reliability, through weapons ``lifetime extension \nprograms.''\n  Their September, 2009 report said that through such programs, \n``Lifetimes of today's nuclear warheads could be extended for decades, \nwith no anticipated loss in confidence . . . ''\n  And President Obama has made a significant commitment to ensuring \nthat we maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal by providing the \nnecessary resources for as long as we have nuclear weapons.\n  The President's fiscal 2011 budget asks for $11.2 billion for the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, a 13.4-percent increase over \nthe fiscal 2010 budget.\n  This includes $7 billion for weapons activities to maintain the \nsafety, security, and effectiveness of the arsenal, an increase of 10 \npercent, or $624 million from fiscal year 2010.\n  The President has submitted a plan calling for $80 billion over the \nnext 10 years. In November, he added an additional $4.1 billion over \nthe next 5 years alone to that enormous sum.\n  Modernization of the nuclear stockpile is surely a major priority, \nand I will fight to make sure these funds are\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\nappropriated. But these questions and concerns have now been addressed, \nand should not hold up this treaty.\n  Second, critics have claimed that New START will impede current and \nplanned missile defense efforts.\n  They point to language in the preamble of the treaty that notes the \ninter-relationship between offensive and defensive strategic arms.\n  They point to the unilateral statement issued by Russia upon signing \nthe treaty indicating that our missile defense plans could prompt \nMoscow to withdraw from the agreement.\n  And they note that the agreement prohibits both countries from \nconverting additional ICBM silos or submarine launch tubes for missile \ndefense interceptors.\n  These arguments are without merit.\n  First, the preamble language simply acknowledges what we all know: \nthat there is a relationship between strategic offensive and defensive \narms. It will not inhibit our missile defense efforts in any way.\n  Similar language can be found in the original START agreement, and it \nhas not inhibited our missile defense efforts over the past two \ndecades.\n  Second, the Russian unilateral statement is not a part of the \nagreement, and the United States is not bound by it in any way. In \nfact, the United States issued its own unilateral statement clearly \nstating that it will move forward with its missile defense plans.\n  Again, it should be noted that the Soviet Union issued a similar \nunilateral statement when START was signed and it had no impact on our \nmissile defense plans.\n  Finally, regarding the prohibition on converting additional ICBM \nsilos and SLBM launch tubes for missile defense interceptors: simply \nstated, our military has no plans to do so. This doesn't block the \nUnited States from anything it plans or wants to do.\n  It is actually cheaper to build new missile defense launchers than to \nconvert existing launch tubes or silos. And the treaty places no \nconstraints whatsoever on that construction.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the uniformed military leadership, and the \nhead of the Missile Defense Agency have testified this treaty will not \nharm missile defense.\n  These concerns have been raised, debated, and answered. It is time \nfor ratification.\n  Mr. President, the choice before us is not New START and the treaty \nthat some of my colleagues would prefer to have. Rather, the choice is \nbetween New START and no arms control treaty at all. To me, that choice \nis easy.\n  Either we make progress on reducing our nuclear arsenals and lay the \nfoundation for further reductions including on tactical nuclear weapons \nor we do not.\n  New START is in our Nation's national security. Every day that passes \nwithout ratification is another day without inspectors on the ground in \nRussia and a decrease in mutual transparency and trust.\n  The Senate has a long tradition of overwhelming support for treaties \nlike this one: the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty was \napproved 93-5; the 1991 START agreement which was approved 93-6; and \nthe 2002 Moscow Treaty which was approved 95-0.\n  There is nothing in this treaty to suggest that the vote on its \nratification should be any different. This should be an easy step for \nthe Senate to take, a step that should be taken in the spirit of \nprotecting our Nation and the world from the devastation of a nuclear \nwar.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10279-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10279-S10280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California on \nher remarks. As a member of Foreign Relations, I voted to bring the \ntreaty to the floor. However, there is another pressing matter I wish \nto discuss this evening.\n  The Senate now has before it the START treaty, but on a parallel \ntrack we have before us the question of financing the government \nthrough the end of the fiscal year next year. There are three \nalternatives available to us. One of them is a continuing resolution \nthrough the end of next year. One of them is a continuing resolution \nthat is modified with an Omnibus appropriations that is put on top of \nit which I understand is the plan. There is a third option which is the \nshort-term CR. It is that question I rise to address for a few moments.\n  Forty-three days ago, I ran for reelection to the Senate. For 2 \nyears, I traveled the State of Georgia campaigning for my reelection. \nThroughout that campaign, there were three guiding issues on which I \nfocused. One was tax policy. At a time of economic recession and high \nunemployment, the worst thing for us to do is to raise taxes of the \nAmerican people and, in particular, small business, which hires the \nmajority of the people. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, I campaigned on the fact that we didn't have a revenue problem \nnearly as much as we had a spending problem; that we needed to ask of \nourselves, as Senators, what every American family has had to ask of \nthemselves at home. They have sat around the kitchen table, looked at \nwhat their income was, looked at what it now is, looked at priorities \nand reprioritized. Times have been tough, and they have been difficult. \nThey did that because they had to.\n  They don't have the luxury of credit and borrowing as our government \nhas, which takes me to the third point I ran on in the campaign; that \nis, that unsustainable debt will make this democracy an unsustainable \ncountry.\n  One of the things I understand a little bit about from having been in \nthe real estate business is leverage. Leverage is a powerful thing to \nbe able to do things, but too much can destroy even the best of people \nor the best of ideas. We are rapidly approaching a time where we owe \nentirely too much money.\n  I love to tell the story about a lesson I learned in good politics. I \nknow the Presiding Officer has had the same kind of lessons he has \nlearned.\n  I was in Albany, GA, making a speech in November of 2009. I kept \ntalking about 1 trillion this and 1 trillion that. This farmer at the \nback of the room said: Senator, I only graduated from Dougherty County \nHigh School. I don't understand how much 1 trillion is. Can you \nexplain.\n  I oohed and aahed and I babbled. I finally said: Well, it is a lot. I \ncouldn't think of a way to quantify 1 trillion.\n  I got home that night. My wife took one look at me and said: What in \nthe world is wrong with you?\n  I said: I got stumped today.\n  She said: What was the question?\n  I said: The question was, How much is 1 trillion?\n  She said: What did you say?\n  I said: I said it is a lot.\n  She said: That was a bad answer.\n  I said: I know that, but I just couldn't think of anything.\n  She knows better than I a lot of times. She said: Why don't you just \nfigure out how many years have to go by for 1 trillion seconds to pass.\n  I said: That is a terrific idea.\n  So I pulled my calculator out and multiplied 60 seconds times 60 \nminutes to get the number of seconds in an hour.\n  I multiplied that 24 times for the number of seconds in 1 day. I \nmultiplied that times 365 for the number of seconds in 1 year. Do you \nknow how many years have to go by for 1 trillion seconds to pass? It is \n31,709 years. I put an asterisk by that because I didn't count leap \nyears and every fourth year has an extra day. I know that will throw \nthe number off a little bit.\n  We owe $13 trillion of those dollars, not just $1 trillion. It is an \nastronomical amount of money. It is an amount we must quantify and \nbegin to lower over time in two ways. One is expanding the prosperity \nof the American people, because as their prosperity goes up, revenues \ncome back to the government. First and most important, we have to get \nour arms around spending. I am deeply opposed to putting an Omnibus \nappropriations bill on the CR that is coming to the Senate and passing \n12 appropriations bills in a short-time debate without the transparency \nwe need.\n  I am not a Johnny-come-lately to this particular position. In the \nHouse of Representatives, when President Bush brought an omnibus budget \nto the House, I voted against it. I voted against it last fall on a \nnumber of occasions when we had Omnibus appropriations bills matched up \ncoming to the\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\nSenate floor under President Obama. It is a bad way to do business. By \nrolling all those things together, you don't have the scrutiny, the \noversight or the understanding of where the money is going, and the \ntendency to push spending beyond your limits actually becomes a \nreality. I am one who subscribes to the fact that we have to change the \nway we do business. We have to make hard decisions. We have to execute \nsome tough love. We have to have some shared sacrifice, and we to have \ndo it quickly.\n  Time has run out on the American Government and our American budget \nprocess without substantial reform, which is why it would be a tragic \nmistake for us sometime this week or this weekend to pass an Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  There is an underlying reason why I don't support that, and it is \nbecause I think a short-term CR makes a lot more sense. A short-term CR \nwill put the Senate in the position of debating the rest of next year's \nspending or this fiscal year's spending under the cloud of the debt \nceiling which is going to confront us in April or May or maybe as soon \nas the middle of March. If we pass a CR or an omnibus that goes beyond \nthat date to the end of next year, September 30, we have no leverage to \naddress the subject of raising the debt ceiling. It is time we stopped \nborrowing to spend more money we do not have.\n  I come at a time when I know the pending business is the START \ntreaty, which I will address on another occasion, but to point out why \nI am so deeply disappointed that we are rushing to judgment on an \nOmnibus appropriations spending bill at a time when the American people \nwant us focusing on spending, on the deficit, and on improving the way \nwe do business.\n  I will vote against an Omnibus appropriations bill. I will vote \nagainst cloture on the bill. I will support a short-term CR. That is \nthe best way for us to set up an occasion next year where we address \nour priorities in the right order and at the right time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10280-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10280-S10281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if you asked anyone in this body to \nsummarize Arlen Specter, I think the words that would come up most \noften would be he is a real fighter. Arlen Specter fought to defend our \nNation in Korea. He fought crime in the streets of Philadelphia as a \ndistrict attorney. He has fought cancer and won three times. And he has \nfought for Pennsylvania every day he has served with us here in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Senator Specter has witnessed three decades of progress in \nWashington. He is a man who has risen above party lines to demonstrate \nhis independence time after time. But his independence was not about \nhim; it was about the people of Pennsylvania, whom he has served with \nhonor and dignity for 30 years, even when cancer tried to keep him from \ndoing so.\n  I have known and served with Senator Specter for almost 30 years, and \nI have come to admire his service and dedication. We have not always \nagreed on how to solve the issues facing America, but he has always \nbeen willing to listen to me and any other Senator in the hopes of \nforging bipartisan agreements that would help the country. He is a very \nprincipled man, a man who does what he believes is right, even when few \nothers agree with him.\n  Senator Specter was raised in the Midwest by his mother and a Russian \nimmigrant father who came to the United States and later served his new \ncountry in World War I.\n  He first discovered Pennsylvania as an undergraduate student at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, where he earned a degree in international \nrelations. After serving 3 years in the Air Force during the Korean \nwar, he attended law school at Yale and established a successful law \npractice in what would become his home State, Pennsylvania.\n  Just as his father left his native land and served his new home as a \nmember of the United States military, Senator Specter left his home in \nKansas and served his adopted Commonwealth in a different way--first as \na district attorney in Philadelphia for 9 years, and then as a U.S. \nSenator for the last 30 years. And he did this with his tenacity. He \nlost a number of elections. He kept coming back, never giving up.\n  As a Member of Congress, he has been a stalwart for justice, health, \nand education. He has presided over several Supreme Court confirmation \nhearings, and played a major role in many more.\n  He has ensured that vital and potentially lifesaving research for \ncancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other diseases receives Federal \ndollars to pave the way for real breakthroughs.\n  One personal experience with Senator Specter--the so-called economic \nrecovery package, the stimulus. He was the key vote--one of the three \nkey votes. He was a Republican. He and the two Senators from Maine made \nit possible to pass that. But his passion in that legislation was the \nNational Institutes of Health. Part of the deal was that they had to \nget $10 billion. Money well spent. But it is something he believed in \nfervently, and we were able to do that.\n  He has also worked to cover children and seniors who struggle to get \naccess to health care they desperately need. He has done that as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, where he has worked to make \nmore education available to all students with the help of scholarships \nand student loans. Furthermore, his work with constituents of every \nstripe makes a difference every day.\n  Senator Specter is a throwback to a previous chapter in the history \nof the Senate--a time when moderates were the rule, not the exception.\n  When I came to Washington, Republicans such as Arlen Specter were \nevery place. That is not the case now. He is a rare breed and will \ntruly be missed.\n  I wish Senator Specter, his wife Joan, and their two sons and four \ngrandchildren the very best in the coming weeks, months, and years.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, Arkansas has given America a lot of which to be proud. \nFrom the late Senator William Fulbright, whom I did not know, to \nPresident Clinton, whom I do know, Arkansans have always produced proud \npublic servants.\n  I had the good fortune to serve with two of the finest Senators we \nhave ever had in this body, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor. I have said \npublicly--I will say again--the finest legislator I have ever served \nwith--I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings here--is David Pryor. \nDavid Pryor was a superb representative of Arkansas and the country.\n  Blanche Lincoln has continued that long tradition of Arkansans who \nhave come to Washington to shape our Nation. And Blanche has never \nforgotten from where she came.\n  Senator Lincoln has been a trailblazer during her time in the Senate. \nIn 1998, she became the youngest woman to ever be elected to the \nSenate. She was also the first woman elected to represent Arkansas in \nthe Senate since World War II. She was the first woman and first from \nArkansas to chair the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  A dozen years ago, Blanche was one of the youngest people in this \nbody. But from day one, she earned a reputation for being very wise, \nwise beyond her years. She has always understood we are here to serve, \nfirst and foremost, and she has never forgotten that.\n  Senator Lincoln once said:\n\n       I am not normally a betting person, but I say that putting \n     your money on the American people is about as close to a sure \n     bet as you are going to get.\n\n  Blanche Lincoln always bet on the American people, and particularly \nthe good people in Arkansas who first sent her to Washington to get \nthings done in 1992.\n  Senator Lincoln never sought the national spotlight. She has always \nbeen focused on making sure the people of Arkansas are represented \nfairly and forcefully. Her legislative accomplishments are too long to \nlist here today.\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\nHer impact will be felt long after she leaves this Chamber.\n  Perhaps her most important work has been her tireless efforts to \nprotect America's children. Senator Lincoln was the lead driving force, \nalong with the First Lady, on the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free \nKids Act to make sure our children have access to healthy meals.\n  She was a cofounder of the Senate Caucus on Missing, Exploited, and \nRunaway Children. She is also the current chair of the bipartisan \nSenate Hunger Caucus.\n  So I am honored to call Senator Lincoln a friend and a colleague, and \nI join my friends and colleagues in saluting her remarkable \naccomplishments. I will miss her. But we know her too well to think we \nhave heard the last from her.\n  It would not be appropriate not to say something about her wonderful \nfamily. Her doctor husband and her twins are remarkably good \nindividuals. Her husband is one of the nicest people I have ever met. \nHe has such a great presence about him. I have met him on the many \noccasions we have been able to get together as a Senate family, and he \ncertainly, to me, is part of that family.\n  But if I ever need to find Senator Lincoln, I will always know where \nto look. Because if there is an issue that has gone unnoticed or a \nperson who feels forgotten or a cause that is worth fighting, Blanche \nLincoln is probably not far behind and already on the case.\n  I wish Blanche and her family the very, very best. It has been a \npleasure to get to know Blanche Lincoln. I look forward to our future \nassociation.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mr. President, I have served with Russ Feingold in the Senate for 18 \nyears. There has never been a point where I did not know where he stood \nand what his core principles were.\n  Senator Russ Feingold came to the body in 1992 with one goal in mind: \nTo always represent the people of Wisconsin--not the special interests, \nnot the establishment. And he never compromised his principles, even \nthough sometimes it made it very difficult for me. But he is a man of \nprinciple, and that certainly is the truth.\n  When Russ first ran for the Senate in 1992, he famously wrote down \nfive core promises he would always keep if he were elected. He wrote \nthem on a piece of paper, and then he affixed this piece of paper and \nthese promises to his garage door at his home.\n  The promises were: To rely on Wisconsin citizens for most of his \ncontributions; to live in Middleton, WI, and send his children to \nschool there; to accept no pay raise during his time in office; to hold \nlistening sessions in each of the 72 Wisconsin counties each year of \nhis term in the Senate; and to make sure that the majority of his staff \nare from Wisconsin and with a Wisconsin background.\n  It should surprise no one that he held true to each of these promises \nand surpassed every expectation that any Badger could have had for this \ngood man who hails from Janesville, WI.\n  As quick as Senator Feingold has been to voice thoughtful opposition \nto anything that would go against his core principles, he never \nhesitated to reach across the aisle and work in good faith with every \nMember of this body.\n  Because of his bipartisan efforts, our system for financing political \ncampaigns is cleaner, more transparent, and more free of undue \ncorporate influence. It is too bad the Supreme Court has so weakened \nthe McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  In 2002, Senator Feingold spoke on the Senate floor during the \ncampaign finance debate, and he spoke remarkable words about why he \nfought so hard for that legislation. He said:\n\n       Nothing has bothered me more in my public career than the \n     thought that young people looking to the future might think \n     that it is necessary to be a multimillionaire or somehow have \n     access to the soft money system in order to participate, to \n     participate as a candidate as part of the American dream.\n\n  It is a simple statement, but it truly helps us understand why the \npeople of Wisconsin were always proud of their junior Senator--because \nhe spoke simple truths, fought passionately for the middle class, and \nwas able to always tap into what people were discussing over their \nkitchen tables every night.\n  Russ Feingold often stood in the minority to voice his positions that \nwere not necessarily popular. He was a strong advocate for equal rights \nfor same-sex couples even when it wasn't the popular thing to do, and \nhe opposed the 2003 Iraq war from the very beginning and has stayed \ntrue to his feelings on this issue since then. But that is the very \nessence of Russ Feingold. He stands on principle and his core beliefs \neven when it isn't convenient. He speaks the truth even when it ruffles \nfeathers. As someone who has been elected to public office for a long \ntime, it is very difficult to express to everyone within the sound of \nmy voice what a special type of person Russ Feingold is. He is the type \nof person who will remain firm and steadfast in all the ways he serves. \nHe is that special kind of person.\n\n  He has continued the tradition of some of the greatest Members of \nthis body. He combines the tenacity of Paul Wellstone with Ted \nKennedy's desire to always fight for the underdog. Russ Feingold has \netched himself into the fabric of this body and for many of us will \nalways be a part of our collective conscience. If we follow the example \nof Russ Feingold, we can rest easy at night knowing that when we stand \non principle, we never have to worry about second-guessing ourselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10281-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10281-S10282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL BRADLEY TURNER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work of an \nunsung hero, COL Bradley Turner of Booneville, KY. After a 37-year \ncareer serving in our Nation's military, Colonel Turner recently \nretired on September 24 of this year.\n  Over that nearly four-decade span, he served in the U.S. Marine \nCorps, the U.S. Army, and the Kentucky Army National Guard. Before \nearning the rank of colonel, Bradley was a sergeant in the Marines, a \ncaptain in the Army, and a lieutenant colonel while in the Guard. In \n1991, he was deployed in Operation Desert Storm with the 623rd Field \nArtillery from Glasgow, KY.\n  Throughout his career he earned many medals, including the Bronze \nStar Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal, among others. His \ndedication in serving our country has truly been a blessing to our \nCommonwealth and our Nation. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Colonel Bradley Turner for his service. The Booneville \nSentinel recently published a story about Colonel Turner and his \naccomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be \nprinted in the Record following these remarks.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n              [From the Booneville Sentinel, Dec. 8, 2010]\n\n          Colonel Bradley Turner Retires After 37-Year Career\n\n       Colonel Bradley Turner of Booneville has retired from the \n     U.S. Army Reserve after a 37-year career. He enlisted in the \n     U.S. Marine Corps in 1973 and served 4 years, attaining the \n     rank of sergeant. After leaving the Marine Corps he attended \n     Lees College and Morehead State University where he graduated \n     with a bachelor of science degree. While in college he \n     attended ROTC and was commissioned in 1981 in the U.S. Army. \n     He served 4 years on active duty, attaining the rank of \n     captain. After leaving active duty, he joined the Kentucky \n     Army National Guard. During his service in the Guard he \n     served as a battery commander, battalion and brigade \n     operations officer, and battalion and brigade executive \n     officer. In 1991 he was deployed to Operation Desert Storm \n     with the 623rd Field Artillery from Glasgow, Kentucky. He was \n     mobilized again in 2003 with the 138th Field Artillery \n     Brigade from Lexington, Kentucky.\n       While in the Guard he graduated from the U.S. Army War \n     College with a master's degree in strategic studies, and he \n     attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then transferred \n     to the 100th Training Division, U.S. Army Reserve where he \n     was the battalion commander of the 10th Battalion of the \n     100th Division in Lexington, and later a principal staff \n     officer at the division headquarters in Louisville. While at \n     the division headquarters he attained the rank of colonel.\n       His awards include the Bronze Star Medal, the Meritorious \n     Service Medal (2 awards), the Army Commendation Medal, the \n     Army Achievement Medal, the Military Outstanding Volunteer \n     Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the \n     Southwest Asia Campaign Medal, and the Liberation of Kuwait \n     Medal. He is married to Debra Combs Turner and they have \n     three children, Tangee Young of Ricetown, Brandi Thompson of \n     Vancleve, and Jeremy Turner of Booneville. They have 4 \n     grandchildren. They reside in east Booneville, and he is an \n     employee of the Lee Adjustment Center in Beattyville. Colonel \n     Turner retired effective September 24, 2010, at the 100th \n     Division in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10282-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10282-S10288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          PORTEOUS IMPEACHMENT\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint \nstatement by myself and Senator Hatch regarding the Porteous \nimpeachment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nJoint Statement of Senator Claire McCaskill, Chairman and Senator Orrin \nG. Hatch, Vice Chairman, U.S. Senate Impeachment Trial Committee on the \nArticles Against Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. of the Eastern District \n                              of Louisiana\n\n       Because the Senate deliberated in closed session, this \n     statement is the only opportunity during the formal \n     impeachment trial process to formally explain our votes and \n     to offer some views on certain issues for future \n     consideration. We independently evaluated the articles of \n     impeachment brought by the House of Representatives and the \n     motions field by Judge Porteous. Because we came to the same \n     conclusions and share many of the same views regarding the \n     articles and motions, we thought it most useful to file a \n     joint statement for the record.\n       The unique nature of impeachment, what it is and what it is \n     not, is an essential guiding principle for the impeachment \n     trial process. Impeachment is a legislative, not a judicial, \n     process for evaluating whether the conduct of certain federal \n     officials renders them unfit to continue in office. Our \n     impeachment precedents give some general definition to the \n     kind of conduct that may meet this standard. The Senate, for \n     example, convicted and removed U.S. District Judge Halsted \n     Ritter in 1933 for bringing his court into ``scandal and \n     disrepute.'' Similarly, during the impeachment trial of U.S. \n     District Judge Alcee Hastings, the President Pro Tempore \n     stated that the question is whether the defendant ``has \n     undermined confidence in the integrity and impartiality of \n     the judiciary and betrayed the trust of the people of the \n     United States.''\n       A consistent focus on the essential nature of impeachment \n     helps answer many of the questions that arise in the \n     impeachment trial process. For example, it sets impeachment \n     apart from the civil or criminal justice processes. Federal \n     officials may be impeached for conduct covered by the \n     criminal law for which they have been convicted, acquitted, \n     or not prosecuted, as well as for conduct that is not \n     criminal at all. Standards of proof that apply in those \n     contexts do not necessarily apply in an impeachment trial; in \n     fact, there exists no single or uniform standard of proof \n     that the Senate as a body must apply.\n       There also exists no rigid standard for the form that \n     articles of impeachment must take. The Constitution gives the \n     ``sole power of impeachment'' to the House of \n     Representatives, which necessarily includes substantial \n     authority to frame articles of impeachment. As it did in the \n     Hastings impeachment, this may result in articles that each \n     alleges an individual act. But other cases, like the present \n     one, may involve distinct sets or categories of conduct. Just \n     as impeachments arise out of different sets of facts, \n     impeachment articles may take more than one form. In every \n     case, however, the House must prove that the conduct alleged \n     in the articles that it frames and exhibits to the Senate \n     justifies removing a federal official from office.\n       In July, Judge Porteous filed with the Senate Impeachment \n     Trial Committee a motion to dismiss the articles of \n     impeachment as ``unconstitutionally aggregated.'' Before the \n     full Senate, he revised this motion to request that the \n     Senate take a preliminary vote on each allegation, a total by \n     his count of approximately 25, contained in the articles. The \n     Committee denied the original motion to dismiss and we joined \n     the Senate in unanimously defeating the revised motion. Even \n     though the articles of impeachment include multiple \n     allegations, we believe that each meets the standard \n     established by the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee during \n     the impeachment of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon and \n     adopted in the present case. Each article presents a coherent \n     and intelligible accusation that properly serves as the basis \n     for the impeachment trial. The need for proving individual \n     elements of an offense is appropriate for the criminal law \n     but, as mentioned earlier, impeachable offenses need not be \n     prohibited by the criminal law at all. Requiring a separate \n     vote on every allegation contained within an impeachment \n     article effectively re-drafts that article, with the result \n     that the Senate would vote on an impeachment matter that the \n     House did not adopt. Finally, Rule 23 of the Senate's \n     impeachment rules explicitly prohibits dividing articles of \n     impeachment for the purpose of voting ``at any time during \n     the trial.''\n       Unless absolutely necessary, impeachment trials should be \n     decided not on the basis of motions that make broad \n     statements or set broad precedents, but on the merits of \n     individual cases and articles of impeachment as the House \n     frames and exhibits them. In this case, each article of \n     impeachment alleged not a collection of unrelated acts but \n     coherent patterns or sets of conduct. The question for the \n     Senate was whether the conduct alleged in each article \n     justified removing Judge Porteous from the bench.\n       One somewhat novel issue raised in this case was whether a \n     federal official may be impeached on articles that allege \n     conduct occurring before he took federal office. The proper \n     focus on the essential nature of impeachment is again \n     important here. Judge Porteous argued for an absolute, \n     categorical rule that would preclude impeachment and removal \n     for any pre-federal conduct. That should not be the rule any \n     more than allowing impeachment for any pre-federal conduct \n     that is entirely unrelated to the federal office or the \n     individual's conduct in that office.\n       Pre-federal conduct should not itself ordinarily be the \n     primary basis for impeachment. Particularly egregious pre-\n     federal conduct that, by itself, would justify impeachment \n     and removal would likely have prevented an individual's \n     appointment in the first place. In most cases, therefore, the \n     question is whether a federal official's conduct since taking \n     office warrants removal from that office. That is the \n     question in the present case because none of the articles of \n     impeachment against Judge Porteous is based entirely on pre-\n     federal conduct.\n       The conduct alleged in Article I contained substantial pre-\n     federal and federal conduct. The House framed the article to \n     include a kickback scheme whereby the law firm of Jacob Amato \n     and Robert Creely would receive curatorship case appointments \n     from Judge Porteous in exchange for Creely and Amato paying \n     some of the fees back to Judge Porteous through the hands of \n     Creely. All parties agree that there was no explicit \n     agreement regarding these cases, but it is estimated that \n     approximately half of the fees went back to Judge Porteous. \n     The curatorship kickback scheme, by definition, could only \n     have occurred during Judge Porteous's time on the state \n     bench. When Judge Porteous, after his appointment to the \n     federal bench, could no longer assign curatorship cases to \n     Amato and Creely, the money stopped coming to Judge Porteous \n     from Amato and Creely.\n       This pre-federal conduct flowed into Judge Porteous's \n     federal service in two documented instances. First, Amato was \n     brought on as counsel for Liljeberg in a multi-million dollar \n     lawsuit named Lifemark v. Liljeberg. Judge Porteous was \n     scheduled to try the case without a jury approximately six \n     weeks from Amato's entry into the case. Counsel for Lifemark \n     filed a motion to recuse Judge Porteous because of the close \n     relationship between Amato and Judge Porteous. While opposing \n     counsel did not know of the curatorship kickback scheme, \n     Judge Porteous did. Judge Porteous clearly should have \n     recused himself or disclosed the scheme. Instead, he chose to \n     misrepresent his relationship with Amato during the recusal \n     hearing. Second, after trial in the Lifemark case, Judge \n     Porteous took the case under advisement. During this period, \n     Judge Porteous solicited money from Amato and received $2,000 \n     in cash, split equally by Amato and Creely from the firm's \n     account. There is no legitimate reason that a federal judge \n     would solicit and accept cash from a lawyer with a case in \n     front of him. We believe that soliciting and receiving a \n     $2,000 cash payment from a lawyer in a case currently before \n     him would alone have been enough to warrant Judge Porteous's \n     impeachment and removal. When viewed with the additional \n     factors, including the kickback scheme, the fact that the \n     lawyer stood to make hundreds of thousands of dollars through \n     a contingency fee if he won, that the judge misrepresented \n     his relationship during the recusal hearing, and that the \n     appeals court found that parts of the judge's decision in \n     favor of this lawyer's client were ``apparently constructed \n     out of whole cloth,'' Judge Porteous's conduct deserved the \n     unanimous rebuke of the United States Senate and removal from \n     the federal bench.\n       The allegations in Article II were very serious and no \n     doubt tainted Judge Porteous's ability to serve on the bench. \n     They involve Judge Porteous's relationship with a bail bonds \n     company and its owners, Louis and Lori Marcotte. This article \n     is, primarily though not exclusively, based upon Judge \n     Porteous's actions prior to his service on the federal bench. \n     The fact that this conduct is pre-federal is not alone a bar \n     to removal, though it is a significant factor to consider \n     when evaluating this and future articles.\n       We decided to vote against conviction on Article II not \n     only because most of the alleged conduct occurred before \n     Judge Porteous became a federal judge, but also because we \n     were not convinced that the conduct sufficiently proven by \n     the House rose to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor. \n     The Marcottes, who are felons convicted of manipulating the \n     Louisiana justice system for profit, are the only source of \n     evidence against Judge Porteous. Unlike the evidence \n     presented on Article I, there are limited receipts and \n     other documentary evidence supporting the claims made by \n     the Marcottes. We found that the timelines laid out by \n     Louis Marcotte, Lori Marcotte, Jeffrey Duhon, and Aubrey \n     Wallace to be inconsistent with one another and with the \n     documentary evidence that does exist regarding this \n     article.\n       The most prominent example of the inconsistent timelines \n     deals with the allegation that Judge Porteous improperly set \n     aside or expunged the convictions of Jeffrey Duhon and Aubrey \n     Wallace as a favor to Louis Marcotte. Louis Marcotte \n     testified that his corrupt relationship with Judge Porteous \n     did not really begin until after September 1993. The Duhon \n     conviction was expunged in 1992. In addition, Judge Porteous \n     only performed a ministerial step in expunging the \n     conviction. Another judge performed most of the \n     responsibilities in setting aside and\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\n     expunging both of Duhon's convictions. Louis Marcotte \n     testified that he hounded Judge Porteous for weeks about \n     setting aside the conviction of Aubrey Wallace. Marcotte \n     stated that Judge Porteous said he would set aside the \n     conviction but not until after he had secured his ``lifetime \n     appointment.'' As we discuss below in relation to Article IV, \n     this statement may reflect Judge Porteous's awareness that \n     certain decisions or actions might impede his confirmation to \n     the federal bench. The documentary evidence shows, however, \n     that Judge Porteous actually took some of the steps towards \n     removing the Wallace conviction, including a hearing on the \n     set aside motion, before his Senate Judiciary Committee \n     confirmation hearing In addition to the conflicting \n     timelines, the House failed sufficiently to establish that \n     Judge Porteous's actions with respect to the Duhon or Wallace \n     convictions were illegal or even improper under state law.\n       The House alleges that Judge Porteous was the Marcottes' \n     ``go-to'' judge and would sign almost any bond that they \n     requested. However, the House conceded that they could not \n     point to any individual bond that was set either too high, \n     too low, or improperly in any other way for the benefit of \n     the Marcottes. Additionally, Judge Porteous's former criminal \n     minute clerk suggests the opposite. The clerk indicated that \n     Judge Porteous or a member of his staff was diligent about \n     calling the jail for information about a prisoner for whom \n     Marcotte requested a bond be set, instead of just taking \n     Marcotte's word for it.\n       The remaining conduct alleged in Article II, that Judge \n     Porteous used his prestige as a federal judge to recruit new \n     state judges for the Marcottes to corrupt, was also not \n     sufficiently proven. The House was able to document six \n     lunches over a ten year period where Judge Porteous is \n     alleged to have helped the Marcottes recruit and train \n     judges. The only evidence that the House presented that Judge \n     Porteous was present at some of these lunches was the fact \n     that there was a reference to Absolut Vodka on the receipt \n     and Judge Porteous was known to drink Absolut Vodka. One of \n     the judges who was allegedly recruited by Judge Porteous, \n     Ronald Bodenheimer, stated that Judge Porteous never told him \n     what to do in relation to the Marcottes, nor did Bodenheimer \n     feel that Judge Porteous ever used his position as a federal \n     judge to pressure Bodenheimer to work with the Marcottes or \n     to issue any bonds. Judge Porteous simply told Bodenheimer \n     that he could trust the Marcottes when it came to providing \n     information related to a particular offender.\n       While we do not take the position that any of these \n     witnesses was lying, we believe that the House must clear a \n     high bar in proving the guilt of a federal official in an \n     impeachment trial. The House did not meet its burden with \n     respect to the conduct alleged in Article II.\n       Three features of Article III distinguish it from the \n     others. Article III is the only one alleging conduct that \n     occurred entirely after Judge Porteous was appointed to the \n     federal bench, that conduct was unrelated to either his \n     office or his official conduct in that office, and Article \n     III raises significant factual disputes. Unofficial conduct \n     may constitute the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that \n     justify impeachment and removal, but that conclusion must be \n     clearly established after giving Judge Porteous the benefit \n     of the doubt regarding remaining factual disputes.\n       There is no dispute that Judge Porteous filed his initial \n     bankruptcy petition under a false name, signing the \n     declaration ``under penalty of perjury that the information \n     provided in this petition is true and correct.'' If there was \n     any evidence that he intended to defraud creditors, this \n     alone might be sufficient for impeachment and removal from \n     office. But the evidence is to the contrary. He used the \n     false name only to avoid the embarrassment of his real name \n     appearing in the newspaper's listing of bankruptcies.\n       The false name existed for only 12 days, and he filed an \n     amended petition with correct information the day after the \n     false name appeared in the newspaper. The amended petition, \n     with the correct identifying information, was then sent to \n     creditors. The fact that so few creditors who were contacted \n     with the correct information actually filed claims suggests \n     that no one was prevented from filing a claim because a false \n     name was on file for less than two weeks. Ironically, if the \n     petition had been filed precisely the same way and the false \n     name had been entered inadvertently rather than deliberately, \n     it likely would not have been discovered and rectified until \n     later in the process.\n       There is also no dispute that Judge Porteous's bankruptcy \n     petition and accompanying schedules omitted certain assets \n     and debts and inaccurately valued others. This fact might be \n     more serious if Chapter 13 bankruptcies typically are filed \n     without such omissions or inaccuracies. Judge Porteous \n     introduced evidence, however, that the opposite is true, that \n     nearly 100 percent of Chapter 13 bankruptcies contain \n     multiple inaccuracies. For these problems to constitute \n     ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' there must be clear and \n     convincing evidence that the inaccuracies and omissions were \n     intentional or fraudulent. The record does not contain such \n     evidence. The House forcefully presented a theory that Judge \n     Porteous hid assets so that he would have more money to \n     gamble away, but a theory unsupported by real evidence is not \n     enough to remove a federal judge from office.\n       Several allegations in Article III raised the question \n     whether ``markers'' used to obtain chips in casinos are \n     checks or credit. This distinction is significant because \n     Judge Porteous was prohibited from obtaining more credit \n     while his bankruptcy plan was in effect. But there was far \n     from clear and convincing evidence settling that question.\n       On the one hand, gamblers fill out a credit application \n     before they obtain markers. On the other hand, casinos redeem \n     markers by presenting them at the gambler's bank. On the one \n     hand, markers are checks under Louisiana commercial law. On \n     the other hand, Judge Porteous's bankruptcy attorney and the \n     bankruptcy trustee in his case considered them to be credit. \n     Experts testifying before the Committee at the evidentiary \n     hearing strongly and directly disagreed. This dispute, as \n     important as the issue may be, was simply not settled with \n     sufficient clarity to direct a conclusion either way. As \n     such, Judge Porteous deserves the benefit of the doubt.\n       Finally, Judge Porteous not only successfully completed \n     what is considered a large Chapter 13 bankruptcy, even after \n     the bankruptcy judge nearly doubled his monthly payment, but \n     he actually paid more than the plan called for. That is not \n     the conduct of someone bent on bankruptcy fraud. The \n     question, then, is whether the allegations in Article III \n     that the evidence clearly showed to be intentional acts were \n     sufficient to remove Judge Porteous from the bench. We do not \n     believe so and, therefore, voted to acquit on that article.\n       We looked at Article IV with particular interest because \n     the conduct by Judge Porteous that it alleged directly \n     implicated the Senate and the judicial confirmation process. \n     One of us not only serves on the Judiciary Committee, but was \n     its Ranking Member when Judge Porteous was confirmed in 1994.\n       In FBI interviews, as well as in questionnaires before and \n     after his nomination, Judge Porteous was asked whether \n     anything in his personal life could be used by someone else \n     to intimidate or influence him, could be publicly \n     embarrassing to him or the President, or could affect his \n     nomination. He signed both questionnaires, which included the \n     statement that the information provided was ``true and \n     accurate.'' Those questions are still asked and still appear \n     in those questionnaires as part of the confirmation process \n     today. Judge Porteous argues that his negative answers to \n     these questions were true because he did not believe that \n     anything he had done, including in the relationships \n     described in Article I and II, to be improper or \n     embarrassing. But Judge Porteous was never asked whether he \n     personally thought anything in his personal life was improper \n     or embarrassing. There would be little value in asking such a \n     question. Judge Porteous was asked whether anything in his \n     personal life could be viewed by others, or by the public, as \n     embarrassing or, more importantly, affect his nomination. Not \n     only is that important information for the confirmation \n     process, but it is information that in most cases can come \n     only from the candidate or nominee.\n       What Judge Porteous may have lacked in personal scruples, \n     he possessed in political instincts about matters that could \n     be confirmation obstacles. Louis Marcotte testified, for \n     example, that when he urged Judge Porteous to clear the \n     criminal record of a Marcotte employee, Judge Porteous said \n     he would do so only after the Senate confirmed his \n     nomination. He did not want it coming out in the newspaper \n     and said that he would not let anything stand in the way of \n     his lifetime appointment. Judge Porteous waited until after \n     his confirmation, but before he took the oath of office, to \n     set aside one of those criminal convictions.\n       The propriety of setting aside that conviction is not the \n     issue. This example simply shows Judge Porteous' awareness \n     that perceptions of his actions might affect his appointment \n     to the federal bench. His instinct, it turns out, was \n     accurate because the New Orleans newspaper reported that \n     Judge Porteous had unlawfully set aside the conviction and \n     the Justice Department would later conclude that his decision \n     was contrary to law. Or consider another example. Judge \n     Porteous' financially interactive relationship with his \n     friends Jacob Amato and Bob Creely may not have bothered him, \n     but it certainly bothered them. While on the state court \n     bench, Judge Porteous began assigning unsolicited curatorship \n     cases to Creely after Creely refused to give him money. \n     Having provided a new source of revenue, Judge Porteous began \n     requesting, and Creely and Amato began providing, a portion \n     of the fees generated by those cases. Amato believed that \n     this arrangement was unethical, a kind of kickback, and \n     warned Creely that it was going to turn out badly. Amato did \n     not disclose it at the recusal hearing in the Lifemark case \n     because he believed he might be disbarred and that Judge \n     Porteous might be removed from the bench. At our evidentiary \n     hearing, the House's judicial ethics expert opined that this \n     conduct violated the ABA model code of judicial conduct, and \n     even Judge Porteous' own expert suggested that it was \n     ethically troubling.\n       If his own best friend thought disclosing this financial \n     relationship might get Judge Porteous removed from the bench, \n     it is simply not credible that Judge Porteous believed \n     disclosure of that relationship could not affect his \n     appointment to the bench. Instead, he apparently answered \n     those questions in the negative for the same reason that he \n     put off setting aside that criminal\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n     conviction, to avoid any obstacles to a lifetime appointment. \n     This dishonest participation in the confirmation process \n     undermined the integrity of that process and possibly \n     deprived the Senate of information that would have mattered \n     in considering his nomination. His negative answers to \n     questions he was actually asked were material and \n     demonstrably false. For that reason, we voted to convict on \n     Article IV.\n       The Senate was correct in removing Judge Porteous from the \n     bench. He argued that it was unclear that his actions \n     violated the public trust and warranted removal. The message \n     from the Senate is clear that the privilege of serving the \n     American people comes with a responsibility to be fair, \n     honest, and to behave in a manner that inspires confidence in \n     the courts and our system of justice.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for just the eighth time in this country's \nhistory, the Senate has voted to impeach and remove a Federal judge \nfrom the bench. Impeachment is a serious, constitutional act intended \nnot as a form of punishment, but rather as means of protecting the \nintegrity of our system of government. This is particularly true when \nwe consider the impeachment of members of the judiciary. Public \nconfidence in our courts is fundamental to the functioning of our \ndemocracy. When a judge engages in conduct that grossly violates the \npublic trust, he or she not only becomes incapable of fulfilling the \nresponsibilities of the office, but also brings disrepute to the entire \njudicial system.\n  Prior to the Senate's vote on December 8, I voted three times to \nconvict a Federal judge. In each instance, I carefully considered the \nfacts in the case, as well as my constitutional obligations and the \nprecedent being set for future generations. I have no doubt that just \nas we looked back to past impeachments to guide our actions in this \nproceeding, we now leave new precedent that others will look to for \nguidance and wisdom. For this reason, I wanted to elaborate on the \nconstitutional issues presented during this impeachment trial and \nexplain my decision to vote to convict Judge Porteous on all four \nArticles of Impeachment.\n  First, I should note that the impeachment trial against Mr. Porteous \nwas bipartisan, and, I believe, unquestionably fair. The Senate \nImpeachment Trial Committee held 5 days of evidentiary hearings, with \ntestimony received from 26 fact and expert witnesses. The record before \nthe Senate is well developed, and most of the facts underlying the \nallegations against Mr. Porteous are uncontested. These facts \ndemonstrate that Mr. Porteous engaged in conduct that compromised the \nadministration of justice, brought disrepute to his office, and \nrequired his removal from the bench.\n  The first article of impeachment alleges that as a Federal judge, Mr. \nPorteous failed to recuse himself in the bench trial of Lifemark \nHospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, despite having \npreviously engaged in a corrupt scheme with one of the attorneys before \nthe court. The House managers established that as a State judge, Mr. \nPorteous assigned curatorship cases to two attorneys, one of whom was \nbefore him in the Liljeberg case, and had a portion of the fees, \ntotaling approximately $20,000, funneled back to him. Not only did Mr. \nPorteous fail to disclose these facts or recuse himself from the case, \nhe proceeded to solicit and accept $2,000 cash from those attorneys \nwhile the Liljeberg case was still under his advisement.\n  Out of concern for the public's confidence in our court system, I \nhave frequently expressed disappointment about the lack of recusals by \njudges with conflicts of interest. There should be no doubt that \nrecusals go to the heart of a judge's impartiality. In gross violation \nof his judicial ethics, Mr. Porteous engaged in a corrupt scheme with \nattorneys, solicited and accepted money from attorneys with pending \nmatters before his court, and deprived the public and litigants of his \nhonest services by failing to recuse himself.\n  The defense argued that article I should be dismissed because of the \nSupreme Court's recent ruling in Skilling. I am familiar with the \nCourt's ruling, and have authored legislation in response to it. The \nSupreme Court's holding was about a specific criminal statute, not \njudicial conduct or impeachment standards. No reasonable judge would \nbelieve that soliciting and accepting cash payments from an attorney \nwith a pending case would be allowable or would not be an obvious \nground for recusal.\n  The notion that was raised by the defense that corrupt judges could \nnot be impeached ignores the purpose of impeachment as it relates to \npublic confidence in our justice system. The Constitution did not list \na specific set of conduct that would result in impeachment. Instead, \nSenators should determine for themselves what conduct renders one unfit \nto hold public office. We must consider the type of duties that the \nimpeached official is called upon to perform and whether the conduct \nengaged in impairs the official's ability to perform those duties. This \nanalysis differs depending on the office and responsibilities of the \nofficial before us.\n  Article II alleges that as a State court judge, Mr. Porteous took \nnumerous things of value and accepted personal services from a bail \nbondsman, while setting favorable bonds for his company. As a Federal \njudge, Mr. Porteous continued to receive things of value in exchange \nfor using ``the power and prestige of his office'' to help these \nbondsmen form corrupt relationships with State court judges. The \nevidence showed a pattern before and after his Federal confirmation of \ncapitalizing on his position of power to receive improper gifts. \nMoreover, as Professor Michael Gerhardt, who served as Special Counsel \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee during the last two Supreme Court \nconfirmations, testified before the House Task Force on Judicial \nImpeachment, the Constitution does not state that improper conduct must \nbe committed during the tenure of the Federal office; rather, ``[t]he \ncritical questions are whether Judge Porteous committed such misconduct \nand whether such misconduct demonstrates the lack of integrity and \njudgment that are required in order for him to continue to function [as \na Federal judge].'' I agree with Professor Gerhardt on this fundamental \nquestion.\n  Certainly if the Senate learned after confirmation that a judge \nkilled someone before he or she was confirmed, the Senate should not be \nprevented from later removing that judge. Similarly, the Senate should \nnot be foreclosed from removing a judge for serious misconduct not \nrevealed during the confirmation process that goes to the role of the \njudge. A lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary does not entitle \nthose unfit to serve to a lifetime of Federal salary and benefits. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I reject any notion of impeachment \nimmunity if misconduct was hidden, or otherwise went undiscovered \nduring the confirmation process, and it is relevant to a judge's \nability to serve as an impartial arbiter.\n  With regard to the third article of impeachment, it is clear that Mr. \nPorteous knowingly and intentionally made material false statements and \nrepresentations--including signing and filing under the name ``G.T. \nOrteous''--under penalty of perjury on his personal bankruptcy court \nfiling. It is hard to imagine stronger evidence that this judge \nbelieved the law did not apply to him. A judge who lies under oath in \ncourt filings is unable to continue in an office that requires him to \nadminister oaths and sit in judgment. Mr. Porteous's actions in his \nbankruptcy proceedings demonstrate a flagrant disregard for the courts \nas an institution, making him unfit to serve as a respected member of \nthe judiciary.\n  The last article of impeachment against Mr. Porteous relates to his \nactions before the Senate Judiciary Committee. As chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I take the word of judicial nominees that \ncome before our committee very seriously. The process for aiding the \nSenate in considering these lifetime appointments relies on being able \nto trust and evaluate the information provided to us by nominees, so it \nrequires their utmost candor.\n  Mr. Porteous knowingly made material false statements about his past \nto the Senate by responding ``no'' to questions on his Senate Judiciary \nCommittee questionnaire, and to the FBI in connection with his \nbackground review, in order to obtain office. His defense to article IV \nis that his conduct was ``business as usual'' in New Orleans and, \ntherefore, he believed his responses to be true. Whether he made false \nstatements is not purely a subjective inquiry; and most certainly not \nwhere his ``belief'' in the truth of his\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\nstatements is in direct conflict with the factual knowledge on which it \nis based. I am convinced that Mr. Porteous's responses on the Senate \nquestionnaire were material because had his solicitation and acceptance \nof cash and gifts from parties with matters before him been known to \nthe Senate, he would not have been confirmed.\n  During the impeachment trial proceedings, I asked both the House \nmanagers and Mr. Porteous's defense attorneys the following question: \n``The Senate Judiciary Committee requires a sworn statement as part of \na detailed questionnaire by a nominee. Until this questionnaire is \nfiled, neither the Judiciary Committee nor the Senate votes to advise \nand consent to the nomination. Would not perjury on that questionnaire \nduring the confirmation process be an impeachable offense?'' Both sides \nunequivocally answered that perjury on the Senate questionnaire and \nduring the confirmation process would be an impeachable offense.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am particularly \noffended by Mr. Porteous's intentional dishonesty and disrespect for \nthe office to which he was confirmed, and for the entire confirmation \nprocess. When a judicial nominee testifies before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, they must be completely forthright and honor the promises or \nstatements they make to us. Once confirmed, Federal judges have \nlifetime appointments. Impeachment is a drastic measure, but one we \nmust take when a nominee conceals serious wrongdoing.\n  The House managers presented uncontested facts that Mr. Porteous \nengaged in conduct that violated the public trust and is now unfit to \nbe a district court judge, or hold any other public office. Both sides \nwere well represented in this proceeding, and I thank them for their \nadvocacy and professionalism.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, as a member of the \nImpeachment Trial Committee, I had the privilege of carrying out a \nconstitutional duty that fortunately is a rare occurrence. I commend \nthe work of Chair McCaskill and Vice-Chair Hatch, as well as the staff \nof the committee, Senate legal counsel, and CRS. They have done an \nexcellent job of making a complex and time-consuming process as clear \nand straightforward as possible.\n  I began the impeachment process with the belief that my legal \nbackground would help guide my judgment as to whether or not Judge \nPorteous is guilty. As the attorney general of New Mexico for 8 years \nand a former assistant U.S. attorney, I saw the impeachment process as \nclosely analogous to a criminal trial. It turns out, however, that the \ntwo are very different in many key aspects.\n  Unlike a criminal trial, our role is not to punish the guilty, but is \ninstead to protect the integrity of the judiciary. The U.S. Judicial \nsystem is the greatest in the world, but it can only remain so as long \nas the integrity and impartiality of our judges is never in doubt. \nJudge Porteous's actions were so contrary to everything we demand of \nour judges that I have no hesitation in voting to convict him on each \narticle.\n  One of the primary aspects that make an impeachment trial unique from \na criminal trial is the standard of proof. I began the impeachment \nprocess believing that the House must prove its case beyond a \nreasonable doubt in order for a conviction. This is not the case.\n  Obviously Judge Porteous would like all of us to use the standard of \n``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' while the House managers would prefer a \n``preponderance of the evidence standard.'' Some scholars have urged a \nmiddle ground, suggesting that the appropriate standard of proof should \nbe ``clear and convincing evidence.'' But the fact is that we each have \nto make our own decision.\n  I believe that the ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' standard is too \nhigh. The Senate does not have the authority to take away Judge \nPorteous's liberty but only the authority to remove him from a position \nof public trust. I also believe that whether you use a clear and \nconvincing evidence standard or a preponderance of the evidence \nstandard, the House managers have met their burden.\n  Another important question each of us must decide is what constitutes \nan impeachable offense. Judge Porteous's attorneys argue that much of \nhis conduct is not impeachable because it does not meet the \nconstitutional standard of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' They also \nargue that most of his conduct occurred prior to his confirmation to \nthe Federal bench or was not related to his duties as a Federal judge, \nand therefore not grounds for impeachment. I do not believe any of \nthese arguments are persuasive.\n  I initially thought of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' in the \ncontext of a criminal trial. My prosecutor experience made me ask what \nelements had to be proven in order to convict on each article. But now \nI understand that an impeachment is so fundamentally different than a \ncriminal trial that such comparisons do not work.\n  Alexander Hamilton wrote that impeachable offenses ``proceed from . . \n. the abuse or violation of some public trust'' and ``relate chiefly to \ninjuries done immediately to the society itself.'' The Framers also did \nnot use the term ``misdemeanor'' to mean a minor crime, as it is used \ntoday. At the time of the Constitution's drafting, a misdemeanor \nreferred to the demeanor or behavior of a public official.\n  Judge Porteous's counsel made several references to the fact that the \njudge was not criminally charged for his actions. But this is not a \nrelevant consideration. The 1989 report on the impeachment of U.S. \nDistrict Judge Walter Nixon provides us with guidance as to what \nconstitutes an impeachable offense. It states:\n\n       The House and Senate have both interpreted the phrase other \n     high Crimes and Misdemeanors' broadly, finding that \n     impeachable offenses need not be limited to criminal conduct. \n     Congress has repeatedly defined [the phrase] to be serious \n     violations of the public trust, not necessarily indictable \n     offenses under the criminal law.\n       Thus, the question of what conduct by a Federal judge \n     constitutes an impeachable offense has evolved to the \n     position where the focus is now on public confidence in the \n     integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. When a judge's \n     conduct calls into question his or her integrity or \n     impartiality, Congress must consider whether impeachment and \n     removal of the judge from office is necessary to protect the \n     integrity of the judicial branch and uphold the public trust.\n\n  We are also faced with deciding whether impeachable offenses are \nlimited to acts occurring after an individual became a Federal \nofficial. According to the Congressional Research Service, ``it does \nnot appear that any President, Vice President, or other civil officer \nof the United States has been impeached by the House solely on the \nbasis of conduct occurring before he began his tenure in the office \nheld at the time of the impeachment investigation, although the House \nhas, on occasion, investigated such allegations.''\n  I do not see how we can restrict our authority to impeach and convict \na Federal official to conduct that only occurred after he or she took \noffice. To do so would lead to a perverse result, one in which, as the \nHouse managers argue, ``makes the position of federal judge a lifetime \nsafe harbor for someone who is able to hide his misdeeds and defraud \nthe Senate into confirming him.''\n  In considering whether pre-Federal conduct should be considered as a \nbasis for impeachment, Professor Michael Gerhardt testified before the \nHouse that, ``[t]he critical questions are whether Judge Porteous \ncommitted such misconduct and whether such misconduct demonstrates the \nlack of integrity and judgment that are required in order for him to \ncontinue to function'' as a Federal judge.\n  I believe this is an appropriate standard, and I believe Judge \nPorteous's conduct as a State court judge was incompatible with the \ntrust we place in our Federal judges. Had his pre-Federal conduct been \nserious, but outside of the scope of his role as a State judge, I might \nhave been more hesitant to consider it as a basis for impeachment. In \nthis case, however, his corrupt conduct was directly connected to his \nduties as a judge. In arguing against considering pre-Federal conduct, \nJudge Porteous is essentially telling the Senate that although he was a \ncorrupt State court judge, that conduct should not be considered in \ndetermining his fitness to continue as a Federal judge. I do not find \nthis argument the least bit persuasive.\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n  A final question is whether impeachable offenses should be limited to \nofficial acts that are directly related to his duties as a judge. Just \nas I don't believe pre-Federal conduct must be excluded as a basis for \nimpeachment, I do not feel that nonofficial conduct must be excluded.\n  In fact, Judge Porteous's own attorney, Jonathan Turley, wrote in a \nlaw review article that ``Congress repeatedly rejected the view that \nimpeachable conduct was limited to official acts or abuses of \nauthority. Impeachable conduct often included acts that were \nincompatible with continuing to hold an office of authority, including \ncrimes or misconduct outside the official realm.''\n  I believe the question to ask when considering nonofficial acts is \nthe same as that for pre-Federal acts does the misconduct demonstrate a \nlack of integrity and judgment that are required in order for him to \ncontinue to function as a Federal judge? Once again, I found Judge \nPorteous's nonofficial conduct to reach the level of an impeachable \noffense. We expect a Federal judge to have the utmost respect for the \nrule of law, but Judge Porteous knowingly filed for bankruptcy under a \nfalse name, an act that he knew was illegal. His attorneys argue that \nthis act was insignificant he filed amended forms a few weeks later and \nnone of his creditors were harmed. But this argument misses the point \nthat a Federal judge had so little respect for the legal process that \nhe would commit perjury in order to avoid embarrassment. Such actions \nmake him unfit for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  For the reasons discussed above, I voted guilty on each of the four \nArticles of Impeachment.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it has been a privilege to serve as a \nmember of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee over the past year. We \nhave been part of a rare event in the history of this Congress and our \ncountry and it has been fascinating to watch this process unfold. I \nwant to join my fellow committee members in thanking Chairman McCaskill \nand Vice-Chairman Hatch for leading a fair, effective, and efficient \noperation. They provided remarkably decisive leadership on complex \nlegal issues while also respecting the rights and the interests of both \nparties to this matter.\n  I am proud of the report our bipartisan committee produced, and I \nwould like to once again thank and recognize the trial committee's \nstaff for their hard work. Their efforts were an indispensable part of \nthis unique and historic undertaking.\n  Judging Articles of Impeachment drawn up by the House of \nRepresentatives is one of the more solemn duties given to Senators by \nour Constitution. After spending more than a week with my fellow \ncommittee members hearing the evidence against Judge Thomas Porteous, \nand after reviewing the parties' final submissions, I concluded that he \nshould be convicted on all four articles and removed from office. I \nwould like to explain the principles I used to reach this conclusion \nand touch on some of the evidence that supported conviction.\n  There has been much discussion by the parties about the standard of \nproof to be employed in an impeachment proceeding, and what constitutes \nan impeachable offense. The Constitution provides us with limited \nguidance on these issues. Ultimately, in keeping with precedent \nestablished by this body in the past, each Senator must individually \ndecide what conduct is impeachment-worthy and how much proof is \nnecessary to reach that conclusion.\n  In my opinion, the question before us is whether Judge Porteous's \nconduct calls his integrity and impartiality into question and whether \nwe must remove him from office to protect the reputation of the \njudiciary and preserve the public's trust in it. Our courts are the \nplaces where citizens expect to receive a fair and legitimate \nresolution of their disputes. This is a cornerstone of civil society. \nAny conduct by a judge--whether on the job or off that causes people to \nseriously question his honesty and basic willingness to dispense \njustice fairly is a violation of the public trust.\n  Unfortunately, I think any reasonable citizen walking into Judge \nPorteous's courtroom would have ample reason to question his commitment \nto doing justice. This is a judge who used his judicial offices at both \nthe State and Federal levels to routinely obtain personal perks, \nincluding meals, alcohol, a bachelor party for his son, trips, and \neventually cash kickbacks totaling some $20,000.\n  Any reasonable citizen would also doubt this judge's ability to be \nimpartial. The House presented substantial evidence related to a \nmultimillion dollar piece of litigation in which Judge Porteous had an \nobvious conflict of interest but failed to recuse himself. He took \nthousands of dollars in cash gifts from a lawyer friend representing a \nparty to the case during the course of his deliberations. He then \nturned around and issued a decision favoring his friend's client. Judge \nPorteous's ruling was overturned in an absolutely scathing opinion by \nthe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which called his decision \n``inexplicable'' and ``close to being nonsensical,'' among other \nrebukes.\n  While on the State bench, the Judge maintained close relationships \nwith bail bondsmen working for defendants in his courtroom. The \nevidence showed that he continuously set favorable bail levels that \nwhile perhaps within the bounds of his legal discretion had been \nsuggested by the bondsmen to maximize their profits. For this, the \njudge enjoyed complimentary steak lunches, midday martinis, at least \none trip to Las Vegas, as well as home and car repairs.\n  I was totally unpersuaded by the defense team's argument that Judge \nPorteous's ``pre-Federal'' conduct should be outside the scope of our \ndeliberation. I do not believe the act of being confirmed to a Federal \njudgeship by the Senate erases or excuses an individual's conduct up to \nthe point of confirmation.\n  Had the Senate known in 1994 what we know now about Porteous's \nconduct as a State judge, it would have undoubtedly disqualified him \nfrom becoming a Federal judge. No judge at any level should accept \ngifts that would even appear to be designed to affect his judgment or \ninfluence his decisions. Yet there is no doubt Judge Porteous did just \nthat.\n  It is unfortunate that those charged with investigating Judge \nPorteous's fitness for office in 1994 did not raise more flags about \nhis history. This does not eliminate our duty to act. I see no reason \nnot to remove him from office today when these events still bear on his \nintegrity and impartiality. Plain and simple, the judge perjured \nhimself before this body during his confirmation by representing that \nnothing in his history would cast doubt on his fitness to hold office.\n  Finally, Judge Porteous also perjured himself during his own personal \nbankruptcy proceedings. The House presented evidence that he failed to \ndisclose gambling debts during his bankruptcy, failed to disclose a \nnumber of assets, and made other willful misrepresentations in his \nfilings like using a false name in his initial petition. I understand \nthat this conduct may not have been a direct abuse of the judge's \noffice, but his deception during this period reflected a lack of \nrespect for the law and an unwillingness to follow it. A sitting \nFederal judge should have erred on the side of overdisclosure. Instead, \nI believe the House has shown that Judge Porteous repeatedly committed \nperjury.\n  Serving as a judge is a privilege, and it demands strict adherence to \nthe highest ethical standards. The evidence in this case, taken as a \nwhole, showed that Judge Porteous failed this test routinely over the \ncourse of some 15 years. The House presented ample credible evidence to \nsupport the charges in each of the articles, and I felt compelled to \nvote to convict on all four to protect the integrity of the judiciary \nand its credibility in the eyes of the public.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to first commend my colleagues on the \nSenate Impeachment Trial Committee for the outstanding work they have \ndone to receive and report the evidence in this case to the full \nSenate. Led by Senators McCaskill and Hatch, the committee's dedication \nto impartiality and integrity is something of which we can all be \nproud.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate ``the sole power to try all \nimpeachments.'' The Senate acts as the factfinder in impeachment \nproceedings and determines, as individuals and as a body, whether the \nrespondent is guilty\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\nof ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' so as to require removal from \noffice.\n  After carefully reviewing the evidence, I voted to convict Judge \nPorteous on each Article of Impeachment. On articles I and II, the \nevidence showed that Judge Porteous used his judicial office for \nfinancial gain by failing to recuse himself in a nonjury civil case and \nengaging in corrupt relationships with Jacob Amato, Robert Creely, and \nLouis Marcotte. The House managers proved by clear and convincing \nevidence that Judge Porteous deprived litigants of a fair trial and \nundermined his sworn judicial duties.\n  On articles III and IV, I found Judge Porteous guilty because of his \ndishonesty and gross misconduct. The facts were clear. He filed his \nbankruptcy petition under a false name, concealed assets and debt to \nfinance his gambling habit and lied to the FBI to obtain Senate \nconfirmation of his judicial appointment.\n  Finally, I voted against Judge Porteous's motion to disaggregate the \narticles. I did so because each article contained a series of events \nthat sufficiently related to the charged allegation. The case against \nJudge Porteous can be distinguished from those of Judge Nixon and \nPresident Clinton. Here, the House presented specific, indivisible \narticles of misconduct which provided a clear record for us to \nevaluate.\n  As with each judicial impeachment, the Senate is faced with difficult \nand novel issues. However, the Constitution makes clear that \nimpeachment is a remedial provision that cures our institutions when \nofficials violate the public's trust and confidence. I do not come to \nmy decision lightly, but removal and disqualification of Judge Porteous \nis necessary. As required by the Constitution, Judge Porteous no longer \nenjoys the privilege of sitting on the Federal bench or holding any \nFederal position ``of honor, trust or profit.'' I thank and appreciate \nmy colleagues for their commitment and collegiality during this \nprocess.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nimpeachment of Judge Thomas Porteous and specifically to offer my \nthoughts on the Articles of Impeachment.\n  First, let me say as a general matter that when we as a body consider \nthe nomination of a Federal judge, we do so with the hope and \nexpectation that the individual being considered will uphold the law \nand treat people appearing in his or her courtrooms with fairness and \nimpartiality. The lengthy record presented by the House managers \ndemonstrated that Judge Porteous has had an ongoing pattern of conduct \nthat does not comport with the trust that the Senate placed in him when \nit confirmed Judge Porteous as a U.S. district court judge in 1999.\n  The managers also presented sufficient evidence for me to vote in \nfavor of each of the Articles of Impeachment. Because of the lengthy, \nongoing, and egregious nature of the judge's conduct, I also voted to \ndisqualify Judge Porteous from any future Federal office.\n  The most compelling evidence presented for each article was as \nfollows:\n  Article I--The record demonstrated that Judge Porteous, while \npresiding as a U.S. District Judge, denied a motion to recuse himself \nin the case of Lifemark Hospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg \nEnterprises, despite the fact that he had a corrupt financial \nrelationship with the law firm representing Liljeberg Enterprises. The \nrecord also demonstrated that Judge Porteous engaged in corrupt conduct \nafter the Lifemark v. Liljeberg bench trial, and while he had the case \nunder advisement. Judge Porteous solicited and accepted things of value \nfrom both Mr. Amato and his law partner, Mr. Creely, including a \npayment of thousands of dollars in cash, then ruled in favor of the law \nfirm's client, Liljeberg Enterprises.\n  Article II--The record demonstrated that while Judge Porteous was a \nU.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana, he engaged \nin a corrupt relationship with bail bondsman Louis M. Marcotte, II and \nhis sister, Lori Marcotte. The record also demonstrated that, as part \nof this corrupt relationship, Judge Porteous solicited and accepted \nnumerous things of value for his personal use and benefit, including \nmeals, trips, home repairs, and car repairs, while at the same time \ntaking official actions that benefitted the Marcottes.\n  Article III--The record demonstrated that Judge Porteous knowingly \nand intentionally made material false statements and representations \nunder penalty of perjury related to his personal bankruptcy filing, and \nthat he repeatedly violated a court order in his bankruptcy case.\n  Article IV--The record demonstrated that Judge Porteous knowingly \nmade numerous material false statements about his past to both the U.S. \nSenate and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to obtain the \noffice of U.S. district court judge. The record demonstrated that these \nstatements included the following:\n  1. On his Supplemental SF-86, Judge Porteous was asked if there was \nanything in his personal life that could be used by someone to coerce \nor blackmail him, or if there was anything in his life that could cause \nan embarrassment to Judge Porteous or the President if publicly known. \nJudge Porteous answered no to this question and signed the form under a \nwarning that a false statement was punishable by law.\n  2. During his background check, Judge Porteous falsely told the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation on two separate occasions that he was \nnot concealing any activity or conduct that could be used to influence, \npressure, coerce, or compromise him in any way that would impact \nnegatively on his character, reputation, judgment or discretion.\n  3. On the Senate Judiciary Committee's Questionnaire for Judicial \nNominees, Judge Porteous was asked whether any unfavorable information \nexisted that could affect his nomination. Judge Porteous answered that \nto the best of his knowledge, he did ``not know of any unfavorable \ninformation that may affect [his] nomination.'' Judge Porteous signed \nthat questionnaire by swearing that the information provided in the \nstatement is, to the best of my knowledge, true and accurate.''\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to explain my votes in \nrelation to the impeachment of Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. I take my \nrole in the rare process of impeachment seriously, and welcome the \nopportunity to explain my reasoning for voting guilty on all four \nArticles of Impeachment and to clarify for the record the limited \nprecedential value that I believe the conviction on Article IV should \nprovide.\n  When considering the evidence presented by the House and Judge \nPorteous, I first had to establish what standard of proof I would use \nto determine his guilt or innocence on each Article of Impeachment \npassed by the House of Representatives. The Senate has never adopted a \nstandard of proof like `beyond a reasonable doubt' from the criminal \ncontext or `a preponderance of the evidence' from a civil dispute \ncontext; rather, the Senate has allowed individual Senators to decide \nfor themselves what standard is most appropriate. I ultimately settled \non the standard suggested by the House Manager, that I be convinced of \nthe truthfulness of the allegations and that they rise to a level of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors.\n  Mr. President, our founders granted Congress the power of impeachment \nto protect the institutions of government from those judged to be unfit \nto hold positions of trust. In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton wrote \nof the jurisdiction to impeach an official: ``There are those offenses \nwhich proceed from the misconduct of public men or, in other words, \nfrom the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' This captures the \nstandard I applied to reach a determination of guilt on each Article of \nImpeachment. I was convinced that Judge Porteous, through each action \nand through his pattern of behavior, undermined the public's faith in \nhim as a government official and in the institution that he \nrepresented--the United States Federal Court.\n  With respect to Articles I, II and III, I am confident that the \nevidence of specific acts and the pattern of behavior displayed by \nJudge Porteous justifies my determination that he was guilty of high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. Article IV, however, gives me pause. While I \nbelieve that the guilty vote on Article IV was correct, I have \nreservations about the precedent that scholars and future Senators \nmight find in this impeachment. The questionnaire the judicial nominees \nfill out for the Senate\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\nJudiciary Committee provides an opportunity for those nominated to \nanswer questions about their past activities and involvement in and \nwith the law. From these questionnaires, we are able to learn of a \nnominee's legal experience, find information about past statements and \ngenerally assess the fitness of the nominee for the federal bench.\n  On his questionnaire, Judge Porteous was asked whether any \nunfavorable information existed that could affect his nomination, and \nhe answered that he did not know of any. I believe that Judge Porteous \nengaged in a pattern of behavior prior to, during and after his \nnomination to the federal district court that undermined the public's \nfaith in him as a government official, and that this pattern of \nbehavior rose to the level of an impeachable offense that met the \nstandard of high crimes and misdemeanors. Having said that, I do not \nbelieve that future nominees should be subject to impeachment simply \nfor a failure to answer a subjective, open-ended question on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's questionnaire.\n  Judge Porteous abused the questionnaire process, misrepresented his \nbackground and misled the Senate in an egregious manner that was unique \nto this specific situation. However, I can imagine a scenario whereby a \nnominee could falsely affirm that no negative information affecting his \nnomination existed, yet I might not find that false answer to be an \nimpeachable offense. I do not wish to see the nomination process become \neven more difficult for qualified men and women of good character, \nsolely because of an onerous application process. Many of us have \nthings in our backgrounds that we might miss when asked open ended \nquestions, and the Senate should not hang the cloud of impeachment over \nevery nominee's head because of such oversights alone--otherwise, we \nwill find ourselves without any nominees.\n  As a Senator who is not a lawyer, I would like to thank my colleagues \nwho took on the historic task of preparing and presenting this \nimpeachment trial. Specifically, Senator Claire McCaskill and Senator \nOrrin Hatch who shared the role of chair of the Special Impeachment \nTrial Committee. I came away from this experience with a renewed \nrespect for the Senate as an institution. When given the opportunity, \nSenators can work in a productive and civil manner, and I am sure that \nif he were able to see the dignity and respect with which the Senate \ntreated this impeachment, Alexander Hamilton would be very proud.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, as a result of today's vote on the four \nArticles of Impeachment against Judge G. Thomas Porteous, the Senate \nhas fulfilled its constitutional duty to remove a threat to the \npublic's trust and confidence in the Federal judiciary.\n  The conduct set forth in the first Article of Impeachment alone \njustifies the Senate's conviction of Judge Porteous. By coercing his \nformer law partners to participate in a kickback scheme while a state \njudge, by failing to properly disclose this corrupt relationship when \nwarranted as a federal judge in a recusal hearing and by obtaining \nfurther improper cash payments from them while taking their case under \nadvisement, Judge Porteous misdemeaned himself in a manner that is \ndirectly contrary to the essential public trust of his office. Federal \njudges cannot solicit improper gifts, and they certainly cannot lie to \nlitigants who appear before them.\n  The conduct described in the remaining three Articles of Impeachment \nis, likewise, wholly repugnant to the office of a U.S. judge. Counsel \nfor Judge Porteous argued that the Senate's unprecedented conviction on \nthese counts would weaken the judiciary to political attacks. I do not \ndismiss these arguments lightly. With only 12 impeachment trials having \nbeen completed in our Nation's history, however, novelty of the \nparticular offenses charged is no absolute defense. My votes to \nconvict--whether for conduct on the State bench, as a private citizen, \nor before the Judiciary Committee--were compelled because they revealed \ncorruption and duplicity that, if countenanced, would destroy the \nintegrity of the federal judiciary. While counsel argued that the \nbehavior charged in the final three articles did not concern Judge \nPorteous' conduct as a Federal judge, each article charged conduct that \nbore an essential nexus to his Federal service.\n  Judge Porteous set bail bonds for the purpose of maximizing the \nprofits of the bail bonds company, rather than protecting the public \nsafety and guaranteeing the defendant's presence at trial. He carried \nout this scheme to cultivate improper benefits from the bail bonds \ncompany, trading official judicial action for personal gain. This \nbehavior was not an isolated lapse in judgment. It lasted for more than \na year, stopping only when Judge Porteous was confirmed to be a Federal \njudge.\n  Judge Porteous also lied during his bankruptcy while serving as a \nFederal judge. His only defense was that such conduct was not related \nto his service as a judge and included only acts taken as a private \ncitizen. A judge cannot repeatedly demean a Federal court by lying to \nit, as here, in an attempt to avoid embarrassment and to continue to \namass more gambling debts.\n  Likewise, Judge Porteous' lies and deceptions during his confirmation \nprocess reflect a willingness to subvert the truth, under penalty of \nperjury, for personal gain. His claim that any mistakes were \ninadvertent is simply not credible. The evidence demonstrates that \nJudge Porteous actively concealed the corrupt bail bonds scheme from \nFBI investigators, and failed to disclose much more corrupt behavior.\n  Our Federal courts are an enduring symbol of our national commitment \nto equal justice under the law. Judge Porteous' long history of \ncorruption, deceit, and abuse of power renders him incompatible with \nthat commitment. His removal strengthens our judiciary and confirms the \nintegrity of those who remain a part of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10288-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                          Maniilaq Association\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor a friend \nand colleague, Senator Bob Bennett, who will be moving on from the \nSenate after 18 years of service to the people of Utah.\n  Bob has had a long and impressive career. Out of college, he served \nfor several years in the Utah National Guard and worked as a \ncongressional liaison for the Department of Transportation. Turning \nnext to the private sector, he worked for 20 years in public relations \nand later in the technology field. He put that experience to good use \nonce elected to the Senate, using his high-tech know-how to chair the \nSenate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, serve on \nthe Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, and work on issues from \nbroadband infrastructure development to cyber security.\n  Utah and North Dakota have many things in common. Both are largely\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\nrural States with unique needs that often go unrecognized by those who \nlive in densely-populated areas. Senator Bennett should be proud that \nhe has been a vocal and consistent supporter of funding for Utah's \nfarmers and ranchers, veterans, rural health care institutions, \nmilitary installations, and roads, highways, and mass-transit \ninfrastructure. I know that Utah has many reasons to be grateful for \nwhat Bob Bennett's hard work on the Appropriations Committee has \nbrought to the State over the years.\n  During his time here, Senator Bennett and I have worked closely on a \nnumber of important issues, especially those related to our national \ndefense. As an important member of the Senate ICBM Coalition, Senator \nBennett has worked with me to ensure that our Nation preserves both its \nfleet of Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles and the \ninfrastructure required to keep them operational for years into the \nfuture. Senator Bennett is also a member of the Senate Tanker Caucus, \nwhich has vocally and consistently pushed for the Department of Defense \nto quickly and fairly select and procure a next-generation aerial \nrefueling tanker to replace the aging KC-135. His advocacy on this \nissue has been key in the work of the caucus.\n  Finally, of course, and I think most importantly to Bob, he is a \ndedicated and outstanding family man. Though I know he will be missed \nhere in the Senate, the new time he will have to spend with his wife \nJoyce and his six children will certainly be counted among his many \nblessings. My wife Lucy and I wish Bob and his family many happy years \nahead.\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague from Indiana, \nSenator Evan Bayh, who is retiring from the Senate. Senator Bayh has \nbeen a strong voice for the people of Indiana , both in two terms as \ntheir Governor and 12 years as their Senator. He has brought a keen \nintellect and a commonsense perspective to the Senate that should make \nhis fellow Hoosiers proud. Building on the Senate traditions he learned \nfrom his father, he has worked hard to build consensus across party \nlines to strengthen our country.\n  It is clear to me that Senator Bayh never forgets his other job in \nlife. As a father of twin boys, he often reminds his colleagues to \nconsider the impact of our decisions on our children and the following \ngenerations.\n  That is why I admire Senator Bayh's deeply held belief in fiscal \nresponsibility. Senator Bayh played a key role in helping push for a \nfiscal commission to address our Nation's debt. He also urged that the \nlong-term debt increase we passed earlier this year include a \ncommitment to dealing with our debt.\n  With his experience on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nand the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Bayh has been a \nrespected voices on national security issues. He has used that position \nto make sure our troops are properly equipped and supplied while on \nduty and to reduce the financial burden on their families. He has also \nbeen a strong supporter for efforts to keep nuclear weapons out of the \nhands of dangerous states and terrorist groups.\n  Senator Bayh also understands the importance of education as a source \nof opportunity to our people and a key investment in the ongoing \nprosperity of our country. As Governor of Indiana, Senator Bayh created \nthe 21st Century Scholars Program, which offers a path to higher \neducation at Indiana's State universities for at-risk students. Senator \nBayh continued his strong support of education in the Senate, working \nto make college more affordable through new tax credits for qualified \ntuition expenses, higher student aid grants, and more affordable \nstudent loans.\n  Senator Bayh has served the people of the State of Indiana with \nintegrity. I will miss having him as a colleague in the Senate, but I \nalso know that his wife Susan and his sons, Beau and Nick, will be \nexcited to have him back home in Indiana. I wish him success in \nwhatever he chooses to do in the next chapter of his life.\n\n\n                            CHRISTOPHER DODD\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize the \naccomplishments of a colleague and friend who will be retiring from the \nU.S. Senate at the end of this term. Senator Christopher Dodd has \nrepresented Connecticut in Congress for 36 years, and has been an \nunrelenting advocate for his constituents and working-class Americans.\n  Senator Dodd has led a very impressive career, and his dedication and \nlove of public service is evident. After graduating from Providence \nCollege, he volunteered with the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic \nfor 2 years. Upon returning to the United States, Dodd enlisted in the \nArmy National Guard and later served in the U.S. Army Reserves. In \n1972, he earned a law degree from the University of Louisville School \nof Law, and practiced law before his election to the United States \nHouse of Representatives in 1975. In 1981, he became the youngest \nperson to join the United States Senate in Connecticut history. Senator \nDodd followed in the footsteps of his father, the late Senator Thomas \nDodd, being elected to both Chambers of Congress.\n  Since his election to Congress, Senator Dodd has served his State and \nthe Nation admirably. He has been a true advocate for our children and \ntheir families, forming the Senate's first Children's Caucus. He was a \nchampion and author of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which \nguarantees working Americans time off if they are ill or need to care \nfor a sick family member or new child. In addition, he has consistently \nfought to improve and expand the Head Start program, a critical \ninvestment in our Nation's future. Due to his tremendous advocacy of \nthe program, he was named Senator of the Decade by the National Head \nStart Association.\n  Senator Dodd was also one of the key Senators who made passage of \nhealth care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a \nreality. A close and personal friend of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, \nSenator Dodd worked tirelessly on health reform in the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, and in the full Senate during \nSenator Kennedy's battle with brain cancer and after his passing. \nSenator Kennedy, who had been the leader in the Senate on reforming our \nhealth care system for several decades, would have been very proud of \nSenator Dodd and his relentless efforts to reform our Nation's health \ncare system.\n  The health care reform law that Senator Dodd helped to craft will \nexpand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans \nand create some common-sense rules of the road for the health insurance \nindustry in an effort to clamp down on abusive practices such as \njacking up premiums or dropping coverage just when people need it most. \nIt also builds on our current private, employer-based system by \nexpanding coverage, controlling costs, and improving quality, \ncompetition and choices for consumers.\n  Senator Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs Committee. He has been instrumental in working to put our \ncountry back on sound economic footing. As we all remember too well, in \nthe fall of 2008 we faced a financial crisis. Senator Dodd and I and \nother leaders from both Chambers were called to an emergency meeting in \nthe United States Capitol as the Nation's economy teetered on the brink \nof collapse. At this meeting, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and \nthe Secretary of the Treasury from the previous administration told us \nthey were taking over AIG the next morning. They believed if they did \nnot, there would be a financial collapse. Those were very, very serious \ndays.\n  A few weeks later, the Bush administration proposed virtually \nunfettered authority for the Treasury Secretary to respond to the \nfinancial crisis. Senator Dodd, to his lasting credit, insisted on \ndefining the Treasury's authority, subjecting it to strict oversight, \nand protecting the taxpayer. He played a key role in improving the \nlegislation, culminating in non-stop negotiations into the middle of a \nSaturday night in October. When the history of the financial crisis is \nwritten, I expect Chris Dodd will be given great credit for responding \nto the crisis, helping to prevent a Great Depression, and improving the \nlegislation. He played a central role, I believe, in shaping the \nresponse so that the ultimate cost to taxpayers will be far, far lower \nthan originally expected.\n  Senator Dodd also took the lead in writing landmark Wall Street \nreform legislation to help prevent another financial sector collapse. \nIt will allow\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nthe government to shut down firms that threaten to crater our economy \nand ensure that the financial industry, not the taxpayer, is on the \nhook for any costs. Senator Dodd is owed great thanks for his \nleadership and hard work on these financial issues during a very \ndifficult time for our Nation.\n  These are just a few of the examples of the great work Senator Dodd \nhas done for the country. I would like to close by saying that Senator \nDodd's presence will certainly be missed in this Chamber. He has served \nthe people of Connecticut faithfully, and I know that his many \ncontributions will not be forgotten. It has been an honor for me to \nwork with such a compassionate and dedicated Senator, and I wish him \nand his family the very best.\n\n\n                             GEORGE LEMIEUX\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize our retiring \ncolleague from Florida, Senator George LeMieux.\n  Senator LeMieux came to the Senate in September of 2009, amid \nextraordinary economic conditions. When he took office, Floridians were \nfacing historically high rates of unemployment--a trend too common \nacross the country. And by November 2009, an estimated 45 percent of \nhome mortgages in Florida were ``upside down,'' meaning affected \nFloridians owed more on their property than it was worth. Needless to \nsay, there were significant economic challenges facing the incoming \njunior Senator from Florida.\n  It takes uncommon character and dedication to accept appointment to \npublic office, especially in these uncertain times. Senator LeMieux \nchose to confront our country's economic challenges by serving the \npeople of Florida in the United States Senate.\n  Since arriving in the Senate, Senator LeMieux has expressed his \ndesire to address our unsustainable fiscal condition--a problem I agree \nwill cripple our country without bipartisan compromise. If we are to \naddress our fiscal challenges, we must work together to craft solutions \nto our economic challenges.\n  In addition to historic economic and fiscal challenges, Senator \nLeMieux has confronted unexpected environmental challenges. Not long \nafter Senator LeMieux arrived in the Senate, our country saw one of its \ngreatest environmental disasters of all time. For 3 months, oil gushed \ninto the Gulf of Mexico, causing extensive damage to marine life, \ncoastline, and commerce. Senator LeMieux, along with his fellow gulf \ncoast colleagues, worked to secure Federal relief to mitigate the \neffects of the spill on the coastal region.\n  It is not easy to navigate the Federal disaster relief system, \nespecially for a new Senator. I commend Senator LeMieux for his work to \nprotect his fellow Floridians from the effects of the gulf oil spill.\n  Despite our political differences, I respect Senator LeMieux's desire \nto make a difference in the lives of everyday Floridians. I have \nappreciated the opportunity to work with Senator LeMieux and thank him \nfor his service to our country.\n\n\n                             Carte Goodwin\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a \ncolleague who has left the Senate. Senator Carte Goodwin represented \nWest Virginia admirably after the passing earlier this year of our dear \nfriend and colleague, U.S. Senator Robert Byrd, who was the longest \nserving Senator in history. Senator Goodwin took the oath of office on \nJuly 20, 2010, and joined the U.S. Senate as the Chamber's youngest \nserving Member at the age of 36.\n  Senator Goodwin has led a very impressive career. After graduating \nfrom Emory University School of Law in 1999, he clerked for Judge \nRobert King of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit. In 2000, \nSenator Goodwin joined the family private practice of Goodwin & Goodwin \nand remained there until 2005, when he became the general counsel to \nWest Virginia Governor Joe Manchin. After serving a full term for the \nGovernor, Senator Goodwin returned to the family private practice \nbefore being selected by Governor Manchin to temporarily fill the \nvacated seat of the late Senator Byrd until the November 2010 \nelections.\n  Senator Goodwin's leadership became immediately evident in the Senate \nas his first vote cleared the way for an important extension of \nunemployment benefits to help those most in need during this tough \neconomic time. He also introduced legislation in September, the Access \nto Button Cell Batteries Act of 2010, to protect children against the \nhazards associated with swallowing button cell batteries that can be \nfound in everything from musical greeting cards to car keys.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, it has been a pleasure to have \nSenator Goodwin serve on that committee, and see first-hand his \ncommitment and dedication to his Mountain State constituents and the \ncountry. It is no wonder that Senator Goodwin was recently named to \nTime Magazine's list of ``40 Under 40--Rising Stars of U.S. Politics.''\n  Senator Goodwin is a man of outstanding integrity, who has a \nrelentless work ethic. He has set a fine example for our Nation's young \npoliticians to follow. He has also been a true defender of West \nVirginia. His compassion and conviction will be missed in the U.S. \nSenate. I wish Senator Goodwin and his family great success, and many \nhappy years ahead.\n\n\n                             roland burris\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor my colleague, Senator \nRoland Burris, who will be retiring from the Senate after serving 2 \nyears.\n  Senator Burris has had a long and distinguished career as a public \nservant, both at the State and local levels. Upon graduation from \nHoward Law School in 1963, Senator Burris became the National Bank \nExaminer for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the U.S. \nDepartment of the Treasury. In 1978, Senator Burris became the first \nAfrican American to be elected to a statewide office when he was \nelected comptroller of the State of Illinois. Senator Burris continued \nto break barriers when elected as attorney general for the State of \nIllinois, becoming only the second African American ever to be elected \nto the office of State attorney general in the United States.\n  Mr. Burris was appointed to fill President Obama's open Senate seat \non December 30, 2008. In his nearly 2 years in the Senate, Mr. Burris \nhas been active on the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, \nas well as the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Whether it is fighting hard for Illinois' veterans or casting an \nimportant vote in favor of health care legislation, Senator Burris has \ndone much with his limited time in the Senate. A lifelong resident of \nIllinois, there are very few people more invested in their State's \nfuture than Roland Burris.\n  As he departs the U.S. Senate and heads off to future endeavors, \nthere is no doubt that his beloved wife Berlean and his two children, \nRolanda and Roland II, will be by his side. I wish Senator Burris lots \nof luck and happiness in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute and recognize the \nachievements of a colleague who will be leaving the Senate at the end \nof this term. Senator Arlen Specter has represented Pennsylvania in the \nSenate for three decades, making him the longest-serving Senator in his \nState's history. During his tenure, he has been an unrelenting advocate \nfor his constituents and working-class Americans.\n  Senator Specter has had an impressive career in both the public and \nprivate sector. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, \nhe served in the U.S. Air Force from 1951 to 1953. Following his \nservice, he attended Yale Law School and worked as editor for the Yale \nLaw School Journal. After graduating from law school, Senator Specter \nbecame an outstanding lawyer. As an aide to the Warren Commission, he \ninvestigated the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. He \nalso served as the district attorney in Philadelphia from 1966 to 1974, \nand practiced law as a private attorney before being elected to the \nU.S. Senate in 1980.\n  In the Senate, Senator Specter and I found significant common ground, \nas his strong sense of integrity and moderate philosophy have been key \nin passing some of the this institution's most important legislation. \nDuring his time in Congress, the Senator will be remembered for \npresiding over historic\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nU.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. While undergoing chemotherapy for advanced Hodgkin's \ndisease, Senator Specter managed the intense confirmation proceedings \nfor Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito Jr. As a \nsenior member of the Appropriations Committee, he led the fight to \nincrease funding for the National Institutes of Health from $12 to $30 \nbillion to expand medical research to find cures for cancer, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's and other devastating and debilitating \ndiseases. It is no wonder that Time Magazine listed him among the 10 \nbest Senators in 2006.\n  Arlen Specter embodies what it means to be a good Senator--integrity, \na strong work ethic, courage, dedication, and being true to one's \nconvictions. Senator Specter has been a real champion for Pennsylvania \nand this country. His compassion, independence and voice of reason will \nbe missed in the U.S. Senate. I have appreciated the opportunity to \nwork with Senator Specter, and wish him and his family the very best.\n\n\n                              Ted Kaufman\n\n  Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kaufman. Ted has retired after just 2 years as a \nUnited States Senator. He was appointed to this position in January \n2009 after Senator Joe Biden was elected as Vice President of the \nUnited States.\n  Ted was an obvious choice to fill Joe's well-established shoes. He \nhas a tremendous amount of experience on Capitol Hill, and there are \nfew who understand the inner workings of the Senate as well as he does. \nBefore being appointed to fill Delaware's vacant Senate seat, Ted \nserved almost 20 years as Chief of Staff for Senator Biden. This \nexperience served him well as Ted proved himself to be a strong and \neffective leader for Delaware.\n  After only a month of Senate service, Ted introduced the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act, which increases the number of FBI agents \nand prosecutors available to prosecute individuals who committed fraud \nduring the financial meltdown. This legislation became law May 20.\n  In addition, Ted has been a tireless advocate for improving \nregulation and safety in the financial services market to help protect \nAmericans from another devastating economic decline as a result of \nloose rules and abusive banking practices. He was also a strong \nproponent for renewing our country's focus on science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics research to help propel our country into \nthe 21st century.\n  Ted also established a unique tradition during his time in the \nSenate. Every week, he made it a priority to honor the lifelong \nservices of Federal employees. All too often, the hard work of these \npublic servants goes unrecognized, and I commend Ted for his efforts to \nhonor these men and women.\n  Even in retirement, Ted will continue serving the American people. He \nwas recently named Chairman of the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel.\n  There are few who could make such a tangible mark on public policy in \nsuch a short time. I thank Ted for his years of service and wish him \nall the best in the coming years.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have been honored for the past 18-plus \nyears to serve alongside Senator Byron Dorgan, who is preparing to \nleave the Senate after three distinguished terms. Senator Dorgan has \nbeen one of the most plain-spoken, energetic, and formidable forces in \nthe U.S. Senate, and I will sorely miss his voice.\n  Some might, at first, see relatively little in common between more \nurban, industrialized Michigan and more rural, agricultural North \nDakota. But Senator Dorgan and I saw eye-to-eye on issue after issue--\nproblems that needed to be tackled, outrages that needed to be exposed.\n  One of those problems is tax abuse. Senator Dorgan has been one of \nthe Senate's most stalwart and active opponents of tax cheats who rob \nthe Treasury of billions of dollars each year, while unloading their \ntax burden onto the backs of honest taxpayers. He introduced \nlegislation, commissioned key GAO reports, and fought long and hard \nagainst tax breaks that encourage U.S. companies to ship jobs offshore, \nset up factories in other countries, and use phony offshore companies \nto dodge taxes. I remember one floor fight last year in which he led a \nsuccessful effort to stop legislation that would have opened the \nfloodgates to billions of dollars that U.S. companies had hoarded \noffshore and wanted to bring back home without paying the same tax rate \nas their competitors. I remember battles we fought to stop so-called \n``inverted'' corporations--companies that pretend to move their \nheadquarters offshore as a method of dodging U.S. taxes--from \nparticipating in Federal contracts. I remember joining with him to \nrequest data exposing how U.S. companies have stopped bearing their \nshare of the tax burden. I am going to miss his iron will and sharp wit \nin the ongoing battles to combat tax abuse.\n  Senator Dorgan has also been an articulate and strenuous defender of \nAmerican workers, benefitting working families not only in North Dakota \nand Michigan, but across the Nation. For years, he has fought for fair \ntrade policies, insisting trade partners like South Korea and Japan, \nthat export millions of autos to the United States, open their doors to \nU.S.-made autos. There may be no major auto factories in Senator \nDorgan's home State, but that did not prevent him from exposing the \nhypocrisy and injustice of unequal market access and demanding change. \nI will miss his voice in the ongoing battles to pry open markets now \nshut to American goods.\n  Senator Dorgan also fought for American working families when he \nhelped author the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act, a \nbill that sought to end the tax benefits given to employers that send \njobs overseas, and instead reward the companies that invest in the \nUnited States. I am hopeful that the Senate may yet see the wisdom of \nhis legislation and enact it into law. Senator Dorgan literally wrote \nthe book on how corporate interests and political short-sightedness are \nhurting U.S. workers and the U.S. economy, and the Nation will continue \nto benefit from his work on this issue even after he has left the \nSenate.\n  Similarly, as cochair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on \nChina, Senator Dorgan has done much to shed light on human rights \nabuses in China and to illustrate how China has often failed to make \ngood on its World Trade Organization commitments. I am a member of the \ncommission, and my brother is Senator Dorgan's cochair, and we have \nboth enjoyed the privilege of working with him in that forum.\n  Finally, Senator Dorgan has been an essential voice in the Senate on \nreining in the excesses of Wall Street. As chairman of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which conducted a 2-year investigation \ninto the financial crisis, I know personally how diligent, informed, \nand intense his efforts were to restore sanity to the U.S. financial \nsystem. He took it upon itself to organize Senators into a force for \nchange and reform. When lobbyists claimed banks were the victims rather \nthan the perpetrators of the crisis, that their executives had done \nnothing wrong, and their multi-million paychecks were justified, \nSenator Dorgan dug into the facts, educated himself on the most \nesoteric financial engineering, and took on the special interests. For \nexample, he crafted an amendment to the Wall Street reform legislation \nto ban ``naked'' credit default swaps and worked with me to add my \namendment banning synthetic asset-backed securities. Our joint \namendment was unsuccessful, but time will show those types of high-\nrisk, empty bets do nothing to advance the real economy and much to \ndirect dollars into the mindless casino that plagued the U.S. financial \nsystem.\n  I will sorely miss Senator Dorgan's insight and determination in the \nongoing battles to rein in Wall Street excess. The people of North \nDakota are rightly proud of Senator Dorgan. He is a fighter, and he \nnever stopped fighting for them. They have benefitted greatly from \nSenator Byron Dorgan's service. The people of our Nation have \nbenefitted. I know the working families of my State have benefitted. I \nwant to thank him for his service, for his energy, for his diligence, \nfor his tenacity, and for his friendship. On a personal level, Barbara \nand I wish him and Kim and their family the best as they embark on this \nnew path together.\n\n\n                            blanche lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 210 years, many pioneers and \ngroundbreakers have passed through this Chamber.\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nToday, I would like to pay tribute to one such groundbreaking Senator, \none who will leave the Senate at the end of this session.\n  When the people of Arkansas elected Blanche Lincoln to represent them \nin the Senate in 1998, she became the youngest woman ever elected to \nthis body. After compiling an impressive list of accomplishments after \njoining the Senate, she became, in 2009, the first woman to chair the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. These accomplishments \nare just some of the highlights of an impressive career of Senate \nservice.\n  Senator Lincoln has been among the Senate's most passionate and \neffective voices in combating hunger, helping found the Senate Hunger \nCaucus to focus attention on an issue that affects far too many \nAmericans. And she has been a tireless advocate for the working \nfamilies of America's rural communities.\n  I am especially grateful for the work Senator Lincoln has done this \nyear in helping craft comprehensive financial reform. She was \ninstrumental in ensuring that the bill we passed into law this year \nbrought new transparency and safety to the largely unregulated world of \nderivatives trading. I know from hard experience that passing reform \nthat Wall Street doesn't like is, to say the least, challenging. The \nfinancial system is more secure, and the people of Arkansas and the \nNation are better off, because Senator Lincoln was willing to take on \nthat challenge and able to overcome it so effectively. She will long be \nremembered as one of the architects of financial reform.\n  Arkansas has given the Nation many accomplished public leaders, names \nsuch as Caraway, Fulbright, Bumpers, Pryor and Clinton. As she prepares \nto leave the Senate, Senator Lincoln can proudly join that list of \nArkansans who have improved the lives of those in their State and this \ncountry. I have been proud to call her a friend and a colleague, and I \nknow that, while she is leaving the Senate, her contributions to her \ncountry are far from over.\n\n\n                               evan bayh\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to congratulate \nSenator Bayh on a productive two terms in this body, and thank him for \nhis service, in particular as a member of the Armed Services Committee \nand on issues of importance to both our States.\n  As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have seen first hand \nthe diligence Senator Bayh brought to his work on national security. He \nhas been active on one of the greatest threats to our security, the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and materials, seeking to support and \nextend the work of his Indiana colleague, Senator Lugar. He has been \nequally effective in working, on a bipartisan basis, to pass \nlegislation seeking to hold the government of Iran accountable for its \negregious human rights abuses. And he has been active in helping the \ncommittee carry out its oversight function, bringing his thoughtful \napproach to his role as chairman of the our Subcommittee on Readiness \nand Management Support over the last 2 years. The committee, the \nSenate, and the American people have greatly benefitted from Senator \nBayh's efforts in these areas.\n  Senator Bayh represents a State that is part of America's industrial \nheartland, and he has energetically sought to ensure that we pursue \npolicies that do not damage the industrial economy. I would mention two \nsuch efforts in particular.\n  In 2007, Senator Bayh, along with me and other members of the Auto \nCaucus, worked to ensure that negotiations on a free trade agreement \nwith South Korea addressed the unfair and unbalanced way in which \nautomotive imports are treated in South Korea. Barriers to entry make \nthe South Korean market essentially closed to U.S.-made vehicles, while \nKorean automakers have found an open lucrative market in the United \nStates. He, like I and many others, is deeply concerned about the \nimpact of any potential trade agreement on the auto industry, and I \nhave been privileged to stand with him on this issue.\n  Senator Bayh also has been a leader in fighting against intellectual \nproperty theft by China and other nations. Manufacturers in both our \nStates have been harmed by the ability of foreign companies to copy \ntheir products and reproduce them in violation of international \nstandards, and by the inability or unwillingness of other nations to \ncombat such piracy. Along with Senator Voinovich, Senator Bayh in 2007 \nintroduced the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act. This \nlegislation would be an important safeguard protecting American \ncompanies from intellectual piracy.\n  Whether the issue was defense of American companies' rights or \ndefense of our Nation, Senator Evan Bayh has been a thoughtful, \nbalanced and capable member of the U.S. Senate. The people of Indiana \nhave gained much from his service. I will miss him as a colleague and a \nfriend, and I wish him and his family the best of luck as he seeks to \ncontinue to serve his State and Nation.\n\n\n                              bob bennett\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment when the \nend of a session of Congress draws near and it becomes time for us to \nsay goodbye to those of our colleagues who will be returning home at \nthe end of the year. We know we will miss them when the next session of \nCongress begins not only for their many contributions to the day-to-day \nwork of the Senate but for their friendship and the good advice they \nhave provided to us for so long as we deliberated issue after issue on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I can't think of anyone who better fits that description than Bob \nBennett. Bob was born in Utah, a member of a family who was very active \nin their community and the government. Bob was therefore blessed with \nsome great role models early on in his life. He soon found he had a \ntalent for business and a great understanding of the needs of \nbusinesspeople all over the State and around the Nation. Because of his \ninsights and his ability to promote his good ideas and products, he \ntook his company from a 4-person shop in 1984 to an $82 million company \njust a few years later with more than 700 newly created staff. With \ntoday's economy we can really appreciate that--that is a lot of jobs.\n  From there he decided to take on the challenge of a run for the \nSenate. As we all know, that first run for the Senate is never easy as \nit takes more than the vote of a community to make it happen. You have \nto take your case to every corner of the entire State. That means \nputting a lot of miles on your car and getting to know people from \nevery city, town, and neighborhood.\n  It wasn't an easy bid for office that brought Bob to Washington. But, \nin the end, he proved to have what it takes to be a successful \ncandidate. He had a vision for the future of Utah and the United \nStates, a willingness to work hard, and a sense of humor. He took his \njob and the position he holds of Senator very seriously, but he was \nnever one to take himself too seriously. In fact, he sees his job \nprincipally in terms of what he can do to help the people of Utah who \nelected him.\n  That is why, when he arrived in Washington, he immediately \nestablished a reputation as one of the Senate's most influential and \nsought after conservatives. Like me, he learned at a very young age \nthat it was better to be a workhorse than a showhorse because there is \nno limit to what you can do if you don't care who gets the credit. Bob \nnever cared about getting his share of the credit; he was always too \nbusy working on the next issue and helping to form another compromise \nagreement to make sure things continued to get done.\n  Bob has left quite a legacy of achievement during his service in the \nSenate and a big pair of shoes for those who will follow him to fill. \nThe media knows him not for an assortment of catchy one liners but for \nhis ability to provide easily understood, readily accessible \nexplanations about what was going on in the Senate--and why. No one has \na better, clearer understanding of the inner workings of the Senate \nthan Bob does. He has been such a valued resource, in fact, that many \nof us have sought him out more than a time or two just to get his take \non things.\n  One of the things I will most remember about Bob is his love of \ngadgets. He was the first Senator to drive a high-mileage, low-\nemissions, gasoline-electric hybrid car. His interest stemmed from his \nawareness of the importance of conserving energy and the need to pursue \nsolutions to our transportation problems that would make good and wise \nuse of our resources.\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\n  He was also a leader in encouraging the Senate to tackle a very \nthorny issue--Social Security. Social Security is a lot like the \nweather: we all complain about it, we all know something needs to be \ndone about it, and we are all sure we will know the right solution when \nit appears magically on the Senate doorstep. That wasn't what we should \ndo, as Bob saw it. Then again, he was never one to shy away from \ngetting the conversation started on just about anything.\n  In addition, as fellow small businessmen, we both took a great \ninterest in proposals that were offered by both sides that would have \ncaused problems for other small businessmen who were trying to do what \nthey do best--make a profit and create more jobs. Thanks to Bob, our \nsmall business community had a champion in the Senate who was willing \nto take a stand against efforts to make owning and running your own \nbusiness more difficult than it already is.\n  Those are just a few short snippets of Bob's record and the great \nsuccess he has been able to achieve for his constituents and for our \ngreat Nation. During his service in the Senate, Bob was not only a part \nof our Nation's history, he helped to write a new chapter of it every \nday.\n  Before I close, I want to thank Bob for the great gift of his \nfriendship. It has meant a great deal to me ever since that first day \nthat Diana and I drove our van into Washington from Wyoming, unsure of \nwhat the future held for us but excited to begin this great new \nadventure in our lives. Bob made a difference for us from the first \ntime we met him and Joyce, and we will always be grateful for that. We \nare very proud of them both and the difference they have made over the \nyears in our lives and so many more. Thanks to their efforts together, \nthe future will be a lot better and a more hopeful place for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  I don't know what you have planned for the years to come, but one \nthing I am certain of--we haven't heard the last from you. That is a \ngood thing. You have proven to be a great success at so many things. \nYou have always been an important addition to our debates and \ndeliberations, and you will be missed. It is good to know you will \nnever be more than a phone call away.\n  Good luck in all your future endeavors, my friend. Keep in touch with \nus, and we will keep in touch with you. God bless.\n\n\n                               evan bayh\n\n  Mr. President, soon the current session of Congress will be gaveled \nto a close. When that happens, it will also bring to a close the Senate \ncareers of several of our colleagues. I know we will miss them and \ntheir spirited participation in our deliberations both in committee and \non the floor.\n  I have always said that every Member who comes to the Senate has \nsomething to teach us--a message that only they could bring. Evan Bayh, \nwho will be retiring at the end of this session is such an individual. \nI will always remember him as the young Governor who was able to serve \nin the Senate without losing sight of his ideals and principles both as \na Hoosier and a parent and devoted and loving father.\n  Evan's career in politics began after he had clerked for a judge and \npracticed law for a while. An opportunity presented itself for him to \nrun for office, and he did, winning an election that made him the \nsecretary of state at the age of 30. In just 2 years he then became the \nyoungest Governor in the Nation. He served in that capacity for 8 \nyears, during which he made a strong reputation for himself as someone \nwho was able to get things done.\n  Then, when term limits prohibited his run for reelection, he set his \nsights on a Senate seat and again found success. He ran a good \ncampaign, took his case to the people, and they liked what they heard. \nThey also knew him and what he stood for from his previous service to \nthe State. They knew they could send him to Washington to the Senate, \nand he would champion what they believed in and fight for what was \nneeded during his service there.\n  During his Senate career, you could always find him in the political \ncenter looking for a compromise agreement that would benefit everyone \ninvolved. I have always thought he would agree that it is better to get \na half of the loaf than none at all, especially when the available half \nwas the part that was needed the most.\n  We also agree on something else. When a Democratic win at the polls \nhelped them to obtain control of the Senate, Bayh joined a breakfast \ngroup of Senators that was designed to get Republicans and Democrats \nmore involved in a regular dialogue. He understood that by getting both \ngroups to talk more and to get to know each other better in a context \nthat was separate from our legislative duties, the Senate would be more \nproductive and it would be easier to create and promote compromises \nbetween the two parties.\n  Now that Evan's Senate career has come to a close, he will be able to \ndo something he has always looked forward to--spend more time with his \nfamily.\n  In the end, I think that is one of the things that Evan will always \nbe known for--his great love of his own family and his understanding of \nthe great love all of his constituents have for theirs. He believes \neveryone deserves their shot at the American dream, no matter their \nage, and the best way to do that is to be careful and cautious in our \napproach to any sweeping legislation and to ensure that we do \neverything we can so our children and grandchildren will have the same \nchance we have had to reach their goals and live their dreams.\n  Diana joins me in sending our best wishes for a happy and healthy \nretirement to Evan and his wife Susan. We wish them the best. I don't \nknow what Evan has planned for the future, but one thing I feel certain \nof--we haven't heard the last from him. Good luck in all your future \nendeavors and in whatever you decide to do. Keep in touch.\n\n\n                             George LeMieux\n\n  Mr. President, each year that brings a session of Congress to an end, \nit has long been a tradition for the Senate to take a moment to say \ngoodbye to those who will not be returning in January for the beginning \nof the next session of Congress. One of those I know I will miss who \nwill be heading home to Florida as his term concludes is George \nLeMieux.\n  It may surprise a lot of people to learn what a powerful presence \nGeorge has been in the Senate. Although he did not serve a full term of \n6 years, the months he has spent representing Florida have been very \nproductive.\n  Simply put, George is an impressive individual who understands the \nimportance of the work we must do to control spending in the years to \ncome and, if we fail to do that, the impact it will have on our Nation \nand our children as they try to pursue their goals and live the \nAmerican dream.\n  George grew up in Florida and, like me, he came to Washington, D.C., \nfor his college studies. I graduated from George Washington University, \nand George graduated from Georgetown University. When he returned home \nto begin his career, his attendance at a high school reunion proved to \nbe a turning point in his life when he met a former classmate named \nMeike who soon became his wife.\n  Years later, when an individual of George's talents and abilities was \nneeded to complete the Senate term of Mel Martinez, the Governor knew \nwho would be the right person for the job--George LeMieux. Soon, George \nwas on his way back to Washington, looking forward to the opportunity \nto use his knowledge, skills, abilities, and professional experience to \nserve the people of his home State.\n  There were some eyebrows raised when he arrived. Some people thought \nhe wasn't the best candidate for the job. Others thought he didn't have \nthe background necessary to be a productive Senator. It didn't take him \nlong before he proved them all wrong.\n  George not only hit the ground running, but he proved to be a natural \nand effective legislator. I don't think I have ever seen anyone who has \nhad such an impact on the Senate after such a short time in office.\n  Over the past months, George has not only fulfilled his duties as a \nSenator, he has taken them to another level as he came up with good \nideas for legislation, especially on the need to control spending and \nreduce the deficit which he has referred to as the ``single greatest \nthreat'' to our future and the prosperity of our people.\n  That is the kind of Senator that George has been--strong, spirited, \nfocused, and determined to speak out about the consequences that will \ncome\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nfrom not being good stewards of our Nation's financial resources. His \nconcern about our debt and the world we will leave behind for our \nchildren and grandchildren means even more to him today now that his \nWashington experience includes the addition of a fourth child--his \nfirst daughter.\n  I don't know what the future holds for you, George, but I do know \nthat we will all be watching with great interest and expectation. You \nhave already established a reputation for hard work that has earned you \nthe friendship of your colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Whatever \nyou decide to do, I am sure you know you can count on us to support and \nencourage you as you begin the next great adventure of your life. I am \nhoping it will be as the elected Senator from Florida. You can \ncertainly run on experience. You have done more in months than some do \nin a career.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to you and Meike. You have \nmade a difference in just a few months, and we are sure there is more \nto come. Keep in touch when you return home. We will always be pleased \nto hear from you with your thoughts and suggestions about the \nlegislation being considered by the Senate and what we can do to make \nit better.\n\n\n                              TED KAUFMAN\n\n  Mr. President, soon the gavel will bring to a close this session of \nCongress, and many of us will return home to be with our families for \nthe holidays. Before we leave, it is one of the Senate's traditions to \nsay a few words to express our appreciation to those who will no longer \nbe serving in the Senate when we reconvene for the next session of \nCongress in January. One Senator I know I will miss in the months to \ncome is Ted Kaufman.\n  Ted isn't one of those who followed the typical road to the Senate. \nHe came to be a part of our work after first making career stops as a \ncollege instructor, a political consultant, and a chief of staff for \nJoe Biden, whose seat he was appointed to fill when Senator Biden \nbecame our Nation's Vice President.\n  Each stop along the way provided Ted with a different perspective \nabout government and its effect on the people it was created to serve. \nThe different roles he has played and his knowledge of and experience \nwith the workings of the Senate made him a good choice to serve the \nremainder of Joe Biden's Senate term. When the Governor made the \nappointment, she cited Ted's knowledge of the Senate which he gained \nduring his many years of service here that she believed would enable \nhim to hit the ground running and be an ``effective Senator for \nDelaware from day one.'' She was right on both counts.\n  Ted is one of only two Senators who holds a degree in engineering. \nJust as I have found being the Senate's only accountant has helped me \nduring our debates on the budget and how to handle the deficit, Ted's \nunderstanding and appreciation of the sciences have given him some \nvaluable insights into the importance of moving science and technology \ncareers ``back in their rightful place in our economy.''\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions, I share his concern about the need to encourage our young \npeople to take a closer look at those fields and consider a career in \none of them. Unless they do, we will continue to fall further and \nfurther behind in the number of science students we graduate. That will \nhave an impact on our place in the world economy and our ability to \nattract the kind of jobs that will enable our workers to find jobs that \nare both challenging and rewarding.\n  Although I do not know what the future holds for Ted as he leaves the \nSenate, I do know that he has taught in the past about government and \nthe process of governing. His experience as a Senator would add a vital \ndimension to another round of those classes. I hope he considers \nsharing what he has learned with the next generation of our leaders--\nand help to groom our future Senators. It will be yet another way for \nhim to make a difference in the world.\n  Good luck, Ted. Thanks for your willingness to serve. You can be very \nproud of the contribution you have made to the Senate and to the \nhistory of our country. Every day another chapter of our history is \nwritten in our Nation's Capitol and, as one of only 100 Senators, you \nhave played a key role in that effort that has now been recorded and \nwill not be forgotten.\n  Our thanks also go to your wife Lynne, who has been a part of this \nand all your life's adventures. As we both know so well, serving in the \nSenate means a lot of late nights, trips back home with little notice, \nand a lot of other things we have to deal with because they come with \nthe job. Fortunately our wives never complain because we could never do \nwhat we have to do without them. While I am thanking you for your \nservice, I think Lynne also deserves a word of recognition for all she \nhas done over the years to support your efforts. Together, you are a \nremarkable team, and that is why Delaware is so proud to claim both of \nyou as their own.\n\n\n                             ROLAND BURRIS\n\n  Mr. President, soon the gavel will bring to a close this session of \nCongress, and many of us will return home to be with our families for \nthe holidays. Before we leave, it is one of the Senate's traditions to \nsay goodbye to those who will not be with us when we reconvene for the \nnext session of Congress in January. One Senator I know I will miss in \nthe months to come is Roland Burris.\n  Roland is quite a remarkable individual--a man of many firsts who has \nnever been one to shy away from any challenge. He was the first African \nAmerican to win a statewide election in Illinois, for example, and for \nthe past months he has been serving the people of that State as their \nSenator.\n  Through the years, Roland has had a wide and varied career. He has \nbeen a lawyer, a lobbyist, a college instructor, the director of a \ncivil rights nonprofit, a bank executive, and so much more. He has a \ngreat understanding of how government works from many different \nperspectives, and that knowledge has helped him to make an important \ncontribution to the work of the Senate every day.\n  One aspect of his character I will always remember is his great love \nof God and his willingness to share so much of himself and his faith in \nour Senate Prayer Breakfasts. He has always had something important to \nsay, a word or an insight that had not been mentioned until he spoke \nand added something that needed to be said by him--and heard by us.\n  I am always amazed to discover that no matter how many times I have \nread or reflected on a passage in the Bible, there is always someone \nwho is able to offer a fresh insight, a new approach to the text that I \nhad never heard or considered before. That is what made Roland such an \nimportant part of our Senate Prayer Breakfasts. On many occasions he \nwas able to offer a personal perspective on the Bible that was gained \nfrom his unique life experience. His heartfelt dedication to the words \nof the Bible meant a great deal to me and to all those in attendance. \nThrough these past 2 years, I have enjoyed listening to him speak about \nhis faith and the source of strength and support it has been for him \nthroughout his life.\n  Now Roland will be returning home to Illinois in search of another \nmountain to climb, another adventure to enjoy. I have no idea what the \nfuture holds for him, but if his past is any indication, we haven't \nheard the last from him. He has always been a trailblazer in a number \nof fields, and I am certain he will continue to be all of that--and \nmuch, much more.\n  Diana and I send our best wishes to Roland, his wife Berlean, and \ntheir children. Thank you for your willingness to serve. Life in the \nSenate has never been easy, and you have handled its pressures very \nwell. God bless.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment when we come to the \nend of a session of Congress. As the clock winds down on the final \nhours of our legislative activities, it also signals the time when \nseveral of our colleagues will be retiring and ending their years of \nservice in the U.S. Senate. One of our colleagues who will be leaving \nat the end of this session is my good friend Jim Bunning of Kentucky. I \nknow we will all miss him, his spirited presence in the Senate and the \nfriendship he has shared with us through the years.\n  Someday when he gets the urge I have no doubt that Jim will be able \nto write another book or two about his life that will sell countless \ncopies all\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nover the country. It can't miss. Jim has a truly remarkable story to \ntell about his life that has all the makings of a best seller. An old \nadage reminds us that it isn't the number of years in your life that is \nimportant, it is the life in your years. If that is the standard we are \ngoing to use, I can't think of anyone who has been able to fit more \ninto every day of his life than Jim and I for one would enjoy reading \nall about it. This time Jim might think about writing about how playing \nbaseball was a lot like politics--and how the bean balls he used to \nthrow at batters became verbal fast balls that came with lightning \nspeed right at other Senators and members of the media.\n  I would imagine the first volume of this new series would be about \nJim's years in baseball. There is definitely a lot still to be written \nabout his Hall of Fame career and the outstanding results he was able \nto achieve that kept him in the Major Leagues for so many years.\n  Jim's 17 year career in baseball began when he broke into the big \nleagues on July 20, 1955 with his first team, the Detroit Tigers. In \nthe years that followed, he pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies, the \nPittsburgh Pirates and the Los Angeles Dodgers, notching 100 wins and \n1,000 strikeouts in both the American and National Leagues. When he \nretired he had the second highest number of career strikeouts in the \nhistory of major league baseball and two no-hitters, one of them the \nseventh perfect game in baseball history that he pitched on June 21, \n1964--Father's Day--which made the game that much more meaningful for \nhim. He was then inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996.\n  For anyone else that would have been enough. A Hall of Fame career, \nafter all, is the kind of thing that most people can only dream about--\nbut Jim was never one to be like most people. He had another career in \nmind, and it was time to get started on his other dream--making \ngovernment work better for the people of Kentucky.\n  Soon after he first tossed his cap into the political arena, Jim won \nan election to serve on the city council in Fort Thomas. He then ran \nfor and won a seat in the Kentucky State Senate where he soon came to \nserve as its Republican leader. Then, when the opportunity presented \nitself, Jim ran for and won an election to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, where he served for 12 years.\n  Fortunately, for the people of Kentucky and the Senate, Jim then ran \nfor and won a seat in the Senate. At every level, it was Jim's \nwillingness to work hard and his commitment to his country and his \nbeloved Kentucky that not only got him noticed, but helped him to make \nprogress on all fronts.\n  Here in the Senate, Jim became the first Kentuckian in nearly 40 \nyears to serve on the Finance Committee. He also served on the Banking \nCommittee, chaired that committee's Economic Policy Subcommittee, and \nthen served on the Energy Committee which gave him a chance to work to \nmake our Nation more energy independent.\n  At every post he has held he has been a fighter--for a sound budget, \none that would provide the funds that were needed for our national \npriorities, like our Armed Forces--especially those who were serving \noverseas. For 12 years in the House and 12 years in the Senate, Jim \nheld true to the values and principles that had guided his life and \nserved as his inner compass through all of his life's challenges and \nopportunities.\n  Jim has had more great moments in his life than most other people \ncould ever hope for. He has his victories on the mound during a Hall of \nFame career to look back on. He had all those wins on election day to \nremember with pride. Still, there was one moment that still stands head \nand shoulders above them all--his marriage. That day when Mary said ``I \ndo'' was the best moment of his life. She is a strong source of support \nfor him and I am sure he has already said that whatever success has \ncome into his life he owes to a large degree to Mary. Theirs has been a \nremarkable marriage, during which they raised nine children who have \nblessed them with an abundance of grandchildren and some great \ngrandchildren, too.\n  Just like the title of the movie so many of us enjoy during this time \nof year Jim is having a wonderful life. Each day, each week, each month \nand every year, he's played a full and active role in his community and \nhis nation. As a baseball player he proved to be one of the best there \never was. As a Senator and a Representative, he showed a willingness to \nbring that same determination that had won him so many games on the \nmound to our deliberations on the Senate floor.\n  I don't know what Jim is thinking of taking on next--but given his \nlegacy of excellence that he continues to add to every day, I wouldn't \nbe surprised to learn we haven't heard the last from him. That would \nsuit me and so many who know him just fine. His is a voice that is \nstill needed.\n  That is why, in the months to come I hope I continue to hear from him \nwith his thoughtful ideas and suggestions about the issues we will be \ntaking up in the current Congress. I will miss hearing what he has to \nsay--but if I know Jim--I have a hunch he will make his views known.\n  Thanks, Jim, for your willingness to serve the people of Kentucky and \nthe Nation. With both careers you have inspired countless people of all \nages to pursue their goals and work to make their dreams a reality. \nThanks most of all for your friendship. Diana and I wish you and Mary \nall the best that life has to offer. You have earned all of that and so \nmuch more. For all your life you have been leading the best way--by \nexample--and living a life that has been nothing short of a great and \ngrand adventure--just what life was always meant to be.\n\n\n                             sam brownback\n\n  Mr. President, if I could sum up the service of Sam Brownback in the \nSenate in just a few words, I would choose a phrase that is very \nfamiliar to the people of Wyoming and the West. Sam is an individual \nwho says what he means and means what he says. That is why when he made \na promise that he would step down after he had served 2 full terms in \nthe Senate--he did it.\n  Fortunately, as the classic old film reminds us, whenever a door is \nclosed, somewhere, God opens a window and that window was Sam's \nopportunity to run for Governor. Now that he has been elected, the \nSenate's loss will be Kansas' gain as the people of that State will \nhave the benefit of his leadership for many years to come.\n  Here in the Senate, Sam followed a philosophy he calls ``pro-life, \nwhole life.'' Simply put that means that the great respect we have for \nlife doesn't end at birth, it continues throughout. If it sounds \nfamiliar I believe that is what our Founding Fathers meant when they \nspoke of ``life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' as the great \ngifts that are given to us by our Creator that can never be taken away \nfrom us.\n  Throughout the years, Sam has followed that philosophy wherever it \nhas taken him as he has worked to support legislative initiatives that \nseemed to clearly follow from it. That is why you would find him \nworking with members on both sides of the aisle to reach out to \n``everybody on the planet'' who was in need ``everywhere on the \nplanet'' they could be found.\n  Looking back, there is so much that Sam has accomplished that should \nserve as a great source of pride for him, his staff and the people of \nKansas. He has taken a consistent stand for human rights whenever he \nwas called to do so and this is another reason why his is a voice that \nwill be missed in the Senate in the months to come.\n  Through the years, I have never met anyone who had a stronger or more \nfirmly aligned inner compass when it comes to doing what is right \nbecause it is right than Sam. In everything he does, his faith and his \nrelationship with God have served to direct his efforts. That heartfelt \napproach of his has helped to keep his work in perfect alignment with \nhis core values and the thinking of the people of Kansas who sent him \nto Washington to do what he thought was best to protect and preserve \nthe American dream and keep it available for generations to come.\n  Sam is someone we will always remember for the things he did and how \nwell he did them. He is a natural leader who leads with actions--not \nwords because he knows that is the only way to get the important things \ndone--and done quickly.\n  That philosophy showed itself in things like Sam's work to address \nthe needs of the people of Africa. He did\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nnot have to do it--but because he did, countless lives were saved. If \nyou asked him why he was working so hard to make a difference in a \nnation so far from home, he would probably say that is just another \nexample of his philosophy that the whole world is his backyard and \neveryone, everywhere is his neighbor.\n  I am certain that Sam is very familiar with the Parable from the \nBible in which the Master expresses his appreciation for the good work \nof his servant. ``Well done, my good and faithful servant. Since you \nwere faithful in small matters, I will give you great \nresponsibilities.''\n  I mention that because Sam has done so very well in the Senate, it is \nas if the people of Kansas have now placed him in charge of great \nresponsibilities as their Governor. I have no doubt that he is the \nright person at the right time for this difficult job the people of his \nState have now entrusted to his care.\n  Sam has often told the story about a comment that was made to him by \nan older gentleman as he traveled throughout the State, listening to \nvoters at the end of his campaign for Governor. The message he heard \nfrom this one voter was simple but it spoke volumes. ``Be a good \ngovernor,'' was all he said. It's good advice but easier expressed than \ndone. Still, I have no doubt in the years to come Sam will be all of \nthat and so much more.\n  Diana joins in sending our best wishes to Sam and his special wife \nMary. Together they make up a remarkable team and they can and should \nbe very proud of all they have accomplished together.\n  Thank you for your willingness to serve and most of all, thanks for \nyour friendship. Although you won't be with us in the Senate Chamber \nnext year, you will be just down the road in the Governor's office in \nKansas. I hope you continue to let your thoughts and suggestions be \nknown as we take up those issues that were such a source of great \ninterest--and action--during your service here. Good luck in the months \nto come as you take on this new and very difficult challenge in your \nlife. God bless.\n\n\n                             arlen specter\n\n  Mr. President, soon the current session of Congress will be gaveled \nto a close. When that happens it will also bring to an end the Senate \ncareers of several of our colleagues. I know we will miss them and the \ncontributions they have made over the years to the debates and \ndeliberations they have participated in on the Senate floor and in \ncommittee.\n  In the years to come I know I will miss Arlen Specter. He has been \nsuch a strong and active presence in the Senate for so many years and \nin so many ways the coming session of Congress won't be the same \nwithout him.\n  His long and varied history as a public servant really began to take \nshape when he was asked to bring his skills and abilities to the Warren \nCommission's investigation of the circumstances surrounding the death \nof President John F. Kennedy. It was a difficult and challenging job, \nbut Arlen proved to be well up to the task. After studying and \nsurveying the evidence surrounding the President's murder, Arlen \ndeveloped the ``single bullet theory'' that proved to be the key to the \ncase that helped to explain what happened that day.\n  In the years soon after, Arlen's understanding of the law and all the \ntechnicalities and the countless details that surround it made him an \nideal candidate for the position of district attorney. In 1965 he ran \nfor the position in Philadelphia and served there for 8 years.\n  I have always believed that every life is a mixture of both success \nand disappointment. How we handle them both defines to a great extent \nthe quality of our lives.\n  That is why Arlen's unsuccessful reelection bid and a few \ndisappointments after that may have slowed him down--but it didn't stop \nhim. It was just a few years later that Arlen would run a successful \ncampaign for the Senate. It was here that Arlen really found his niche \nas he was soon in the middle of a number of high profile battles in the \nJudiciary Committee that won him the notice of his colleagues for his \nin-depth knowledge of Senate procedure, the law and our Constitution.\n  Arlen's reputation as a warrior has stayed with him over the years as \nhe has faced a number of challenges in committee and on the floor--as \nwell as a number of very difficult health issues in his life. He fought \nthem all with the same strength and heartfelt determination that would \nmake any fighter from Philadelphia proud.\n  Although Arlen credits his successful return to health to his \nenjoyment of squash, a difficult sport that he says kept him strong and \nhealthy enough to make it through each health crisis he faced, I credit \nhis good health to his strong Philadelphia roots.\n  As Arlen wrote in his book ``Never Give In,'' the key to so much of \nlife is to ``keep working and keep fighting.'' That is the only way to \nensure you will continue to make progress--or at least--make your \npresence felt in the war you are waging. That is how Arlen has lived \nhis life as he has pursued each goal he set his sights on. In the end, \nas he wrote in his book ``The tougher the battle, the sweeter the \nvictory.''\n  Arlen has now served five terms for a total of 30 years in the \nSenate. He has survived countless battles at the ballot box and a \nwealth of health issues that would have convinced a lesser individual \nthat the time had come to take it easy for a while. Not Arlen, however. \nHe has always been someone who fought with all his heart for the things \nhe believed in and as a result, he has known the sweetness of victory \nmany, many times in his life.\n  Arlen is not only the longest serving Senator in Pennsylvania's \nhistory he is also one of the most productive. He has left a remarkable \nlegacy and shoes that will be very difficult for any future \nPennsylvania Senator to fill. Together with his wife Joan they have \nbeen a team that has made a difference throughout their home state of \nPennsylvania and the Nation.\n  Thanks, Arlen, for your willingness to serve the people of your home \nState for so long and so well. Diana joins in sending our best wishes \nand our appreciation for your friendship to you both. I hope you will \nkeep in touch with me and with all your colleagues in the years to \ncome. Good luck. God bless.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, the final gavel will soon bring to a close the 111th \nSession of Congress. When it does, we will all return home to spend \ntime with our friends and families to celebrate the holidays. We will \nalso have a chance to meet with our constituents as we prepare for the \nchallenges the New Year and a new session of Congress will bring.\n  Before all of that occurs, we will have to say goodbye to several of \nour colleagues who will be returning home at the end of the year. We \nwill miss them and the important presence they have been in our lives \nand our work over the past few years. One such Senator I know we will \nmiss is Blanche Lincoln who will be returning home to her beloved \nArkansas.\n  During her service in the House and the Senate, Blanche was known for \nbeing one of the strongest voices for rural America. She understands \nthat what works well in the big cities and towns back East doesn't \nalways work so well in rural areas--like those in her State and mine.\n  Blanche came by her knowledge and understanding of the difficulties \nand challenges inherent in rural life from the days of her childhood. \nShe comes from a family that for seven generations has farmed rice, \nwheat, soybeans and cotton. She may be the only Senator who has walked \na rice levee.\n  Blanche is a woman of great faith, and she is very open about her \npersonal relationship with Jesus Christ. ``When I talk to Him,'' she \nsaid, ``it's pretty informal. I just lay it out there and say it like \nit is.'' That is the kind of straight talk that the people she \nrepresents found so appealing. Simply put, what life is like on a daily \nbasis for them has been the same for her.\n  Although she takes great pride in her title as Senator, she has \nanother that means just as much if not more to her--she's the mother of \ntwin boys. She works hard at both jobs--raising her family and making \nsure she is prepared for every issue that comes to the floor.\n  Because she was raised on a farm she has a great interest in what can \nbe done to help support the farming community of Arkansas and the rest \nof the United States. That is what made her such an important part of \nthe effort to draft a major farm policy overhaul. She was no stranger \nto the issue, having served as a subcommittee chair on\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nagriculture. She did such a good job with those issues she was honored \nfor her efforts with a ``Golden Plow'' award from the American Farm \nBureau Federation.\n  Her support for farmers across the country and her willingness to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to forge workable solutions to difficult \nproblems reflect the kind of principles that have helped to guide and \ndirect her during her service in the Senate and throughout her life. \nAnother is the importance of family--her own--and families just like \nhers all over the country.\n  Those aren't just my observations--they are common knowledge back in \nArkansas. When Blanche won a seat in the House of Representatives \neveryone was certain that the sky was the limit for her. After she had \nserved for 2 terms; however, she decided not to run for another when \nshe learned she would soon be giving birth to twins. She decided to \nreturn home so she could take care of her family while she waited for \nanother opportunity to serve the people of Arkansas to present itself--\nwhich is exactly what happened.\n  As her twins began to grow up, she was able to return to politics. \nShe made a run for Dale Bumpers' seat when he retired and was elected \nby a margin of 13 percent. Her victory made her the youngest woman ever \nelected to the Senate, an expression of the great confidence and trust \nthe people of her State had in her.\n  For 12 years Blanche has worn the title of Senator with great pride \nnot for her accomplishment, which was historic, but for the opportunity \nit gave her to make the world a better place for the people of \nArkansas, the people of rural America, the citizens of our great Nation \nand, of course, for those twins of hers.\n  I do not know what Blanche has planned for the days to come but I \nthink I can predict with safety and certainty that we haven't heard the \nlast from her--and that is a good thing.\n  Keep in touch, Blanche. We will always be pleased to learn what you \nare doing and your thoughts on the latest issues before the Senate. \nDiana and I send our best wishes to you and all your family. God bless \nand keep all of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10297-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Daniel Edward Duefield\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the life of a young veteran, Daniel Edward Duefield, who \ndied at the age of 24 on November 17 at his home in Grafton, NH. A \nveteran of the Iraq war, Daniel served his country on two tours of duty \nas a member of the 10th Mountain Division in the U.S. Army.\n  A native of New Hampshire, Daniel was born in Franklin on December \n14, 1985. He attended Mascoma Valley Regional Schools and graduated \nfrom Mascoma Valley Regional High School in June 2004. From playing \nvideo games with his nephew, Josh, to relaxing on a fishing trip, \nDaniel enjoyed spending time with family and friends.\n  He also felt a deep and abiding love for his country, enlisting in \nthe Army in June 2005. Daniel graduated from Army basic training in \nFort Benning, GA, and joined the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort \nDrum, NY. He was excited to have the opportunity to protect his country \nand family and succeeded in doing so throughout his service until he \nwas honorably discharged in July 2008. The American people will forever \nbe grateful to Daniel for his willingness to serve.\n  Daniel was a true patriot whose service to his country and family \nwill endure in our memories. No words can lessen the pain of losing \nthis young hero and brave New Hampshire son. It is now up to us to \nhonor him by continuing to improve the support we provide to our \nveterans and their families and ensuring America's continued security.\n  Daniel is survived by his parents, Harold ``Duffy'' E. Duefield III \nand Ruth E. Duefield of Grafton, NH; his fiance, Alicia Vasquezi of \nGrafton, NH; his grandfather, Harold E. Duefield, Jr., and extended \nfamily. This young patriot will be dearly missed.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nof Daniel Edward Duefield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10297-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10297-S10299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning, both the New York Times and \nthe Washington Post published strong editorials condemning the delays \nin Senate consideration of the President's nominees. The Washington \nPost wrote about the extraordinary and damaging treatment of Jim Cole, \nwho is nominated to serve as the No. 2 official at the Justice \nDepartment, a position with extensive responsibilities for national \nsecurity and law enforcement. The New York Times wrote about the \nacross-the-board objections to Senate consideration of judicial \nnominees, including dozens who have been reported without opposition by \nall Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Two weeks ago, I came to the floor and asked unanimous consent that \nthe Senate consider the long-pending nomination of Jim Cole to be the \nDeputy Attorney General, and that the Senate schedule for debate and a \nvote without further delay. Senator Sessions objected to my request and \nwe continue to be prevented from acting on this critical national \nsecurity nomination.\n  I will ask consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy statement today's editorial from the Washington Post entitled, ``An \nUnacceptable Delay.'' The editorial notes:\n\n       James M. Cole appeared well on his way in July to filling \n     the important No. 2 slot at the Justice Department after \n     earning a favorable vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       But the full Senate has yet to vote on Mr. Cole's \n     nomination to what is essentially the post of chief operating \n     officer of the mammoth department. The five months between \n     committee and floor vote appear to be the longest delay \n     endured by any deputy attorney general nominee.\n       The slow crawl comes courtesy of some Senate Republicans \n     who question Mr. Cole's approach to terrorism cases and his \n     role as an independent monitor for struggling financial giant \n     American International Group (AIG). These concerns should not \n     derail Mr. Cole's confirmation--and they certainly should not \n     be used to block a vote.\n\n  Mr. Cole's nomination has been pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar since it was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee in \nJuly. Those continuing to block this nomination from debate and a vote \nare wrong. As the editorial observes: ``There is no suggestion that Mr. \nCole suffers from the kind of ethical or legal problems that would \ndisqualify a nominee.'' If Senators disagree, they are free to vote \nagainst the nomination. But it is long past the time to end the \nstalling.\n  I noted 2 weeks ago that the letter from eight former Deputy \nAttorneys General of the United States who served in the \nadministrations of President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, \nPresident Clinton, President George W. Bush, as well as the current \nadministration, correctly observed that ``the Deputy is also a key \nmember of the president's national security team, a function that has \ngrown in importance and complexity in the years since the terror \nattacks of September 11.'' They are right. This is a dangerous game \nthat partisans are playing in stalling this important nomination in \nwhat is really an unprecedented way.\n  Mr. Cole's nomination has been pending five times longer than the \nlongest-pending Deputy Attorney General nomination in the last 20 \nyears. All four of the Deputy Attorneys General who served under \nPresident Bush were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of \n21 days after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. In fact, \nwe confirmed President Bush's first nomination to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral the day it was reported by the committee. We treated those \nnominations of President Bush with the ``enormous deference in \nexecutive branch appointments'' that the Post editorial today states \nthat every President deserves.\n  Jim Cole served as a career prosecutor at the Justice Department for \na dozen years, and has a well-deserved reputation for fairness, \nintegrity and toughness. As he demonstrated during his confirmation \nhearing months ago, he understands the issues of crime and national \nsecurity that are at the center of the Deputy Attorney General's job. \nNothing suggests that he will be anything other than a steadfast \ndefender of America's safety and security. His critics are wrong about \nJim Cole's approach to terrorism. He has testified strongly that the \nPresident should use every power and weapon and tool he possesses in \nthis fight.\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\n  His critics are also wrong to try to blame him for the actions of \nAIG. His role was limited to a monitor of other corporate functions and \nthere is no showing he did not perform his assignment well. In fact, \nformer Republican Senator Jack Danforth introduced him to the committee \nand gave him a strong endorsement. Let us hold those responsible at AIG \naccountable. Those who disagree are free to vote against the nomination \nof this good man if they choose, but they should end the holds and the \nstalling and let the Senate decide whether to consent to this \nnomination. As today's editorial concludes, ``have the decency to hold \na floor vote and give him a thumbs down.'' I am confident that when \nallowed a vote, he will be confirmed. He should be confirmed with \nbipartisan support and that vote should have been taken months ago. The \nmonths of delay of this nomination have been unnecessary, debilitating \nand wrong.\n  I urge those Senators who are objecting to debate and a vote to turn \naway from their destructive approach so that we can consider and \nconfirm Jim Cole immediately and he can finally begin his important \nwork to help protect the American people.\n  For over a year now, I have been urging all Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to join together to take action to end the crisis of \nskyrocketing judicial vacancies now threatening the ability of Federal \ncourts throughout the country to administer justice for the American \npeople. That has not happened. I have asked that we return to \nlongstanding practices that the Senate used to follow when considering \nnominations from Presidents of both parties. This has not happened. As \na result, 38 judicial nominations that have been favorably reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee continue to be stalled without final Senate \naction on the Senate's Executive Calendar.\n  I will ask consent to have printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement today's editorial from The New York Times entitled ``Advise \nand Obstruct.'' It rightly calls for an end to the across-the-board \nobstruction of President Obama's judicial nominations. The editorial \nnotes that the Senate has been blocked from considering a single \njudicial nomination since September 13. In fact, the Senate has only \nconsidered five Federal circuit and district court nominations since \nthe Fourth of July recess. Of the 80 judicial nominations reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee and sent to the Senate for final action in \norder to fill Federal circuit and district court vacancies, only 41 \nhave been considered. That is a historically low number and percentage. \nMeanwhile, dozens of judicial nominees with well-established \nqualifications and the support of their home state Senators from both \nparties have been ready and kept waiting for Senate consideration all \nyear.\n  The editorial also points to the high costs of obstruction ``at a \ntime when an uncommonly high number of judicial vacancies is \nthreatening the sound functioning of the nation's courts.'' The \neditorial is right. The vacancies on the Federal courts around the \ncountry have doubled over the last 2 years and now are at the \nhistorically high level of 111. Fifty-two of these vacancies are deemed \njudicial emergency vacancies by the nonpartisan Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts. The Senate has received letters from courts around \nthe country calling for help to address their crushing caseloads, \nincluding letters from the Chief Judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and the U.S. District Courts in California, Colorado, Illinois \nand the District of Columbia. They have pleaded with us to end the \nblockade and confirm judges to fill vacancies in their courts.\n  The Times editorial accurately portrays a grim picture of where we \nare in considering these nominations and also points the way forward:\n\n       At this point, the Senate has approved 41--barely half--of \n     President Obama's federal and district court nominees \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee. Compare that with the \n     first two years of the George W. Bush administration when the \n     Senate approved all 100 of the judicial nominations approved \n     by the committee. The final days of the lame-duck session are \n     a chance to significantly improve on this dismal record and \n     to lift the judicial confirmation process out of the partisan \n     muck.\n\n  The editorial calls for a vote on all 38 judicial nominations \nawaiting final action by the Senate. I agree and have been calling for \nvotes on all of these nominations. We should do as we did during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office and consider every judicial \nnomination favorably reported by the Senate. During those two years the \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported 100 judicial nominations and the \nSenate confirmed every one of them, including controversial circuit \ncourt nominations reported during the lameduck session in 2002. In \ncontrast, we have during President Obama's first 2 years favorably \nreported 80 circuit and district court nominations, but considered only \n41, barely half.\n  I have been trying to end this obstruction, yet it continues. \nAgreements to debate and consider nominations have been sought \nrepeatedly, but the Republican leadership has objected time and time \nagain.\n  Of the 38 judicial nominations currently stalled on the Executive \nCalendar, 29 of them were reported unanimously, without a single \nnegative vote from the 19 Republican and Democratic members of the \ncommittee. Another three were reported with strong bipartisan support \nand only a small number of no votes. Of these 32 bipartisan, consensus \nnominees, 17 of them were nominated to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies. They should all have been confirmed within days of being \nreported, not obstructed with weeks and months of delay. It will be a \ntravesty if they are not all confirmed before the 111th Congress \nadjourns.\n  These consensus nominees include six unanimously reported circuit \ncourt nominees, and another circuit court nominee supported by 17 of \nthe 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee. The nomination of Judge \nAlbert Diaz of North Carolina, a respected and experienced jurist who \nserved in the Armed Forces, for a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nFourth Circuit has been stalled for 11 months despite the support of \nhis home state Senators from both parties. Judge Ray Lohier of New York \nwould fill one of the four current vacancies on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit. He is another former prosecutor with \nsupport from both sides of the aisle. His confirmation has been stalled \nfor no good reason for more than seven months. Scott Matheson is a \nnominee from Utah supported by Senator Hatch; he was reported without \nopposition over 6 months ago. Mary Murguia, a nominee from Arizona \nsupported by Senator Kyl, was reported without opposition over 4 months \nago. Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio is nominated to the Federal \nCircuit and was reported without opposition nearly 3 months ago. \nJustice James Graves of Mississippi, whose nomination has the strong \nsupport of his home State Republican Senators, was reported unanimously \nto serve on the Fifth Circuit. Also pending is a seventh consensus \ncircuit court nomination, Susan Carney of Connecticut, who was reported \nwith strong bipartisan support to fill another judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Second Circuit.\n  The nominees currently being blocked from consideration also include \n30 district court nominations, some reported as long ago as February. \nThe Republican blockade of these nominations is a dramatic departure \nfrom the traditional practice of considering them expeditiously and \nwith deference to the home State Senators. These 30 district court \nnominees include 23 nominees reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Fifteen of these nominations are for seats designated as \njudicial emergencies. All of these nominees have well established \nqualifications and are at the top of the legal community in their home \nstates. All have put their lives and practices on hold in an attempt to \nserve their country and their community. There is no cause for \ncontinuing to block the Senate from considering their nominations and \nno precedent for extending these delays further.\n  In addition, I have urged for many months that the Senate debate and \na vote on those few nominees that Republican Senators decided to oppose \nin committee. These nominees include Benita Pearson of Ohio, William \nMartinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Edward Chen of \nCalifornia, John McConnell of Rhode Island, and Goodwin Liu of \nCalifornia. As I have said before, I have reviewed their records and \nconsidered their character,\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\nbackground and qualifications. I have heard the criticisms of the \nRepublican Senators on the Judiciary Committee as they have voted \nagainst this handful of nominees. I disagree, and believe the Senate \nwould vote, as I have, to confirm them. Each of these nominees have \nbeen reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, several of them two \nor three times, and each deserves an up-or-down vote. That they will \nnot be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them from \nconsideration by the Senate or serving on the bench.\n  All 38 of these judicial nominations should have an up-or-down vote, \njust as all 100 of President Bush's judicial nominations reported by \nthe committee in his first 2 years had a vote in the Senate. Even if \nRepublican Senators will not follow our example and treat President \nObama's nominees as we treated President Bush's, even if they will not \nabide by the Golden Rule, they should at least listen to their own \nstatements from just a few years ago. They said that every judicial \nnomination reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee was entitled to \nan up-or-down vote. They spoke then about the constitutional duty of \nthe Senate to consider every judicial nomination. The Constitution has \nnot changed; it has not been amended. The change from the days in which \nthey made those statements is that the American people elected a new \nPresident and he is making the nominations. In fact, President Obama \nhas reached out and worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle. \nWe have not sought to proceed on one of his judicial nominees without \nthe support of both home State Senators.\n  Time is running out in this Congress to turn away from the disastrous \nstrategy of blocking nominations across the board. It is time to return \nto the Senate's longstanding traditions and reject this obstruction. \nThe Federal courts and the American people who depend on the courts for \njustice are suffering.\n  Today, December 15, is the anniversary of the ratification of the \nBill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Let us renew our commitment to the Constitution, to our \nBill or Rights, and to our liberty by turning away from the destructive \npartisanship that has delayed Senate consideration of these \nnominations. Let us act in the spirit of the Founders, in the spirit of \nthe season, and move forward together to consider and vote on these \nimportant nominations of a Deputy Attorney General and U.S. judges.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe articles to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 15, 2010]\n\n                         An Unacceptable Delay\n\n       James M. Cole appeared well on his way in July to filling \n     the important No. 2 slot at the Justice Department after \n     earning a favorable vote from the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       But the full Senate has yet to vote on Mr. Cole's \n     nomination to what is essentially the post of chief operating \n     officer of the mammoth department. The five months between \n     committee and floor vote appear to be the longest delay \n     endured by any deputy attorney general nominee.\n       The slow crawl comes courtesy of some Senate Republicans \n     who question Mr. Cole's approach to terrorism cases and his \n     role as an independent monitor for struggling financial giant \n     American International Group (AIG). These concerns should not \n     derail Mr. Cole's confirmation--and they certainly should not \n     be used to block a vote.\n       Mr. Cole, who is in private practice and spent some 13 \n     years in the Justice Department, criticized the Bush \n     administration in a 2002 opinion piece in Legal Times for \n     some of its post-Sept. 11, 2001, tactics, including the use \n     of ``military tribunals to try noncitizens for terrorist \n     crimes.'' Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), ranking member on the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, condemned Mr. Cole for labeling \n     the attack a crime rather than an act of war; he also \n     questioned the wisdom of embracing ``a law enforcement \n     approach.''\n       ``You capture enemies. You arrest criminals,'' Mr. Sessions \n     said during the confirmation hearings. Mr. Cole said he \n     believes that recently reconstituted military commissions are \n     a legitimate option, but he rightly refused to rule out \n     federal court prosecutions for some suspects--an approach \n     that mirrors that of the president and the attorney general.\n       Some Republicans also are troubled by Mr. Cole's work, \n     starting in 2006, as a special monitor for AIG. Mr. Cole made \n     several suggestions about needed improvements in AIG's \n     business practices, but he appears not to have addressed the \n     risky and unregulated credit default swaps that led to AIG's \n     collapse and subsequent government bailout because they were \n     not part of his portfolio.\n       The president deserves enormous deference in executive \n     branch appointments. There is no suggestion that Mr. Cole \n     suffers from the kind of ethical or legal problems that would \n     disqualify a nominee. If Republicans nevertheless find Mr. \n     Cole unacceptable, they should have the decency to hold a \n     floor vote and give him a thumbs down.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 14, 2010]\n\n                          Advise and Obstruct\n\n       The Senate's power to advise and consent on federal \n     judicial nominations was intended as a check against sorely \n     deficient presidential choices. It is not a license to \n     exercise partisan influence over these vital jobs by blocking \n     confirmation of entire slates of well-qualified nominees \n     offered by a president of the opposite party.\n       Nevertheless, at a time when an uncommonly high number of \n     judicial vacancies is threatening the sound functioning of \n     the nation's courts, Senate Republicans are persisting in \n     playing an obstructionist game. (These, by the way, are the \n     same Senate Republicans who threatened to ban filibusters if \n     they did not get an up-or-down vote on every one of President \n     George W. Bush's nominees, including some highly problematic \n     ones.)\n       Because of Republican delaying tactics, qualified Obama \n     nominees who have been reported out of the Judiciary \n     Committee have been consigned to spend needless weeks and \n     months in limbo, waiting for a vote from the full Senate.\n       Senate Republicans seek to pin blame for the abysmal pace \n     of filling judicial vacancies on President Obama's slowness \n     in making nominations. And, no question, Mr. Obama's laggard \n     performance in this sphere is a contributing factor. \n     Currently, there are 50 circuit and district court vacancies \n     for which Obama has made no nomination. But that hardly \n     explains away the Republicans' pattern of delay over the past \n     two years on existing nominees, or the fact that Senate \n     Republicans have consented to a vote on only a single \n     judicial nomination since Congress returned from its August \n     recess.\n       At this point, the Senate has approved 41--barely half--of \n     President Obama's federal and district court nominees \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee. Compare that with the \n     first two years of the George W. Bush administration when the \n     Senate approved all 100 of the judicial nominations approved \n     by the committee. The final days of the lame-duck session are \n     a chance to significantly improve on this dismal record and \n     to lift the judicial confirmation process out of the partisan \n     muck.\n       Of the 38 well-qualified judicial nominees awaiting action \n     by the full Senate, nearly all cleared the Judiciary \n     Committee either unanimously or with just one or two \n     dissenting votes. Some nominees have been waiting for Senate \n     action for nearly a year. Senator Mitch McConnell, the \n     minority leader, should allow confirmation of all 34 nominees \n     considered noncontroversial, including the 15 nominees \n     cleared by the committee since the November election.\n       There are four other nominees who were approved by the \n     committee over party-line Republican opposition. They, too, \n     deserve a prompt vote rather than requiring President Obama \n     to start the process over again by renominating them when the \n     next Congress begins. That short list of controversial \n     nominees includes Goodwin Liu, an exceptionally well-\n     qualified law professor and legal scholar who would be the \n     only Asian-American serving as an active judge on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. His potential \n     to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy seems to be the main \n     thing fueling Republican opposition to his nomination.\n       Mr. McConnell is said to be negotiating a deal with Senator \n     Harry Reid, the majority leader, that allows for confirmation \n     of 19 nominees approved by the committee before the election \n     but denies consideration by the full Senate to the others. \n     That would be a disservice to the judicial system, to Mr. \n     Obama's nominees and to the idea that bipartisanship should \n     exist, at last, in the advice-and-consent process for federal \n     judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10299-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10299-S10300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL HOME CARE AND HOSPICE MONTH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, November is National Home Care and \nHospice Month, which gives us the opportunity to honor the home health \nand hospice caregivers and volunteers who make such a remarkable \ndifference in the lives of their patients and their families. The \nhighly skilled and compassionate care that home health and hospice \nagencies provide has helped to keep families together and enabled \nmillions of our most frail and vulnerable individuals to avoid \nhospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be in the \ncomfort and security of their own homes.\n  Home health and hospice have consistently proven to be compassionate \nand cost-effective alternatives to institutional care. In fact, a \nrecent survey conducted for the Maine chapter of\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nAARP found that 9 out of 10 Mainers would prefer to receive services at \nhome as opposed to a nursing home or other residential care facility. \nMoreover, by helping patients to avoid more costly hospitals and \nnursing homes, home health and hospice save Medicare, Medicaid, and \nprivate insurers millions of dollars each year.\n  Over the past several years, I have had the opportunity to meet and \nvisit with a number of home health and hospice patients and providers \naround my State. I have seen firsthand what a difference the highly \nskilled and compassionate care that these health professionals provide \nmakes to the lives of their patients and families. That is why I am \nsuch a committed and passionate advocate for home health and hospice \ncare. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to these wonderful health care professionals and volunteers \nduring the month of November as we celebrate National Home Health and \nHospice Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10300-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MELISSA SHUTE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to a \ntrusted member of my staff who will be departing the Senate. Melissa \nShute has served as my legislative counsel, handling issues involving \nenergy, natural resources, and public lands. I have been fortunate to \nhave a wonderful tradition of outstanding staffers to handle my energy \nand environmental issues; however, the problem with good staff is that \nthey often get pulled away.\n  Melissa is no exception. She came to me in 2008 after serving as lead \ncounsel to one of our former Members whom I highly regard, Senator Pete \nDominici, on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \nWhile on the committee, Melissa was a key player on legislation to \nincrease domestic energy production in the United States. Melissa has \ndeveloped an expertise in energy and environmental issues and the \nimportance they play in our economy. She is an enthusiastic warrior for \nthe principles we share.\n  Melissa has provided critical counsel to me regarding major issues in \nnuclear, coal, and renewable fuel research and development. She also \ntook a leading role in helping Alabamians living on the gulf coast \nduring the tragic oil spill. Melissa and my energy team went above and \nbeyond to take the steps necessary to help those impacted by the \nenvironmental disaster receive the support and information they need to \nbegin the road of clean-up and recovery.\n  A graduate of the University of Tulsa's College of Law, Melissa has \ndemonstrated a sound legal mind in analyzing legislative proposals that \nwould impact current moratoria on off-shore drilling. She understands \nthat we need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil and find new \nways to tap the rich energy supplies our country has to offer.\n  She has been a great partner as we have worked to reduce the huge \nwealth transfer from the United States to purchase foreign oil, to \nreduce pollution, to produce energy at the lowest possible prices, such \nas nuclear power, and to create jobs in America. It has been a good \nrun.\n  Mr. President, I express my deepest gratitude to Melissa for all of \nher efforts and leadership, and I wish her well as she moves on to a \nnew chapter in her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10300-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10300-S10301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN BOYD\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to say goodbye to one of \nthe most esteemed members of my staff. Stephen Boyd, an exceptional \nindividual with a deep devotion to the State of Alabama, will be \nleaving my office to become chief of staff for a new member of the \nAlabama delegation, Congressman-elect Martha Roby.\n  Stephen came to my office 7 years ago right out of law school. I was \nimmediately impressed not only by his talent but by his tenacity. No \nmatter how difficult the task given him he would pursue it with vigor, \nand he would not relent until he arrived at a solution. Stephen sees \nevery obstacle as a challenge to overcome.\n  In his first post as my legislative assistant for energy issues, he \nworked on efforts to establish the Coastal Impact Assistance Program. \nThat program became law through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Stephen \nalso played a significant role in developing the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2006.\n  Early on, Stephen also recognized the need to pursue alternative \nenergy sources in order to diminish our dependence on foreign oil. \nThrough his efforts he brought considerable attention to switchgrass as \na renewable energy resource, ultimately leading to switchgrass' \npotential being recognized in President Bush's 2006 State of the Union \nAddress.\n  One of Stephen's most valuable assets is his ability to anticipate \nproblems and to prepare for the unpredictable. Stephen was the point \nperson for our office response when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. But \nbefore that disastrous hurricane hit, Stephen had already implemented \nan office action plan to make sure we could quickly and efficiently \nrespond to an emergency.\n  In the last 4 years, Stephen has served first as my press secretary, \nfollowed by a swift promotion to communications director. He played a \nkey role in overseeing office communications during some of the most \ndifficult and challenging issues our country has faced in a long time--\nfrom wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to the recent economic crisis, to \nthe disastrous oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Stephen also made an invaluable contribution in two Supreme Court \nconfirmations, helping deliver a crucial message about preserving the \nintegrity of America's courts--defending them from the corruption of \npolitics and grounding them in the firm bedrock of our Constitution.\n  Given his myriad accomplishments and his stellar service to this \noffice, it is no surprise that Stephen is highly regarded by his \ncolleagues in the Senate. Allow me to share what others have said:\n  Don Stewart, communications director for Senate minority leader Mitch \nMcConnell, said, ``Stephen has shown the kind of calm leadership that \nwas needed in one of the most active periods I've ever seen in my time \nhere. He doesn't yell and scream, he just gets it done.''\n  Josh Holmes, staff director for Senate minority leader Mitch \nMcConnell's Republican Communications Center, said, ``Stephen is one of \nthe rare commodities in Washington who prefers achieving results over \npersonal accolades. He's a consummate professional and effective \nadvocate who has been an absolute pleasure to work with.''\n  Rick Dearborn, my chief of staff, said, ``I am proud to have worked \nalongside Stephen Boyd. I have always admired his attention to detail \nand the great clarity of his perspective. He has a commonsense approach \nI've witnessed him apply to all manner of complex problems to be \nsolved, issues to be decided or given further thought.\n  So much of what I believe has guided him to excel has been his basic \nhonesty, his strong core integrity and a sincere commitment to serve \nthe people of Alabama on behalf of Senator Sessions through his various \nroles in our office.\n  Our loss in the Senate is Martha Roby's gain in the House and the \nsecond District of Alabama. He now assumes a key position within our \nstaff delegation, as the Congresswoman's new chief of staff. She could \nnot have made a better choice.''\n  Matt Miner, staff director for the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, \n``Stephen Boyd has been a tremendous asset to the Judiciary Committee \nduring Senator Sessions' tenure as ranking member. Through two Supreme \nCourt confirmations and numerous national security debates, Stephen's \ncalm and thoughtful work as communications director helped focus the \nnational debate and convey the Republican message. He is one of the \nmost talented people with whom I have worked on Capitol Hill, and I \nwish him all the best in his next endeavor.''\n  Brian Benczkowski, former staff director for the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee said, ``It was a professional and personal pleasure to work \nwith someone as gifted and hard-working as Stephen Boyd. Stephen has an \nuncanny ability to analyze any given subject like a top-notch lawyer, \nwhile also applying a good dose of Alabama common\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\nsense to the problem, and then communicating the result in clear and \nunmistakable terms. These skills were an invaluable resource for the \nSenate Judiciary Committee during my tenure, particularly during the \nSotomayor and Kagan nominations. If there is a silver lining in his \ndeparture from Senator Sessions' staff, it is that he will continue his \npublic service for the people of Alabama. His keen judgment and \nexcellent personal integrity will be an asset to Congresswoman Roby, \nand I know he will be missed by his colleagues in the Senate.''\n  Alan Hanson, chief of staff to Senator Richard Shelby, said, ``It is \na credit to Stephen's abilities and work ethic that he has so rapidly \nadvanced in his Capitol Hill career. Having worked with him for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears and known him much longer, I can personally attest that he is a \nsingularly talented and capable jack-of-all-trades. Senator Sessions' \nloss is truly Congresswoman Roby's gain, and I look forward to \nwitnessing the great things Stephen will accomplish in his new role in \nthe House of Representatives.''\n  Sarah Haley, press secretary for Senator Sessions, said, ``Stephen \nBoyd is a man of scrupulous character, sound ethics, and servant \nleadership. It has been a privilege to work under him. Stephen will be \ngreatly missed by all of us.''\n  Stephen Miller, press secretary for the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nsaid, ``Stephen Boyd is a brilliant communicator, operating at a truly \nelite level. And yet he is the furthest thing from an elitist. \nThoughtful, genuine, sincere--these are the traits so familiar to those \nwho know him. I am proud to have had the chance to work with Stephen \nBoyd. But I am prouder still to call him a friend.''\n  Ryan Patmintra, press secretary for Senator Jon Kyl, said, \n``Stephen's background in both policy and communications made him one \nof the top-notch Senate communicators on either side of the aisle. His \nability to go beyond talking points and walk reporters through our \narguments served us well. We were lucky to have him on our team. His \npresence and expertise will be sorely missed in the Senate.''\n  Cindy Hayden, who served with Stephen Boyd during her tenure as my \nchief counsel, said, ``Stephen displays unwavering devotion to Senator \nSessions, to the people of Alabama, and to his principles. A talented \nlawyer and a trusted colleague, Stephen possesses a likeability even \nhis opponents find hard to resist. I am confident his future colleagues \nwill enjoy working with him as much as I did.''\n  I will miss Stephen. He was always thinking down the road, \nanticipating programs, and protecting me and the Senate from unwise \nactions. That kind of attention to detail and good judgment is rare and \nnoteworthy.\n  From the first day he joined my staff, Stephen has been a tremendous \nasset. He has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues, and \nhas proven himself as a leader. His journey is only beginning, and I \nwish him all the best in the months and years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10301-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10301-S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEVIN LANDY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish today to bid farewell and \nexpress my special thanks to Kevin Landy for his 13 years of \nextraordinary service on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Kevin, presently the committee's chief counsel and my longest serving \ncommittee staff member, is leaving the Senate this month. But I am \nhappy to say he will continue his career in public service as the \nDirector of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of \nDetention and Policy Planning, an office responsible for formulating \nand implementing reforms at immigration detention facilities.\n  As a Senator, I am privileged to work with dedicated Senate staffers \nlike Kevin Landy, who want to take their talents, skills, and passions \nand put them to work for the American people.\n  Thomas Jefferson once asked the question: ``What duty does a citizen \nowe to the government that secures the society in which he lives?''\n  Answering his own question, Jefferson said: ``A nation that rests on \nthe will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its \ninstitutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public service \nshould feel an obligation to make that contribution.''\n  Kevin has answered his Nation's call and leaves the Senate with an \nexemplary record of achievement on behalf of the American people, on a \nwide range of issues. In particular, I'd like to highlight Kevin's role \nas my lead staff member on four bills that I count among my most \nimportant legislative accomplishments.\n  In the 107th Congress, Kevin successfully and simultaneously \nstewarded to passage two very different pieces of legislation. One of \nthose bills established a new framework for the government's uses of \nthe Internet and passed after a great deal of careful consensus \nbuilding; the other bill established the 9/11 Commission to \nindependently investigate the circumstances of the terrorist attacks \nand was enacted after a vigorous and often contentious campaign to \nsurmount the administration's resistance.\n  First, Kevin drafted the E-Government Act, which I introduced in May \nof 2001, and which called for greater citizen access to government \ninformation, services, and regulatory proceedings over the Internet; \nbetter management of information technology; and greater protections \nfor privacy and security.\n  When Kevin began work on this initiative he was trained as a lawyer \nand had no government IT background. Yet he worked meticulously with \nevery relevant group and constituency first to become fully informed \nand then to ensure their concerns were addressed. More importantly, \nKevin spent months negotiating with OMB officials to overcome the \nadministration's initial opposition. The work paid off when the \nlegislation passed both the House and the Senate by unanimous consent \non the same day, November 15, 2002, and was subsequently signed into \nlaw the next month.\n  Some of Kevin's most significant work for our country was on \nlegislation creating and reforming the institutions charged with the \ndefense of our homeland from the terrorist threat.\n  Soon after the tragic September 11 attacks, Senator McCain and I \ncalled for an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the \ncircumstances surrounding the terrorist attacks and to provide \nrecommendations designed to guard against future acts of terrorism. \nKevin helped draft the legislation to establish the 9/11 Commission, \nwhich I introduced with Senator McCain on December 20, 2001.\n  At first we had no other cosponsors, and faced the opposition of the \nadministration. But over the next year Kevin worked closely with the \nfamilies of the victims of 9/11, who lobbied arduously for our \nlegislation both in the Halls of Congress and in the media, and the \nadministration finally reversed its position the night before the \nSenate voted to approve the Commission by a vote of 90 to 8. \nContentious negotiations with White House officials followed, but on \nNovember 27, 2002, the legislation establishing a 9/11 Commission was \nenacted.\n  Kevin's effectiveness and his strong relations with 9/11 family \nmembers stood him in good stead when I asked him to lead an even \ngreater challenge 2 years later: helping win enactment of legislation \nto implement the Commission's ambitious and wide-ranging \nrecommendations.\n  Following the release of the 9/11 Commission's report on July 22, \n2004, Kevin led the combined efforts of the staffs of four Senators to \nquickly draft legislation, S. 2774, that implemented all of the \nCommission's recommendations, covering not only comprehensive reform of \nthe intelligence community and the creation of a National \nCounterterrorism Center but also information sharing, terrorist travel, \nborder security, and secure identification, among other topics. Because \nof the determined efforts of Kevin and his colleagues, I was able to \njoin with Senators McCain, Bayh, and Specter in introducing the \nlegislation on September 7, just 6 weeks after the Commission's \nrecommendations had been released.\n  Kevin continued to play a leadership role as I worked with the \ncommittee chairman and my close friend, Senator Susan Collins, to draft \nlegislation that focused on the Commission's intelligence reform \nrecommendations, S. 2845. On the Senate floor, provisions of the two \nbills were merged as we faced a blizzard of amendments and tough votes, \nbefore we won an overwhelming\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nSenate victory. An arduous conference followed, as several House \ncommittee chairmen adamantly opposed the bill--through it all Kevin \nfought to uphold the principles laid down in our legislation. We \nprevailed, resulting in the historic enactment on December 17, 2004, of \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, IRTPA.\n  We faced even more complex procedural hurdles in 2007, when Senator \nCollins and I led the efforts of multiple Senate committees to assemble \nand enact provisions that built on what we had accomplished with IRTPA, \nmandating counterterrorism improvements in areas such as terrorist \ntravel, communications interoperability, and aviation and maritime \nsecurity. By then the committee's chief counsel, Kevin had demonstrated \nhis skills at legislative maneuvering in a variety of circumstances. I \ncalled on him once again to help coordinate our team as we pushed \nthrough a difficult markup, a lively Senate debate, and a fiercely \ncontested conference, at which approximately 15 Senate and House \ncommittees claimed jurisdiction and joined the fray. Our work resulted \nin ambitious legislation, known as the ``Implementing Recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007,'' enacted on August 3, 2007.\n  I have described his biggest accomplishments in the areas of national \nsecurity and good government, but through his entire career Kevin has \nalso shown a passion for the pursuit of justice, including justice for \nthe powerless. Upon graduating from Amherst College, Kevin went to work \ndefending the rights of prisoners to humane conditions in the Texas \npenal system. Then after graduating from Yale Law School, one of \nKevin's jobs took him to Cambodia, where he worked with that nation's \njudges and prosecutors in an effort to help improve the rule of law as \nthat nation struggled to emerge from its brutal totalitarian past.\n  On the committee, Kevin has worked tirelessly to improve the \ntreatment of asylum-seekers who often languish in county jails and \nother immigrant detention facilities as they pursue their claims. He \ndrafted the first bill to address immigration detention reform, the \nSecure and Safe Detention and Asylum Act, and in 2007 we won Senate \npassage of the bill as an amendment to ultimately unsuccessful \nimmigration reform legislation. Although legislative progress in this \narea has proven elusive, Kevin's work helped to bring greater attention \nto the need for reforms. He has now embraced the opportunity to support \nthe detention reform initiatives being undertaken at the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I have benefited greatly from Kevin's commitment to my goals and to \nthe pursuit of excellence while achieving them. I want to thank him \nagain for his hard work, his long hours, and selfless persistence in \npursuit of worthy legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10302-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HAWAII EDUCATORS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Her earnest dedication to and enthusiasm for \nservice to her fellow citizens has set an example for all to follow.\n  Carol's career began when she joined Jim Abdnor's successful Senate \ncampaign against George McGovern in 1980. Her passion was pushed to a \nnew level when Carol's husband Curt passed away at an early age in \n1987. It was this event which prompted her to undertake the challenge \nof running for Minnehaha county commissioner. The level of courage and \nperseverance she demonstrated through her first campaign paid off with \nan overwhelming victory. In her five subsequent terms as a county \ncommissioner, she has shown unceasing dedication and compassion to \nserving her constituents. Because of this remarkable resolve, Carol has \nmade praiseworthy accomplishments in combating homelessness, improving \njuvenile services, and, above all, working to improve the effectiveness \nand efficiency of county operations.\n  Carol's service has benefitted the people of Minnehaha County over \nher many years of service.

This legislation was \noriginally filed as an amendment, number 4693, to the FDA Food Safety \nModernization Act S. 510, but did not receive a vote. Therefore, before \nthe 111th Congress ends, I am introducing it as a stand-alone bill \nwhich may be taken up in another Congress.\n  Anabolic steroids--masquerading as body building dietary \nsupplements--are sold to millions of Americans in shopping malls and \nover the Internet even though these products put at grave risk the \nhealth and safety of Americans who use them. The harm from these \nsteroid-tainted supplements is real. In its July 28, 2009 public health \nadvisory, the FDA described the health risk of these types of products \nto include serious liver injury, stroke, kidney failure and pulmonary \nembolism. The FDA also warned:\n\n       [A]anabolic steroids may cause other serious long-term \n     adverse health consequences in men, women, and children. \n     These include shrinkage of the testes and male infertility, \n     masculinization of women, breast enlargement in males, short \n     stature in children, adverse effects on blood lipid levels, \n     and increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n  New anabolic steroids--often called designer steroids--are coming on \nthe market every day, and FDA and DEA are unable to keep pace and \neffectively stop these products from reaching consumers.\n  At the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs hearing I \nchaired on September 29, 2009, representatives from FDA and DEA, as \nwell as the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, testified that there is a cat and \nmouse game going on between unscrupulous supplement makers and law \nenforcement--with the bad actors engineering more and more new anabolic \nsteroids by taking the known chemical formulas of anabolic steroids \nlisted as controlled substances in Schedule III and then changing the \nchemical composition just slightly, perhaps by a molecule or two. These \nproducts are rapidly put on the market--in stores and over the \nInternet--without testing and proving the safety and efficacy of these \nnew products. There is no pre-notification to, or pre-market approval \nby, federal agencies occurring here. These bad actors are able to sell \nand make millions in profits from their designer steroids because while \nit takes them only weeks to design a new steroid by tweaking a formula \nfor a banned anabolic steroid, it takes literally years for DEA to have \nthe new anabolic steroid classified as a controlled substance so DEA \ncan police it.\n  The FDA witness at the hearing, Mike Levy, Director of the Division \nof New Drugs and Labeling Compliance, acknowledged that this is a \n``challenging area'' for FDA. He testified that for FDA it is \n``difficult to find the violative products and difficult to act on \nthese problems.'' The DEA witness, Joseph T. Rannazzisi, Deputy \nAssistant Administrator for DEA, was even blunter. When I questioned \nhim at the hearing, Mr. Rannazzisi admitted that ``at the present time \nI don't think we are being effective at controlling these drugs.'' He \ndescribed the process as ``extremely frustrating'' because ``by the \ntime we get something to the point where it will be administratively \nscheduled [as a controlled substance], there's two to three [new] \nsubstances out there.''\n  The failure of enforcement is caused by the complexity of the \nregulations, statutes and science. Either the Food Drug and Cosmetic \nAct, which provides jurisdiction for FDA, or the Controlled Substances \nAct, which provides jurisdiction for DEA, or both, can be applicable \ndepending on the ingredients of the substance. Under a 1994 amendment \nto the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, called the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act, DSHEA, dietary supplements, unlike new drug \napplications, are not closely scrutinized and do not require Pre-market \napproval by the FDA before the products can be sold. Pre-market \nnotification for dietary supplements is required only if the product \ncontains new dietary ingredients, meaning products that were not on the \nU.S. market before DSHEA passed in 1994.\n\n  If the FDA determines that a dietary supplement is a steroid, it has \nseveral enforcement measures available to use. FDA may treat the \nproduct as an unapproved new drug, or as an adulterated dietary \nsupplement under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Misdemeanor violations \nof the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act may apply, unless there is evidence \nof intent to defraud or mislead, a requirement for a felony charge. \nHowever, given the large number of dietary supplement products on the \nmarket, it is far beyond the manpower of the FDA to inspect every \nproduct to find, and take action against, those that violate the law--\nas the FDA itself has acknowledged.\n  The better enforcement route is a criminal prosecution under the \nControlled Substances Act. However, the process to classify a new \nanabolic steroid as a controlled substance under Schedule III is \ndifficult, costly and time consuming, requiring years to complete. \nCurrent law requires that to classify a substance as an anabolic \nsteroid, DEA must demonstrate that the substance is both chemically and \npharmacologically related to testosterone. The chemical analysis is the \nmore straightforward procedure, as it requires the agency to conduct an \nanalysis to determine the chemical structure of the new substance to \nsee if it is related to testosterone. The pharmacological analysis, \nwhich must be outsourced, is more costly, difficult, and can take years \nto complete. It requires both in vitro and in vivo analyses, the latter \nis an animal study. DEA must then perform a comprehensive review of \nexisting peer-reviewed literature.\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n  Even after DEA has completed the multi-year scientific evaluation \nprocess, the agency must embark on a lengthy regulatory review and \npublic-comment process, which typically delays by another year or two \nthe time it takes to bring a newly emerged anabolic steroid under \ncontrol. As part of this latter process, DEA must conduct interagency \nreviews, which means sending the studies and reports to the Department \nof Justice, DOJ, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, provide public \nnotification of the proposed rule, allow for a period of public \ncomment, review and comment on all public comments, write a final rule \nexplaining why the agency agreed or did not agree with the public \ncomments, send the final rule and agency comments back to DOJ, OMB and \nHHS, and then publish the final rule, all in accordance with the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. To date, under these cumbersome \nprocedures, DEA has only been able to classify three new anabolic \nsteroids as controlled substances and that process--completed only \nafter the September 29, 2010 Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing--\ntook more than 5 years to finish.\n  It is clear that the current complex and cumbersome regulatory system \nhas failed to protect consumers from underground chemists who easily \nand rapidly produce designer anabolic steroids by slightly changing the \nchemical composition of the anabolic steroids already included on \nSchedule III as controlled substances. The story of Jareem Gunter, a \nyoung college athlete who testified at the hearing, illustrates the \nsystem's failure. To improve his athletic performance four years ago, \nJareem purchased in a nutrition store a dietary supplement called \nSuperdrol, a product he researched extensively on the Internet and \nbelieved was safe. Unfortunately it was not. Superdrol contained an \nanabolic steroid which to this day is still not included in the list of \ncontrolled substances. After using Superdrol for just several weeks, \nJareem came close to dying because this product--which he thought would \nmake him stronger and healthier--seriously and permanently injured his \nliver. He spent four weeks in the hospital and has never been able to \nreturn to complete his college education.\n  To close the loopholes in the present laws that allow the creation \nand easy distribution of deadly new anabolic steroids masquerading as \ndietary supplements, I am introducing today The Designer Anabolic \nSteroid Control Act of 2010. The bill simplifies the definition of \nanabolic steroid to more effectively target designer anabolic steroids, \nand permits the Attorney General to issue faster temporary and \npermanent orders adding recently emerged anabolic steroids to the list \nof anabolic steroids in Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  Under the bill, if a substance is not listed in Schedule III of the \nControlled Substances Act but has a chemical structure substantially \nsimilar to one of the already listed and banned anabolic steroids, the \nnew substance will be considered to be an anabolic steroid if it was \nintended to affect the structure or function of the body like the \nbanned anabolic steroids do. In other words, DEA will not have to \nperform the complex and time consuming pharmacological analysis to \ndetermine how the substance will affect the structure and function of \nthe body, as long as the agency can demonstrate that the new steroid \nwas created or manufactured for the purpose of promoting muscle growth \nor causing the same pharmacological effects as testosterone.\n  Utilizing the same criteria, the bill permits the Attorney General to \nissue a permanent order adding such substances to the list of anabolic \nsteroids in Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act.\n  The bill also includes new criminal and civil penalties for falsely \nlabeling substances that are actually anabolic steroids. The penalties \narise where a supplement maker fails to truthfully indicate on the \nlabel--using internationally accepted and understandable terminology--\nthat the product contains an anabolic steroid. These penalties are \nintended to be substantial enough to take away the financial incentive \nof unscrupulous manufacturers, distributors, and retailers who might \notherwise be willing to package these products in a way that hides the \ntrue contents from law enforcement and consumers.\n  Finally, the bill adds 33 new anabolic steroids to Schedule III. \nThese 33 anabolic steroids have emerged in the marketplace in the six \nyears since Congress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. \nThe bill also instructs the United States Sentencing Commission to \nreview and revise the Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure that \nsentences will be based on the total weight of the product when \nanabolic steroids are illegally manufactured or distributed in a \ntablet, capsule, liquid or other form that makes it difficult to \ndetermine the actual amount of anabolic steroid in the product.\n  By making these changes, we can protect the health and lives of \ncountless Americans and provide an effective enforcement mechanism to \nhold accountable those individuals and their companies which \npurposefully exploit the current regulatory system for their selfish \ngain. The Department of Justice has provided extensive technical \nassistance in the drafting of this bill over many months. In addition, \nthis legislation is fully supported by the United States Olympic \nCommittee, the National Football League, the United States Anti-Doping \nAgency, as well as by Supplement Safety Now, a coalition including all \nthe major league sports teams, and other sports and medical \nassociations. I urge my colleagues to take up this much-needed bill in \nthe next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 4033. A bill to provide for the restoration of legal rights for \nclaimants under holocaust-era insurance policies; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge my \ncolleagues to support and take up next Congress the bill I just \nintroduced, the Restoration of Legal Rights for Claimants Under \nHolocaust-Era Insurance Policies. The bill would restore the right of \nHolocaust survivors and their descendants--many of them United States \ncitizens--to maintain lawsuits in our courts to recover unpaid proceeds \nunder Holocaust-era life insurance policies. Recent decisions of the \nfederal courts about which I have spoken at length in prior floor \nstatements and confirmation hearings have denied survivors and their \ndescendants that right.\n  The insurance policies at issue were issued to millions of European \nJews before World War II. During the Nazi era, European insurers \nlargely escaped their obligations under the policies--sometimes by \nparticipating with the Nazis in what one Supreme Court Justice has \ncharacterized as ``larcenous takings of gigantic proportions.'' [Am. \nIns. Ass'n v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 430 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., joined \nby Stevens, Scalia, and Thomas, JJ., dissenting).] In the aftermath of \nWorld War II, insurers dishonored the policies for one shameful reason \nor another. The most shameful of them was that a claimant could not \nproduce a death certificate of a deceased insured who had been murdered \nin a Nazi death camp.\n  In the 1990s survivors turned, as a last resort, to the courts of the \nUnited States. Numerous suits were filed seeking compensation from \nEuropean insurers for dishonoring Holocaust-era insurance policies \nduring and especially after the War. Several States, for their part, \nattempted to facilitate recovery under unpaid policies by requiring \ninsurers doing business in their States, as most did, to disclose \ninformation about those policies.\n  European insures responded to these developments by agreeing to \nestablish a private claims resolution process. Their agreement resulted \nin the establishment of a voluntary organization in 1998--formed by, \namong others, the insurers, the State of Israel, and State insurance \ncommissioners in the United States known as the International \nCommission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, ICHEIC. ``The job of \nICHEIC,'' according to the Supreme Court, ``include[d] negotiation with \nEuropean insurers to provide information about unpaid insurance \npolicies and the settlement of claims under them.'' [Garamendi, 539 \nU.S. at 407.]\n  Many survivors and their descendants filed claims through ICHEIC. How \nfairly ICHEIC decided their claims remains a debated question. \nTestimony before Congress at least raises serious questions as to \nwhether meritorious\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\nclaims were denied. I do not wish to enter that debate today except to \nemphasize that ICHEIC was not a neutral, governmental adjudicatory \nbody. It was, as then-Judge Michael Mukasey said, a ``an ad-hoc non-\njudicial, private international claims tribunal'' created, funded, and \nto a large extent controlled by the insurance companies--in short, \nagain in Judge Mukasey's words, ``a company store.'' [In re \nAssicurazioni Generali, S.p.A Holocaust Ins. Litig., 228 F. Supp. 2d \n348, 356-57 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).] I also wish to emphasize that by filing a \nclaim through ICHEIC, a claimant did not waive his right to file suit. \nOnly claimants who received payments under insurance policies did so.\n  Despite the creation of ICHEIC, litigation continued in American \ncourts. Foreign protests over the litigation led the United States to \nnegotiate several executive agreements with foreign governments. Of \nthese, the most important was the 2000 German Foundation Agreement. It \nobligated Germany to establish the German Foundation, which was funded \nby Germany and German companies, to compensate Jews ``who suffered'' \nvarious economic harms ``at the hands of the German companies during \nthe National Socialist era.'' As for insurance claims in particular, \nthe agreement obligated German insurers to address them through ICHEIC. \nSimilar agreements between the United States and Austria and France \nfollowed. No agreement was reached, though, with Nazi German's \nprincipal ally, Italy.\n  In negotiating the 2000 agreement, Germany sought immunity from \nsuit--``legal peace'' as Germany calls it--in American courts for \nGerman companies. The United States refused to provide it, and could \nnot have provided it, in my view, in the absence of a Senate-ratified \ntreaty or some other such authoritative Congressional action. Instead \nthe United States agreed only to the inclusion of a provision \nobligating the United States to file in any suit against a German \ncompany over a Holocaust-era claim a precatory statement informing the \ncourt that ``it would be in the foreign policy interests of the United \nStates for the Foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for the \nresolution of all asserted claims against Germany companies arising \nfrom their involvement in the National Socialist era and World War \nII.'' The United States also agreed in any such filing to ``recommend \ndismissal on any valid legal ground (which, under the U.S. system of \njurisprudence, will be for the U.S. courts to determine).'' The 2000 \nagreement makes explicit, however, that ``the United States does not \nsuggest that its policy interests concerning the Foundation in \nthemselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal.''\n  But what the 2000 executive agreement expressly denied Germany \ncompanies--that is, immunity from suit--our federal courts have now \ngiven them at the urging of the executive branch. I refer first and \nforemost to the Supreme Court's much-criticized, five-to-four decision \nin American Insurance Co. v. Garamendi, 2003. The Court held there that \nthe executive branch's foreign policy favoring the resolution of \nHolocaust-era insurance claims through ICHEIC preempted a California \nlaw requiring the disclosure of information about Holocaust-era \ninsurance policies to potential claimants. It did not matter, the Court \nsaid, that the executive agreement said nothing whatsoever about \npreemption, let alone that no federal statute or treaty actually \npreempted disclosure statute's like California's. It was enough that \nthe agreement embodied a general policy--reaffirmed over the years by \nstatements by sub-cabinet officials--with which California's disclosure \nstate could be said to conflict. Four Justices with very different \nviews on executive power--Ginsburg, Scalia, Stevens, and Thomas--\ndissented. While conceding the, questionable, argument that the \nPresident can under some circumstances preempt state law by executive \nagreement, they emphasized the obvious flaw in the Court's position on \nthe facts at hand: The 2000 agreement says nothing about preemption. \nInsofar as it says anything on the subject, it actually disclaims any \npreemptive effect.\n\n  On the authority of Garamendi, the Federal district court before \nwhich lawsuits to recover on policies issued by the Italian insurer \nGenerali had been consolidated dismissed those suits as preempted. The \ncourt rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the suits could not be \npreempted because Italy and the United States had never entered into an \nexecutive agreement addressing claims against Italian insurers. Appeals \nto the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit followed. While the \nappeals were pending, a class action settlement was reached and \napproved by the court under which most of the class members received \nnothing. The plaintiffs' lead counsel has said that Garamendi left them \nno choice but to settle. Several plaintiffs who opted out of the \nsettlement nonetheless pressed on with the appeals. Early this year the \nSecond Circuit affirmed the dismissal of their cases. [In re \nAssicurazioni Generali, S.P.A., 529 F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 2010).]\n  The plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to hear their case by \nfiling a petition for certiorari. They raised two main questions. \nWhether Garamendi preempts the generally applicable state common law \nunder which the plaintiffs sought recovery, as opposed to the \ndisclosure-specific law California enacted. Whether Garamendi should be \nread to preempt state-law claims in the absence of any executive \nagreement addressing those claims. Recall that Italy and the United \nStates never entered into an executive agreement with which claims \nagainst Generali, an Italian insurer, could be said to conflict. A \npost-Garamendi decision of the Court, Medellin v. Texas, 2008, suggests \nthat Garamendi cannot be so broadly read--that an executive-branch \nforeign policy can preempt state law only if it becomes law through the \nmeans prescribed by the Constitution or, in some limited class of cases \nat least, find expression in an executive agreement entered with \nCongress's acquiescence. Despite the importance of these questions and \nan apparent split among the lower courts in answering them, the Supreme \nCourt denied certiorari.\n  My legislation would achieve two narrow, but important, objectives: \nFirst, it would restore Holocaust survivors and their descendants to \nthe legal position they occupied before Garamendi and Generali. Second, \nit would allow states to enforce the sort of disclosure laws at issue \nin Garamendi. With limited exceptions tailored to achieve these \nobjectives, the legislation would otherwise leave undisturbed any \ndefenses that insurers may have to Holocaust-era insurance claims, \nincluding the defense that they were settled and released through \nICHEIC.\n  Of equal significance, my legislation would vindicate two important \nConstitutional principles--one involving separation of powers, the \nother federalism. The principle of separation of powers is that the \nConstitution vests all lawmaking authority in Congress and none in the \nexecutive branch. The principle of federalism is that, under the \nConstitution's supremacy clause, Article VI, only the Constitution, \nCongressionally enacted law, and Senate-ratified treaties can preempt \nstate law. Some executive agreements, if entered at least with \nCongress's acquiescence, arguably may also do so. But executive-branch \npolicies plainly do not.\n  One final point: A similar House bill, H.R. 4596, has been objected \nto on the ground that it will disserve aging Holocaust survivors \nbecause it will create unrealistic expectations of recovery. Claims \nthat were not successful before ICHEIC, the House bill's critics claim, \nare almost certain to fail in court. That is a debatable objection. It \nis, in any event, beside the point. Holocaust survivors and their \ndescendants should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to file \nsuit. Neither the executive branch nor the federal courts should make \nthat decision for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "15", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/15/senate-section/article/S10307-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10307-S10308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4810.
