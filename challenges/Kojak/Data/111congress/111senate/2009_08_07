Mr. President, it is really an understatement to say that \nthe current economic downturn is the worst the country has experienced \nin several generations. The reality is that the crisis President Obama \ninherited when he was elected President was severe--worse that anything \nthe country has seen since the Great Depression. When he took office, \nthe country was losing 700,000 jobs a month. Banks were in crisis and \nhad stopped lending, and a number of them were teetering on bankruptcy \nand some went out of business. The President and the Congress acted \nswiftly and passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which \nhas stopped the bleeding and avoided economic catastrophe.\n  People complain: Look at all the deficit spending. In December, I was \nat a meeting with a small number of people. We had Mark Zandi, John \nMcCain's economic adviser during the campaign, and we had economic \nadvisers to Democratic and Republican Presidents in years past. Every \none of them said: The only money in the world is in Washington, and \nunless you spend some of it, there will be a worldwide depression. We \nlistened, and that is why we did what we did.\n  Today, the July unemployment numbers have been reported. They paint a \nmuch better picture than was anticipated. It was anticipated that \n340,000 jobs would be lost, and that is not the case. The case is that \nover 200,000 jobs have been lost--a terribly large number but certainly \nmuch better than anyone ever anticipated. It is the lowest number since \nthe spring of 2008. It is now late summer 2009. The national \nunemployment rate actually fell last month by one-tenth of 1 percent. \nIt is welcome\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nnews and further proof that the economic recovery plan we enacted is \nproducing positive results. I repeat, what would it have been had we \nnot done that?\n  So that is the good news. But many Americans still continue to \nstruggle. Many in Nevada continue to struggle as a result of the \neconomic crisis. Over the next several weeks, long-term unemployed \nworkers will begin exhausting their unemployment benefits. Some \nestimates put the number of unemployed workers who will have used up \ntheir benefits by the end of September at 500,000. By the end of the \nyear, the number of unemployed workers who will have exhausted their \nbenefits will be 1.5 million. With the job market as depressed as it \nis, most of these workers will not be able to find work and will then \nhave no means to survive and take care of their families.\n  Soon after Congress returns to Washington, we will need to address \nthis matter. We must do so with the understanding that most experts \nbelieve job growth will be one of the last things to recover in this \neconomic crisis. It always lags behind economic recovery.\n  There is an economic case to be made for extending unemployment \nbenefits. Last year, when analyzing the effectiveness of various \nstimulus proposals, Mark Zandi found that extended unemployment \nbenefits generated $1.64 for every dollar it cost the American people. \nThat means unemployment benefits are a sound investment.\n  There should be no disagreement that we must help those who are \nsuffering as a result of the economic crisis they didn't create. We \nwill keep fighting until unemployed workers in Nevada and across the \nNation find employment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9066-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am not sure I will need that much time, but \nthere are four or five things I wanted to address this morning now that \nthe Senate has completed its work through July and we will all be going \nhome to visit with our constituents over the August recess.\n  What I did was I pulled together three or four topics I wished to \naddress but, because of all the business we had this past week in \ndealing with the Sotomayor nomination and the cash for clunkers \nlegislation, in particular, I had not yet had an opportunity to address \nthem.\n  Let me start with the so-called cash for clunkers legislation which \nwas adopted last night. This is legislation which I think was, as I \nsaid, a very well-intentioned concept in two respects: No. 1, to help \nauto dealers get off the mat--they had all been suffering from a lack \nof business--as well as to promote the idea of more fuel-efficient \ncars. But the well-intentioned plan ran into a lot of problems, and I \nthink there were two reasons for that.\n  The first was the fact that it was rushed through. It was put on an \nemergency piece of legislation without hearings, without legislation \nhaving gone through the committee process, and, frankly, without \nanybody really thinking through how the program would be implemented. \nAs a result, there were a lot of problems with it.\n  I got calls from car dealers. They had no idea whether they were \ngoing to be paid. The Department of Transportation had no idea whether \nit still had money left to pay the car dealers. As a matter of fact, \none of them called me and said, as of Thursday a week ago, the \nDepartment had said they didn't need to kill the vehicles anymore that \nthey had taken in on trade-in--that is to say do what they do to them \nso they can never operate again--because they weren't sure the money \nwould be available to send to the dealer for the transaction. So the \ndealer may need to resell the car as a used car. The program, in other \nwords, was very confusing and they got a lot of confusing signals out \nof the Department of Transportation.\n  That is why I offered an amendment yesterday that suggested we ought \nto call a timeout, a pause, to make sure all of the transactions that \nqualified could clear the process, the dealers could get paid, and we \nwould know how much money we spent. Did we spend $1 billion? More than \n$1 billion? My amendment would have said whatever it takes to pay for \nall of the deals that had been made as of today, but then establish \nsome process whereby the sales could be tracked, so that each day, at \nleast by the end of the day, we would know how many cars were sold and \nwhat the obligations of the government were to the dealers that had \nacquired those trade-in cars. That way, we would know when we got close \nto the additional money that had been allocated.\n  Well, my amendment didn't pass. As a result, it is quite likely we \nare going to continue to have problems with this program. So I hope the \nDepartment of Transportation can find a way on its own to do this \nwithout direction from Congress so we don't have the same kinds of \nproblems we have had in the past.\n  But there is a more fundamental problem with the program, and that is \nthat it subsidizes a specific segment of the economy, as several of my \ncolleagues pointed out, for the most part to simply advance the sale of \na car that would have occurred anyway. So at the end of the day, there \nwas no new economic activity--simply the expensive replacement of a \nvehicle that might have been used as a secondhand vehicle for several \nmore years but because of the requirements of the program is actually \ndestroyed. So as a matter of fact, we actually took value out of our \neconomy rather than putting it in, and at a great cost. It was \nestimated that it was about $20,000 per vehicle.\n  There was a great editorial--or column, I should say--in my hometown \nnewspaper, the Arizona Republic, today by Bob Robb, who is one of the \nsmartest people I know, especially when it comes to economic matters. \nThe title of it is ``Cash for Clunkers a Lemon.'' In it, he points out \nwhat is wrong as a matter of economic policy with programs like this \nthat subsidize a particular piece of economic activity but end up in \neffect simply costing the taxpayers of the country without advancing an \neconomic cause.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this very erudite column printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Aug. 7, 2009]\n\n                       Cash for Clunkers a Lemon\n\n                             (By Bob Robb)\n\n       The cash for clunkers program is a perfect illustration of \n     what's wrong with economic policy and thinking in this \n     country.\n       The program is widely hailed as a successful economic \n     stimulant. Congress is rushing to pour more money into it.\n       And it has been a success, if success is defined as selling \n     more cars in the short-term.\n       Basically, the program offers owners of old cars a subsidy \n     to buy a new one. If government subsidizes something, demand \n     for that thing will increase--whether it is cars, or toasters \n     or cosmetic surgery.\n       And if there is a quick expiration date on the subsidy, as \n     is the case with cash for clunkers, demand will be \n     artificially goosed even more.\n       This is obviously good news for car sellers and qualifying \n     new car buyers. It may be good news for those in the car-\n     making business, if production picks up to replace depleted \n     inventories.\n       However, for the economy as a whole, the effect of cash for \n     clunkers will be negligible, and slightly negative if \n     anything.\n       In the first place, the federal government has no money. \n     So, every dime of subsidy it is offering has to be borrowed. \n     That puts a burden on future economic activity.\n       To the extent the subsidy induces people to make a car \n     purchase they otherwise would\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\n     not have made, the money so spent would have otherwise been \n     spent on something else or saved. There is no clear evidence \n     that the economy will be better off for the money to have \n     been spent on a new car than the alternatives.\n       In political economy, it is virtually always better to look \n     to the long-term than the short-term. Government has neither \n     the wit nor the tools to manage short-term economic \n     performance. Despite all the happy talk about shovel-ready \n     projects, very little of the stimulus money has gotten out \n     the door. The Fed has been flooding the economy with \n     liquidity, but lending is still contracting.\n       Virtually everyone agrees that Americans need to spend \n     less, borrow less and save more. President Obama has given \n     speeches lecturing us about that.\n       Yet the federal government continues to offer massive \n     inducements for consumption and borrowing.\n       The federal government will pay more for your old car than \n     it is worth if you'll buy a new one.\n       The housing bubble was caused by an overinvestment in \n     housing and lax lending standards. Yet the federal government \n     is offering a sizable tax credit for the purchase of a new \n     home and the Federal Housing Administration will guarantee \n     mortgages with a down payment of as little as 3.5 percent of \n     the purchase price.\n       Lax monetary policy is a subsidy for borrowing in general.\n       In other words, the message from the federal government is \n     that Americans need to spend less, borrow less and save more. \n     Just not now.\n       But it is during downturns that behaviors change. A respect \n     for economic uncertainty is what causes people to live below \n     their means and save for the future. When things are humming \n     along, few see the need to change their behavior.\n       This isn't to say that government should remain idle during \n     a downturn, particularly one as severe as this one. \n     Government should be in the business of helping people cope, \n     through such things as extended unemployment benefits and \n     other income transfer programs.\n       Government shouldn't, however, be offering new inducements \n     for consumption and borrowing. That's sacrificing the long-\n     term for the short-term.\n       The reason policymakers do this is, in significant part, \n     our fault. We hold federal elected officials, particularly \n     the president, responsible for the short-term performance of \n     the economy. If the economy is doing well at any given \n     moment, we're likely to think the president is doing a good \n     job. If not, we're looking to get rid of the bum.\n       Presidents do not an economy make. They can affect the \n     long-term trajectory of the economy through wise or unsound \n     long-term fiscal policies. But day-to-day, we're pretty much \n     on our own.\n       Of course, any presidential candidate who actually said \n     that would never get elected. And therein lies the heart of \n     the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9067-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPPORTING THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Lieberman from \nConnecticut, had put an item in the Congressional Record that was a \nletter to the President urging that the President and the Attorney \nGeneral take action to stop the further notion of investigating members \nof the U.S. intelligence community for activities long since past \nrelated to the interrogation of terrorists after the September 11 \nattack on the World Trade Center. I found this to be a particularly \nwell-reasoned statement as to why this kind of continually looking \nbackwards, this kind of politics that seems to want to continue to \nscratch at old wounds, can be very destructive to our safety and \nsecurity in the future.\n  Among other things, Senator Lieberman quoted President Obama and \nsaid:\n\n       President Obama had it right when he said that with regard \n     to past behavior by the intelligence community, he is ``more \n     interested in looking forward than . . . looking backward.''\n  And Senator Lieberman said:\n\n       Given the threats that we face as a Nation, it is \n     imperative that we follow the President's lead.\n\n  He went on to point out that if we don't, we are going to chill the \nactivities of the intelligence community.\n  He noted--and I will note, as well--that there are so many very hard-\nworking, dedicated Americans working in a frequently very dangerous \nenvironment whom we have asked to find out the most difficult things, \nsuch as: What are these terrorists up to? And might they have plans to \nattack us again? It is very difficult to get this information.\n  Anything we do that chills the methods by which they do that--short, \nof course, of violating the law or engaging in torture or other \nimpermissible activity--simply hastens the day when there is another \nsuccessful attack against the American people. We need to do everything \nwe can to prevent that. The reason I was reminded was there are reports \nthis morning we have been successful in taking out one of the most \ndangerous terrorists in Pakistan, someone who was allegedly involved in \nthe planning of the death of Benazir Bhutto and who had been sought for \na long time.\n  I was thinking about the activities of some of my colleagues in the \nSenate attacking the previous administration for considering a program \nthat would involve the use of intelligence community assets to track \ndown and find and then either capture or kill these terrorist leaders \nwho are responsible for so many deaths. The assumption was it was \nsomehow wrong for the United States to consider doing this. This \nprogram was begun back when President Clinton was in office, and he \nissued a directive which basically said: If there is a way we can find \nand either capture or kill these people, we should do so. The program \nwas never implemented because there were potential problems with it. \nThe same thing occurred during the Bush administration. It wasn't \nimplemented. The Intelligence Community wasn't advised about it. Had \nthere been a decision to go ahead with the program, the law would have \nrequired that the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate be \nbriefed. But there was great criticism of the Bush administration and \nVice President Cheney.\n  I wondered at the time, how about these people whom we send into \nharm's way to try to find these terrorists and either capture them or, \nif they attempt to fight or flee, to kill them, what does it say to the \npeople we send into harm's way to accomplish this, when there is all \nthe criticism back home that somehow there is something wrong with it?\n  I was pleased this morning when the news of the alleged attack and \nkilling of this terrorist leader was greeted with a great deal of \napproval in the media and by the people who commented on it. That is \nthe kind of reaction our intelligence officials need to see when they \ngo after these very dangerous terrorists--not a reaction that, gee, \nmaybe we need to read this guy the Miranda rights before we try to \ncapture him.\n  The reality is, these people are not generally subject to capture. We \nhave the facilities and the means to track them and, frequently, we do \ntrack them by these means, and we are able to take them out. Since we \nare engaged in a war with these terrorists and they would kill us if we \ndon't kill them, if you don't have the ability to capture them, then \nkilling them and taking them off the battlefield in that way is totally \nappropriate and under the rules of war.\n  That is why I am pleased this kind of event is greeted with \nenthusiasm and approval because it might send the kind of signal to the \nintelligence community we want to send, which is: Do your best to \ndefeat the opposition in the war on terror. I think Senator Lieberman's \npoint was well taken in the letter he wrote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9067-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9067-S9068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WITHHOLDING STIMULUS FUNDS\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Jon Kyl continues to roll.\n       And it continues reminding us that hardball, hyperpartisan \n     tactics did not suddenly disappear from the White House when \n     Karl Rove left the building.\n       Indeed, in some ways, the tactics have gotten worse. Since \n     when are Cabinet secretaries supposed to act like wise guys \n     in a political goon squad?\n       On July 12, Kyl went on the Sunday Washington talk show \n     This Week and criticized the $787 billion economic-stimulus \n     program. He said the program was ineffectual and suggested it \n     be wrapped up and ended.\n       The administration came down on the senator like a ton of \n     Chicago-baked bricks.\n       The very next day, four Cabinet secretaries sent letters to \n     Arizona's Republican Gov.\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\n     Jan Brewer, asking if she still wanted the state's portion of \n     the stimulus cash, or if she felt compelled to fall in with \n     Kyl. The letters arrived almost simultaneously and were \n     similar in structure and language, each suggesting that \n     projects important to Phoenix and Arizona were in jeopardy.\n       Clearly, their delivery was orchestrated to embarrass Kyl.\n       Few doubted the manipulative hand of Emanuel in the letter-\n     writing campaign. And, indeed, the online political news \n     service Politico reported July 16 that ``Emanuel directed \n     that the letters from the Cabinet secretaries be sent to \n     Brewer, according to two administration officials.''\n       It would be an intellectual insult to suggest otherwise. \n     Emanuel is notorious for such back-alley tactics and is the \n     only person in a position to organize such a campaign \n     literally overnight. But on July 24, at a hearing of the \n     House Budget Committee, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood--\n     author of the snarkiest of the four letters--insulted away.\n       Asked repeatedly whether he had been encouraged or told by \n     anyone within or without the administration to write his \n     letter, LaHood--finally--gave a straight answer. ``No,'' he \n     said.\n       As most Washington-watchers know, honesty does not come \n     easily to many of the political class. But couldn't LaHood, \n     an Illinois Republican, simply have taken the Fifth? It would \n     have been in keeping with the tenor of things.\n       Rahm Emanuel used the president's Cabinet for his political \n     goon squad.\n       If anyone ought to be protesting this staged theater, it \n     isn't so much Kyl or Brewer as the Cabinet secretaries who \n     were so demeaned by being forced to deliver cheap political \n     threats that are laughable on their face and utterly \n     transparent.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the editorial reports on what they call a \npolitical hit job perpetrated ostensibly against me. It didn't bother \nme, but as reported, the Chief of Staff of the President enlisted four \nCabinet officers to write letters to the Governor of Arizona, which \nwere seen by some as veiled threats to withhold stimulus funding \nbecause I had dared to criticize the stimulus program and suggest that \nafter the first couple years of spending, the outyears might be saved \nand spent in better ways. That generated criticism by these four \nCabinet Secretaries, who wrote almost identical letters, which clearly \nwere designed to try to intimidate.\n  That is not the right way for the administration to make its point. I \nam happy to debate the success or failure of the stimulus package with \nanybody from the administration who would like to debate it. I welcome \nthat kind of conversation. But there seems to be too much effort now to \neither shut people up or intimidate them from speaking.\n  There have been a lot of reports with respect to the stimulus and the \nso-called health care legislation, and in other areas, to be \ncoincidence. There seems to be a pattern developing, and it is not \ngood. Senator Cornyn, yesterday, spoke to that issue with respect to a \nnew Web site that the White House started asking people to send in \ntheir observations of people who are criticizing the administration's \nplans, if they think some of the criticism isn't accurate or they said: \nIf you think there is something fishy, let us know about it.\n  These are the kinds of tactics that might go over well in certain \ncities that have had a history of political bosses, but it is not the \nkind of tactic you would expect from the White House. I hope the folks \nat the White House have learned their lesson and, frankly, will knock \nit off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9068-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9068-S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there were two items that came to my \nattention that I wished to briefly comment on that are related. The \nfirst has to do with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continuing saga of \ncosting the American taxpayers a ton of money. We all know that despite \nwarnings, particularly from Republicans, they needed oversight, that \nthey were accumulating far too much bad debt and taking on all these \nso-called toxic assets--mortgages that, frankly, weren't going to be \npaid back; that they were exposing the American taxpayer to liability \nbecause of the implicit guarantee that lay behind the Federal charter \nfor Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Others said: Don't worry, keep going \nwith this; it is a wonderful program. Finally, the bottom fell out. \nFannie and Freddie were deeply in debt and the American taxpayers came \nto their rescue.\n  The idea was then to restructure these two entities so that never \nagain could this happen. We did that. The problem was that, because \nFannie and Freddie were government-chartered entities, it didn't take \nlong for them to squeeze out most of the private players in the \nmortgage market. Today, I think they hold something like 75 percent of \nthese particular mortgages.\n  Well, of course, the day of reckoning has come again. They have now \nrun up more debt--a huge amount of debt--and they are not going to be \nable to pay it. A story in yesterday--I will get the source later--\nreported that the government has since pledged, after their original \nreorganization, more than $1.5 trillion, including $85 billion in \ndirect aid, in order to keep the mortgage market working through \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The White House is now considering a new \nplan that apparently is coming out of the Office of the Secretary of \nTreasury and the National Economic Council Director that would somehow \nreform Fannie and Freddie yet again.\n  The Treasury Secretary said:\n\n       The only question that remains is what form and what \n     structure they ultimately will take.\n\n  The article points out that the most likely structure is a good bank/\nbad bank structure, in which they will basically be relieved of all \ntheir obligations, which will all be put in a new ``bad bank,'' which \nis a pile of debt that the American taxpayers will eat, and then the \n``good bank'' is the entity that is supposed to continue on.\n  The question is: Why would we want these quasi-government entities to \ncontinue to compete with the private market, continue to create bad \ndebt that taxpayers have to eat every now and then, and after we slough \noff the bad debt to the American taxpayers, they continue to do \nbusiness as if they had gone through bankruptcy and don't have any more \ndebts but they still have the implicit guarantee of the American \ntaxpayers.\n  It is time to end that. We have a vibrant mortgage market now. There \nis an expectation that within the next several months housing will come \nback. It already is in certain areas. Interest rates are low, and it is \npossible to write mortgages now. We have learned the lesson that we are \nnot going to write mortgages that cannot be repaid. It is not good for \nthe financial institutions or for the people who take out the mortgages \nif they cannot repay them, and it is not good for taxpayers who have to \nend up eating the bad debt that is created.\n  I wished to close by referring to the penultimate paragraph from this \nnewspaper, which says that the bad bank would be for Fannie Mae's and \nFreddie Mac's toxic assets. Then the government could create new \ncompanies to attract private investment for mortgage finance, starting \nthe process over again.\n  Why should the government create new companies? The private market \nhas an adequate way to deal with this; it is called the private sector, \nprivate companies. They are highly regulated. The proposal from the \nadministration is to impose additional regulations, but why do we need \na new government company? We have government insurance companies, \ngovernment car companies, and the administration proposal on health \ncare is to create a new government health insurance company. We have \nbanks taken over by the government.\n  Now we are going to fail to learn the lesson with Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and create new government-backed companies, such as Fannie \nand Freddie--maybe they have the same name, who knows--in the mortgage \nbusiness. When are we going to get out of the business of having the \ngovernment create new companies? That is socialism, that is not \nAmerican. That is not our free enterprise system. When things go wrong, \nwe adjust and we make new regulations to correct the problems that were \ncreated; we learn the lessons of why government created the issue in \nthe first place.\n  We don't need to continue to have the government create new companies \nthat cost the taxpayers money and get us deeper into the notion that \nthe government can compete with the private sector. That, then, leads \ninevitably to the government takeover because the government is never a \ngood competitor when it is also the regulator. That is a fear a lot of \npeople have with health care.\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9069-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9069-S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that brings me to the final point. In \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal, an article is entitled ``ObamaCare's \nReal Price Tag.'' It goes through all the different expenses of the \nproposed health care legislation, with the creation of a government \ninsurance company. They talk about the funding gap that is created by \nthe commitments of funding to this entire program. One of the things \nthey notice is people need to be aware of the long-term consequences. \nWe all know that Medicare, for example, is not financially sound. We \ncan go out through the 5-year projections, 10-year, 15-year, 20-year, \nand so on, and know what the obligations of our children and \ngrandchildren will be.\n  When we pass regular legislation in Congress, we have a set of \nblinders that says: What is the 10-year cost? We get it, and then we \nassume there are no more costs beyond that. What this op-ed points out \nis, we can calculate a 10-year cost. Maybe it is $1 trillion or $2 \ntrillion or maybe it is more than that. We can at least estimate it. \nThat is what the CBO and the Joint Tax Committee are charged with \ndoing. Then there is an assumption that there is no cost beyond that.\n  What the people who write the legislation frequently do is to build \nin benefits in the early years and then phase in the ways of paying or \nnot paying for it, so the real costs come in the so-called outyears--\nthe outyears are beyond the 10-year window--so that it doesn't score as \na big loser. What they point out is, in effect, what this legislation \ndoes is gone out for 10 years and creates a cliff. When you fall off \nthe cliff, that is when you are in trouble because the commitments to \nthe people for health care have been already made.\n  Can you imagine Congress pulling back on those commitments? Once \nthere is an expectation from government, that is not lightly withdrawn. \nThe American people come to expect it, and there is a big lobby against \nit, if you try to withdraw the benefit. But if you haven't provided for \nhow you are going to pay for it, there is a very rude and sudden \nawakening when you come to the cliff and realize you haven't folded \ninto your calculations how you are going to pay for this benefit.\n  We did that with the so-called SCHIP legislation. We created a \nbenefit, and the benefit kicked in early. The funding ostensibly \nstopped after a certain period of years. But everybody knew the funding \nwould not stop. That required the suspension of belief. I guess it is \ncalled cognitive dissonance. The notion that somehow or another \nCongress is going to, at the end of that period of time--I believe it \nwas 5 years--pull back all the benefits we had been giving to people \nfor 5 years, that was not going to happen.\n  So you had the commitment to provide benefits, but no way to pay for \nthem. As this article points out, that is what is happening with this \nhealth care legislation as well.\n  Let me quote from the third paragraph:\n\n       In the July 26 letter, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf notes \n     that the net costs of new spending will increase at a more \n     than 8 percent per year between 2019 and 2029--\n\n  There we are talking about the next 10 years, not the first 10 years.\n\n     --while new revenue would only grow at about 5 percent. ``In \n     sum,'' he writes, ``relative to current law, the proposal \n     would probably generate substantial increases in federal \n     budget deficits during the decade beyond the current 10-year \n     budget window.''\n\n  The point is, we should not look at these things during the first \nperiod of time that we analyze them, but rather the continuing \ncommitment of the American taxpayer. When we do that, as the Director \nof the CBO points out, we find that we have a continuing, growing \ndeficit; in other words, piling up more and more debt and, if anything, \nmy guess is that these estimates are conservative and that the amount \nof deficit would be even more.\n  The editorialist in the Wall Street Journal had complained about \nthis, talking about the ``Grand Canyon'' between spending and revenue, \npointing to the CBO's long-term projections, and then said:\n\n       That's not our outlook. That's what White House Budget \n     Director Peter Orszag told the House Budget Committee in \n     June. He added that ``If you're not falling off a cliff at \n     the end of your projection window, that is your best \n     assurance that the long-term trajectory is also stable.''\n\n  As the editorial points out: ``The House bill falls off a cliff.''\n  So the precise thing we are trying to avoid in intelligent \nlegislating is not avoided in the Democratic health care proposals: \nbenefits promised now, ostensibly paid for in the first 10 years, not \npaid for after that. That is not me talking, as I said, that is the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  There are other examples of this pointed out, but as the editorial \nnotes in conclusion:\n\n       ObamaCare's deficit hole will eventually have to be filled \n     one way or another--along with Medicare's unfunded liability \n     of some $37 trillion.\n\n  I read that last night, and I had to go back and reread it--unfunded \ndeficit of $37 trillion. It is impossible for us to imagine how much \nmoney that is--$37 trillion just for current obligations, not counting \nwhat would be added by the ObamaCare.\n  We cannot afford this, and I think the American people are beginning \nto appreciate we cannot afford it. There is no free lunch. The Federal \nGovernment cannot simply keep promising things and not worry about the \ncosts in the future. We can only print money for so long before we have \nrampant inflation that destroys the wealth of everyone, primarily the \npeople who have saved in the country, which starts with our senior \ncitizens.\n  We cannot borrow our way out of it because the main people who \ncontinue to lend to us, such as the Chinese, have begun to lecture us \non the fact they don't trust we are going to pay them back now, and \nthey are going to start requiring more and more in the way of interest \npayments for them to continue to lend to us.\n  It is a little bit like the credit card company that says to a \nfamily: Look, you have borrowed a lot of money on your credit card. We \nare not sure that you are going to be able to pay that back to us. So \nif you are going to borrow more money on the credit card, we are going \nto double the interest rate to make it a high interest rate so at least \nit accounts for our risk in lending you more money. Borrowing more \nmoney from the Chinese at higher interest rates is not the answer.\n  The other alternative is to tax the American people. Everybody \nunderstands taxing the American people is the worst thing you can do \nfor an economy, especially in a downturn. Americans believe they are \nalready taxed enough. You cannot tax the rich and solve the problem \nbecause they already pay most of the taxes and it would only account \nfor another few hundred billion dollars, even if you taxed them for \neverything they are worth.\n  You eventually get down to the middle class. The President has said \nover and over that he does not want to tax the middle class. The \nreality is that it is unavoidable if we continue to consider \nlegislation such as this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis Wall Street Journal op-ed of August 6 called ``ObamaCare's Real \nPrice Tag.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, August 6, 2009]\n\n                       ObamaCare's Real Price Tag\n\n       The funding gap is a canyon by year 10.\n       ObamaCare sinks in the polls, Democrats are complaining \n     that the critics are distorting their proposals. But the \n     truth is that the closer one inspects the actual details, the \n     worse it all looks. Today's example is the vast debt canyon \n     that would open just beyond the 10-year window under which \n     the bill is officially ``scored'' for cost purposes.\n       The press corps has noticed the Congressional Budget \n     Office's estimate that the House health bill increases the \n     deficit by $239 billion over the next decade. But government-\n     run health care won't turn into a pumpkin after a decade. The \n     underreported news is the new spending that will continue to \n     increase well beyond the 10-year period that CBO examines, \n     and that this blowout will overwhelm even the House \n     Democrats' huge tax increases, Medicare spending cuts and \n     other ``pay fors.''\n       In a July 26 letter, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf notes \n     that the net costs of new spending will increase at more than \n     8% per year between 2019 and 2029, while new revenue would \n     only grow at about 5%. ``In sum,'' he writes, ``relative to \n     current law, the proposal would probably generate substantial \n     increases in federal budget deficits during the decade beyond \n     the current 10-year budget window.'' (The House bill has \n     changed somewhat in the meantime, but not enough to alter \n     these numbers much.)\n\n[[Page S9070]]\n\n       The nearby chart shows this Grand Canyon between spending \n     and revenue, including CBO's long-term predictions. While \n     these are obviously very coarse estimates, there's also a \n     projection of a $65 billion deficit in the 10th year--and \n     ``deficit neutrality in the 10th year is . . . the best proxy \n     for what will happen in the second decade.''\n       That's not our outlook. That's what White House budget \n     director Peter Orszag told the House Budget Committee in \n     June. He added that ``If you're not falling off a cliff at \n     the end of your projection window, that is your best \n     assurance that the long-term trajectory is also stable.'' The \n     House bill falls off a cliff.\n       And the CBO score almost surely understates this deficit \n     chasm because CBO uses static revenue analysis--assuming that \n     higher taxes won't change behavior. But long experience shows \n     that higher rates rarely yield the revenues that they \n     project.\n       As for the spending, when has a new entitlement ever come \n     in under budget? True, the 2003 prescription drug benefit \n     has, but those surprise savings derived from the private \n     insurance design and competition that Democrats opposed and \n     now want to kill. The better model for ObamaCare is the \n     original estimate for Medicare spending when it was passed in \n     1965, and what has happened since.\n       That year, Congressional actuaries (CBO wasn't around then) \n     expected Medicare to cost $3.1 billion in 1970. In 1969, that \n     estimate was pushed to $5 billion, and it really came in at \n     $6.8 billion. House Ways and Means analysts estimated in 1967 \n     that Medicare would cost $12 billion in 1990. They were off \n     by a factor of 10--actual spending was $110 billion--even as \n     its benefits coverage failed to keep pace with standards in \n     the private market. Medicare spending in the first nine \n     months of this fiscal year is $314 billion and growing by \n     10%. Some of this historical error is due to 1970s-era \n     inflation, as well as advancements in care and technology. \n     But Democrats also clearly underestimated--or lowballed--the \n     public's appetite for ``free'' health care.\n       ObamaCare's deficit hole will eventually have to be filled \n     one way or another--along with Medicare's unfunded liability \n     of some $37 trillion. That means either reaching ever-deeper \n     into middle-class pockets with taxes, probably with a \n     European-style value-added tax that will depress economic \n     growth. Or with the very restrictions on care and \n     reimbursement that have been imposed on Medicare itself as \n     costs exploded.\n       On the latter point, the 1965 Medicare statute explicitly \n     stated that ``Nothing in this title shall be construed to \n     authorize any Federal official or employee to exercise any \n     supervision or control over the practice of medicine or the \n     manner in which medical services are provided.'' Yet now such \n     government management of doctors and hospitals is so \n     pervasive in Medicare that Mr. Obama can casually wonder in a \n     recent interview with Time magazine how anyone could oppose \n     the ``benign changes'' that he supports, such as ``how the \n     delivery system works.'' Oh, is that all?\n       Democrats will return in the fall with various budget \n     tweaks that will claim to make ObamaCare ``deficit neutral'' \n     over 10 years. But that won't begin to account for the budget \n     abyss it will create in the decades to come.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I know I have talked about a lot of different \nissues today, but as we start this period of time when we go back \nhome--we call it our work period back home--there are a lot of issues \nabout which we want to talk to our constituents.\n  First on my list is going to be what do you think about the increased \namount of debt this country is taking on, with all of the programs we \nhave already passed and the programs that are on the horizon, including \nwhat was referred to here as ObamaCare, but the so-called health care \nreform? Do you believe your health care situation is in such a dire \nstrait that we need to take on that kind of debt, or are there more \ntargeted ways to resolve the problems that everybody acknowledges \nexists, particularly with some of the costs associated with health \ncare.\n  We are also going to talk about whether the American people are \ncomfortable with the degree of government involvement, the government \ntakeover of all of these different elements of our society, including \nhealth care, including the mortgage business, as I talked about, and \npicking winners and losers in subsidizing the purchase of cars now.\n  I know we own two of the big car companies, but it seems a little \nself-serving then to try to help those car companies that the \ngovernment owns by picking that as the place to put $3 billion to \nencourage people to buy new cars.\n  I know a lot of folks back home who are in other businesses who are \nhurting significantly. They could use this help just as much. I wonder \nif we took $3 billion and spread that to some of the other industries \nthat are also hurting, I am sure they would say: This is great; why \ndon't you help us out?\n  When government gets in the business of picking winners and losers, \nit is a sad day for our democratic Republic. I think we need to watch \nthis. I am going to ask my constituents what they think about that. I \nalready know. I got an earful last Sunday in church about a couple of \nthese different ideas. I expect I am going to continue to hear about \nthat.\n  It is important that our constituents talk to us about their \nconcerns. We work for them, not the other way around. They pay our \nsalaries. We need to listen to them about what they have to say.\n  Finally, we have all these domestic issues, but I wanted to refer to \nSenator Lieberman's comments about we cannot forget we have brave men \nand women halfway around the globe right now in 120-degree temperatures \nrepresenting us. They are the men and women in our military services \nand in our intelligence services working very hard to protect us.\n  We have to send the signal to them that we appreciate what they do, \nthat we are not going to criticize them for simply doing their job. I \nthink Senator Lieberman was right when he said let's not send signals \nto those we have instructed to help us out in this war on terror that \nat the end of the day we are going to second-guess what they are doing, \nwe are going to be Monday morning quarterbacks and even potentially \nfind them criminally liable for activity they engaged in in good faith \nand belief they were protecting the American people.\n  I am going to be very interested to see what my constituents have to \nsay about these issues. I know my colleagues will as well. I hope when \nwe come back from the recess that we will not only be personally \nrefreshed from having the opportunity to visit with our families and \nspend a little downtime but intellectually refreshed by having heard \nfrom our bosses--our constituents--on how they want to approach these \nproblems in the future. Maybe in September, we will be a little more \nenlightened about how to carry out our responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN.

These are letters from people who \nhave often suffered because our health care system doesn't work for \nthem.\n  We understand the health care system works for many; that many people \nare pleased with their health insurance. We understand--and the Chair \ncertainly does, as a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee--that we have made sure people who have insurance \nthey are satisfied with can keep that insurance. As you know, we have \nbuilt consumer protections around those health care plans that people \nnow benefit from to make sure preexisting conditions are not banned \nfrom coverage; to stop discrimination based on gender or age; to make \nsure insurance companies cannot throw somebody off their rolls because \nthey have an annual cap on the insurance. But as we throw these words \naround on this debate, words like ``exchange'' and ``market \nexclusivity'' and ``gateway'' and ``direct negotiations'' and all these \nterms, it is important to always bring it back to people whom we know, \npeople who have written letters--from Eugene, OR, or from Toledo, OH--\npeople who have written letters to us about the health insurance \nsystem. I would like to share a few of these letters today as I have \nfor the last 2 or 3 weeks.\n\n[[Page S9071]]\n\n  Heather from Lorain County, the county where I live, west of \nCleveland, writes:\n\n       I am a resident of Elyria, OH, a Registered Nurse of 14 \n     years, living with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. I \n     live at both ends of the stethoscope. I am a frontline \n     witness to the disintegration of our health ``care'' system \n     both as a caregiver and as a patient. Health care is a NON-\n     partisan issue, but it's been all about dollars and cents, \n     not common sense.\n\n  She is right about that. We simply have let too many people fall \nthrough the cracks. We have not relied enough on nurses like Heather, \npeople who deliver the care directly. We have allowed our health care \nsystem in that sense to get away from us.\n  Mary from Jefferson County, eastern Ohio, along the Ohio River--\nSteubenville is the community that is the county seat in their county.\n\n       I am writing this on behalf of my brother, an insulin \n     dependent diabetic who is a retired factory employee in \n     Kettering, OH. He has recently been notified that he will be \n     losing most of his pension and all of his health care.\n       I have contacted almost all health care insurance companies \n     trying to a get single coverage policy. Due to his diabetes, \n     he is excluded from any coverage and completely uninsurable. \n     His insulin alone is approximately $8,000 a year. The reason \n     is not that diabetes is a pre-existing condition but is a \n     chronic condition.\n       My brother worked in the factory for over 30 years, paid \n     into the program, paid his taxes. It is a true sin that these \n     older Americans are being treated this way in our system.\n\n  Mary writes about diabetes, which is an increasing problem in this \ncountry. It is an increasing health problem that afflicts so many, not \njust older people like Mary's brother but younger people too, \nespecially people diagnosed with diabetes at very young ages. Our \nlegislation deals with that. It deals with that particularly for \nchildren, on preventive care and wellness programs dealing with \nchildhood obesity--all of those issues.\n  It deals with people like Mary's brother in Kettering who suffer \nbecause of, in too many cases, a cap on coverage. If you are spending \ntoo much, according to the insurance company, one year, they do not pay \nany more. The rest of it comes out of pocket. Sometimes they dump you \nand you lose your insurance. That kind of discrimination by the \ninsurance companies will be prohibited under our health care bill even \nif you have insurance you are happy with. We want you to stay in the \nplan if you are happy with your insurance, but we are going to build \nthese consumer protections around it so things don't happen to you like \nhappened to Mary's brother.\n  This comes from Scott in Hamilton County--that includes Cincinnati on \nthe Ohio River in southwest Ohio.\n\n       I recently changed employers. My previous employer was not \n     required to offer COBRA. I was not aware of this and was \n     quite shocked. My new employer had a waiting period of 90 \n     days before I could enroll in the employer-sponsored plan. \n     Between the time I left my old job and before I could enroll \n     in a new plan, my wife found out she was pregnant. But when \n     attempting to find new coverage, we kept being turned down \n     due to the pregnancy being deemed a pre-existing condition. \n     There should have been a better option. Please do what you \n     can to support health care reform.\n\n  If I didn't live in this country and I didn't know that these things \nhappen, I would just think they made up that story. This guy has \ninsurance. He switches jobs. Between leaving his job and his next job, \nhe is uninsured. His wife gets pregnant, and they can't get insurance \nbecause she has a preexisting condition. How stupid does that sound?\n  What is wrong with out health insurance system? It has a lot of good \nthings, but what is wrong with the system that allows him to fall \nthrough the cracks so at best she will have a pregnancy with no \ndifficulties, generally good pregnancy, but still that costs thousands \nof dollars. Imagine if she has a particularly difficult pregnancy with \nall kinds of expensive care for her and for their newborn baby. Imagine \nthe tens of thousands of dollars. They will go into debt because, as \nScott from Hamilton County says, health insurance was not available \nbecause of this preexisting condition--his wife got pregnant.\n  Dinah from Cuyahoga County, up near Cleveland, writes:\n\n       I've been a small business owner in graphics design for 17 \n     years. We always provide our employees with the best fully-\n     paid health care we could afford. Throughout the whole time, \n     the cost of health care was our largest expense after \n     salaries. Business has declined--\n\n  As it has throughout our Nation in many places--\n\n     and we have been forced to lay off employees from our once \n     high of eight to just two of us. Now we are on the edge of \n     having to close down unless business increases soon.\n       We have learned that we are in a catch-22 situation. If I \n     lay off my last employee to stay in business, we no longer \n     have two persons to qualify for a group and thus the group \n     insurance will be canceled by our insurer. Getting an \n     individual policy with reasonable coverage at age 62 is no \n     easy trick. And we have no idea if my one employee, single \n     and 40, will qualify either. We have no idea whether we will \n     be accepted or will have some kind of preexisting condition \n     we're not aware of. With two and a half years to go before \n     Medicare, I'm pretty close to my worst fears being realized.\n       Fight on for the public option. Please don't give up and \n     settle for something that just puts a band aid on this huge \n     problem. So many people so desperately need your help.\n\n  That is what we never can forget in this body when we talk about \nmarket exclusivity and talk about the gateway and exchange and all \nthese terms--direct negotiations. We can never forget people like Dinah \nfrom Cuyahoga County, saying, ``So many people so desperately need your \nhelp.'' They need our help in this body. We have to pass this bill by \nthe end of the year. She says, ``Fight on for the public option.'' She \nunderstands that insurance companies so often play games with people \nsuch as Dinah and Scott and Heather and some of the other people I will \nread letters from today.\n  Mr. President, that is why you, on the HELP Committee, and why I, on \nthe HELP committee, and Senator Dodd and others, why we fought for the \npublic option. That is an option. What it will do is inject competition \ninto the health care system, competition with insurance companies so \nthat insurance companies--even though we are going to change the rules \nfor insurance companies, we also know they always try to game the \nsystem. They want to insure you because you are healthy. They are not \nso sure they want to insure you because you might be expensive. We \ncannot let them do that anymore. That is why we are changing the rules. \nThat is why we also need the public option, so the public option can \ncompete and keep these insurance companies honest. Dinah gets that. Not \nall of our colleagues in this body get that. That is why it is so \nimportant to make sure this health care system improves so it works for \neverybody.\n  Ruth from Greene County, the Xenia area in the State, sort of \nsouthwest Ohio, writes:\n\n       Last year, my granddaughter Lilly was diagnosed with cystic \n     fibrosis, a fatal genetic disorder. She requires many \n     specialized enzymes and foods and three daily breathing \n     treatments to keep her lungs from deteriorating. She also \n     needs specialized care from a cystic fibrosis center and will \n     likely be hospitalized for lung infections at some point.\n       Without insurance this treatment would not be possible, and \n     with insurance companies' ability to deny coverage for \n     preexisting conditions, what is her long-term ability to get \n     health coverage? Currently, her parents are changing jobs. \n     How will they get affordable health insurance for their \n     daughter is a big question.\n\n  It appears from the letter from Ruth that her granddaughter Lilly has \ninsurance right now and is getting good treatment and good medical \ncare, as most Americans are at this point.\n  But it seems there are two things she is talking about. One is her \nparents have had, for whatever reason, to change jobs--Lilly's parents. \nWhat is going to happen with their insurance when their new employer \nand their new employer's insurance company understands they have a \ndaughter with cystic fibrosis? And then she asks a question that is \njust as crucial: What happens to Lilly when she gets older? What \nhappens to somebody who has a chronic health condition such as cystic \nfibrosis or anything else? When they get to be adults, what happens to \nthem? What happens to their ability to get health care coverage?\n  That is why the public option is so important, why our bill is so \nimportant. The public option will compete with private insurance \ncarriers to make sure they stay honest, that they do not dump people \nlike Lilly, so they do not play this preexisting condition game, so \nthey don't game the community rating system, so they don't discriminate \nagainst people because of\n\n[[Page S9072]]\n\ngender or geography or age or anything else.\n  The last two letters I would like to read are actually both from \nphysicians.\n  Michael, from Montgomery County, the Dayton area, writes:\n\n       As a physician I see what happens to people every day when \n     they cannot get health insurance. I see the abuses they \n     suffer at the hands of the greedy insurance companies. I also \n     see constant erosion in payments to doctors, hospitals, and \n     all health care providers. The only thing that is increasing \n     is the redtape. The redtape doesn't provide care. It takes \n     caregivers away from patients.\n\n  Michael is a medical doctor in Montgomery County in southwest Ohio. \nMichael understands, because he has been victimized by it, he has been \nharassed by it, he has been annoyed at best by it, that he deals and \nhis office deals with all kinds of insurance company redtape.\n  Mr. President, I have heard you actually talk about it in committee. \nYou know Medicare has less than 5 percent administrative costs. The \npaperwork for Medicare is much less than the paperwork Michael's office \nhas to do, dealing with hundreds and hundreds of different insurance \ncompanies. Medicare keeps its administrative costs under 5 percent. \nInsurance companies' administrative costs are 15, 20, sometimes even 30 \npercent. That is the redtape he is talking about.\n  Medicare is not perfect. Medicare has redtape. It needs to be \nstreamlined every way we can do that so it is simpler and cleaner, the \nway we need to build the public option to be.\n  But we also know private insurance has huge administrative costs, \nhuge salaries for their executives. People have come down to the floor \nand read what the salaries are of United Health and some of the other \ninsurance companies--Aetna, CIGNA--the top executive salaries, often \ninto the tens of millions of dollars each. We know they have those \nkinds of administrative costs. We know they have the profits they make. \nFine, they should make profits, but sometimes they are excessive.\n  We also know they have costs for huge numbers of people in these \nprivate insurance companies who are there to deny care. When did you \never hear Medicare turn somebody down for a preexisting condition? I \ndon't think it has ever happened. When did you ever hear Medicare say: \nSorry, you are spending more than your cap; that is the end; we are not \ngoing to take care of you. The fact is, the preexisting condition, the \ndenial of coverage because of your gender or your age or your \ngeography, doesn't happen with Medicare. It does happen with private \ninsurance.\n  Michael understands that when he writes. He talked about the greedy \ninsurance companies. Not all of them are but some are, and some of the \nexecutives are way overpaid. We know that.\n  Most important, we need to cut through the redtape. That is why the \npublic plan, competing with the private insurance plans, will make the \nprivate plans better, and, frankly, the energy and the dynamism of the \nprivate plans probably will make the public option better too. That is \nthe whole point of competition.\n  The last letter I will read comes from Ellen from Cuyahoga County, \nthe Cleveland area.\n\n       I am a physician and a partner in a small business that \n     offers health care benefits to its employees. For them, but \n     most as a wife of a cancer survivor, I feel there is no more \n     important issue than health care. We must provide affordable \n     health care to all Americans.\n\n  We hear it from doctors, we hear it from a nurse, we hear it from \npatients, we hear it from family members, family members who care \ndeeply about their family and what it has done to them.\n  We are about to leave here for the next month. When we come back in \nSeptember, there is a deadline on negotiations in the Finance \nCommittee. If the six--three Democratic and three Republican Senators--\ndo not come to agreement, it is time to move forward with the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions bill we wrote. Our bill, as you recall, \nis a bipartisan bill. Our bill that we passed out of the HELP Committee \nwent through 11 days of markup, 11 days of considering amendments, \ndebating, discussing, arguing--whatever we do when we get together. \nNever in my 17 years in the House of Representatives and the Senate \nhave I seen a bill have that much attention, have that many amendments, \nspend that long working on it. This bill has been vetted. We know the \nins and outs of it.\n  We accepted 161 Republican amendments. Some of them were minor, some \nof them were major amendments. The Republicans did not win on some of \nthe big issues, but the big issues were decided, in many ways, by the \nelection. The big issues are things such as, should there be a \nMedicare-like plan or should we continue the privatization of Medicare, \nwhich is what Republicans want to do. There are very big differences \nthere.\n  But the fact is, this bill is a bipartisan bill. It came out of \ncommittee with a strong vote. We know it will cover almost every \nAmerican. We know it will bend the cost curve down so we will begin to \nsave money. We know it will ban all kinds of insurance company gaming \nof the system, provide consumer protections for people who now have \nhealth insurance that they are generally satisfied with, and make sure \nthose people do not lose their insurance because of preexisting \nconditions or discrimination.\n  We have work to do after being back in Ohio and the Chair back in \nOregon for the next month. It is important we get back to work, after \nlistening to our constituents and getting more input on these bills. It \nis important that we go back to work in September and pass health care \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I had the opportunity this morning to \ntalk with Judge Sotomayor and congratulate her on her confirmation to \nthe Supreme Court. It is an exceedingly important position. Her \nnomination initiated a national discussion about the role of a judge in \nAmerican society. I hope it rose to the level of debate and discussion \nthat was worthy of such a great occasion.\n  She is a wonderful person. She is going to give her best effort to be \na great Justice on the Court. I hope and pray she will achieve that. I \nreached a conclusion, as did a number of my colleagues, that her \nstatements and expressions of judicial philosophy were such that it \ncaused concern and gave rise to a belief that her approach to judging \nwas part of a growing idea that judges are not bound by the law and \nfacts but are rightly able to allow their personal views to influence \ntheir decisions.\n  Her testimony was different, however, from what was reflected in her \nspeeches. I am hopeful that her testimony will be the basis by which \nshe conducts her business on the bench.\n  I congratulate her. I think our discussion was at a high level. It \ndealt with an issue that so many of us feel very deeply about; that is, \nthat the law must be objective, that judges must show fidelity to the \nlaw as written, even if we in Congress have not written it so well and \nif they would like to see it differently. That is the cornerstone of \nthe American legal system, and I am proud of it.\n  I received an e-mail a few days ago from Sarah Chayes who has written \na book about Afghanistan. She was an NPR reporter, stayed in \nAfghanistan, fell in love with the country, has learned the language \nand works tirelessly to improve the lives of people in that country.\n  She told about being in the States and meeting with the relative of \nan individual who tried so hard in Iraq to promote law and justice. She \nsaid this lady, her relative, said what most impressed her in America \nwas the law. She said it was not food, it was not technology, it was \nnot wealth that we had, it was the legal system we had. It is a \nbeautiful, wonderful thing. It is a heritage we have received. We have \nnot earned it. We have inherited it, and we have a responsibility to \nmake sure we pass it on in a healthy state, to those who will follow \nus.\n  So my congratulations go to Judge Sotomayor. I know her mother and\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\nother family members are so excited this day. This was one of the \nshortest confirmation processes in recent memory. I know that she is \npleased that it was completed before the August recess. It will allow \nher to move and get herself organized for the beginning of the term in \nOctober. So, again, my congratulations are to her.\n  I appreciate the Members of the Senate, Chairman Leahy, for allowing \na full and robust debate on this issue. I will assure my colleagues, \nthe issue of judicial activism is not going away. The American people \nfeel strongly that judges must operate as their judicial oath says, in \naccordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States--not \nabove them. They expect them to work diligently to determine the right \nanswer to each case before them and to find and declare that right \nanswer, even if the law they base it on is one they personally would \nlike to see altered.\n  That is the ideal of American justice, and we will be continuing to \nbattle for that as the months and years go forward. I think it is an \nimportant issue this country will be wrestling with.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before we leave for our August recess, I \nthink it is good to maintain our watch on what is happening in the \nfinancial markets. I have reported on these matters several times this \nyear because I think it is something we have to talk about. The reason \nwe have to talk about it is because the United States is borrowing more \nmoney this year than any year in the history of the American Republic. \nIt dwarfs anything we have ever done before, and it is an action that \nhas consequences. We cannot borrow dramatically without having \nconsequences occur, just as they do in our families. If your family \ngoes more into debt, you are burdened with high interest rate payments \nthat produce nothing but are monies you expend because you borrowed \nmoney. That is what interest is. It does not do you any good. It is a \npainful thing for no immediate benefit. The benefit comes when you \nborrowed it and bought something with it, but in the long run you carry \nthat interest unless you pay the debt off in the future.\n\n  The problem this country has is that according to the President's own \nbudget, in the next 10 years we have no plans whatsoever to pay down \nany debt. In fact, the debt is surging in the outyears. Growing the \ndeficit for each annual accounting will increase in the outyears. So we \nare in an unsustainable rate of spending in America. We have heard \nthose phrases, and ``unsustainable'' means just that: We can't keep it \nup in this fashion.\n  I will put this chart up that is not disputed by anybody who has been \ninvolved in the process. It represents what the Congressional Budget \nOffice--a nonpartisan group, but in truth it is hired by the Democratic \nmajority here in the Congress, in the Senate--has scored the \nPresident's budget and what it will mean for us in terms of debt over \nthe next 10 years. It is a 10-year budget, and we are supposed to look \nout into those years.\n  In 2008, the total debt in America was $5.8 trillion. From the \nbeginning of the American Republic until 2008, we had accumulated $5.8 \ntrillion in debt. That is a lot of money; more than we needed to have \nbeen carrying as a debt. President Bush was criticized for having \nseveral deficits, one over $400 billion, and another one either at or \naround $400 billion. Other years were less: $100 billion, $160 billion, \nsomething like that. But he was criticized for that because it helped \ncause the debt to go up. But look what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays we are going to be facing 5 years from now in 2013: a doubling of \nthat debt to $11.8 trillion. Ten years from now it will triple to $17 \ntrillion. The debt will increase in the out years. President Bush was \nrightly criticized for having added a $450 billion deficit in 1 year. \nWe will not see in the next 10 years, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, a single deficit year that low. The lowest they project \nis that it would be $600 billion plus. In the tenth year, out here in \n2019, it is projected the deficit will be $1.1 trillion. This year, the \ndeficit is projected to be $1.8 trillion. We will soon know. Some say \nit will be $2 trillion; $1 trillion, of course, is one thousand billion \ndollars--a lot of money. It has consequences. Where do you get this \nmoney?\n  Where do we get the extra $2 trillion we are spending today that we \ndon't have? Where do we get it? Well, we go into the marketplace and we \nask people to buy Treasury bills and loan us the money. It is basically \na note. They give us their money and we give them a promise to pay, \nplus interest. If you don't have any plan to pay down those debts, and \nwe don't--indeed, we continue to project a surge in borrowing even in \nthe tenth year, with no recession being projected in this next 10 \nyears, so it is a grim prospect to pay this kind of interest.\n  This chart deals with the interest payment. People think: Well, \nsomehow we can borrow and it doesn't hurt us. That is not so. If you \nborrow, you have to pay interest on it. This country pays interest \ntoday on the debt of $5.8 trillion. We are sort of fortunate because in \nthis economic slowdown interest rates are low, but they are not going \nto stay low, and that is the problem. Not only that, the size of the \ndebt is increasing.\n  So in 2009, it is projected that the interest on our debt will be \n$170 billion. Well, the entire Federal education budget--what, $100 \nbillion--the entire Federal highway budget prior to this stimulus \npackage, at least, was $40 billion. So $170 billion goes out in \ninterest to people all over the world and in the United States who have \nbought Treasury bills, including foreign countries such as the Arab \ncountries who have so much of the American dollars because we buy their \noil, and China, we buy their products and they have American dollars, \nand they have been buying our Treasury bills.\n  But look what happens over the 10-year window. This is according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office--a fair, objective analysis of what we \nare looking at. Let's take the red numbers. This is what we would be \npaying out annually in interest. It goes up--by 2019, the interest we \nwould pay at the originally projected rate of interest CBO used--to \n$800 billion in 1 year in interest we pay on the debt.\n  People are getting worried the interest rates are going to go up \nbecause we are borrowing so much money and people are going to be \nafraid that the dollar will be devalued, and our currency will be \ninflated. Therefore, they won't get as much return because they will be \ncheated because the dollars they get back from the United States in \nterms of interest aren't the same valuable dollars they were \noriginally. The fundamental thing that is working up here in people's \nminds is that the interest rates could go up. If we use the Blue Chip \neconomics forecast, the total payment in interest could be $865 \nbillion. If it goes up higher to the rates we saw in the 1980s, it \ncould be $1.3 trillion. That is just interest, in 1 year, that we would \nhave to pay. Our total budget today is about $3 trillion. That would be \nmore than a third of the budget.\n  I don't think the Members of this Congress understand the seriousness \nof this problem, because look at the bills that go through here. I am a \nbig supporter of farm programs. I supported farm bills year after year, \nbut I couldn't vote for the one this year. It had a 11-percent increase \nin discretionary spending under the agriculture bill--11 percent. You \nknow, at 7 percent return, your money doubles in 10 years; at 11 \npercent, the agriculture budget will double in several years.\n  At a time when we are running up unprecedented debts, we have an 11-\npercent increase there. It is difficult for me to comprehend. I don't \nthink we are serious about it. Now the House has put in three airplanes \nso Members of the Congress can take trips with them, presumably. \nSomebody somewhere needs to be asking: Where are we going to get this \nmoney? Every dime of it will be borrowed. The $800 billion we\n\n[[Page S9074]]\n\npassed earlier this year that was supposed to stimulate the economy, \nkeep the unemployment rate from going up, and cause economic growth to \noccur, was borrowed. We didn't have that money. The first automobile \nclunker bill, $1 billion, was borrowed on top of that. It wasn't even \npaid for out of the stimulus bill. It was new billion dollars. Then the \nnew clunker bill that passed here last night in the House, they said: \nWell, it was going to come out of the stimulus package and, therefore, \nit wouldn't add to the debt because we have already authorized this \nstimulus money to be spent, but that is not what the House leadership \nsaid. They promised they wouldn't reduce any of the spending that was \nprovided for in the $800 billion stimulus package. Only 11 percent of \nthe discretionary funds will be spent by October 1. They wouldn't take \nthe money out of that to fund the clunker program. They promised \nwithout any equivocation that they would replenish that to borrow \nmoney. They are going to borrow that money so they don't have to reduce \nany of this spending in the stimulus package.\n  The Treasury issued a record amount of debt this past year--an \nunbelievable amount, actually. The Treasury Department said Wednesday \nit is going to sell a record $75 billion in Treasury bills just next \nweek so we can pay all of these obligations, we have appropriated the \nmoney for. We don't have the money, so we have to borrow it. In \nparticular, the Treasury officials need to ensure that demand from \nChina--that is, China's purchasing of our Treasury bills--doesn't fall \noff. We want them to keep buying. There are several problems, however. \nChina doesn't have as much money as they did because their sales are \nnot going as they were, and they are using some of their surplus money \nto stimulate their own economy. So they are not going to have as much \nmoney to buy Treasury bills as they did, frankly. But at any rate, \ndemand from China, the largest holder of U.S. Government debt, is \nshaky. We put out the Treasury bills by auction at an interest rate and \npeople bid for them, basically, and the government has to raise the \nrate high enough to get people to give them the money so we can spend \nin Congress.\n  According to yesterday's Wall Street Journal, last week's auctions of \nfixed-rate Treasury notes saw lukewarm demand from China and other \ninvestors. They are getting worried. Chinese officials had indicated \nthey want inflation-protected securities, especially as the U.S. \neconomy starts to recover. Inflation-protected securities. That is the \nTIPS. Right now they are not paying much interest. It is pretty low \ninterest. But if you have a TIP, inflation-protected securities, and \nthe interest rate goes up, then you get paid more. The return on your \nTreasury bill goes up. It is not fixed.\n  ``Inflation is the No. 1 worry,'' said Mark Chandler, global head of \ncurrency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman & Company: ``This is the \ngovernment saying, `We will take that inflation risk away from you.' ''\n  That is what a TIP does. It says, Don't worry about inflation; if the \ninflation goes up, we will pay you greater interest on the Treasury \nbill you buy.\n  And the spread--the difference between the 10-year TIPS--inflation-\nprotected securities--and the regular 10-year Treasury note has risen \nfrom near zero at the beginning of this year to about 2 percent today. \nThat means that one can get a 2-percent better rate by buying regular \nTreasuries, 10-year Treasury notes, but people still want TIPS. People \nwith money want TIPS. Why? Because they are afraid in the next 10 years \nwe are going to have a surge of inflation and a 3.7-percent 10-year \nTreasury bill. Well, they would rather have a 1.7-percent TIPS than get \n2 more percent on the U.S. Treasury bill.\n  According to yesterday's Wall Street Journal, officials from the \nUnited States and China discussed TIPS issuance in high-level talks \nlast week. U.S. officials assured their Chinese counterparts that they \nremain committed to TIPS sales, according to a person with knowledge of \nthe discussions. China has accumulated more than $2 trillion in foreign \nexchange reserves and has invested about $800 billion in the U.S. \nTreasury. Meanwhile, interest rates on regular 10-year Treasuries have \nincreased from 2.4 percent to 3.75 percent this year, an increase of \nover 50-percent.\n  So the interest rates on the 10-year Treasury has increased over 50 \npercent since January. Why? Because people are not willing to give the \ngovernment money at the lower 2.4 percent rate because even though we \nare in a recession and interest rates are very low, they know with this \nkind of debt, this kind of future debt that the United States is \nfacing, we are going to have a tremendous temptation to inflate the \ncurrency. And we are going to have that pressure because one way to \nbeat your debt, of course, is to pay it back in dollars not worth as \nmuch as the dollar the person loaned. If they loan you a dollar today, \nand the dollar drops 20 percent, you can pay them back with dollars \nworth 80 cents rather than a dollar. That is a pretty good deal, if you \ncan get away with it.\n\n  People are smart and they see this coming. They are demanding higher \ninterest rates now, or they won't loan us the money--like any smart \nbusinessperson would. I say to my colleagues you don't get something \nfor nothing. There is no free lunch. You cannot run up this kind of \ndebt without consequences for the young people of this country in the \nyears to come. They are going to be carrying a $800 billion-a-year \nannual interest rate in 10 years. Most likely, this number will be \nhigher than $800 billion a year, whereas our generation today is \ncarrying a $170 billion a year annual interest payment. I do not \nbelieve we have to do that to help this economy come out of recession. \nIn fact, when you talk to people who are involved in the American \nfinancial sector, the biggest worry they have is interest and the debt. \nFor everything else, they can see a way the U.S. economy will come out \nof it. If we burden ourselves with more debt than we can sustain--and \nwe are clearly heading in that direction--long-term investors are \nworried. They don't see this coming out right. That is why they say it \nis not sustainable.\n  I wished to share these remarks before we recess for August. I don't \nthink it should be forgotten. We have a responsibility to see that \nevery dollar we spend produces something of value. While it can also \nhave a stimulative effect, it needs to produce something of value; it \ncannot just be thrown away. We need to look for every possible way to \ncontain this growth in spending. It is unacceptable and it cannot \ncontinue. Somehow, some way, Congress has to get the message; and I \ndon't think we have gotten it. I don't think we understand that \nmillions of people are losing their jobs. People who used to have \novertime are not getting it today. Many who were working full time are \nworking part time today. Families who used to have two wage earners now \nonly have one.\n  This is serious. We are going to have to recognize we cannot spend \nour way out of it. We cannot borrow our way to prosperity, as one \nAlabamian told me at a townhall meeting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9074-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9074-S9075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONFIRMATION OF JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Anyone who knows their story knows how much Justice Sotomayor \nowes to her mother. She paid tribute to her mother during her opening \nstatement at the confirmation hearing last month when she poignantly \nsaid: ``I want to make one special note of thanks to my Mom. I am here \ntoday because of her aspirations and sacrifices for both my brother \nJuan and me. Mom, I love that we are sharing this together.''\n  One of the good things about the hearing was that Americans were able \nto meet Celina Sotomayor, a woman admired across America. I will never \nforget her own participation at that hearing. She sat just behind her \ndaughter, nodding in agreement when her daughter spoke. She followed \nthe questions and answers, the give-and-take. She was focused, \nprotective and justifiably proud of her daughter.\n  Justice Sotomayor's story is her story too. Justice Sotomayor's \ntriumph is her triumph too. This confirmation is the realization of the \nAmerican dream that she lived and for which she worked, sacrificed and \novercame adversity. She is an inspiration to us all.\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9075-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n CUSTOMS FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Representative John Randolph, chairman of \nthe House Ways and Means Committee in the early 1800s, said, ``We all \nknow our duty better than we discharge it.''\n  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, or ICE, have two vital duties. They must protect \nour national security by ensuring that threats to that security do not \ncross our borders, and they must protect our economic security by \nensuring that legitimate trade does cross our borders, smoothly and \nquickly. I have no doubt that CBP and ICE know these duties. But they \nmust do a better job of discharging their trade duties.\n  Senator Grassley and I introduced a bill that would require the \nagencies to do just that. The Customs Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Reauthorization Act of 2009 would direct CBP and ICE to \nmake customs facilitation and trade enforcement a priority again, and \nit would provide the agencies with the tools and resources that they \nneed to fully discharge those duties.\n  These agencies know that high-level officials must focus on their \ntrade duties. The bill would help the agencies discharge those duties \nby creating new high-level positions at CBP devoted exclusively to \ntrade. The bill would assign new trade facilitation and enforcement \nduties to the highest level official at ICE.\n  The agencies know that they must facilitate and expedite legitimate \ntrade across our borders. The bill would help the agencies to discharge \nthose duties by providing trade facilitation benefits, such as faster \ncustoms clearance, to importers with a history of complying with U.S. \ncustoms and trade laws. The bill would also require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to identify and provide trade facilitation benefits \nto importers that provide additional security information. The bill \nwould provide funding for automated programs that would help CBP \nprocess imports more quickly.\n  The agencies know that they must enforce U.S. trade, intellectual \nproperty, and health and safety laws at our borders. The bill would \nhelp the agencies to discharge those duties by giving CBP new tools to \nidentify goods that are most likely to violate these laws. It would \ngive CBP the means to prevent those goods from crossing our borders. It \nwould require ICE to do more to prevent the importation of goods made \nwith forced, convict, or indentured labor.\n  The agencies know that they must listen to Congress and the business \ncommunity when taking significant actions that affect America's \ncompetitiveness. The bill would help the agencies to discharge that \nduty by requiring CBP to engage in robust consultation before taking \nsuch steps.\n  The agencies know that they must serve rural border areas, such as \nthose in my home State of Montana. The bill would help the agencies to \ndischarge that duty by creating a pilot program to establish 24-hour \nports along these border areas, ensuring that legitimate trade can flow \nquickly through these areas.\n  So let's come together to reauthorize CBP and ICE. Let's give these \nagencies the tools and resources they need to facilitate and enforce \ninternational trade. And let's help CBP and ICE to discharge these \nduties that are so essential to our economic security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9075-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EXPAND BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY ACT OF 2009\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that I \nintroduced, the Expanding Building Efficiency Incentives Act of 2009, \nwhich would expand the tax incentives for building and put our country \non course to reduce energy consumption in a sector that currently \nconsumes 40 percent of our total energy. I am pleased to have worked \nwith Senator Feinstein and Bingaman, two longtime leaders on energy \nefficiency, on this proposal and look forward to discussing this bill \nwith my Finance Committee colleagues.\n  One inexcusable legacy of this housing crisis is that the vast \nmajority of homes constructed over the last 10 years during the housing \nboon have been inefficient. While an inefficient vehicle purchased \ntoday may guzzle gasoline for an average of 10 years, an inefficient \nbuilding will require elevated levels of energy for as long as 50 \nyears. Therefore, whenever we create inefficient buildings, generations \nto come will be saddled with our wasteful energy decisions. Last week \nMcKinsey and Company in a report, ``Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the \nUS Economy,'' concluded that a major investment in energy efficiency \ncould save $1.2 trillion and cut consumption 23 percent by 2020. This \nlegislation serves as a cornerstone to realizing these opportunities.\n  The Expanding Building Efficiency Incentives Act builds on current \ntax incentives that have worked to move the market toward energy \nefficiency. While the marginal costs of constructing an energy-\nefficient building may be higher than an inefficient building, the \nlong-term energy savings have environmental and energy dividends, as \nwell as ultimate cost savings. These tax incentives provide an \nincentive to correct this market failure and obtain these long-term \nbenefits.\n  Specifically, the bill includes an extension of the current energy-\nefficient new homes tax credit for 3 years, which requires new homes to \nbe 50 percent better than current code with respect to heating and \ncooling. In addition, this bill will create a new tier for a $5,000 tax \ncredit if a building consumes 50 percent less total energy than a \ncomparable building. The current tax credit system for new homes has \nbeen very successful. According to the Residential Energy Services \nNetwork, 4.6 percent of all new homes met these rigorous standards in \n2008, which adds up to nearly 22,000 homes being at the cutting edge of \nenergy efficiency. This tax credit is working and not only should we \nextend this tax credit, but we must build on this to encompass \nadditional energy consumption in a new home.\n  In addition, the bill would provide a $500 tax credit for individuals \nto become professional energy auditors, experts that can reduce our \ncountry's demand for oil, reduce carbon emissions, and save our \nstruggling families money on their energy bills. In addition, a $200 \ntax credit is established for homeowners to hire these professional \nenergy auditors and analyze the deficiencies of an existing home and \npropose investments that will save the taxpayer money. As we move \nforward with dedicating significant resources to energy efficiency in \nthis legislation it is critical that we ensure that this funding is \nutilized effectively by a professional energy efficiency industry and \nthis amendment will accomplish this critical goal.\n  Finally, the amendment increases the tax credit for energy-efficient \ncommercial buildings by increasing the deduction from $1.80 cents per \nsquare foot to $3.00 per square foot. The original version of the \ncommercial buildings tax deduction as passed by the Senate set the \ndeduction to $2.25 per square foot, with the critical support of the \ncurrent Finance chairman and ranking member. Adjusting for inflation, \nthis corresponds to $3.00 per square foot today with partial compliance \nincreased to $1.00 per square foot. These changes would return the \ndeduction to viability as it was originally designed and ensure that \ncommercial building developers are provided an adequate incentive to \npursue energy efficiency.\n  Earlier this year, a New York Times editorial pointed out that we are \nan extremely energy inefficient economy--the 76th best country in the \nworld. This must change if we are to retain our leadership in this \nworld, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve our \nranking and increase our country's energy efficiency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9075-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9075-S9076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CLEANER, SECURE, AND AFFORDABLE THERMAL ENERGY ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Cleaner, Secure, \nand Affordable Thermal Energy Act, which I introduced with Senator \nBingaman. This bill will add diversity to the fuel usage of Americans \nwho are forced to use home heating oil, a heating source that has gone \nthrough wild price swings and last year reached historic prices. While \nI strongly believe that we must invest in weatherization and energy \nefficiency, I also believe that we must create diversity for thermal \nenergy.\n\n[[Page S9076]]\n\n  In my home State of Maine, roughly 80 percent of the population \nutilize heating oil to keep warm in the winter. In New England, 40 \npercent of homes use heating oil. As a result, on average nearly 4.7 \nbillion gallons of heating oil are consumed by New England. This is not \nonly an enormous cost to families across the region, but it creates \nmassive greenhouse gas emissions and increases our country's demand of \nforeign oil. This is not merely a regional issue, this is a national \nissue and it should be a priority of Congress to reduce heating oil use \nin New England.\n  This bill builds on the current credits for nonbusiness energy \nproperty to provide an additional credit for conversion of homes using \nhome heating oil to natural gas or biomass. Specifically, the bill \nprovides a tax credit of $3,500 for natural gas conversion and $4,000 \nfor biomass conversion. While natural gas is not available throughout \nthe United States and is not widely available in Maine, I am hopeful \nthat these incentives will provide an additional incentive to expand \nusage in regions that have access to natural gas supplies.\n  In regions that the rocky geology does not allow natural gas to be \nutilized, the bill includes a tax credit for biomass for thermal \nenergy, such as wood pellets. Just this past July, International \nWoodFuels announced plans to construct a 100,000 ton per year pellet \nplant in Burnham, ME. This is from wood product that is harvested in \nMaine and can be used to replace home heating oil in the State. While I \nstrongly believe that we must carefully develop policies to ensure that \nthe expanded use of wood pellets will undermine existing forest \nindustries, I strongly believe that we must encourage additional \ndiversity of our home heating oil energy sources and wood pellets \nprovide a viable pathway to energy diversity for the State of Maine.\n  I strongly believe that reducing the current consumption of home \nheating oil in the State of Maine, New England, and the country should \nbe a major priority as we move forward with overhauling our energy \npolicy, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the \nCleaner, Secure, and Affordable Thermal Energy Act into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9076-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I honor and bid farewell to my friend \nand our colleague, Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota. Norm and I served \ntogether for 6 years in the Senate and on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He also served on the Agriculture, Aging, Homeland Security, \nand Small Business Committees. He has a legislative record to be proud \nof.\n  As our colleagues know, I have long enjoyed my work with Native \npeople. Norm, throughout his tenure, was a steadfast friend of American \nIndian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian people and a strong advocate \nfor the interests of the tribes in his home State of Minnesota. His \nvoice will be missed in the U.S. Senate on these issues.\n  As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Norm pushed for drastic reforms in our Nation's emergency \nresponse and recovery capabilities in the wake of the failed response \nto Hurricane Katrina. He was diligent and steadfast in his desire to \nprotect our country and deeply engaged in efforts to increase \nprotections for our Nation's critical infrastructure.\n  I will remember Norm as one who had a love and appreciation for my \nState of Alaska. On several occasions he enjoyed the beauty of Alaska \nwhile seeking his prized king salmon on the Kenai River. Norm further \nextended his Alaska ties by hiring Jennifer Mies Lowe, who is married \nto my former chief of staff, George Lowe. Jennifer served Senator \nStevens for many years before moving to Senator Coleman's office as his \nchief of staff.\n  Norm has a long record of public service fighting for Minnesotans. He \nserved as mayor of St. Paul before being called by the people of \nMinnesota to come to the U.S. Senate.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss why we need a \nclean energy economy and how natural gas will be a critical component \nof our future energy mix.\n  We need legislation to move forward, to the President's desk, this \nyear. To compete in a 21st century global economy, the United States \nmust take immediate action to transition to a clean energy market, one \nthat allows us to take advantage of the many different clean energy \nsources that our country has to offer.\n  Some have asked why we need to act on clean energy legislation.\n  Several of my colleagues this week have eloquently discussed the \nimpacts of carbon pollution. In the West, we are already seeing \nindications of climate change through warmer winters and drier summers. \nThis is a global challenge that we must address and not ignore. But, \nirrespective of the impacts of carbon pollution to our communities and \nenvironment, clean energy legislation really comes down to two things--\nour economic and national security.\n  Clean energy legislation will create millions of new jobs here at \nhome and provide the basis for America's 21st century economy. Clean \nenergy economy legislation will spur innovation in and accelerate the \nshift to clean and domestic energy sources. It will create a new \nindustrial sector employing millions of Americans in the research, \ndevelopment, manufacture, sale, installation, and servicing of new \nenergy technologies. With the U.S. leading the way, we will sell our \nnew technologies to other countries throughout the world.\n  Clean energy legislation will also help strengthen our national \nsecurity. The most obvious reason, of course, is that switching to \nclean, domestic sources of energy will reduce our dependence on foreign \noil by shifting America toward cheaper, cleaner alternative energy \nsources like natural gas and wind power. Our current economy \nunfortunately depends on the importation of foreign oil from nations \nthat do not have our best interests at heart, which creates threats to \nAmerica's national security and puts our troops in harm's way.\n  Where does this leave us?\n  We need to jump-start our clean energy economy, and that means we \nneed to invest in the wide range of energy sources that are available \nnow, as well as research and development of future energy sources.\n  This is not about a silver bullet answer to our energy problems: it \nis, rather, like silver buckshot.\n  On the ground, that means we should encourage energy development of \nnew renewable energy sources, find cleaner ways to use traditional \nenergy sources like coal and oil, and expand our use of clean, mature \ntechnologies like nuclear and natural gas.\n  Natural gas, in particular, often does not get the attention that it \ndeserves among our diverse portfolio of clean energy sources.\n  Natural gas will be the bridge between today's economy and our clean \nenergy future.\n  It is the cleanest of the fossil fuels and has the lowest greenhouse \ngas emissions per unit of energy, emitting about half of the \nCO2 of coal when burned for electricity generation.\n  Furthermore, the technology is already being used by utilities across \nthe country. Let me emphasize again--this is mature technology that is \nalready in use across the country to power our homes and businesses.\n  In fact, natural gas accounts for 24 percent of the energy \nconsumption in this country and approximately 98 percent of U.S. \nnatural gas consumption originates right here in North America, \nprincipally from the United States and Canada.\n  Using natural gas means that we do not have to depend on foreign \ngovernments determining the cost of our energy or whether or not we \neven have access to it. And increasing natural gas production and use \nmeans that we are creating jobs and supporting families here at home.\n  Natural gas is an abundant resource across our country.\n\n[[Page S9077]]\n\n  In recent years, natural gas production from conventional resources \nhas continued to decline, but production from unconventional resources \nsuch as coal beds, tight gas sands, and particularly from natural gas \nshales has increased.\n  These are in regions--such as the Northeast--that are not \ntraditionally thought of as gas-producing States. In fact, expanded \ndrilling in tight gas sands and gas shales helped increase total U.S. \ngas production by about 9 percent in 2008 after a decade of its being \nroughly constant.\n  We also have natural gas reserves, particularly off our coasts, that \nhave yet to be fully explored.\n  Now, let me be clear in that I do not support drilling for gas \nanywhere and everywhere. I believe certain areas, both on and offshore, \nshould be placed off limits to development.\n  But we also need to take advantage of this domestic resource and \ndevelop some of these resources in an environmentally friendly way. \nThat is why, during consideration of the clean energy bill in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, I supported Senator Dorgan's \nefforts to open up the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to development.\n  Between recent discoveries of new domestic natural gas reserves and \nuntapped reserves offshore, natural gas can continue to be a vital \nenergy source for our country. The latest estimates indicate that we \nhave enough reserves to sustain our current consumption rate for almost \n100 years--and that is without new technology development or new \nreserve discoveries.\n  It is also important to understand how natural gas interacts with \nother energy sources, particularly renewable energy, like wind and \nsolar. Many here in the Senate know that I am a strong proponent of a \nnational renewable electricity standard, or RES. Colorado already has a \nState RES and it has been very successful in both increasing our use of \nrenewable energy sources and bringing new jobs to our State. However, \nrenewable energy sources alone will not be enough to fulfill our \ncountry's energy needs, especially in the short term, and electricity \npowered by natural gas will play a critical role in adjusting to the \nvariability of renewable energy generation.\n  We can take these steps to decrease our carbon emissions and promote \nour domestic energy sources without increased energy costs for \nconsumers. New natural gas combined-cycle plants are competitive with \nnew coal plants. Natural gas plants have lower capital costs and \nshorter construction times than coal-fired powerplants. For example, \nthe National Academies of Sciences recently released a report \n``America's Energy Future: Technology and Transformation'' as part of a \ncomprehensive look at our energy policy. The report found that, at a \nprice of $6 per million Btu, natural gas plants have the lowest \nlifetime cost of electricity of comparable energy source.\n  While there has been concern in recent years over price fluctuation \nin the natural gas market, the Energy Information Administration \nprojects that prices will range from $6 to $9 per million Btu or lower \nfor natural gas for decades.\n  Yet natural gas is not just for producing electricity. Clean natural \ngas is already being used as an alternative fuel for vehicles. \nDeveloping a stronger and wider market for natural gas vehicles will \nreduce our dependency on foreign oil, create jobs, and benefit the \nenvironment.\n  As of 2006, there were about 116,000 compressed natural gas vehicles \nand about 3,000 liquefied natural gas vehicles in the United States. \nAbout two-thirds of these natural gas vehicles are passenger vehicles.\n  The benefits of creating a natural gas fuel system akin to the \ncurrent petroleum system would be immediate. Average consumers would \nsave about $800 in fuel costs by switching to natural gas. And, again, \nnot only is natural gas cheaper for powering vehicles but it would also \nemit fewer greenhouse gases than gasoline vehicles and natural gas \ncould be produced domestically.\n  These facts seem almost too good to be true, but they are just that: \nfacts. What we need now is to invest in natural gas and support \ncreating a viable natural gas vehicle industry.\n  So natural gas--a clean, domestic fuel source that powers mature \ntechnology--is already a force in our electricity market and is a \ngrowing factor in our transportation system. Yet the current--the bill \nthat the House passed does not include appropriate encouragement for \nthis energy source.\n  As I work with my colleagues here to pass clean energy legislation \nthis year, I will continue to push for incentives for natural gas \npowered electricity and clean natural gas vehicles. America--and \nColorado--can become the world leader in clean energy, exporting our \nexpertise, intellectual property, and products worldwide, just as we \nhave done repeatedly throughout our history. With our budding renewable \nenergy industry and strong support for traditional energy sources, \nColorado has a tremendous opportunity to lead the clean energy \nrevolution, and I do not want us to miss it. But that means we must \ntake action now and that is why we need to get clean energy legislation \npassed this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9077-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING THOMAS MAROVICH, JR.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Thomas M. Marovich, Jr. This brave man lost his \nlife while working to protect Californians from a forest fire.\n  On July 21, 2009, Thomas Marovich died during a rappel proficiency \ntraining exercise while he was assigned as an apprentice with the \nChester Helitack Crew fighting the Backbone Fire in Humboldt County. He \nwas 20 years old.\n  Those who knew Thomas recall that, since childhood, his dream was to \nbecome a firefighter. When he was a student at James Logan High School \nin Union City, he was honored as Student of the Year in the regional \nfire technology program. Shortly thereafter, he began his firefighting \nservice as a member of the Cadet Program for the Fremont Fire \nDepartment at the age of 17 and became an emergency medical technician, \nEMT, by 18. He was hired on as a firefighter for the Modoc National \nForest in the Big Valley Ranger District in Adin, CA, after working as \na volunteer while completing basic fire training. In 2008, after two \nfire seasons, he was hired as a Wildland firefighter apprentice to \ntrain for fire management. Thomas is survived by his parents, sister, \nand three grandparents.\n  Thomas Marovich, like all those who fight fires across California, \nput his life on the line to protect our communities. My heart goes out \nto his family and loved ones and my thoughts and prayers are with them. \nWe are forever indebted to him for his courage, service, and \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9077-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9077-S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the members of \nthe Women Airforce Service Pilots, WASP, hailing from the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania who have recently received our Nation's highest \ncivilian award--the Congressional Gold Medal. Joan Frost, Julia Jordan, \nRuth Kunkle, Eleanor Lawry, Kristin Lent, Barbara Posey, Florence \nReynolds, and Lillian Yonally exemplify hard work, courage, and \ncommitment to their country.\n  The WASP were the first female pilots in America's Armed Forces. They \nwere stationed at 120 Army air bases across America, from where they \nflew approximately 60 million miles in less than 2 years and in a \nvariety of aircraft. Over 25,000 women applied to the program, a select \n1,800 went through basic training, and 1,074 women graduated.\n  The contributions of these brave women to the success of the United \nStates in WW II cannot be minimized, and I am truly proud that several \nof these extraordinary women called Pennsylvania home. To each of these \nwomen, I would like to say thank you for your contribution to aviation. \nBy going against convention, you broke important barriers and are the \nreason why female pilots fly in every type of aircraft and mission, \nincluding combat sorties, today.\n  I am sure that each time a young person sees a black-and-white photo \nof a young smiling female pilot leaning out the window of her B-26 \nMarauder,\n\n[[Page S9078]]\n\nshe or he is inspired with a sense of adventure and a desire to \ndiscover the joy of flying that the WASP sought and achieved. \nTherefore, I again congratulate Pennsylvania's eight WASP and WASP \nnationwide. I wish you all the best as you continue to share your \npatriotism and courage with your family, friends, and \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9078-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING WISCONSIN NATIONAL GUARD UNIT\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to recognize the \nachievements of the members of 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry, part of \nWisconsin's 32nd Infantry Brigade, for its selection as the top \nbattalion in the Army National Guard of the United States. Mr. \nPresident, 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry has been selected as the \nwinner of the Walter T. Kerwin Jr. Award for Readiness and Training for \n2009. The award is given annually to the Army National Guard unit found \nto have the highest deployment readiness in the Nation, and I am \npleased that the men and women of this Eau Claire-based unit were found \nto have standards of training and maintenance that exceeded the \nstandards for deployment.\n  The U.S. Army has selected 2009 to be the ``Year of the NCO'' to pay \ntribute to the day-to-day leadership qualities of the noncommissioned \nofficers charged with executing the training and maintenance that make \ntheir units function. In the spirit of the ``Year of the NCO,'' I would \nlike to pay a special tribute to the NCOs of 1st Battalion, 128th \nInfantry, as their leadership helped make it possible for the unit to \nachieve the standards that earned them this award.\n  I had the honor of attending the February send-off ceremony prior to \nthe unit's deployment to Iraq. I consider myself privileged to have \nattended the ceremony where the State of Wisconsin and the soldiers' \nfamilies paid tribute to the State's largest National Guard deployment \nsince World War II. The soldiers of 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry spent \nnearly years training for their mission, and the high standards \nestablished during that preparation are now nationally recognized. I \napplaud the service of the members of the brigade, and I wish them \nsuccess in their mission to help stabilize Iraq and look forward to \ntheir return home next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9078-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9078-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9078-4", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n              Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolutions Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of August 5, 2009, the Acting \nPresident pro tempore (Mr. Reid) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills and joint resolutions:\n\n       H.R. 774.

A bill to keep Americans working by strengthening and \nexpanding short-time compensation programs that provide employers with \nan alternative to layoffs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Keep Americans \nWorking Act, legislation to strengthen and expand work share programs \nto keep Americans working and provide employers with an alternative to \nlayoffs.\n  This legislation allows employers to reduce the hours of their \nworkers for some period of time and for the workers to receive \nproportionate unemployment benefits for those reduced hours to lessen \nthe impact on them and their families.\n  While 17 States, including Rhode Island, are using their resources to \nprovide work share, these programs remain largely underutilized. \nIndeed, work share is simply not available in \\2/3\\ of States.\n  In Rhode Island, the number of employees participating in the program \nhas more than tripled this past year to 8,000 workers, in comparison to \nthe year prior. It has also been highly successful. For instance, I \nrecently visited Hope Global in Cumberland, Rhode Island, which has \nparticipated in Rhode Island's WorkShare program. At this company, I \nlistened to an employee who worked there with her husband, and they \nbenefitted from this program. She said, point blank: Without it, we \nwould have lost our health care and we would have lost our home.\n  Other states with work share programs have also experienced an \nextraordinary increase in participation.\n  But given Rhode Island's 12.4 percent unemployment rate--the second \nhighest in the country--we can stem even more job loss with this \nlegislation. Specifically, the Keep Americans Working Act provides \nstates with temporary federal financing for 100 percent of work share \nbenefits paid to workers for up to 26 weeks. Employers have to certify \nthat maintenance of health and retirement benefits is not affected by \nparticipation in the program. This financing program is available for 2 \nyears.\n  It also includes important limitations to ensure that taxpayer \ndollars are provided only when appropriate safeguards are in place. To \nhold employers accountable, states can assess penalties on employers \nthat break the rules, including those who do not act in good faith to \nretain participating employees. In addition, to aid States in this \neffort, the Department of Labor would establish an oversight and \nmonitoring process for state agencies to ensure that participating \nemployers comply with the terms of the written plan approved by the \nstate agency.\n  Given that State labor agencies are already doing more with less, \nthis legislation also provides for administrative funding, and for \nthose States that are trying to get work share programs off the ground, \nit provides start-up grants.\n  It is a win-win for all.\n  First, work share helps speed economic recovery. Economist Mark Zandi \nestimates that temporary financing of work share offers a very high \n``bang for the buck'' of $1.69. That is, every $1 devoted to finance \nState work share programs results in $1.69 in real GDP.\n  Secondly, work share allows businesses to retain skilled workers, \ntemporarily cut costs, and maintain employee morale.\n  Thirdly, it keeps people working with their health insurance and \nretirement benefits. This means parents can continue to pay their \nmortgages and their bills and provide for their families.\n  This legislation will help stem the tide of joblessness, providing \nworkers, businesses, and communities with the resources to stay afloat \nwhile we work our way through these tough economic times.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Americans Working \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to keep Americans working by \n     strengthening and expanding short-time compensation programs \n     that provide employers with an alternative to layoffs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for additional emergency unemployment \ncompensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Assistance for \nUnemployed Workers Extension Act, legislation to extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits so people can pay their bills while they look for \nwork. These benefits are set to expire at the end of this year. I am \njoined in introducing this critical legislation by Senators Durbin, \nSchumer, Boxer, Lautenberg, Levin, Stabenow, Whitehouse, Kerry, \nMenendez, Cardin, Brown, Begich, Burris, and Franken.\n  Last fall, I authored the law that provided additional weeks of \nunemployment insurance for individuals exhausting their benefits. Among \nother provisions to help stimulate the economy, create jobs, and help \nthe unemployed, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act extended the \ntermination dates of these unemployment benefits.\n  Yet, as jobs have become scarcer, we need to do more. My legislation \nwill continue several current-law unemployment compensation programs \nthrough 2010.\n  In addition, it also provides help to those who are getting stuck on \nunemployment for long periods. Indeed, there is only roughly one job \nopening for every five job seekers.\n  The Assistance for Unemployed Workers Extension Act provides 13 \nadditional weeks of unemployment insurance for states like Rhode \nIsland, South Carolina, Oregon, California, Ohio, Michigan, and Georgia \nas well as\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\nother states which have an unemployment rate at or above 8.5 percent.\n  Without this legislation, over half a million workers are expected to \nexhaust their benefits by the end of September, and another 1.5 million \nare estimated to run out of coverage by the end of the year. This is an \nextraordinary number of Americans that will face life without a \npaycheck or an unemployment check during the worst economy since the \nGreat Depression.\n  While all states are suffering during these very difficult times, my \nown State of Rhode Island has been hit especially hard, saddled with \nthe second highest unemployment rate and a recession that hit earlier \nthan in any other State.\n  More than 1,500 Rhode Islanders have exhausted their unemployment \ninsurance benefits this year. By November, another 3,300 unemployed \nRhode Islanders will also exhaust their benefits. This is about 150 \npeople each week.\n  Providing basic support for those who are out-of-work through no \nfault of their own assures Americans can provide for their families and \nkeep a roof over their heads, stemming the tide of foreclosures and the \ndeterioration of neighborhoods.\n  As has been the case with past extensions, I look forward to working \non a bipartisan basis to pass this legislation. It is critical that we \nprovide help to the growing ranks of the unemployed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nreplace the Federal Election Commission with the Federal Election \nAdministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my partner in \nreform, the senior Senator from Arizona, to introduce the Federal \nElection Administration Act of 2009. Americans naturally expect that \nelections in this country will be honest, fair, and above all, lawful. \nThat is the purpose of the Federal Election Commission, yet the FEC's \nwillingness to enforce the law has gone from bad to worse. Now more \nthan ever, the health of our democracy depends on whether Congress will \ntake decisive action to fix this unpardonably broken agency.\n  Senator McCain and I originally introduced this bill in 2003, after \ngiving the FEC a fair chance to implement the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, or BCRA. Despite our very best efforts and those of our \nHouse sponsors, Representatives Shays and Meehan, the FEC opened new \nloopholes rather than trying to faithfully discern the intent of the \nlaw. It acted as an unelected legislature, substituting its policy \njudgments for those of Congress.\n  This is not my personal judgment. This is the judgment of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has struck down \nover twenty of the FEC's implementing regulations as arbitrary and \ncapricious or directly contrary to the will of Congress. In its most \nrecent opinion in 2008, the court was merciless in its criticism of the \nFEC. It said some of the FEC's arguments were ``absurd'', or ``fl[y] in \nthe face of common sense''; or ``disregard[] everything Congress, the \nSupreme Court, and this court have said about campaign finance \nregulation''; or ``ignore[] both history and human nature.'' It said \nthat one regulation ``provides a clear roadmap'' for using soft money \nin connection with federal elections, ``directly frustrating BCRA's \npurpose.'' It said that the rule ``would lead to the exact perception \nand possibility of corruption Congress sought to stamp out in BCRA.'' \nThis is not language that the American people should ever hear from a \ncourt about a law enforcement agency.\n  The situation has only gotten worse. Earlier this year, the FEC blew \na hole through the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, \nissuing a regulation that allows lobbyists to hide the bundling of \ncampaign contributions that the law was designed to make public. The \nFEC disregarded clear and deliberate statements of congressional \nintent, not only from me but from then-Senator Barack Obama.\n  Those laws that the FEC cannot regulate out of existence, it smothers \nwith inaction. During the first six months of 2008, the FEC was \neffectively closed for business because President Bush insisted on \nstanding behind a nominee, Hans Von Spakovsky, whom the Senate would \nnot confirm. We were in the middle of a presidential election year, \nwith no enforcement of federal election law. That deadlock was broken \nwhen Mr. Von Spakovsky's nomination was finally withdrawn and four new \nCommissioners and one holdover Commissioner were confirmed in July \n2008.\n  But the cure turned out to be worse than the disease. In the words of \nThe Washington Post: ``What's worse than a federal agency that lacks \nthe quorum of commissioners necessary to act on a matter? Answer: An \nagency that has a quorum in place but is paralyzed from acting anyway \nbecause it is deadlocked along party lines.''\n  The whole point of having six commissioners, three Democrats and \nthree Republicans, was to protect against partisan enforcement of the \nelection laws. But over the past year we've seen election laws enforced \nagainst neither party. In well over a dozen cases, whether the likely \nlawbreaker was linked to George Soros or Mitt Romney, a 3-to-3 deadlock \nhas prevented the FEC professional staff from doing their job. Even \nadmitted offenders have been let off the hook: On at least two \noccasions, the FEC declined to collect fines that election law \nviolators had already agreed to pay. That's like a district attorney \ntearing up a criminal's plea bargain.\n  It gives me no pleasure to say this, but enough is enough. The \ncurrent structure of the FEC cannot meet the challenges of enforcing \nour election laws in the 21st century. In this bill, we replace the FEC \nwith a new agency, the Federal Election Administration. The FEA will be \nhelmed by three members instead of six, so that there is always a \ntiebreaker and we stop seeing perpetual deadlock. The Chair will have a \nten-year term to encourage independence. The other two members will \nhave staggered six-year terms. Our hope is that this new agency will \nnot be the captive of the political parties, but instead, led by a \nstrong and independent Chair, will be the trustworthy law enforcement \nagency that the American people want to see.\n  To that end, we have followed the model of more effective regulatory \nagencies such as the EPA, the NLRB, and the SEC. The FEA will have a \ncorps of Administrative Law Judges to adjudicate complaints that the \nAdministration's professional staff will bring. The new agency will \nhave the power to determine violations of our election laws and to \nassess penalties subject, of course, to judicial review.\n  Americans want our democratically enacted laws to be enforced, as a \nmatter of public good and public trust. If the EPA doesn't enforce \npollution laws, our drinking water gets poisoned. If the SEC doesn't \nenforce the securities laws, our economy gets poisoned. If the FEC does \nnot enforce election laws, our democracy gets poisoned.\n  The new Federal Election Administration will ensure that our \ndemocracy remains healthy, strong, and fair. I want to thank my friend \nSenator McCain for all of his work on campaign finance and other reform \nissues for well over a decade, and I look forward to working closely \nwith him again to pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 241\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, known as ``PKD'', is 1 \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a severe, dominantly \n     inherited disease that has a devastating impact, in both \n     human and economic terms, affecting equally people of all \n     ages, races, sexes, nationalities, geographic locations, and \n     income levels;\n       Whereas there are 2 hereditary forms of polycystic kidney \n     disease, with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease \n     (ADPKD) affecting 1 in 500 people worldwide, including \n     600,000 patients with polycystic kidney disease in the United \n     States, according to prevalence estimates by the National \n     Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas in families in which 1 or both parents have ADPKD \n     there is a 50-percent chance that the parents will pass the \n     disease to their children;\n       Whereas autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease \n     (ARPKD), a rarer form of PKD, affects 1 in 20,000 live births \n     and frequently leads to early death;\n       Whereas in families in which both parents carry ARPKD there \n     is a 25-percent chance that the parents will pass the disease \n     to their children;\n       Whereas, in addition to patients directly affected by \n     polycystic kidney disease, countless additional friends, \n     loved ones, family members, colleagues, and caregivers must \n     shoulder the physical, emotional, and financial burdens of \n     polycystic kidney disease;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, for which there is no \n     treatment or cure, is the leading cause of kidney failure \n     resulting from a genetic disease, and 1 of the 4 leading \n     causes of kidney failure in the United States;\n       Whereas the vast majority of patients with polycystic \n     kidney disease have kidney failure at the age of 53, on \n     average, causing a severe strain on dialysis and kidney \n     transplantation resources and on the delivery of health care \n     in the United States, as the largest segment of the \n     population of the United States, the baby boomers, continues \n     to age;\n       Whereas end-stage renal disease is one of the fastest \n     growing components of the Medicare budget, and polycystic \n     kidney disease contributes to the cost with an estimated \n     $2,000,000,000 budgeted annually for dialysis, kidney \n     transplantation, and related therapies;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease instills in patients a \n     fear of an unknown future with a life-threatening genetic \n     disease, and apprehension over possible genetic \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas the severity of the symptoms of polycystic kidney \n     disease and the limited public awareness of the disease cause \n     many patients to fail to recognize the presence of the \n     disease, to forego regular visits to physicians, and not to \n     receive good health or therapeutic management that would help \n     avoid more severe complications when kidney failure occurs;\n       Whereas people suffering from chronic, life-threatening \n     diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, are more \n     frequently predisposed to depression and the resulting \n     consequences of depression because of anxiety over the \n     possible pain, suffering, and premature death that people \n     with polycystic kidney disease may face;\n       Whereas the Senate and taxpayers of the United States want \n     treatments and cures for disease and hope to see results from \n     investments in research conducted by the National Institutes \n     of Health and from initiatives such as the National \n     Institutes of Health Roadmap to the Future;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is an example of how \n     collaboration, technological\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\n     innovation, scientific momentum, and public-private \n     partnerships can--\n       (1) generate therapeutic interventions that directly \n     benefit the people suffering from polycystic kidney disease;\n       (2) save billions of Federal dollars under Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, kidney \n     transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related therapies; \n     and\n       (3) allow several thousand openings on the kidney \n     transplant waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to the discovery of the 3 primary genes that \n     cause polycystic kidney disease, and the 3 primary protein \n     products of the genes, and to the understanding of cell \n     structures and signaling pathways that cause cyst growth that \n     has produced multiple polycystic kidney disease clinical drug \n     trials;\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide \n     dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering public \n     awareness and understanding, educating patients and their \n     families about polycystic kidney disease to improve treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors; and\n       Whereas volunteers engage in an annual national awareness \n     event held during the third week of September, making that \n     week an appropriate time to recognize National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the period beginning on September 13, 2009, \n     and ending on September 19, 2009, as ``National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to support National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \n     Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities;\n       (B) to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease; and\n       (C) to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9091-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFGHANISTAN'S UPCOMING ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

GRUCCIO, and ending SARA \n     A. SLAUGHTER, which nominations were received by the Senate \n     and appeared in the Congressional Record of July 31, 2009.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Francis Collins\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, few people have had as significant an \nimpact on the scientific world over the past two decades as Dr. Francis \nCollins, President Obama's nominee to head the National Institutes of \nHealth. As director of the National Human Genome Research Institute \nfrom 1993 to 2008, Dr. Collins has led the way in medical innovation.\n  As his most renowned accomplishment at NHGRI, Dr. Collins achieved \nunparalleled success leading the revolutionary Human Genome Project. \nEstablished in 1990, the Project's goal was to map out the thousands of \ngenes that make up the human genome in order to better understand the \ngenetic makeup of humans and to ultimately reveal the cures for our \nmost challenging diseases. In 2003, the Human Genome Project, under the \nguidance of Dr. Collins, released its completed version of the entire \nhuman genome, an unprecedented achievement. Dr. Collins' work has led \nto some ground-breaking medical discoveries, including the \nidentification of genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes and \nthe genes responsible for cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, \nHuntington's disease and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. To allow \nthis data to be used as effectively as possible, Dr. Collins has \nensured that all of the data obtained by the Human Genome Project be \nmade available to the entire scientific community without restrictions \non access or use.\n  Among other prestigious honors, Dr. Collins has been elected to the \nInstitute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences, two of the \nmost influential medical organizations in the world. In addition, on \nNovember 5, 2007, Collins received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nthe nation's highest civil award, for his remarkable contributions to \nthe field of genetic research.\n  Not only has Dr. Collins proven himself to be a brilliant and \nrevolutionary scientist, but he is also a remarkably effective leader. \nPerhaps the greatest evidence of this quality is displayed by his \nability to finish the human genome sequence both ahead of schedule and \nunder budget. It is clear why President Obama selected him to lead this \nimportant agency.\n  Last week, I met with Dr. Collins to discuss his vision for the \nfuture of NIH. He is my constituent, as are many of the scientists who \nwork at the Rockville campus, and the academic institutions and \nbusinesses that thrive due in no small part to NIH grants and other \nextramural programs. I am extremely proud to represent all of them.\n  During our meeting, I raised serious concerns about recent actions of \nNIH leadership with regard to two grant programs, the Small Business \nInnovation Research program and the Small Technology Transfer Program. \nFederal law requires departments that award more than $100 million in \nextramural grants annually to devote a total of 2.8 percent to small \nbusinesses to foster innovation. These programs are catalysts for job \ncreation and job growth, and a recent study found that 25 percent of \nall new product innovations were brought to market by SBIR grantees. \nBut a provision--encouraged by NIH--was inserted during conference into \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, with no notice to the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee, where I serve, although we \nhave jurisdiction over these programs. That provision excluded the NIH \nfunds in ARRA from the SBIR and STTR requirements, effectively denying \nsmall businesses $230 million in research grant opportunities. Its \norigins are still unknown.\n  The effect on small businesses has been devastating, leading some \nbiotechnology firms in my State to lay off employees or close due to \nlack of funding. In June, I chaired a field hearing about this issue in \nRockville, and although the hearing location was minutes away from the \nNIH campus, the agency did not send a witness. NIH staff promised to \nsubmit testimony, but it was faxed to us 2 hours after the hearing had \nended. In addition, during the hearing, we received testimony citing a \nhistory of perceived bias among NIH review panels against SBIR \napplications.I raised these concerns with Dr. Collins, and we had a \nfrank and open discussion. Dr. Collins spoke of his high regard for the \nSBIR program and noted that he could not have completed the Human \nGenome Project in such a timely and cost-efficient manner absent the \ninvolvement of small biotechnology companies. He has promised to work \nwith me and other members of the Committee to ensure that NIH \nparticipation in SBIR and STTR proceeds according to congressional \nintent. I am encouraged by his support for these programs, and I \nbelieve that the Small Business Committee, will have a much improved \nworking relationship with NIH going forward. I left that meeting with \nconfidence in Dr. Collins' ability to lead this essential agency very \neffectively.\n  Going forward, Dr. Collins faces numerous challenges, implementing \nthe new policy on federally funded stem cell research, moving forward \non promising cancer research, and developing strategies to combat the \nglobal AIDS epidemic, among others. These challenges require a \nvisionary leader with the level of expertise and management experience \nthat Dr. Collins possesses.\n  I am pleased to express my support for the nomination of Dr. Francis \nCollins to be the next Director of the National Institutes of Health, \nand I look forward to working with him in the years to come.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the attached \nletter of support from the March of Dimes for the nomination of Francis \nCollins to be Director of the National Institutes of Health be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        March of Dimes Foundation,\n\n\n                               Office of Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the 3 million \n     volunteers and 1,400 staff at the March of Dimes Foundation I \n     am writing to highlight Francis Collins's, MD PhD exceptional \n     contributions to biomedical research and to acquaint Congress \n     with Dr. Collins' long standing relationship with the \n     Foundation. This letter is submitted for inclusion in the \n     Congressional Record.\n       The Foundation's investments in biomedical research are a \n     cornerstone of the March of Dimes mission. March of Dimes \n     programs fund several different types of research, all aimed \n     at preventing birth defects and infant mortality and securing \n     reproductive health. These programs and projects include \n     basic research into life processes, such as genetics and \n     development; clinical research applied to prevention and \n     treatment of specific birth defects and prematurity; the \n     study of environmental hazards; and research in social and \n     behavioral sciences relevant to our mission. In 1985, the \n     March of Dimes recognized Dr. Collins's promising talent, \n     naming him a Basil O'Connor Research Scholar and awarding him \n     a grant the Foundation reserves for young investigators at \n     the start of their independent careers. This award marked the \n     beginning of a long and productive relationship with Dr. \n     Collins.\n       Throughout his career, Dr. Collins has focused on advancing \n     scientific knowledge that has laid the foundation for \n     identifying and treating genetic disorders. For example, Dr. \n     Collins was instrumental in the discovery of the gene \n     responsible for cystic fibrosis, thereby providing the \n     opportunity to design interventions for managing this complex \n     birth defect and accelerating the search for its amelioration \n     and potential cure. As Director of the National Human Genome \n     Research Institute, Dr. Collins oversaw the sequencing and \n     mapping of the human genome, a major contribution to \n     scientific research and one that has already led to the \n     development of strategies for preventing and treating various \n     birth defects and hereditary diseases.\n       The March of Dimes continues to invest in intellectually \n     gifted young investigators because it is they who hold the \n     greatest promise for progress in research and science. All of \n     us at the Foundation look forward to the forthcoming \n     confirmation and to working with you and Dr. Collins to \n     improve the health of women and children here and around the \n     world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dr. Jennifer L. Howse,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Jon Huntsman, Jr.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination of \nthe Honorable Jon Huntsman, Jr., to be the U.S. Ambassador to China.\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\n  I think it goes without saying that Governor Huntsman is a man of \nintegrity whose service to the State of Utah has been of great worth. \nIndeed, what Utah stands to lose from this nomination is exactly what \nthe United States and China stand to gain: a seasoned diplomat, an \nexcellent manager, a qualified politician, and a man who wants the very \nbest for the country he loves and has served for more than 20 years.\n  It takes great courage for a Republican Governor of one of the \nreddest, most conservative States in the Nation to accept an invitation \nto serve under a Democratic President; yet this is the same courage \nGovernor Huntsman has displayed throughout his career. From his time as \na staff assistant in the Reagan administration to his work in the \ntrenches at the Commerce Department, Jon Huntsman, Jr., has proved to \nbe an innovative leader, a progressive thinker, and someone who comes \nto this position at a time when the United States needs an Ambassador \nto China who will strive to forge the kind of relationships we need to \nmove forward in the globally connected world of the 21st century.\n  As the Ambassador to China, the challenges before Governor Huntsman \nwill neither be easy nor few. Our relations with other nations are the \nfoundation of peace and stability on the planet. And when Richard Nixon \nreached out and brought China back into the international system in \n1972, a huge structural imbalance in the global system was redressed.\n  The United States and China are very different countries with vastly \ndifferent experiences and, based on our very different government \nstructures, very different values. Yet, as we know, our countries have \ndeveloped complex and mutually beneficial relations. We also know that \nour nations have great potential for beneficial relations, but, as \nanyone who studies history and geopolitics knows, we have the potential \nto clash as China grows and expands its influence. That is why it is \nimportant for us today to continue what Richard Nixon started: a world \nwhere our countries can exist in peace.\n  In my years in the Senate, I have seen a huge change in our country's \nrelationship with China. When I came here, President Carter was just \nfinalizing the Nixon initiative, and I led the move to pass the Taiwan \nRelations Act, which allowed for the United States to continue a \nsupportive relationship with Taiwan even though we had withdrawn our \ndiplomatic recognition. I have seen China evolve from a Maoist \ntotalitarian system to a communist police state that has allowed many \npersonal freedoms and a historic transformation of the economy using \ncapitalist principles. This is a relationship that must be handled by \nexperienced China hands and professionals.\n  That is why I find it gratifying that President Obama has chosen to \ngo with someone of great experience and ability--Governor Huntsman. I \nalso find it noteworthy that the Governor has been here twice before--\nfirst when he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. \nAmbassador to the Chinese nation of Singapore under President George \nH.W. Bush, and then as a Deputy U.S. Trade Representative under \nPresident George W. Bush. Now, in his third appearance before the \nSenate as a nominee, he has answered the President's call to serve as \nAmbassador to China and leaves his post in Utah where, I might add, he \nwas reelected to a second term as Governor with more than 70 percent of \nthe vote. This speaks volumes about Governor Huntsman's ability to \ncross bridges, conquer divides, and put aside partisan politics when \ndoing what he believes to be best for his family, our State, and our \ncountry.\n  It is no secret that under Governor Huntsman's stewardship, Utah has \nbeen named the best-managed State by the Pew Research Center. Building \non the excellent work of our State legislature, the Governor has helped \nlead our State in economic development initiatives and incentive \nprograms that have shaped Utah into one of the most dynamic States in \nthe Nation.\n  In short, I cannot think of a more qualified nominee for Ambassador \nto China than Governor Huntsman. He is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, a \nskill that is vitally important in this day and age. Indeed, the \nGovernor has been to China on numerous occasions and even learned \nChinese while serving a mission in Taiwan for The Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. It is in that light that I have no doubt \nthe Chinese will have to respect his affection for Taiwan as much as \nthey respect his linguistic ability.\n  Moreover, while the Governor will not be making policy, he will be \nknown to the Chinese as a Republican. They will see him as an \nindependent thinker, while always being loyal to the administration he \nserves.\n  Finally, China is a country that admires the businessman and the \ntrader, and they are a country that knows that business and trade with \nthe United States is the key for their sustained success. These are \nvalues and experience the Governor knows, understands and has practiced \nduring his varied and impressive career in public service and private \nbusiness. His years in international business have exposed him to the \nuniverse of China experts--people such as my good friend John Kamm, the \npreeminent advocate of human rights in China. It is my hope that he \nwill keep the Embassy door open to these experts from around the world, \nand I am sure that he will.\n  Again, I commend President Obama for selecting Governor Huntsman for \nthis important post, even though Utah will lose a great leader as a \nresult. However, Governor Huntsman has left the State in good hands and \nwe all look forward to working with Lt. Gov. Gary Herbert in his new \nrole as Governor of the great State of Utah.\n  In closing, I believe I speak for all Utahns when I say Governor \nHuntsman will be missed, but we all know he is the appropriate person \nfor this job. Moreover, his selection could not come at a more \nappropriate time. Indeed, this is a time when a man like Governor \nHuntsman is needed on the world stage.\n  I congratulate Governor Huntsman on his nomination. I applaud his \nbeautiful wife Mary Kaye and her decision to continue to share his time \nand talents with the world. And I know his wonderful family will be \nblessed by his contribution to our country in this position.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask now that we proceed to Calendar Nos. \n217, 218, 219, 259, 260, 310, 311, 313 and that the nominations be \nconfirmed en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid on the table \nen bloc, and no further motions be in order and any statements relating \nto these matters be printed in the Record as if read and the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Coffin, of Vermont, to be United States \n     Attorney for the District of Vermont for the term of four \n     years.\n       Joyce White Vance, of Alabama, to be United States Attorney \n     for the Northern District of Alabama for the term of four \n     years.\n       Preet Bharara, of New York, to be United States Attorney \n     for the Southern District of New York for the term of four \n     years.\n       B.

Mitchell, of Virginia, to be a Commissioner of \n     the United States Parole Commission for a term of six years. \n     (Reappointment)\n\n\n                    Nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nspeak about Mr. Mayorkas' record and what I believe he will bring to \nthe Department of Homeland Security as Director of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. I have known Mr. Mayorkas for many years and am \nproud to have recommended him to President Clinton for the position of \nU.S. attorney for the Central District of California.\n  As U.S. attorney, Mr. Mayorkas developed an innovative program to \naddress violent crime by targeting criminals' possession of firearms, \nprosecuting street gangs, and at the same\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\ntime developing afterschool programs to help at-risk youth discover and \nrealize their potential.\n  Mr. Mayorkas has also worked directly on dozens of cases and overseen \nhundreds of attorneys relating to immigration during his tenure as a \nU.S. attorney. These cases included the prosecution of individuals and \nrings producing false immigration documents, illegal reentry cases, and \nalien smuggling conspiracies, among others.\n  For example, in 1999, at the very beginning of his career as U.S. \nattorney, Mr. Mayorkas prosecuted the ringleader of an Iranian visa \nforgery operation connected to terrorism. Bahram Tabatabai pleaded \nguilty to providing material assistance with immigration papers to \nmembers of the People's Mujahadeen, a group that the State Department \nconsiders a terrorist group. Tabatabai helped overseas foreign \nnationals obtain fake birth certificates and records to apply for \nbenefits and created false persecution stories for Iranians in the \nUnited States to apply for asylum.\n  Mr. Mayorkas also prosecuted Jesse Gardona who at the time was a 15-\nyear veteran of INS--for his role in moving 10 undocumented immigrants \nfrom an INS detention facility to an East Los Angeles drop house and \ndemanding as much as $1,800 in ransom from their relatives.\n  The mission of Citizenship and Immigration Services is to establish \nimmigration services, policies, and priorities to preserve America's \nlegacy as a nation of immigrants while ensuring that no one is admitted \nwho is a threat to public safety. Mr. Mayorkas has a record of working \nto secure our Nation's criminal and immigration laws in the face of \nincreasing gang and border violence--and as travel documents have \nbecome less secure, to work to ensure that fraud is no longer prevalent \nin our immigration system.\n  I am confident that under Mr. Mayorkas' leadership, this \nadministration will work to preserve and increase the integrity of our \nimmigration laws by decreasing fraud and bringing accountability to our \nimmigration system.\n  It is also my belief that Mr. Mayorkas has the vision to lead \nCitizenship and Immigration Services in the other half of its mission--\nto preserve the role of America as a compassionate Nation that treats \nfamilies and children at our shores humanely and with an eye toward the \npotential they bring to our Nation. In 1960, Mr. Mayorkas and his \nfamily fled Cuba and came to the United States as refugees. Since then, \nhe has lived the American dream and has done so by working on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, with the nomination of Mr. Mayorkas the administration \nhas taken a significant step toward rebuilding public confidence in the \nsecure, fair, and effective administration of our Nation's immigration \nlaws. I urge my colleagues to confirm Mr. Mayorkas today so that DHS \nwill have the leadership in place to get to work on behalf of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto Calendar Nos. 415 and 418 and that the nominations be confirmed en \nbloc, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table en bloc, no \nfurther motions be in order, and any statements relating to the \nnominations be printed in the Record and President Obama be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of having people \nto work with me and with us, and one of my prizes over these years has \nbeen a young man by the name of Jacques Purvis who has worked on my \npersonal staff. He is, of course, an integral part of the cloakroom. We \nsee him here every day. He helps send to me every day on my e-mail \naccount what is taking place each day. I read faithfully what is taking \nplace because I am not here all the time on the Senate floor. He is \nbright, hardworking, and so nice. He is going to be leaving the Senate \nto go to the London School of Economics for an advanced degree. I have \ntried to talk him out of it, but not really, because he has various \ngoals in mind. He is going to complete his studies in London, come back \nand go to law school. I hope after that time he will consider coming \nback and working in the Senate. We will all miss him. He is a wonderful \nyoung man, and I consider him a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/07/senate-section/article/S9096-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2009, AND TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
