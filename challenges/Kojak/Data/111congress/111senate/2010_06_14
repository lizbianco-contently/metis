Mr. President, we will learn a lot this week about who \nwants to fix problems and who wants to make excuses. This week will be \nthe seventh week the emergency unemployment insurance bill has been on \nthe Senate floor. It is another week the good families in Nevada and \nacross the country have to struggle to make ends meet after their \nbenefits have expired--to simply cover the basics while they look for \nfull-time work.\n  If my friends on the other side of the aisle have their way, this \nweek will be yet another week with no lifeline for the most needy--\nthose willing to work and who are waiting to work. The other side has \nslowed and stalled almost every piece of legislation this year, just as \nthey did last year and the year before. And that is not a secret. The \nnumbers don't lie and the Republicans make no efforts to hide their \nstrategy of delay. That is why today they are known as the party of no.\n  But that strategy has consequences. The first is unemployment \ninsurance. Years of disastrous Republican policies led to the worst \neconomic disaster in generations. That, in turn, led to layoffs in \nnearly every industry in every State. When millions of Americans lost \ntheir jobs, they lost their incomes, their homes, their savings, their \ngas money, their tuition payments, all through no fault of their own. \nDemocrats aren't about to turn their backs on out-of-work Americans, \nwhich is why we are trying to help them keep their heads above water in \nthis emergency.\n  The second casualty is Medicaid funding, known as FMAP, so the \npoorest of the poor in our communities can see a doctor when they get \nsick. Many States, including the State of Nevada, have budgeted for \nthis money and count on us to deliver it. Nevada is counting on more \nthan $100 million. Others are waiting on billions of dollars. If we \ndon't deliver, we will leave huge holes in State budgets that will be \nfilled with other deep and drastic cuts affecting the basic goodness of \nour country and directly the lives of millions. Critical services from \ncoast to coast will bear the burden. We have to pass this bill on the \nFMAP legislation. We have to do it to protect those services and the \njobs they create.\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\n  Third, this bill will fix an injustice to doctors who treat America's \nsenior citizens--those on Medicare. More than a decade ago, a \nRepublican-dominated Congress passed a flawed policy regarding how \ndoctors are reimbursed for seeing patients on Medicare. Tomorrow, these \ndoctors will see those payments drop 21 percent--that is more than one-\nfifth--and it will drop overnight. That is grossly unfair to doctors \nand it is dangerous for seniors, veterans, and others they may soon no \nlonger be able to treat.\n  But that is not all. Many HMOs and other providers base their \nreimbursements on Medicare rates. So you don't have to be a senior \ncitizen or a veteran to be affected by the sharp cut scheduled to take \neffect tomorrow.\n  Some on the other side are still trying again to stand in the way. As \nI said, the doctors payment problem came out of a Congress that was \ndominated by Republicans. The Democratic Congress is determined to fix \nthis.\n  Let's say a word about the BP disaster. Next week will mark 2 months \nsince millions of gallons of oil started gushing into the Gulf of \nMexico. But this week will tell us a lot about who is fighting for the \ntaxpayers and who is fighting for corporate America.\n\n  The cost of the BP disaster isn't limited to the devastated waters \nand wildlife along our gulf coast. The damage extends to the lives and \nlivelihoods of so many in that region--such as small businesses that \ncan't operate at full speed, and the workers whose jobs are threatened \nwhen these businesses slow. Whether it is fishermen, shrimpers, or \ntourism businesses whose workplace--the Gulf of Mexico--has been \npolluted on such a large scale, the damages would stretch clear across \nthe State of Nevada, from our California border to our Utah border. \nUnderstand how big that is. Nevada is the seventh largest State in the \nUnion, areawise.\n  Another cost, of course, is the families forever changed when 11 men \ndied in the explosion that caused the spill. Some estimate the pricetag \nfor this disaster will climb to the tens of billions of dollars. But \nlet's be honest: Someone is going to end up paying that bill \neventually, but we are making sure it is not going to be the taxpayers. \nWe are going to send the tab to BP.\n  That is why I sent a letter yesterday to Tony Hayward, BP's chief \nexecutive officer. I am pleased and encouraged that the vast majority \nof Democrats we could get hold of signed their names alongside mine. We \ntold Hayward we are committed to ensuring BP is held fully responsible, \nand that we refuse to ask taxpayers to bail out one of the richest \ncompanies in the whole world. We asked our Republican colleagues to \njoin us.\n  We are calling on BP to create a special accountability account--\noverseen by an independent trustee--to pay for the damages from their \nhistoric disaster and the cost of cleaning up their catastrophe. We are \nmaking these demands because we don't have a lot of reason to give BP \nthe benefit of the doubt. Shortly after the explosion, we learned of \nthe shortcuts that led to it. We saw it all over--including a very nice \npiece they did on ``60 Minutes.'' We also recently learned BP vastly \nunderstated the extent and rate of the spill. And in past disasters, we \nhave seen other oil companies spend millions on lawsuits and public \nrelations campaigns, all designed not to compensate the businesses and \nfamilies they hurt but to improve their profits.\n  Our message to BP is as simple as this: If you drill and you spill, \nwe are going to make sure you pay the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4870-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first, I would like to note a couple \nimportant anniversaries today. It was on this day in 1775 that the \nContinental Army was established and George Washington appointed to \nlead it. So June 14 has gone down in history not only as the beginning \nof America's defeat of the British Army but also as the birth of the \ngreatest Army the world has ever known. The largest and oldest branch \nof the U.S. military, the Army is older than the United States itself. \nIts first leader became our first President. It continues to make \nAmericans proud, and we are grateful on this day and every day for the \nmen and women of the U.S. Army.\n  Incidentally, 2 years to the day after the establishment of the Army, \nthe Second Continental Congress officially established the flag under \nwhich our military has fought ever since. The resolution in Congress \nsaid that 13 stripes would represent the 13 States, and that 13 stars \nwould represent the Union in the form of a new constellation. President \nWilson officially established this day as Flag Day in 1916. Ever since, \nAmericans everywhere have honored this great symbol of freedom every \nyear on Flag Day, June 14. We honor those who have fought for it, and \nwe are proud of all that the flag of the United States of America \nrepresents here and wherever it flies around the globe.\n  On another topic, the Obama administration announced new regulations \ntoday that will give Americans a better sense of how the health care \nbill will affect them. These new regulations outline the various ways \nin which existing health plans will be forced to change under the new \nlaw. According to the Obama administration report we saw on all this \ntoday, these regulations could result in nearly 7 out of 10 workers--\nand 80 percent of workers at small businesses--seeing changes in their \nplans. In other words, under the new health care bill, more than half \nof those who get insurance through their jobs may be forced to change \ntheir plans whether they want to or not.\n  This is not only bad news for the vast majority of Americans who like \nthe plans they have. It also flatly contradicts the President's \nrepeated promises to the contrary. A year ago this month, the President \nsaid the following on national television: ``. . . Government is not \ngoing to make you change plans under health reform''\n  The implication here was that businesses might change your plans, but \ngovernment won't. Today's regulations show that this isn't true. The \ngovernment is about to change the plans most Americans have. Here's one \nmore promise the administration has broken on health care and one more \nwarning Republicans issued on this bill that's been vindicated.\n  Now onto the business on the floor. Since Democrats continue to argue \namong themselves about the extenders bill, I will be asking consent at \nthe end of my remarks to pass a 30-day extension of the recently \nexpired provisions in the bill that will give doctors and those looking \nfor work the assurances they need to plan ahead. And rather than doing \nit in a way that simply adds to the deficit, this proposal would \nactually reduce the debt by $2.5 billion. Moreover, later today Senator \nThune will offer an amendment that would provide for a long-term \nextension of these programs, plus the tax provisions which expired at \nthe end of last year, without adding a dime to the deficit.\n  In fact, the Thune amendment would enable us to lower the deficit by \n$55 billion by enacting the kinds of spending cuts Americans are \ndemanding of lawmakers in Washington.\n  Many of these cuts have been proposed previously by Senator Coburn \nand received bipartisan support on the supplemental spending bill. We \nneed to show the American people we are making serious efforts to cut \nspending. The Thune amendment gives us an opportunity to do just that \ntoday. I hope our Democrat friends join us in that effort.\n  As I indicated and mentioned to the majority leader when we were in \nprivate discussion a while ago, I will now propound the consent \nagreement to which I referred in my remarks.\n\n\n                   unanimous-consent request--S. 3421\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 411, S. 3421; further, that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; before the chair rules, for clarity, this is a paid for \n30-day extension of the extenders bill, which includes unemployment \ninsurance, doc fix, COBRA, flood insurance, and the extension of the \nsmall business loan guarantee program and the 2009 Federal poverty \nguidelines.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding, through the Chair to my distinguished friend, the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, that this is paid for out of stimulus money?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe most of the pay-fors are. I \nwould say to my friend, having consulted with staff, it is some \nstimulus money but largely what we believe to be noncontroversial pay-\nfors.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a 30-day extension doesn't solve the \nproblems we have. A 30-day extension of unemployment, 30-day FMAP, 30-\nday doc fix, is just kicking them all down the road. We have to have a \nlegitimate program to extend these benefits into the future, and 30 \ndays does not do it. It just kicks the ball down the road.\n  I would also say, with money being taken from the recovery moneys--\nthis is one of the job-creating things we have left going on in this \ngovernment. It is a good program, it creates jobs.\n  I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to have a \nmore long-term fix of this difficult problem, and therefore I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge quick \nconfirmation of President Obama's nominee, Dr. Donald Berwick, to \nbecome the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, also known as CMS. He is highly qualified and capable. This \nis an extremely important position for which he has been nominated.\n  Unfortunately, according to recent press reports, it appears that \nsome who oppose the new health reform law are hoping to use Dr. \nBerwick's confirmation process as a forum to debate the merits of this \nnew health reform law which has now been enacted.\n  In my view, whether Senators favored or opposed the enactment of \nhealth care reform legislation, it is clearly in the interests of our \ncountry that we have a capable Administrator to implement the new law. \nOver the last year and a half, there has been an enormous focus in \nCongress on addressing the very serious problems facing our health care \nsystem. It is important the President's choice to head the CMS be \nconfirmed so that he can take up the enormous challenge and the \nenormous opportunity that is presented by the enactment of this new \nlegislation.\n  It is clear our Nation has urgent needs. This is not a time for the \nSenate to delay Dr. Berwick's nomination. I recently spent time with \nDr. Berwick at the annual Health Policy Conference headed by the \nCommonwealth Fund this last January. I was impressed both with the \ndepth of his understanding of the many issues facing the health care \nsystem as well as his passion for improving the quality of health care \nand his impressive successes in doing so.\n  Dr. Berwick has dedicated his career to finding ways to make our \nhealth care system work better for patients and cost less for \ntaxpayers. These are core missions he will take on as our next CMS \nAdministrator.\n  Don is the founder and CEO of the Institute for Health Care \nImprovement. He is a professor of health policy at the Harvard Medical \nSchool and the School of Public Health, and he is a practicing \nphysician at some of our Nation's top hospitals. He has held numerous \nleadership roles at the institutions that ensure quality care in \nAmerica, including service on the board of the American Hospital \nAssociation and as chair of the Advisory Council for the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality.\n  Don's vast experience with our health care system, his award-winning \ncareer as an expert in health care quality, make him the ideal \ncandidate to lead CMS at this critical time. The historic health reform \nlegislation that President Obama signed into law this year takes \nsignificant steps to strengthen Medicare, reduce waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the system, and makes critical improvements in the way care is \ndelivered. Implementing those changes in the smartest and most \neffective way is going to require an Administrator who has seen \nfirsthand what it takes to make meaningful improvements in health care \nquality and efficiency. It is also going to take an Administrator with \na passion to get the job done right.\n  Don Berwick has both. That is why he was chosen by President Obama to \nbe the next CMS Administrator. His nomination has won praise from \nacross the political and professional spectrum, including former CMS \nAdministrators who served Republican Presidents. For example, Thomas A. \nScully, who was CMS Administrator under President George W. Bush \nbetween 2001 and 2003, said:\n\n       Dr. Berwick is about as noncontroversial and well liked as \n     you can get. You are not going to do any better.\n\n  Mark McClellan, CMS Administrator under George W. Bush from 2004 to \n2006 said the following:\n\n       What happens at CMS over the next couple of years will \n     determine whether the new legislation actually improves \n     quality and lowers costs. Don has a unique background both in \n     improving quality care on the ground and thinking about how \n     our Nation's health care policies need to be reformed to help \n     make that happen.\n\n  Dr. Nancy H. Nielsen, M.D., immediate past president of the American \nMedical Association, said:\n\n       We welcome President Obama's nomination of Dr. Donald \n     Berwick to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid services. He is widely known and well respected for \n     his visionary leadership efforts that focus on optimizing the \n     quality and safety of patient care in hospitals and across \n     health care settings.\n\n  Dr. John Rather, the executive vice president of AARP, said:\n\n       Dr. Berwick's expertise on healthcare innovation and his \n     dedication to quality improvement and patient safety would \n     benefit the millions of low-income and older Americans served \n     by Medicare and Medicaid. His appointment is welcome news to \n     Medicare beneficiaries, as it signals that quality and safety \n     will be at the top of the agenda.\n\n  Finally, our former colleague, Dave Durenberger, a Republican from \nMinnesota, said:\n\n       President Obama let us know he means business on ``bending \n     the medical cost curve'' by nominating Dr. Don Berwick as \n     head of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services. . . \n     .This appointment will be taken as an indication that health \n     policy and health system reform is likely to be this \n     President's top priority in his first term. We all know that \n     Don Berwick has the ability to make both work.\n\n  There is broad consensus that the nomination of Dr. Berwick is an \nexcellent choice by President Obama. Our country needs Dr. Berwick's \nremarkable talents now, and every day his confirmation stalls or is \ndelayed is a missed opportunity to ensure his unparalleled leadership \nis directing our Nation's largest and most influential health care \nagency.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to swiftly approve \nhis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I might note to my colleague from New Mexico \nthat there is a different point of view about this particular nominee. \nI would venture to say that since his hearing has not been scheduled \nyet, it may be a while before we are able to take up that nomination. \nIn any event, there are many on our side of the aisle who have \nsignificant concerns about whether he should be put in charge of the \nCMS. But I appreciate the comments of my colleague, and I will turn to \na different subject at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4871-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4871-S4872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SPENDING\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, about the time I think Washington is \nbeginning to get the message that the American people are fed up with \nrunaway spending, my hopes are dashed by proposals to spend even more. \nI would like to refer to one here in just a moment.\n  First, there is no question that the American people are unhappy \nabout\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nthe spending binge and soaring debt that have occurred under this \nadministration and this Congress. In the last year and a half, there \nhas been trillions in new spending, program after program, bailout \nafter bailout. We are about to see another one.\n  Every time I return home to Arizona from Washington, my constituents \nremind me of their frustration with Washington's lack of restraint. \nThey know the reckless spending and borrowing cannot go on forever. \nThey are worried about how their kids and their grandkids will pay for \nall of President Obama's spending priorities and associated debt.\n  Now, $260 of new debt has been added to each household every week of \nthe Obama administration. Let me repeat. For every week of this \nadministration, every household has another $260 of debt. Our national \ndebt has now reached $13 trillion, much of which is held by countries \nsuch as China. More than $1 trillion has been added to the debt since \nthe majority adopted legislation they called pay-go. These are so-\ncalled budget controls which require Congress to pay for what it \nspends. But, unfortunately for the taxpayers, the emergency \ndesignations and other budget gimmicks have been a convenient way for \nthe majority to circumvent these pay-go rules.\n  Now the President is asking for some more money to spend for yet \nanother bailout. This time it is $23 billion for teachers' salaries and \na total of $50 billion to defray the cost of State employees' and local \nemployees' salaries. No guarantee that the funding would be used in the \ncase of the teachers necessarily to save jobs, or firefighters, the \nsame. And this comes just 16 months after Congress poured $100 billion \nfor education into the so-called stimulus legislation, including $48 \nbillion in direct aid to the States. As for total Federal education \nspending, it has doubled since the year 2000 to 15 percent of the \nFederal budget now--not an inconsequential amount.\n  Besides more spending and debt, I see the continuation of two \ntroubling patterns here. One is the refusal of this administration and \nthe majority in this Congress to encourage State and local governments \nto economize to live within their means, just as families and private \nsector businesses must do. The President's latest proposal for this $50 \nbillion in so-called emergency funding simply bails the States out, the \nState and local governments that have obligations to their employees.\n  With regard to education, the Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, says \nthe $23 billion for teachers is an emergency. But, as George Will \npointed out in a recent column, the private sector has lost 8.5 million \njobs during the recession or 7.4 percent of workers, while local \ngovernments have only lost 141,000 workers or less than 1 percent of \ntheir workers. Will writes, ``Now this supposed emergency, and states' \ndependency, may be becoming routine and perpetual.'' In other words, \nthe Federal Government just becomes the payor for the salaries of \npeople who work for State and local governments.\n  Spending $23 billion is not going to help unemployed private sector \nworkers find jobs; it may actually hurt them. And spending billions of \nstimulus dollars on State and local governments hasn't helped them to \nsolve their financial problems thus far. How will spending billions \nremedy their underlying budget problems? It is just a temporary \nreprieve. But if they don't do anything to address the underlying cause \nof the problem, we will not have helped them at all.\n  Education spending has not been neglected during the recession, and \nat some point local governments have to figure out a way to make do \nwith what they have. The debt and out-of-control spending are the real \nemergencies we should be dealing with.\n  The second pattern I would like to note is the administration's habit \nof supporting legislation that designates winners and losers, \nespecially when it comes to labor unions. They were the beneficiaries \nof $85 billion in bailouts to the car companies and special tax \ntreatment of the President's health spending law. Teachers unions are \nthe winners if the President convinces Congress to spend another $23 \nbillion on teacher salaries. This is not the kind of change Americans \nhad in mind when President Obama took office; that is, political allies \ngetting special status and treatment.\n  President Obama pays lipservice to fiscal responsibility but does so \nas long as his own priorities do not have to be put on hold; otherwise, \nhe would not talk in the same breath about fiscal restraint on the one \nhand and another $50 billion in Federal taxpayer money or borrowing \nfrom other countries in order to pay teachers' salaries, firefighters' \nsalaries, and the like. At some point, I believe the President will \nhave to match his rhetoric with action; otherwise, the United States \nwill not be able to avoid unprecedented budgetary and economic crises. \nIs this really the legacy this administration and this Congress want to \nleave behind? I think not.\n  I think when I go home this week and I visit with constituents of \nmine, including another tea party group, I am going to hear an earful \nabout how they thought Washington was beginning to get the message that \nwe were not supposed to spend so much money we did not have; that they \nare tired of us going to borrow money from other countries such as \nChina and putting it on the credit card for our kids and our grandkids \nto pay. I think I am going to have to tell them: Well, I thought folks \nwere beginning to get the message, but now, with the President's new \nrequest, it appears we are going to have to deal with the problem \nagain.\n  I hope that when the President's proposed legislation comes to the \nCongress, we are able to say to him: No, not this time, just as we are \nwith the legislation that is on the floor of the Senate this week, the \nso-called emergency that continues certain tax policies in force, \nextends certain benefits such as unemployment insurance, but does a lot \nof other things that are not paid for, that are not offset by cuts in \nother spending.\n  I don't think we can continue to just keep piling on more and more \nspending without finding a way to offset it with savings elsewhere. It \nis not as if those savings can't be found, but we will never get there \nif we decide to take on the obligations of State and local governments \nto pay for all of the governmental workers who are on their payrolls. \nWe have to start looking at the private sector and how to encourage the \nprivate sector to begin to put more of their folks back to work instead \nof taking money out of the private sector in order to keep these \ngovernment workers employed.\n  I hope my colleagues will take the message I have heard loudly and \nclearly from home to heart and begin to apply some fiscal discipline to \nthe spending policies this administration is proposing and will for \nonce say: No, we can't afford this, and so we are not going to spend \nthe money.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in morning business for such time as I consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4872-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4872-S4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CAP-AND-TRADE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to speak on where I think \nthis climate change debate is headed after last Thursday's vote on the \nMurkowski resolution. We got a very clear signal in today's Politico, \nwhich reported that President Obama, in his Oval Office address \ntomorrow night, will seek, as a part of the response to the BP \noilspill, to ``put a price on carbon.''\n  Let's keep in mind what ``a price on carbon'' is. That is a tax, a \ncarbon tax, or what we call cap and trade. Quite often people have \nsaid: Well, if those individuals really want to charge for carbon, want \nto stop this economy, why don't they just put a carbon tax on it? The \nreason they do not is then people would know how much it is costing \nthem. As it is now, with cap and trade, they would not.\n  But again, he is going to have an Oval Office address. I think this \nwill be\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\nthe first talk he will give from the Oval Office since he has been \nPresident. Of course, that is Washington-speak for cap and trade--a \nprice on carbon.\n  This is remarkable. Here we have the most significant environmental \ndisaster in our Nation's history, and the President decides now is the \ntime for cap and trade--a massive new energy tax paid for by consumers, \nworking families, farmers, and small businesses; a massive new energy \ntax that will destroy millions of jobs, in good measure by sending many \nof them to places such as China and India; a massive new energy tax \nthat will make a gallon of gas more expensive; and a massive new energy \ntax that will not do anything to stop global warming but will increase \nthe size of government and give more money to politicians to spend. \nJust how that will contain the oilspill, mitigate the environmental \ndamage, or help those immediately affected by it remains a mystery. Put \nsimply, it will not do any of those things, but it will damage the \neconomy and make it harder to deal with this crisis.\n  We have a serious incident on our hands. People died, people's \neconomic livelihoods are at stake, and the environment is being harmed. \nBut instead of Presidential leadership and clear direction, we are \ngetting pure partisan politics. One glaring example is President \nObama's moratorium on deepwater drilling--something environmental \ngroups have been seeking for many years. This is an exercise in \noverreaching that will do far more harm than good. The Louisiana \nDepartment of Economic Development estimates that the President's \nmoratorium would kill 3,000 to 6,000 jobs in the next few weeks and \nover 10,000 Louisiana jobs in the next few months. More than 20,000 \njobs are at risk in the next 12 months. That is one example of just \npure politics.\n  Today, in a letter to supporters--we just got this, Mr. President; \nyou may not be aware of this--this is a letter that went out today to \nObama supporters all across the Nation, and it says: We are going to \nhave a big meeting at the White House, and we are going to talk about \nmoving forward on legislation to promote a new economy powered by green \njobs, combating climate change, and ending our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Down further in the letter, he says that the House of Representatives \nhas already passed comprehensive energy legislation. Let's remember \nwhat that was. That was the Waxman-Markey bill. That was a cap-and-\ntrade bill--one that was very expensive. He says there is currently a \nplan in the Senate to do the same thing. That is the Kerry-Lieberman \nbill he is talking about and we are going to talk about.\n  So the whole idea of this meeting--and I understand the speech that \nis going to take place tomorrow night is to try to promote an agenda, a \nvery liberal agenda, an agenda that has been rejected. Cap and trade \nhas been rejected by this legislative body since the Kyoto Treaty. That \nwas way back in the late 1990s. Then, of course, the 2003 and 2005 \nbills by McCain and Lieberman that have been cap-and-trade bills were \nrejected and every one of them since then, including the Warner-\nLieberman bill and the other bills we have had. The interesting thing \nis, every time a cap-and-trade bill comes up here, it is defeated by a \nlarger margin. That is why I have been saying cap and trade is \nsomething that is dead in the Senate.\n  Instead of Presidential leadership, we are getting rhetoric of the \nworst kind. A case in point came last week. We heard that the Murkowski \nresolution is a ``big oil bailout'' that will allow oil companies such \nas BP to pollute the air. That must be news to thousands of groups \nacross the country because they certainly were very much in support of \nher resolution. I am talking about people such as the American \nAssociation of Housing Services for the Aging, Family Dairies USA, the \nFarm Bureau, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Brick \nIndustry Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nAssociated Builders and Contractors--the list goes on and on of the \npeople who realize they do not want to have this massive government \ntakeover.\n  Let's keep in mind that when you talk about cap-and-trade legislation \nand then you talk about what the EPA is talking about doing under the \nClean Air Act, it is essentially the same thing. It is just that since \nthey could not get it passed legislatively, they are going to try to do \nit administratively. That is what the whole Murkowski resolution was \nabout. It was about stopping that from taking place. Incidentally, it \ngot 47 votes, and I am going to talk about those votes in a minute.\n  Well, do some Members really believe these groups have been duped, \nthat what they are really supporting is nothing more than a sop to BP \nand big oil? This is simply insulting to the citizens across the \ncountry who supported the Murkowski resolution for one simple reason: \nIt will stop the greatest bureaucratic intrusion into the lives of the \nAmerican people in history.\n  I am confident we will keep hearing this refrain as we get closer to \nNovember. The story in today's Politico--and this is interesting; it \njust came out today--talks about a survey by a guy named Joe Benenson. \nHe is President Obama's campaign pollster. He is an Obama guy. They are \ndoing it for a very liberal group. Among other things, Mr. Benenson \nfound that, based on his interpretation of the survey results, pushing \nfor cap and trade and tying opposition to it to big oil is a ``potent \npolitical weapon'' for Democrats against Republicans this fall. Purely \npolitical. No one can argue that.\n  Well, it is my view that we should be capping that well and not the \neconomy, but apparently the President sees it differently. I suppose \nsome of this was driven by last week's 47-to-53 vote on overturning the \nEPA's endangerment finding. The motion to proceed to the Murkowski \nresolution failed, but the President should not let those numbers \nobscure the hard political reality: there is a bipartisan majority in \nthe Senate that supports either a delay of or an outright ban on the \nObama EPA's job-killing global warming agenda.\n\n       By preventing a debate on the Murkowski resolution, the \n     Democrat-led Senate voted last week to expand the reach of \n     government into our daily lives. But the reason this \n     bureaucratic intrusion will continue is that a deal was cut \n     just prior to the vote.\n\n  Now, listen to this. It was exposed in a front-page story in the Hill \nthe day of the vote. I am going to read from that story, the Hill \nstory:\n\n       Democratic leaders are scrambling to prevent the Senate \n     from delivering a stinging slap to President Barack Obama on \n     climate change. They have offered a vote on a bill they \n     dislike in the hopes of avoiding a loss on legislation Obama \n     hates. The president is threatening to veto a resolution from \n     Sen. Lisa Murkowski that would ban the Environmental \n     Protection Agency from regulating carbon emissions. But if \n     the president were forced to use his veto to prevent \n     legislation emerging from a Congress in which his own party \n     enjoys substantial majorities, it would be a humiliation for \n     him and for Democrats on Capitol Hill. So Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders are doing what \n     they can to stop it. They are floating the possibility of \n     voting on an alternative measure from Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a \n     Democrat from the coal state of West Virginia, which they \n     previously refused to grant floor time. . . .\n\n  This is all quoted from the article.\n  It appears at least seven Democrats took the deal offered to them. \nWhat is the deal? The deal is: I know you guys want to vote for the \nMurkowski resolution. All your people back home want you to vote for \nit. It is a very popular resolution to stop this overwhelming takeover. \nYet, in order to keep them from getting to 51 votes, you are going to \nhave to vote against it.\n  These are seven Democrats. At the same time, those same seven \nDemocrats could use the Rockefeller amendment for cover. The \nRockefeller amendment is the same as the Murkowski resolution, except \nit just delays it 2 years. Frankly, it accomplishes the same thing. I \nam for either one of them. Either one would be good. The problem with \nthat is the Rockefeller bill would take 60 votes. So it is saying we \nknow they can get the 51 votes, but if you seven won't vote for \nMurkowski, we will let you go ahead and vote for the Rockefeller thing \nand they won't get it anyway because it would take 60 votes.\n\n  I know it is heavy lifting. It is complicated, but that is what is \ngoing on around here. In other words, for the Democrats to ensure that \nthe EPA can micromanage farms and other institutions in America, they \nhave to develop a scheme to give cover to Democratic Members who should \noppose the EPA takeover. I wish to emphasize that I\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nbelieve these Members are conflicted about what to do. I think they \nunderstand the economic harm and what an unfettered EPA bureaucracy \ncould mean for their constituents--fewer jobs, more regulations, higher \ntaxes, and a slower economy--but they were pressured by the President \nand the base of the Democratic Party. They were warned against defying \nthe President on one of his top initiatives, so they turned to the \nRockefeller bill as an alternative, which is a 2-year delay for \nimplementation of this bill; in other words, not allowing the EPA to \nmicromanage our lives at least for 2 more years, giving us a little \nbreathing time. But it is not the end of the road.\n  As I see it, the Rockefeller bill should not be used as political \ncover. It is merely an alternative means of achieving a similar goal \nsought by Senator Murkowski to stop the EPA from deciding our Nation's \nenergy policy. We ought to get a vote on Rockefeller one way or \nanother, and if it happens, I trust these seven Members--and possibly \nothers who voted no on Murkowski--will vote with their constituents for \nthe Rockefeller bill and against EPA taking jobs, businesses, and \nenergy out of our struggling economy.\n  Let me be blunt. EPA's growing regulatory regime will lead to one of \nthe greatest bureaucratic intrusions into the lives of the American \npeople. Peter Glaser, an attorney with Troutman Sanders and one of the \nforemost Clean Air Act attorneys--the Clean Air Act passed many decades \nago--said that the EPA's endangerment finding will lead to Federal \nregulation of schools, hospitals, nursing homes, commercial buildings, \nchurches, restaurants, homes, hotels, malls, colleges and universities, \nfood processing facilities, farms, sports arenas--all of these things. \nThat is virtually everybody--and it would be a very expensive \nproposition.\n  If you look at what happened throughout the history of this \nendangerment finding, the debate over the Murkowski resolution began \neven before the resolution was introduced in January. It began with the \ncreation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC. \nThat was at the United Nations back in 1989. That led to the Kyoto \nProtocol, and we voted on the intent of the Kyoto Protocol right in \nthis Chamber 95 to nothing. The question was this: We will reject any \ntreaty that comes from the Clinton-Gore White House to us if it either \nhurts our economy or doesn't treat the developing nations the same as \nthe developed nations. Of course, that is exactly what we did. That was \n95 to 0.\n  Then, later on, as I mentioned, we had all of these different bills, \nincluding the Lieberman-Warner bill, the McCain-Warner bill, and all of \nthese were cap-and-trade bills and they all died. All of this led to \nthe EPA's endangerment finding. What that said was--and this is the \nPresident: In the event that the House and the Senate refuse to vote in \nfavor of some kind of a cap-and-trade bill, as has been mentioned, then \nwe will go ahead and do it under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act \nwas set up to attack real pollutants such as SOX, \nNOX, and mercury. So they were saying we will go ahead and \ndo it with this regulation.\n  Make no mistake. Despite testimony to the contrary by senior \nofficials, the Obama administration was not forced by the Supreme Court \nto choose endangerment. As I noted, they had a choice. They made the \nwrong choice. They could have either voted not to consider \nCO2 as endangering to health or they could do it or ignore \nit altogether. They decided to do it, and it didn't surprise me a bit.\n  So the IPCC put together this thing and we now--I can remember so \nwell when we had Lisa Jackson, who is the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, before our committee. We talked about \nthe fact that I thought--this is before the endangerment finding. I \nsaid: Administrator Jackson, I think you are going to have an \nendangerment finding, and when you do, you have to base that on \nscience. What science are you going to base it on? The answer was: The \nIPCC or the United Nations.\n  We know what has happened to the credibility of that science since \nthat time. It has been totally debunked.\n  The other defense people use in trying to justify voting against the \nresolution as expressed by a few Democrats was that overturning \nendangerment would mean removing the authority from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration--that is the NHTSA--to set \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy standards, CAFE standards. More \nspecifically, some argue it would undo the historic auto deal reached \nlast May by the two auto companies, the White House, and the EPA, DOT, \nand California. The only problem with this argument is that it is \nwrong. Ask the Obama administration. According to a February 19 letter \nby Kevin Vincent--that is the NHTSA's general counsel:\n\n       As a strictly legal matter, the Murkowski resolution does \n     not directly impact NHTSA's statutory authority to set fuel \n     economy standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation \n     Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act \n     of 2007.\n\n  So we are hearing that this resolution will revoke the new CAFE \nstandards and increase the amount of oil we consume. It is patently \nfalse to assert that NHTSA said they can't continue to work on, and \nthen implement, as they are doing today, the CAFE standards. So that \nargument is a phony argument.\n  Cap and trade. During the debate last week, I spoke briefly about the \ncollapse of the science behind manmade global warming. I said the vote \nlast week was not based on the science but, rather, on stopping a \nliberal job-killing agenda. It is interesting because there are several \npeople--all of the Republicans supported the Murkowski resolution. Yet \nthere are some Republicans who actually believe that anthropogenic gas \nis a major cause of global warming. I am not one of those. I am at the \nother extreme. But there are some here who don't agree. So that wasn't \nwhat the vote was about. It was about whether they should take over \ncontrol of our lives as they are talking about doing. There is no doubt \nthat there is a wide spectrum of beliefs about the science in the \nRepublican Party, but I am pleased that last week we stood united for \nprotecting American jobs. That is all 41 Republicans. That is very \nrare. They always say Democrats are much more disciplined than \nRepublicans are. That is where the phrase ``herding cats'' came from. \nThat is why you try to get Republicans all together. It is a very \nunusual thing, but we were. We were all together last week.\n  The Clean Air Act is a monumental mistake that will shackle the \nAmerican economy with job-killing regulations and higher energy taxes.\n  Let me now take a little time to discuss both the current state of \ncap and trade in the Senate and the latest science behind global \nwarming. First, let me state the obvious. Despite the best efforts by \nmany in the more extreme liberal wing of the Democratic Party, global \nwarming cap-and-trade legislation is dead. It is dead. I stated that 2 \nmonths ago, and there is no way they are going to be able to bring it \nback. We will have to wait and see. In fact, just the term ``cap and \ntrade'' is so toxic these days in the Senate, my Democratic colleagues \nrefuse to even use the term anymore. They don't use ``cap and trade.'' \nLast week Majority Leader Harry Reid said:\n\n       We don't use the words ``cap and trade'' . . . That's \n     something that's been deleted from my dictionary.\n\n  Further, RollCall reported last week that Democrats in the House had \na similar response to cap and trade. RollCall reported:\n\n       Both Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny \n     Hoyer bristled at a question about Senate Minority Leader \n     Mitch McConnell's declaration that the House's cap-and-trade \n     energy proposal is dead. The House passed a bill that \n     includes the proposal last year, but the issue has stalled \n     in the Senate. ``That's not the bill they have in the \n     Senate,'' Pelosi told reporters. ``They don't have a cap-\n     and-trade bill. That's not the bill they have in the \n     Senate.''\n\n  That is the bill we have in the Senate. It is cap and trade. All of \nthose are cap and trade. The current bill, the Kerry-Lieberman bill, is \ncap and trade. They may change the name of it, but it is still cap and \ntrade. They cap emissions and then they start trading around and the \ngovernment picks winners and losers and tries to convince everyone that \nhe will be the winner.\n  It wasn't long ago that the author of the cap-and-trade bill in the \nSenate tried to suggest that his bill wasn't cap and trade either. He \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\n\n       I don't know what ``cap and trade'' means. I don't think \n     the average American does. This is not a cap-and-trade bill, \n     it's a pollution reduction bill.\n\n  It is a cap-and-trade bill.\n  In fact, when Senators Kerry and Lieberman finally introduced their \nbill, we soon learned that it was worse than cap and trade because it \nwas cap and trade, but it also included a gas tax increase.\n  No matter the word games employed or the extent to which the \nDemocrats wish to hide the truth from the American people, cap and \ntrade will mean more job losses, more pain at the pump, and higher food \nand electricity prices for consumers. Despite the postmodern denial of \n``the truth'' in which words can mean whatever one chooses, the next \nversion of ``putting a price on carbon'' will be cap and trade, pure \nand simple. And if the House Waxman-Markey bill is any guide, it will \nshowcase massive expansion of government mandates, spending, taxes, and \nenergy rationing for America.\n  Now let me turn to cover the flaws of the science on which the EPA's \nendangerment is based. Lisa Jackson is President Obama's EPA \nAdministrator. She admitted publicly that the EPA's finding of \nendangerment is in good measure a conclusion of the UN's IPCC. She told \nme in a public forum live on TV that EPA accepted those findings \nwithout any serious independent analysis to see whether they were true.\n  After climategate and the admission of errors by IPCC, we now know \nthat the process was flawed all along. In a Senate report I released \nearlier this year on climategate, the report found that some of the \nworld's leading climate scientists engaged in unethical behavior and \npossibly violated Federal laws. Many of those scientists appeared to \nhave manipulated the data--this is what came out of the report--\nmanipulated the data to fit preconceived conclusions. In other words, \nIPCC says, What do we have to show to come to the conclusion we have \nalready come to 7, 8 years ago that anthropogenic gases are causing \nglobal warming. They obstructed Freedom of Information requests and \ndissemination of climate data--and by the way, they did show that was \ntrue in Great Britain, but the problem is the statute of limitations \nhad already run and the IPCC had colluded to pressure journal editors \nagainst publishing scientific work contrary to their own.\n  The U.K. Government has already found that scientists from the \nClimate Research Unit, or CRU, who are at the center of this scandal, \nviolated its Freedom of Information Act.\n  Importantly, the Senate report shows many of the scientists involved \nin this scandal worked for the UN's IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change. They helped compile the IPCC's 2O07 Fourth \nAssessment Report. That is important because that report is a primary \nbasis for the EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gases. The \nmedia has uncovered several errors and mistakes in the report which \nundermine the credibility of the IPCC's science.\n  The things I am going to list right here were found both in Al Gore's \nmovie as well as the IPCC report. They are all in this thing together. \nThey said it would melt the Himalayan glaciers by 2035. That is just \nflat not true. They admit that is not true. They said it would destroy \n40 percent of the Amazon's rain forest. That is not true. They said it \nwould melt the ice in the Andes, the Alps, and in Africa. That is not \ntrue. They said it would drastically increase the cost of climate-\nrelated natural disasters. That is not true. It would drive 20 to 30 \npercent of the species to extinction. That is not true. It would slash \ncrop production by 50 percent in Africa by 2020. All of these things \nhave been fabricated and since proven not to be true. Yet that is the \nscience on which the endangerment finding has been based. Oh, yes. The \nIPCC said the Netherlands is 50 percent below sea level. That is not \ntrue, either, as we well know. There is even more, but I think we have \nmade our point here.\n  The fact is that the EPA accepted the IPCC's erroneous claims \nwholesale without doing its own independent review. So EPA's \nendangerment finding rests on bad science. The EPA minority report \nprovides further proof that EPA needs to scrap the endangerment finding \nand start all over again. By the way, anyone interested in this can \nlook at my Web site where we cover all the details and all the \ndocumentation on everything I have been saying.\n  The Obama administration, however, is pressing ahead. We have been \ntold that the science still stands. We have been told that IPCC's \nmistakes are trivial. We have been told that climategate was just \ngossipy e-mails between scientists. Yet global warming alarmism has \nbeen sold on the very notion that manmade greenhouse gases are causing \nenvironmental catastrophes, such as the Himalayan glaciers melting and \nall that stuff. So the science is certainly not so.\n  Further, the challenges to the integrity and credibility of the IPCC \nmerit closer examination by the Congress. The ramifications of the IPCC \nspread far and wide, most notably to the endangerment finding.\n  The EPA's finding rests on the IPCC's conclusions, and the EPA has \naccepted them wholesale, without independent assessment.\n  Remember how the Telegraph of London referred to all this? That is \none of their largest publications, the London Telegraph. They said \nclimategate and the IPCC's errors amount to ``the greatest scientific \nscandal of our time.'' That is a publication that was very favorable to \nthe IPCC before climategate came along. Climategate--even though it \nhappened this last December, if anybody wants to document how far back \nthis was first discovered, I made a speech at this podium on the Senate \nfloor 4 or 5 years ago that documented all these scientists coming in \nand saying how they were rejected from the process of the IPCC because \nthey would not verify their conclusions.\n  At this pivotal time, as the Obama EPA is preparing to enact policies \npotentially costing trillions of dollars and thousands of jobs, IPCC's \nerrors make plain that we need openness, transparency, and \naccountability in the scientific research financed by U.S. taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude with this: As the most conservative \nMember of the Senate, as ranked by the National Journal, I have spent \nthe past 2 years speaking out against the unprecedented liberal agenda \ncoming out of Washington. I have stood up and spoken out about massive \nout-of-control spending in Washington, increased government \nintervention into our daily lives, the gutting of our national defense, \nand of the costly global warming agenda.\n  In the midst of these challenges, we also face an unprecedented \nenvironmental catastrophe in the gulf. Today, as the American people \ncontinue to face high unemployment and a struggling economy, we must \nremain focused on finding every opportunity to stand on the side of the \nAmerican worker and create opportunities.\n  In the gulf, we all have to work together and stay focused on \nmitigating and containing the environmental impacts and providing \nassistance to the gulf's affected commercial and recreational \nindustries and investigating the causes so we can prevent a disaster of \nthis kind from happening again. Staying focused will help us make \nprudent decisions.\n  The bottom line is, for the sake of our Nation, we must be willing to \nput aside the costly liberal agenda of the left and not allow them to \nuse the gulf tragedy to advance their cap-and-trade energy tax, which \nis completely unrelated to stopping the spill and helping the people in \nthe gulf. There is no relationship between cap and trade and the gulf \ndisaster. There is no relationship between what the EPA endangerment \nfinding would allow one bureaucrat to do and the gulf tragedy. By their \nown admission--to say they can parlay this into their own agenda is \nsomething we cannot let happen.\n  Twenty years ago, a very similar thing happened with the Exxon \nValdez. It was tragic, and I went up there. The environmental \nextremists were up there celebrating and saying: We are going to parlay \nthis into retarding the exploration and production on the North Slope. \nI made the statement there--it is all in writing--how can you figure \nthis out? How can you stop oil production domestically in Alaska by \nusing this issue?\n  Well, the issue was a transportation issue. It wasn't an oilspill or \na production accident. It was a transportation accident.\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\n  I said: If you stop our production, we are going to be more dependent \nupon other countries for our ability to run this machine called \nAmerica. They are going to have more transportation and a greater \npossibility of transportation accidents. That is what we are faced with \nnow.\n  Clearly, I appreciate the two statements that were made by President \nObama's old director of the EPA that the endangerment finding is based \non the science that we now know is false science. By the way, even \nthough it is not the end of the world that the Murkowski resolution \nfailed, four key lawsuits are filed challenging the law on which they \nare basing this endangerment finding.\n  Even if we were to pass any of the cap-and-trade bills, it would not \nreduce worldwide emissions any. It would only affect the United States. \nI argue it would increase CO2 emissions because as we lose \njobs in the United States with cap and trade and force a lot of our \nmanufacturers to other countries--they would go to countries such as \nChina, India, and Mexico where they don't even have strong emissions \nstandards.\n  With that, let's not politicize this any more. If they want to bring \nup cap and trade, let's do it, and we can defeat it like we have done \nover the past 10 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there doesn't seem to be anybody else \nhere, so I will make one comment about amendments coming up that are \nclosely related to the subject we just discussed. It is Sanders \namendment No. 4318. I knew this would happen--that the bill would be \nused to pass another agenda. Sure enough, that is what is happening.\n  The Sanders amendment is aimed at stopping oil production altogether. \nIt does three things: It repeals expensing for tangible drilling costs, \nit repeals percentage depletion for marginal oil and gas wells, and it \nrepeals the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas production.\n  I predicted the spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be used as an \nopportunity to shut down domestic oil and gas wells owned and operated \nby independent oil and gas producers throughout the country. That is \nwhat is happening with this amendment.\n  Repealing expensing of intangible drilling costs eliminates the \nability to expense intangible drilling and development costs, called \nIDC, which would force at least a 25- to 30-percent reduction in \ndrilling budgets, leading to lost jobs, lost production, and higher \nprices for consumers. We have not talked much about higher prices to \nthe consumers.\n  With cap and trade--if they were successful in that--we would feel \nthat in a matter of weeks. Despite the rhetoric, IDC expensing is \nfirmly grounded in sound accounting practices and principles, and it \nhas been in the Tax Code since 1913. IDC expensing is similar to \nexpensing by other companies for technology, wages, and fuels which \nother industries expense for operations. So they are singling out the \noil and gas industry, just willfully, to stop them and put them out of \nbusiness.\n  Likewise, since 1926, small producers and millions of royalty owners \nhave had the option to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify \nand account for the decline in the value of minerals produced from a \nproperty. It is complicated, but percentage depletion recognizes that \noil and gas reservoirs are depleted by production, so it is the amount \nwhich small producers can expense to reinvest in production. Percentage \ndepletion is particularly important for the production of America's \nover 600,000 low-volume marginal wells.\n  I am particularly interested in this because in my State of Oklahoma \nwe have mostly marginal well production. Marginal wells produce less \nthan 15 barrels a day. It is a smaller type of production. The average \nmarginal well produces barely two barrels a day--we have been talking \nabout millions of barrels in the gulf--yet, cumulatively, they account \nfor nearly 28 percent of domestic production in the lower 48 States.\n  Since every on-shore natural gas and oil well eventually declines \ninto marginal production, the economic lifespan and corresponding \nproduction of nearly all natural gas and oil wells would be reduced \nthrough the elimination of percentage depletion.\n  Finally, Congress has already frozen the manufacturers' tax deduction \nspecifically for only oil and natural gas companies less than 2 years \nago. All other domestic manufacturing can deduct income at a higher \nrate than oil and gas companies. Repealing the entire reduction for oil \nand gas companies is only targeting oil and gas production, and it \nshows what the motivation is.\n\n  We have to remember a couple of very important points when we seek to \ntarget certain industries for tax treatment. First, oil and gas \ncompanies employ Americans and fund our communities. Oil and gas \ncompanies employ over 9 million people in the United States. \nApproximately 3 million land and mineral owners from coast to coast are \nthe beneficiaries of monthly checks from the royalties produced on \ntheir properties. Many of these individuals are small property owners--\nvery small--and some are just small family farms. In fact, just today \nthe National Association of Royalty Owners ranked this as its No. 1 \nconcern on its Web site. That was today.\n  They say the Sanders amendment is their No. 1 target. These are not \nrich people. They are small farm owners and landowners. States annually \ncollect billions of dollars in oil and gas excise and severance taxes \nthat furnish critical funding for roads, schools, and law enforcement. \nBy punishing America's oil and gas industry, this amendment only puts \nunemployment and State and local funding in peril.\n  Secondly, punishing our oil and gas industry only makes us more \ndependent on foreign sources of energy. After President Jimmy Carter \nimposed a windfall profit tax on the oil and gas industry in 1980, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service later determined that its \nresults were hugely counterproductive, saying:\n\n       The windfall profit tax reduced domestic oil production \n     between 3 and 6 percent, and increased oil imports from \n     between 8 and 16 percent. . . . This made the U.S. more \n     dependent upon imported oil.\n\n  America's natural gas and oil companies are already paying taxes at \nthe highest rates. Figures from the Energy Information Agency indicate \nthat America's major oil producers already pay, on average, more than a \n40-percent income tax rate.\n  The EIA also reported in December of 2009 that, on average, 53 \npercent of the net incomes of oil and gas companies are paid in taxes \ncompared to 32 percent from others in the manufacturing sector.\n  Now is not the time to group the entire oil and gas industry together \nfor punishment. Punishing the entire industry in the sledge hammer \napproach this amendment uses only increases the cost of energy for all \nAmericans, and it makes us more dependent upon foreign countries to run \nthis machine called America, as I often say.\n  People say they don't want oil, gas, coal, or nuclear. Well, in the \nfinal analysis, how do you run the country without it? You can't. If we \nretard in any way the ability to produce oil and gas, it will make us \nmore dependent upon foreign countries for us to drive this machine \ncalled America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will talk briefly on this amendment. It is \nan important amendment. Last year, in November, we passed the Worker, \nHome Ownership and Business Assistance Act containing a number of \nimportant provisions to support our economy.\n  First of all, let me say the idea for this came from the Senator from \nGeorgia, John Isakson.\n  It is a great idea. He was a businessman before he came here. This \ncertainly indicates he must have been a good businessman. This credit \nhas been so helpful to our economy, not only in Nevada but around the \ncountry.\n  As part of this bill we passed in November, we expanded and extended \nthe home buyer tax credit. We made the credit available to more \nindividuals and families who purchase a home.\n  We also extended the credit through April 30 of this year and allowed \nanybody who signed a binding contract on a home and makes the purchase \nbefore July 1 to benefit from that credit.\n  When this provision became law last November, the housing market was \njust beginning to recover. But further support was necessary given the \nimportance of the housing industry to the overall economy.\n  Now we are beginning to see more signs of recovery. Sales have \nincreased since January. Median home prices have increased since \nNovember. Still, in States such as Nevada, the housing market is \nstruggling. Across the State a significant percent of mortgages are \nunderwater. That means the amount owed on the mortgage is greater than \nthe value of the home.\n  The home buyer tax credit is helping to alleviate some of that \npressure. Economists estimate that the home buyer tax credit increased \ndemand by about 1 million buyers.\n  The stories I have been told about people being able to buy their \nfirst home are remarkable. Someone who worked for me had a girlfriend \nwho wanted to buy a home. She was finally able to do that. She was so \nhappy. She tried eight different times before she got one for which she \nqualified.\n  I was doing a tour of one of the hotels, the cafeteria in the Paris \nHotel. It is actually two large rooms where they eat coming off their \nshifts. I was asked by one of the executives taking me around to come \nand talk to this man. He was so happy. He had come to this country. He \nwas an immigrant. He had become a citizen. He was so excited because \nhis son was able to buy a home because of this first-time home buyer \ntax credit. You could not have seen anyone happier than this man. He \nwas proud of his son being able to buy a home.\n  This tax credit helps to increase the value of homes and, just as \nimportant, it adds jobs to the housing industry. This shows the credit \nis doing what it was designed to do--help stimulate the housing market \nin a tough economic climate.\n  There are some home buyers who entered into a binding sales contract \nby April 30 of this year expecting to receive a credit but will be \nunable to close by July 1, 2010, through no fault of theirs. There is a \nhuge backlog of people wanting to buy these homes. They should not be \nprevented from doing this because of the paperwork.\n  These home buyers are doing everything they can to close by the \ndeadline, but completion of the sale will take longer than some \noriginally expected. One reason is because of the volume of work. The \nother reason is because some of the financial institutions are very \nslow, for administrative reasons, especially on sales of bank-owned \nproperties where paperwork can take an inordinate amount of time.\n  An extension of the date to close the transaction from July 1 of this \nyear to October 1 of this year will give these home buyers who properly \nsecured a binding contract for their new home before April 30 the \nability to receive the credit. This will especially help States still \nstruggling to recover from the troubled housing market. These States \nhave higher levels of bank-owned properties.\n  To remind my colleagues, this extension only applies to those home \nbuyers who are already under a binding contract. This amendment is not \nan extension of the time to enter into a contract.\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\n  To quote my friend, the Senator from Georgia, whose idea this is, \nthis whole concept:\n\n       As I tell so many who call me, it is not going to be \n     extended because credits such as that are designed to do what \n     it has done; that is, to bring the marketplace back and \n     hopefully stabilize values and move forward.\n\n  We must make sure those home buyers who are already under a binding \ncontract or committed to the purchase of a new home are able to receive \nthe home buyer tax credit. This amendment is necessary to ensure we \nfollow through on the commitment to help the struggling housing market. \nThis extension of time is fully paid for with an offset included in the \nPresident's tax compliance proposals. The offset would deny a tax \ndeduction for payments made for punitive damages.\n  Punitive damages are intended to be just that--punitive. The American \ntaxpayers should not be subsidizing payments intended to be punitive in \nnature through a tax deduction. These exemplary damages entered should \nnot be something they can write off. This offset is good policy and \nwill help pay for our Nation's ongoing economic recovery. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my friend to yield?\n  Mr. THUNE. I will be happy to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. REID. He will have the floor right back. I told the Republican \nleader earlier today I would file cloture. I am going to do that right \nnow, recognizing this is not in any way going to hinder people offering \namendments, but I told the Republican leader I would do that and, \nfrankly, I want to do it now so I will not have to worry about it \nlater.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I express my appreciation to my friend from South Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4333 to Amendment No. 4301\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask to call up amendment No. 4333, and \nask it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bond, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Isakson, and \n     Mr. Roberts, proposes an amendment numbered 4333 to amendment \n     No. 4301.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of June 9, 2010, \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the amendment I offer is cosponsored by \nSenators McCain, McConnell, Bond, Coburn, Isakson, and Roberts. It is \nan alternative to the legislation that is under consideration by the \nSenate today. That is the tax extenders bill that was the subject of \nsome debate last week, that we will continue to do this week, perhaps \ninto next week. I am not sure exactly when it will conclude.\n  What my amendment does is present an alternative because the \namendment under consideration that has been offered up by the \nDemocratic majority here in the Senate adds almost $80 billion to the \nFederal debt, it raises taxes by $70 billion, and increases spending by \n$126 billion.\n  To put that into proper context, it is important to remember that we \nhave a current $13 trillion debt. The amount of publicly held debt is \n$8.6 trillion, but if you include the amount of debt owed between \nintergovernmental agencies, intergovernmental debt is $13 trillion that \nour government owes and is in debt.\n  What has been proposed by the other side is in direct contradiction \nof some legislation that we passed here a few months ago that suggested \neverything we were going to do around here, or almost everything, was \ngoing to be paid for. It was called pay-go. We passed the pay-go rules. \nIt was highly touted at the time. There was great fanfare associated \nwith the passage of pay-go rules that would insist when there is new \nspending or tax cuts that those be offset by some spending cuts or some \ncombination of tax increases that would make sure there was no net \nimpact on the deficit.\n  What is happening here is the exact opposite of that because what we \nare seeing happen with the legislation that is before the Senate today \nis, if in fact this bill were enacted and became law, it ends up being \nabout $200 billion in new debt, debt we have added to the public debt \nsince pay-go has been enacted.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader, yielding \nback time so I can continue to speak about this amendment. I understand \nthe process for consideration of this legislation will now be somewhat \ntruncated if in fact cloture is invoked. I suspect it will not be long \nnow we will be having a vote on that. But I hope my colleagues will \ndefeat the motion to invoke cloture until such time as we have had an \nopportunity to debate many of these important amendments.\n  Clearly I believe the amendment I am discussing right now is one we \nneed to vote on. I suspect there will be others of my colleagues who \nwill want to offer amendments that I hope we will be able to debate and \nvote on before this legislation moves forward.\n  The point I wanted to make is this. Since the enactment of the pay-\nas-you-go rules here in the Senate, about $200 billion, if the current \nlegislation on the floor today is enacted, will have been added to the \nFederal debt. That is $200 billion which we hand to our children and \ngrandchildren to pay, notwithstanding what we have said publicly here \nin the Senate a few months ago, that all these things are going to be \npaid for and we are now going to be serious here in the Senate and in \nthe Congress about making sure we are not piling more and more debt on \nfuture generations. That is completely contradicted by the legislation \nwe will be voting on here in the near future on this tax extenders bill \nbecause it does increase the debt by almost $80 billion and, as I said \nearlier, raises taxes by almost $70 billion.\n  What I offer is an alternative to that approach. What this \nalternative does is, rather than increasing and raising taxes, it \nreduces taxes by $26 billion, it cuts spending by $100 billion, and it \nreduces the debt by $55 billion. So instead of more spending, more \ntaxes, and more debt in the middle of an economy that is trying to get \nback on its feet and create jobs, my alternative and the one I will \noffer on behalf of my colleagues--who, as I mentioned earlier, are \ncosponsors of this amendment--will in fact reduce spending, reduce \ntaxes, and reduce debt.\n  I think that is a good deal for the American taxpayer. I think it \nstrikes at the very heart of what we ought to be focused on, which is \njob creation. We hear the other side talk a lot about job creation, but \nwhen it comes time to create jobs, you cannot find many policies coming \nout of Washington, DC, today that actually are additive when it comes \nto job creation. In fact, as I said earlier, it is just the opposite. \nYou have a massive new health care entitlement that, when it is fully \nimplemented, will cost $2.5 trillion over 10 years, which in my view \nwill add enormously to the Federal debt because of all the double \ncounting that was used to understate the true cost of that legislation; \nyou had a trillion-dollar stimulus bill passed a year ago which was \ntotally put on the debt for America's future generations; you have now \ndiscussion of a new energy tax in the form\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nof some cap-and-trade legislation that could come before the Senate in \nthe next few months--and you just go down the list. At every turn, what \nthis Congress has done in the last several months, in the last year and \na half since the new administration came to office, is to increase \ntaxes, to increase spending, to increase debt, and to increase the size \nand the scope of government. We continue to see this effort to expand \ngovernment. When we expand government, obviously it takes more revenues \nto fund that government, create new bureaucracies--which is what we \nwill see with regard to the health care legislation--and in the end \ntakes more and more of those dollars out of the private economy where \nthe real permanent job creation should be occurring.\n\n  Instead, what we should be focused on is creating incentives for \nsmall businesses to create jobs. Rather than creating more government, \nexpanding the size of government here in Washington, DC, we ought to be \nlooking at what we can do to provide incentives for the economic engine \nin our economy--and that is our small businesses--to go out there and \ndo what they do best, which is create jobs.\n  But what you hear from small businesses not only in South Dakota but \nall across the country is there is so much policy uncertainty coming \nout of Washington and there is so much concern about the spending and \nthe debt and the taxes, that a lot of the small businesses that might \nbe making investments that would create jobs--hire new personnel, hire \nnew people, buy a new piece of equipment, make capital investment--are \nsitting on that investment for fear the next policy to come out of \nWashington, DC, could be a new energy tax, it could be higher taxes. We \nall know starting next year you are going to see higher taxes on \ndividends, higher taxes on capital gains, higher taxes on marginal \nincome, unless Congress takes steps to extend some of these expiring \ntax provisions.\n  That being said, what we are doing here today is we are going to make \nmatters that much worse. If you are a small business person in this \ncountry, if you are someone who is in this economy and is concerned \nabout Federal debt, is concerned about Federal spending, is concerned \nabout taxes, then the legislation that is before the Senate right now, \nif adopted, is going to add, as I said earlier, another almost $80 \nbillion to the Federal debt, will raise taxes by $70 billion, and \nincrease spending by $126 billion.\n  There is a better way. That is why I offer this amendment. This \namendment does a number of things. It reduces spending in a number of \nareas. It deals with some of the provisions of expiring tax law that \neverybody here agrees needs to be fixed. There are things both sides \nagree on. Both Democrats and Republicans here in the Senate believe it \nis important that we extend unemployment insurance for those people who \nhave lost jobs in the economy. Both Republicans and Democrats think it \nis important that there are certain expiring tax provisions that need \nto be extended--a research and development tax credit, for example, is \none thing that comes to mind. But there is a whole list of these \nexpiring tax provisions that need to be extended that both sides agree \nshould be done.\n  The difference in how we go about doing that is I think what is going \nto be the difference in the amendment that I offered versus the \nunderlying legislation. Again, what I will do is reduce Federal \nspending and address the expiring tax law, the need to extend \nunemployment insurance in a way that does not raise taxes, add to the \ndebt, and increase dramatically Federal spending in this country.\n  What does the amendment essentially do? Very briefly, it includes all \nthe major priorities that both parties want to accomplish but it drops \nthe spending that has been rejected by the Senate. It would eliminate \nthe $24 billion that is in the Senate bill that was not in the House \nbill that deals with the bailout for States around the country. It does \noffer, by the way, an additional year of the so-called doc fix. There \nhas been a lot of discussion here about extending the doc fix into the \nfuture.\n  And the underlying bill the Democratic majority has put forward does \nextend the doc fix. The reimbursement physicians receive under Medicare \nwould drop dramatically if nothing is done by Congress to address that, \nand both sides agree that needs to be addressed. Frankly, it should \nhave been done during the health care debate, but it was not. So the \nunderlying bill, the majority Democratic bill before the Senate, would \nextend the doc fix through the end of 2011.\n  What my alternative amendment would do is extend the doc fix through \nthe end of the year 2012. So you get an additional year for the doc \nfix. That is something physicians around the country are interested in, \nand I know for a fact that it is because my physicians in South \nDakota--and I am sure most of my colleagues hear on a regular basis \nfrom their physicians around the country.\n  It drops all the tax increases in the bill, including carried \ninterest, the tax on professional service S corps, the international \nprovisions, and the increase in the per-barrel tax that funds the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund that will raise gas prices for consumers \naround the country.\n  The alternative amendment I filed is fully paid for with spending \ncuts. It offers more than $100 billion in savings by actually doing \nwhat the American people want; that is, reducing spending. Every \nAmerican is dealing with a tough economy. A lot of Americans have lost \njobs. A lot of Americans certainly have lost income. A lot of Americans \nhave seen their net worth plummet as a result of the economic \ncircumstances in which the country finds itself. So they are all making \nhard decisions. They are sitting around the kitchen table and they are \nhaving these discussions with their family about what part of their \nbudget to cut or what they are going to have to do without. The only \nplace where that hasn't been true is here in Washington, DC. Why \nshouldn't we, as the leaders of this country, be willing to make the \nhard decisions that every American family is having to make?\n  Well, this legislation does that. It takes $37.5 billion of the $50 \nbillion in unobligated stimulus funds and uses that to extend existing \ntax and benefit provisions. It cuts money from the government by \nreducing congressional budgets right here close to home. We ought to \nhave to do what every American family and what every American business \nis having to do right now; that is, make some hard decisions and reduce \nour own spending. So it does reduce congressional budgets.\n  It rescinds unspent Federal funds, those funds that have been \nappropriated but not spent. It requires the government to sell unused \nland and auction off unused equipment. So it generates some additional \nrevenue that way.\n  It imposes a 1-year freeze on the salaries of Federal employees and \neliminates their bonuses, and it caps the total number of Federal \nemployees at current levels. In other words, the Federal Government \ncan't continue to grow and expand at a time when we see a lot of our \nbusinesses around this country having to lay workers off or cut back \ntheir hours. It collects $3 billion in unpaid taxes from Federal \nemployees.\n  It encourages responsibility and prioritizing by requiring a 5-\npercent across-the-board discretionary spending cut for all agencies \nexcept the VA and the Department of Defense. So 5 percent across the \nboard for all agencies except VA and DOD. And we think, again, that is \nan important step to take if we are serious about getting our own \nspending under control and addressing what is a very serious problem \nfor the future of this country; that is, the ballooning Federal debt, \nthe continual growth of government and spending and taxes.\n  It saves $5 billion by eliminating nonessential government travel, \nand it eliminates bonuses for poor-performing government contractors.\n  Finally, it adds a new deficit-reduction trust fund where rescinded \nbalances and money saved through this amendment will be deposited for \nthe purposes of paying down the Federal debt.\n  This amendment ought to be a no-brainer for all of our colleagues in \nthe Senate because it reduces the deficit by over $50 billion; it cuts \nspending by over $100 billion; it extends the existing tax law, the \nprovisions we have all talked about that both sides think are \nimportant; and it provides 6 more\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nmonths of stimulus unemployment benefits for those who have lost jobs \nin our economy.\n  As I said earlier, that is the exact opposite of the approach taken \nby the Democratic majority, which is, as I said before, the way they \nfinance all of these things is through $70 billion in new taxes. Again, \nmany of those taxes are going to hit squarely on our small businesses, \nwhich are the economic engine and the job creators in our economy and \nare going to hopefully lead us out of this economic malaise and get us \non to times where we are growing and expanding and creating more and \nmore jobs. And it adds $80 billion to the Federal debt, which, as I \nmentioned earlier, is at $13 trillion. If you include all of the \nFederal debt--that amount held by the public, held by foreign \ncountries, held by people here in this country--and then you add in the \ngovernment, the intergovernmental debt that is owed to various agencies \nof government, we are at $13 trillion and counting.\n  In fact, if you look at the trajectory going into the future, we are \ntalking about doubling and tripling that debt, doubling it in 5 years \nand tripling it in 10. And we are going to get to the point where over \n4 percent of our entire economy is spent just paying interest on the \ndebt.\n  Think about that. Over 4 percent of our entire economy--we have a $14 \ntrillion economy--would be spent just paying for interest on our \nFederal debt. There is going to come a point, 10 years out from now, \nwhen the amount of money we have to spend to finance our debt, to pay \nfor the interest on the debt, exceeds the amount we spend on our \nmilitary. Think about that. We would spend more financing the debt we \nowe, spend more on interest payments on the debt we owe, than we \nactually spend on our national security. That is a staggering thought, \nif you think about it. That is what we have to try to avoid. The only \nway we do that is by getting serious and starting here and starting \nnow.\n  My colleagues on the Democratic majority side have said that because \nthey passed pay-go, now we are on a different path; it is a different \nset of rules, a new sheriff in town; we are going to deal with these \nissues differently. But unfortunately what we are seeing is the same \npattern, the same old way of doing things, which is to declare \neverything an emergency, borrow the money from China, and hand the bill \nto our children and grandchildren. It is time that stopped. This \namendment gives us an opportunity to do that.\n  To put things into perspective because I think sometimes these \nnumbers get to be very abstract, and you listen to politicians get up \nand talk about debt and spending and deficits and that sort of thing, \nand it is hard to kind of comprehend, if you will, the dimensions we \nare talking about--I mean, $13 trillion. It is hard to even contemplate \nwhat $1 trillion is. So just to put that into proper perspective, if \nyou were to equate a dollar to a second, how much is 1 trillion \nseconds?\n  I spoke at Boys State a week ago or a little over a week ago now, and \nI asked the Boys Staters to sit down and do the arithmetic and to \nfigure out how much 1 trillion seconds is because I think it helps put \ninto perspective how much $1 trillion is. It is hard to even wrap your \nmind around what $1 trillion represents. But if you equate that to 1 \ntrillion seconds, 1 trillion seconds is 31,746 years--31,746 years. \nThat is what 1 trillion seconds represents.\n  Well, we are not $1 trillion in debt; we are $13 trillion in debt. \nHow much is 13 trillion seconds? Over 412,000 years. Over 412,000 \nyears. If you were to help people understand and put it in a certain \nperspective, that is the amount of money--the $13 trillion that we now \nowe, that is today. As I said before, if you look at the publicly held \nportion of that, we are expected to double that in 5 and triple it in \n10 years.\n  It took us 200 years of American history to get to $1 trillion, and \nwe have exploded that. If you look at the trendlines and where we are \nheaded as a nation, it is a very, very scary thought. It should be \nscary to all Americans, and I know it is. It certainly should be scary \nto the Members of this Chamber. That is why, every time we deal with a \nmajor piece of legislation, foremost in our mind ought to be, how is \nthis going to impact the fiscal balance sheet of this country? How is \nthis going to make the next generation--how is it going to improve \ntheir standard of living, their quality of life? What is it going to do \nto them? Are we going to be the first generation to bequeath to the \nnext generation a lower standard of living and a lower quality of life \nbecause we haven't been willing to make the hard choices and to make \nthe hard decisions that are so essential if we are going to get our \ncountry on a fiscal path?\n\n  This amendment does address the issues on which both sides agree. It \naddresses the issue of extending expiring tax provisions that many \npeople on both sides care about. It extends unemployment insurance \nuntil the end of the year. It does extend the doc fix beyond what the \nbase bill does. The base bill extends it through the end of the year \n2011. What this amendment would do would be to extend it to end of the \nyear 2012.\n  So we have an opportunity for Senators to take a vote and to let \neverybody know, let their constituents know whether they are serious \nabout getting spending under control; about making sure we are doing \neverything we can to create the right economic conditions for job \ncreation, and by that I mean keeping taxes low on small businesses, not \nraising taxes by $70 billion, which is what this bill does; and whether \nwe are serious here in Washington, DC, about listening to the American \npeople and what they are saying with regard to spending. They want us \nto cut federal spending. They want us to do what they are having to do \nin their family budgets and in their small business budgets. What every \nAmerican is now having to deal with is becoming more fiscally \nresponsible, dealing with austere measures that will keep them from \nhaving to go deeply into hock or into bankruptcy. We are doing that \nhere--we are going into bankruptcy. We just have the luxury here in \nWashington, DC, of being able to continue to borrow and borrow and put \nit on the credit card and hand the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren. It is time for that to stop. It can stop with this \namendment.\n  I hope that as we continue debate on the underlying bill and get \nvotes on those amendments, my colleagues in the Senate will do the \nright thing for the future of this country and start to get spending \nunder control and start to pay for what we continue to borrow for so \nthat we are not piling more and more debt on future generations.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In addition, full-\n  year funding estimates under current law are included for entitlement\n  and mandatory programs requiring annual appropriations, even if the\n  appropriations have not been made.\n\\3\\ Excludes administrative expenses of the Social Security\n  Administration, which are off-budget, but are appropriated annually.\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n  TABLE 2.--SUPPORTING DETAIL FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL REPORT FOR ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FISCAL YEAR\n                                            2010, AS OF JUNE 7, 2010\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Budget\n                                                                     authority        Outlays        Revenues\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPreviously Enacted: \\1\\\n    Revenues....................................................            n.a.            n.a.       1,633,385\n    Permanents and other spending legislation...................       1,656,952       1,651,725            n.a.\n    Appropriation legislation \\2\\...............................       1,917,749       2,048,775            n.a.\n    Offsetting receipts.........................................        -690,252        -690,252            n.a.\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n      Total, previously enacted.................................       2,884,449       3,010,248       1,633,385\nEnacted this session:\n    An act to accelerate the income tax benefits for charitable                0               0             -40\n     cash contributions for the relief of victims of the\n     earthquake in Haiti (P.L. 111-126).........................\n    Emergency Aid to American Survivors of the Haiti Earthquake               50              50               0\n     Act (P.L. 111-127).........................................\n    Social Security Disability Applicants' Access to                          -4              -4               0\n     Professional Representation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-142).....\n    United States Capitol Police Administrative Technical                     10               6               0\n     Corrections Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-145).....................\n    Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (P.L. 111-147)..          20,903             141          -4,380\n    Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148)...           8,500           3,130            -580\n    Satellite Television Extension Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-151)...               2               0               2\n    Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L.             1,130             220          -1,930\n     111-152)...................................................\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n      Total, enacted this session...............................          30,591           3,543          -6,928\nEntitlements and mandatories:\n    Budget resolution estimates of appropriated entitlements and         -14,500           2,066               0\n     other mandatory programs...................................\nTotal Current Level \\2\\ \\3\\.....................................       2,900,540       3,015,857       1,626,457\nTotal Budget Resolution \\4\\.....................................       2,907,837       3,015,541       1,612,278\n    Adjustment to the budget resolution for disaster allowance           -10,350          -5,448            n.a.\n     \\5\\........................................................\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\nAdjusted Budget Resolution......................................       2,897,487       3,010,093       1,612,278\nCurrent Level Over Budget Resolution............................           3,053           5,764          14,179\nCurrent Level Under Budget Resolution...........................            n.a.            n.a.            n.a.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes legislation affecting budget authority, outlays, or revenues that was enacted in the first session\n  of the 111th Congress.\n\\2\\ Pursuant to section 403 of S.

Madam President, pursuant to a public letter to \nSecretary Sebelius dated September 24, 2009, there is a pending \nobjection to unanimous consent requests for the following nominees: Jim \nEsquea, nominated for HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation, and \nRichard Sorian, nominated for HHS Assistant Secretary for Public \nAffairs. I ask unanimous consent that a public letter dated September \n24, 2009, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 24, 2009.\n     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Sebelius: America's 11 million seniors \n     enrolled in the Medicare Advantage program deserve to be \n     informed of any actions by the federal government that could \n     affect this program and its broad implications. Medicare \n     Advantage Plans and Prescription Drug Plans that provide \n     services through the Medicare program have a constitutional \n     right to provide information about these Medicare programs to \n     their customers. Therefore, I hope you can understand our \n     grave concern with the recent Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services directive barring all such providers from \n     any and all communications of this kind with America's \n     seniors. This gag order must be immediately lifted.\n       As the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, our \n     constitutional tradition is one of ``a profound commitment to \n     the principle that debate on public issues should be \n     uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'' Health plans, of \n     course, have the right to speak on matters of public \n     concern--a fundamental principle that your Department, until \n     recently, had recognized and respected. Specifically, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) previously \n     noted that there was no legal authority to justify \n     prohibiting a health plan ``from informing its members of \n     proposed legislation and exhorting them to express their \n     opinions'' about it. In fact, HHS had previously determined \n     that shutting down communication of this sort ``would violate \n     basic freedom of speech and other constitutional rights of \n     the Medicare beneficiary as a citizen.''\n       Now, the Obama administration has reversed this \n     longstanding HHS decision--in the midst of a critical debate \n     about the future of health care services in our country--to \n     shut down communication between private companies and \n     America's seniors on an issue that has a direct impact on \n     their health care. And your Department has done so by \n     imposing an industry-wide gag order without apparent \n     justification or basis in law and completely contradictory to \n     your past public guidance and the plain language and spirit \n     of the First Amendment, among the most sacred tenets of our \n     democracy.\n       America's seniors and the health plans that serve them \n     deserve to have their free speech rights respected. Their \n     rights should not be subject to the whims of any \n     Administration, and the health plans that serve them should \n     not be threatened with punishment if they speak out on a \n     matter of public concern simply because the Administration \n     disagrees with their position.\n       Until your Department rescinds its gag order and allows \n     seniors to receive information about matters before Congress, \n     we will not consent to time agreements on the confirmation of \n     any nominees to your Department or associated agencies.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter of such \n     great importance to America's seniors.\n           Signed,\n     Mitch McConnell.\n     Jon Kyl.\n     Lamar Alexander.\n     John Cornyn.\n     Lisa Murkowski.\n     John Thune.\n     Michael B.

Madam President, this past week, Fremont County in my home \nState of Wyoming has been hit hard by flooding. I want to take this \nopportunity to commend the communities in Wyoming that have come \ntogether and worked so hard to respond to the flooding, to help protect \neach other's homes, and whose willingness to step up and volunteer to \nhelp their neighbors really shows the true Wyoming spirit.\n  I want to thank the individuals who have been filling sandbags all \nweek. Literally hundreds of thousands of sandbags have been filled to \nhelp hold back the floodwaters and protect homes and businesses. I am \ntold that there are more sandbags if we need them and I know that \npeople in my home State won't hesitate for a second to do the hard work \nthat will help protect a neighbor's home or a community business. This \ntruly is a community effort, and I am proud of the example that our \nsmall businesses, our community organizations, and Wyoming's volunteers \nare making.\n  Nearly 240 Wyoming National Guard members are in Fremont County right \nnow. Their service is critical to our communities in times like these, \nand I want to recognize and thank them for their hard work. They are \nmaking a huge difference in helping make sure that communities like \nLander, Ethete, Fort Washakie, and many other places have the help they \nneed.\n  The extent of the damage from this disaster is still unclear, but our \ncommunities--both in Wyoming and in other States that have been hit by \nnatural disasters--must have the resources to recover and put their \ntowns and neighborhoods back together. For those agricultural producers \naffected by this flood, this is the very reason why I worked with my \ncolleagues during the 2008 farm bill to enact a permanent disaster \nprogram--so funding would be available when it is most needed and would \nnot require emergency congressional action.\n  I know Senator Barrasso and Representative Lummis are working hard to \nmake sure Fremont County can get the support it needs. Their energy and \nhard work have been critical to the teamwork that we do. Wyoming is a \nbig State, so I am glad that we have always worked together to make \nsure we can get different jobs done in different places.\n  I want to thank everyone who has helped respond to this disaster for \ntheir hard work and persistence. They have truly demonstrated what it \nmeans to part of the Wyoming community. Our prayers are with everyone \nat this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4882-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4882-S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I commemorate the 233rd Flag Day \nin the United States. On June 14, 1777, nearly a year after our Nation \ndeclared its independence, the Second Continental Congress approved the \ndesign of our national flag. The 13 stripes that alternate red and \nwhite and the white stars on a field of blue have proudly stood as a \nbeacon of liberty and justice around the world ever since.\n  Flag Day--the anniversary of the Flag Resolution of 1777--was \nofficially established by the Proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson \nin 1916. While Flag Day was celebrated in various communities for years \nafter Wilson's proclamation, it was not until 1949 that President \nTruman signed an act of Congress designating June 14 of each year as \nNational Flag Day and the corresponding week as National Flag Week.\n  My home State of Maryland plays an integral role in the rich history \nof our flag. The flag was the source of inspiration for Francis Scott \nKey's ``Star Spangled Banner'' which became our national anthem. That \nmost famous of American flags flew over Fort McHenry in Baltimore \nHarbor. It bravely withstood the torrent of British buckshot and still \nhangs today in the Smithsonian Museum of American History. Each year \nthe National Flag Day Foundation of Baltimore, MD, sponsors a moving \nceremony at the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine \nwhich brings our community together in celebration and remembrance of \nour glorious past.\n  America's flag graces classrooms, statehouses, courtrooms, and \nchurches, serving as a daily reminder of this Nation's past \naccomplishments and ongoing dedication to safeguarding individual \nrights. The brave members of our Armed Forces carry ``Old Glory'' with \nthem as they fulfill their mission to defend the blessings of democracy \nand peace across the globe; our banner flies from public buildings as a \nsign of our national community; and its folds drape the tombs of our \ndistinguished dead. The flag is a badge of honor to all and a sign of \nour citizens' common purpose.\n  This week and throughout the year let us do all we can to teach \nyounger generations the significance of our flag. Its 13 red and white \nstripes represent not only the original colonies\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nbut also the courage and purity of our Nation, while its 50 stars stand \nfor the separate but United States of our Union. Let us pledge \nallegiance to this flag to declare our patriotism and raise its colors \nhigh to express our pride and respect for the American way of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4883-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PETER AND SUZIE ARNOLD\n\n Mr. KOHL.

At the first Earth Day, Senator Nelson noted that his \ngoal was not just one of clean air and water, but also ``an environment \nof decency, quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and \nall other living creatures.'' He knew that this goal was achievable \nthrough grassroots efforts by every day Americans.\n  Today I am pleased to congratulate Peter and Suzie Arnold for \nrecently being named the Wisconsin Conservation Farmer of the Year \nAward Recipients by the Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation \nAssociation. Their leadership and dedication to land conservation over \nthe last 11 years has been a model for grazing lands conservation. \nThrough the years their farm near Edgar, WI, has served to educate \nother dairy farmers on the benefits of grazing lands conservation and \nserved as a research site for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nDairy Forage Research Center.\n  The Arnolds have adopted a number of conservation practices to \nimprove soil, air, and water quality on their farm. Over the past \nseveral years the organic matter levels in their soils have increased \nfrom an average of 2.7 percent to 6 percent while attaining the highest \nSoil Quality Index score measured by the Natural Resource Conservation \nService. This is a true testament to their commitment to conservation. \nI congratulate the Arnolds for their strong commitment to environmental \nstewardship and their willingness to continue Wisconsin's proud \nconservation legacy. The Arnolds are showing that Senator Nelson's \nvision of ``an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for \nall other human beings and all other living creatures'' is achievable \nthrough grassroots efforts by every day Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4883-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECOGNIZING AGAR, SD\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend section 139 of title 49, United States Code, \nto increase the effectiveness of Federal oversight of motor carriers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nI believe will ensure that our motor vehicle operators, particularly \nthose smallest businesses who rely on only one or two vehicles, are no \nlonger subject to the nefarious practices of unscrupulous logistic \ncompanies and brokers.\n  The Bureau of Transportation Statistics has indicated that by 2020, \nfreight volume will double in this country. A critical component of \nmoving that vast expansion of freight to distributors and retailers \nwill be motor carriers--that is, trucks.\n  However, for years, trucking operators, particularly the smallest \ncompanies who not only perform the back-breaking work of transporting \nfreight across the country, but simultaneously run their own \nbusinesses, have fallen victim to fly-by-night brokers and \nintermediaries who connect the truck operators with shippers who need \ngoods moved, then defraud the operators of their payments before \nvanishing in the night, depriving the operator of any legal recourse in \nan effort to recover their losses.\n  How can they do this? Aren't these actions criminal? Unfortunately, \nthe current regulations are long outdated. Beyond a prospective broker \nbeing required to pay a ten thousand dollar bond, there is little in \nthe way of registration requirements or government oversight under \npresent law. According to trucking experts, a broker can rake in \nrevenues far in excess of that ten thousand dollar upfront payment in \nless than a month, allowing them to disappear in the night, losing \ntheir bond but more than making up for it in revenues stolen from hard-\nworking truck operators who are left with nothing to show for their \ndelivery, and no way to recoup those losses. The time has come to \nprovide these operators that chance to defend themselves.\n  That is why I have taken this opportunity to introduce the Motor \nCarrier Protection Act. This legislation will bolster the rather meager \nframework of regulations now in place to guard against deceitful \nbehavior from the handful of freight forwarders who engage in these \ncriminal practices. The bond necessary to serve as a broker will no \nlonger be a paltry 10,000, but will be elevated to 100,000, a more \nreasonable amount reflecting the reality of today's shipping \nenvironment. It will also expand the requirements to become a licensed \nbroker, giving the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to \nopportunity to collect licensing fees from brokers, intermediaries and \nfreight forwarders--using those fees to fund greater enforcement \ncapabilities. As a result of this legislation, the Federal Government \nwill be able to revoke operating licenses for those brokers that do not \nmeet these revamped strictures. These new licenses must be renewed \nannually. With these improvements to existing regulation, motor vehicle \noperators will no longer wonder if they will receive payment for a job \nwell done.\n  Why is this legislation necessary? We must be mindful that these \nscams are not easily discouraged. For example, in Georgia, one group of \nindividuals operated twelve different freight broker companies over a \nperiod of 3 years--continuously evading law enforcement and the \ntruckers they defrauded by changing the name and location of their \nbusiness--while never paying the truck operators who actually moved the \nfreight. In the end, this racketeering enterprise collected over \n$500,000, most of which was due to the operators. In fact, it was the \ndiligent efforts of Georgia law enforcement that broke up this \noperation, not the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, who the \ngovernment has charged with preventing these sorts of fraud.\n  We must update these regulations, and provide FMCSA with more tools \nto prevent these kinds of criminal activities. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation as we move forward.\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/14/senate-section/article/S4887-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 551--MARKING THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE JUNE 12, \n   2009, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN IRAN, AND CONDEMNING ONGOING HUMAN \n                         RIGHTS ABUSES IN IRAN\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nGraham, and Mr. Levin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 551\n\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has systematically \n     undertaken a campaign of violence, persecution, and \n     intimidation against Iranian citizens who have peacefully \n     protested the results of the deeply flawed Iran presidential \n     elections of June 12, 2009;\n       Whereas the 2009 Department of State Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Iran found that ``[t]he government \n     [of Iran] severely limited citizens' right to peacefully \n     change their government through free and fair elections'' and \n     ``. . . severely restricted the right to privacy and civil \n     liberties, including freedoms of speech and the press, \n     assembly, association, and movement'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators \n     gathered in the streets of Iran in the aftermath of the June \n     12, 2009, elections, and dozens of innocent Iranians were \n     killed and more than 4,000 were arbitrarily arrested by \n     police and security forces and the Basij militia;\n       Whereas hundreds of Iranian citizens remain in detention \n     and more than 250 prominent activists and demonstrators were \n     tried in mass ``show trials'' that began in August 2009, and \n     at least 50 of these defendants have received sentences \n     ranging from six months imprisonment to death;\n       Whereas, on June 20, 2009, a member of the Basij militia \n     reportedly shot and killed 27 year-old student Neda Agha-\n     Soltan, whose murder was recorded on a mobile phone camera, \n     disseminated via the Internet, and became a rallying cry for \n     the political opposition and Green Movement;\n       Whereas, since the election, the Government of Iran has \n     systemically restricted and suppressed free press, free \n     expression, free assembly, and free access to the Internet \n     and other forms of connective technology in order to limit \n     the flow of information and silence political opposition and \n     other forms of popular dissent;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has a deplorable human \n     rights record that includes severe restrictions on the \n     freedom of religion or belief, denial of the freedom of \n     assembly and the rights of civil society, systematic torture \n     and ill-treatment, and judicial proceedings that lack due \n     process;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to operate with \n     hostility and impunity toward journalists, reformers, ethnic \n     and religious minorities, political opponents, human rights \n     defenders, women's rights groups, student activists, and \n     others, including through unlawful and arbitrary detentions, \n     arrests, politically motivated sentencing, physical assaults, \n     and killings;\n       Whereas human rights activists, journalists, and ethnic and \n     religious minorities have fled Iran for fear of persecution \n     and are residing, some in dangerous circumstances, in \n     neighboring countries seeking refugee status and asylum in \n     the United States and other countries;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has violated its obligations \n     under the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the \n     International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Racial Discrimination, and the International Covenant on \n     Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;\n       Whereas the 2010 Freedom House Freedom in the World Report \n     finds that Iran leads the world in the number of jailed \n     journalists;\n       Whereas, since the June 2009 election, the Government of \n     Iran has restricted foreign press access, banned more than 60 \n     international media outlets, and jammed international \n     broadcasts, including those of Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty's Radio Farda, Voice of America's Persian News \n     Network, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and other non-\n     Iranian news services;\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2009, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution condemning ``serious, ongoing \n     and recurring human rights violations in Iran'' and calling \n     on the Government of Iran to respect its human rights \n     obligations;\n       Whereas, on December 27, 2009, the Ashura holiday, at least \n     eight civilians were killed in confrontations with \n     authorities, and police reportedly arrested approximately 300 \n     civilians in relation to popular demonstrations;\n       Whereas, on February 11, 2010, the anniversary of the \n     Islamic Revolution, the Government of Iran beat and arrested \n     numerous protestors, jammed text messaging technology, slowed \n     and restricted access to the Internet, and blocked email and \n     news websites, intentionally limiting the ability of Iranian \n     citizens to communicate and freely access news and \n     information;\n       Whereas, on April 19, 2010, the Government of Iran \n     officially suspended prominent political parties, banned a \n     reformist newspaper, and sentenced to prison leaders within \n     the political opposition; and\n       Whereas activists connected to the 2009 election protests \n     were recently re-arrested in an attempt to disrupt planned \n     protests on the one-year anniversary of the election on June \n     12, 2010: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) solemnly marks one year since the flawed June 12, 2009, \n     presidential election in Iran, and honors Iranian citizens \n     who have lost their lives in peaceful protest since the \n     election;\n       (2) supports the people of Iran as they seek peaceful and \n     free expression, free speech, free press, free assembly, \n     unfettered access to the Internet, and freedom of religion \n     despite a campaign of intimidation, repressions, and violence \n     perpetrated by the Government of Iran;\n       (3) commends the people of Iran who have braved the \n     persistent and pervasive threat of censorship, arrest, \n     physical harassment, and death to have their voices heard and \n     peacefully exercise fundamental human rights, as enshrined in \n     the constitution of Iran and international human rights law, \n     including the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, entered into force on March 23, 1976, and ratified by \n     Iran;\n       (4) condemns the Government of Iran for perpetrating \n     ongoing human rights abuses and for restricting, monitoring, \n     and suppressing freedom of the press, expression, assembly, \n     speech, and religion, as well as free access to the Internet \n     and other forms of connective technology in order to limit \n     the flow of information and silence political opposition and \n     other forms of popular dissent;\n       (5) denounces the atmosphere of impunity for those who \n     intimidate, harass, and commit violence against Iranian \n     citizens, and calls for the unconditional release of all \n     political and religious prisoners in Iran;\n       (6) urges the President and Secretary of State to mobilize \n     resources to support freedom of assembly, freedom of \n     expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and \n     freedom of speech in Iran, especially on the June 12 \n     anniversary of the 2009 presidential election;\n       (7) encourages the President and Secretary of State to work \n     with the United Nations Human Rights Council to condemn the \n     ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by the Government \n     of Iran and establish a monitoring mechanism by which the \n     Council can monitor such violations;\n       (8) urges the Government of Iran to cooperate with

Res. 551\n\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has systematically \n     undertaken a campaign of violence, persecution, and \n     intimidation against Iranian citizens who have peacefully \n     protested the results of the deeply flawed Iran presidential \n     elections of June 12, 2009;\n       Whereas the 2009 Department of State Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices in Iran found that ``[t]he government \n     [of Iran] severely limited citizens' right to peacefully \n     change their government through free and fair elections'' and \n     ``. . . severely restricted the right to privacy and civil \n     liberties, including freedoms of speech and the press, \n     assembly, association, and movement'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators \n     gathered in the streets of Iran in the aftermath of the June \n     12, 2009, elections, and dozens of innocent Iranians were \n     killed and more than 4,000 were arbitrarily arrested by \n     police and security forces and the Basij militia;\n       Whereas hundreds of Iranian citizens remain in detention \n     and more than 250 prominent activists and demonstrators were \n     tried in mass ``show trials'' that began in August 2009, and \n     at least 50 of these defendants have received sentences \n     ranging from six months imprisonment to death;\n       Whereas, on June 20, 2009, a member of the Basij militia \n     reportedly shot and killed 27 year-old student Neda Agha-\n     Soltan, whose murder was recorded on a mobile phone camera, \n     disseminated via the Internet, and became a rallying cry for \n     the political opposition and Green Movement;\n       Whereas, since the election, the Government of Iran has \n     systemically restricted and suppressed free press, free \n     expression, free assembly, and free access to the Internet \n     and other forms of connective technology in order to limit \n     the flow of information and silence political opposition and \n     other forms of popular dissent;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has a deplorable human \n     rights record that includes severe restrictions on the \n     freedom of religion or belief, denial of the freedom of \n     assembly and the rights of civil society, systematic torture \n     and ill-treatment, and judicial proceedings that lack due \n     process;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran continues to operate with \n     hostility and impunity toward journalists, reformers, ethnic \n     and religious minorities, political opponents, human rights \n     defenders, women's rights groups, student activists, and \n     others, including through unlawful and arbitrary detentions, \n     arrests, politically motivated sentencing, physical assaults, \n     and killings;\n       Whereas human rights activists, journalists, and ethnic and \n     religious minorities have fled Iran for fear of persecution \n     and are residing, some in dangerous circumstances, in \n     neighboring countries seeking refugee status and asylum in \n     the United States and other countries;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has violated its obligations \n     under the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the \n     International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \n     Racial Discrimination, and the International Covenant on \n     Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;\n       Whereas the 2010 Freedom House Freedom in the World Report \n     finds that Iran leads the world in the number of jailed \n     journalists;\n       Whereas, since the June 2009 election, the Government of \n     Iran has restricted foreign press access, banned more than 60 \n     international media outlets, and jammed international \n     broadcasts, including those of Radio Free Europe/Radio \n     Liberty's Radio Farda, Voice of America's Persian News \n     Network, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and other non-\n     Iranian news services;\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2009, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution condemning ``serious, ongoing \n     and recurring human rights violations in Iran'' and calling \n     on the Government of Iran to respect its human rights \n     obligations;\n       Whereas, on December 27, 2009, the Ashura holiday, at least \n     eight civilians were killed in confrontations with \n     authorities, and police reportedly arrested approximately 300 \n     civilians in relation to popular demonstrations;\n       Whereas, on February 11, 2010, the anniversary of the \n     Islamic Revolution, the Government of Iran beat and arrested \n     numerous protestors, jammed text messaging technology, slowed \n     and restricted access to the Internet, and blocked email and \n     news websites, intentionally limiting the ability of Iranian \n     citizens to communicate and freely access news and \n     information;\n       Whereas, on April 19, 2010, the Government of Iran \n     officially suspended prominent political parties, banned a \n     reformist newspaper, and sentenced to prison leaders within \n     the political opposition; and\n       Whereas activists connected to the 2009 election protests \n     were recently re-arrested in an attempt to disrupt planned \n     protests on the one-year anniversary of the election on June \n     12, 2010: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) solemnly marks one year since the flawed June 12, 2009, \n     presidential election in Iran, and honors Iranian citizens \n     who have lost their lives in peaceful protest since the \n     election;\n       (2) supports the people of Iran as they seek peaceful and \n     free expression, free speech, free press, free assembly, \n     unfettered access to the Internet, and freedom of religion \n     despite a campaign of intimidation, repressions, and violence \n     perpetrated by the Government of Iran;\n       (3) commends the people of Iran who have braved the \n     persistent and pervasive threat of censorship, arrest, \n     physical harassment, and death to have their voices heard and \n     peacefully exercise fundamental human rights, as enshrined in \n     the constitution of Iran and international human rights law, \n     including the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights, entered into force on March 23, 1976, and ratified by \n     Iran;\n       (4) condemns the Government of Iran for perpetrating \n     ongoing human rights abuses and for restricting, monitoring, \n     and suppressing freedom of the press, expression, assembly, \n     speech, and religion, as well as free access to the Internet \n     and other forms of connective technology in order to limit \n     the flow of information and silence political opposition and \n     other forms of popular dissent;\n       (5) denounces the atmosphere of impunity for those who \n     intimidate, harass, and commit violence against Iranian \n     citizens, and calls for the unconditional release of all \n     political and religious prisoners in Iran;\n       (6) urges the President and Secretary of State to mobilize \n     resources to support freedom of assembly, freedom of \n     expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and \n     freedom of speech in Iran, especially on the June 12 \n     anniversary of the 2009 presidential election;\n       (7) encourages the President and Secretary of State to work \n     with the United Nations Human Rights Council to condemn the \n     ongoing human rights violations perpetrated by the Government \n     of Iran and establish a monitoring mechanism by which the \n     Council can monitor such violations;\n       (8) urges the Government of Iran to cooperate with and \n     allow visits of the United Nations Special Rapporteurs for \n     Human Rights and the United Nations Office of the High \n     Commissioner for Human Rights;\n       (9) urges the
