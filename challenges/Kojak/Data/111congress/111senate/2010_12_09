Madam President, we have a piece of legislation that passed \nlast night in the House of Representatives. I received a call last \nnight, I guess around 9:30 or 10 o'clock, from both the majority leader \nand the Speaker that the so-called DREAM Act had passed in the House. \nThat changes things over here. It changes things because we had been \ntoiling on this for a long time, and now that it has passed the House, \nthe appropriate way to proceed would be to have a vote on that matter, \nbecause if we are able to pass it, it goes directly to the President.\n  Having said that, I think it would be futile for us to have a vote on \na motion to invoke cloture on a bill we know will not matter. So what \nwe will do is, I am going to ask consent to vitiate the vote that is \nscheduled for 11 o'clock on the DREAM Act, and to alert everyone, we \nhave not given up on the DREAM Act. Quite the opposite. It having \npassed the House gives us more energy to move forward on this most \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The stories that relate to this DREAM Act are compelling to me, of \nthese young men and women who want to be able to complete their \neducation, want to be able to go into the military and serve their \ncountry and, in the process, they are not guaranteed citizenship, they \nare guaranteed that they will not be arrested or deported. They will be \ngiven a green card to prove that they are eligible for citizenship. So \nwe are going to proceed and do everything we can to pass what the House \ndid.\n  Having said that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote scheduled on the DREAM Act at 11 o'clock be vitiated.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, on behalf of our leadership, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding Senator Durbin is \nto be recognized at this time for up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, 10 years ago, I received a telephone \ncall in my Chicago office that I have recounted on this floor many \ntimes. But it started me on a journey that resulted in where we stand \ntoday on the passage of the DREAM Act. It was a phone call from a \nKorean-American mother with an amazing daughter who was a musical \nprodigy who had been accepted at the Juilliard School of music in the \nActing President pro tempore's home State of New York.\n  This excited young woman, in filling out the application, came to the \nquestion about her citizenship and nationality and turned to her mother \nand said: What do I put here? And her mother had to tell her the sad \nnews that when that young girl was brought to America from Korea, at \nthe age of 2, the mother did not file any papers and so that young girl \nwas literally undocumented, literally illegal in the eyes of some.\n  She asked us for help. What can we do to help in this situation? Here \nwas a bright young woman, with a bright future, who had done everything \nright and excelled in so many ways. We contacted the Immigration \nService and they said: It is too bad. Under American law, this young \ngirl--who never consciously did anything wrong in her life--was a \nperson without a country. Her only recourse at the age of 18 was to \nreturn to Korea--a country she had no knowledge of, could not speak the \nlanguage, and had never visited anytime in her life.\n  When I heard about that, I thought that was fundamentally unfair. \nThis young woman did nothing wrong. The mother made the mistake. The \nmother did not file the papers. And now her life was in shambles, and \nuncertain because of it.\n  So I put in a bill which basically said: If you are in that \nsituation, where you were brought to America at a young age, and then \nproceed to do the right thing with your life--go to school, make \ncertain you were a good member of your community--we will give you a \nchance when you have graduated from high school, a chance to prove \nyourself, that you were going to be a good citizen in America.\n  You could prove it one of two ways. You could do a noble act for \nAmerica, stand up and volunteer to serve in our Armed Forces, literally \nprepared to risk your life for this great Nation--and if you did that, \nthen we would put you on the path to legalization--or if you didn't \nchoose the military service, you could prove it by your educational \nachievement.\n\n  Now, most of the people we are talking about are not Korean or Polish \nor Filipino. They are Hispanic, and the numbers tell us the odds are \nagainst the young people we are talking about. Half of them don't \nfinish high school. Only 5 percent of these undocumented students end \nup going into a college of any kind. Think about those odds: 50-50 that \nyou will finish high school and 1 out of 20 that you will even enter \ncollege.\n  So we put up a high wall and said: You have to clear this wall to \nprove that you are not only a good person but that you desperately want \nto be part of America's future. That is the DREAM Act.\n  In the process we said: We are going to ask you more questions than \nwe ask of a Congressman or a Senator. We are going to ask questions \nabout your background, your moral character, your knowledge of English. \nWe are going to follow you closely and carefully, and if you stumble \nalong the\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nway, we can't help you. It is a very strict standard we impose, but it \nis one that these young people are anxious to meet.\n  These young people who will be affected by the DREAM Act are some of \nthe most amazing, inspiring people I have ever met. From the Presiding \nOfficer's home State of New York, as a young man, Cesar Vargas--I told \nhis story on the Senate floor yesterday--came to America from Mexico at \nthe age of 5. He went through school. Then, on 9/11, he was so angry \nabout what happened in the Presiding Officer's city of New York, he \nwent to the recruiter and said: I want to enlist in the military. I \nwant to serve and defend this country against terrorism.\n  They said: Mr. Vargas, you can't because you are undocumented. You \ncan't join because, you see, our military has not waived the \nrequirement of legal status for those who want to enlist. So he \ncontinued his education. He is now in his second or third year at the \nNew York University Law School. I have met him. He is an extraordinary \nman. He speaks five languages. As the Presiding Officer knows, he could \nbe a catch for a law firm--this young man, with all of these skills and \nall that drive. That is not his goal. He wants to be a part of our \nmilitary still, to be a lawyer in the military today. That is his \nambition.\n  He is a DREAM Act young man. Why would we say no to him? Why would we \nturn our backs on him and say: We don't need you. We know better. The \nSecretary of Defense, Robert Gates, has said: Yes, we need him and many \nmore like him who can come into our military and make a better and \nstronger and more diverse military and build up a tradition of service \nin the military which will extend for generations forward. Secretary \nGates knows the DREAM Act is in the best interests of the defense of \nAmerica.\n  Secretary Arne Duncan, our Education Secretary, appeared with me \nyesterday and said these young people who have overcome the odds and \nfinished high school and want to go to college and be lawyers and \nengineers and doctors and teachers are the people who can build our \nbase of success in the future. Why would we turn them away? At a time \nwhen we are debating about importing talent from other countries to \nmeet our needs in America, why would we turn away the talent in \nAmerica, those who are here today and only asking for a chance?\n  Last night, in the House of Representatives, there was an amazing \nvote, an incredible vote, passing the DREAM Act. I believe it is the \nfirst time it has passed the House of Representatives. I want to credit \nmy colleague and great friend, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, who worked \nnight and day, and I also wish to thank the men and women of the House \nwho showed the courage to vote for it. One of them called me late last \nnight and was emotional about this decision, wondering if it would have \na long-term impact on his political career. But that Congressperson had \nthe courage to step up and do it.\n  Now the question is, Will we have the courage to do the same? Our \nleader, Majority Leader Reid, has asked to vitiate the rollcall vote \nthis morning, which is basically putting it aside, because he believes \nthe bill is not a bill that is viable under the circumstances now that \nthe House bill has passed. The minority leader, Senator McConnell, has \ncome to the Senate floor repeatedly and said we should not be having \nthese so-called symbolic votes, even on the DREAM Act. This morning, \nSenator Reid said: Let's take a symbolic vote off the calendar and wait \nuntil we receive the House message. There was an objection from the \nRepublican side so, clearly, they are arguing it from both sides.\n  Be that as it may, we owe it to the young men and women whose lives \nwill be affected, we owe it to America who needs their service in the \nmilitary and needs their skill in building our economy to honestly \naddress this issue and ask Members of both sides to sit down, pause, \nand reflect as to whether we can afford to say to these talented young \nmen and women: There is no place in America for you.\n  There is a place. There is a place for them, as there was a place for \nmy mother, who came to this country at the age of 2 as an immigrant, \nwhose mother and father could barely speak the English language but who \neventually gave birth to a son who stands here today as the Senator \nfrom the State of Illinois. My story is an American story, and the \nstory of these DREAM Act students is an American story of fighting \nagainst the odds, of coming from other places, determined to be a part \nof this great Nation and making a contribution that makes a difference.\n  I pray my colleagues will reflect on what happened last night--the \nhistoric vote of passing the DREAM Act--and that before this Congress \npacks up and leaves, we will address this issue and pass it too.\n  I see the minority leader is on the floor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8661-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise in tribute to my good friend \nand distinguished colleague, Senator Sam Brownback, or I could also say \nGovernor-elect Sam Brownback of the great State of Kansas.\n  Sam promised his constituents that he wouldn't run for more than two \nfull 6-year terms in the Senate, and Sam has honored that pledge.\n  Let me just say at the outset that Sam has been an outstanding \nSenator and an example of principled leadership to all of us. He has \nserved the people of Kansas with great distinction and honor, and I am \ncertain he will continue to do so as he takes on new challenges in \nTopeka.\n  Sam is a born leader. He was raised in the small town of Parker, KS, \nwhere his mom and dad still live and farm today, and his many talents \nwere evident early on. In high school, he was State president of the \nFuture Farmers of America. As an undergraduate at Kansas State \nUniversity, he was elected president of the student body, and he was \nelected class president in law school, too, at the University of \nKansas. After law school, Sam worked as a lawyer in Manhattan, KS, for \n4 years before being appointed as the secretary of the Kansas Board of \nAgriculture.\n  From 1990 to 1991, Sam was accepted as a White House fellow under \nPresident George H.W. Bush, where he worked for the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. Three years after that, he ran for Congress as part of \nthe Republican revolution and was overwhelmingly elected to Kansas's \nSecond District. It was the first time in Sam's life that Republicans \nhad the majority in the Congress, and he was a part of it. He planned \nto make the most of it by focusing on limiting the size and reach of \nthe Federal Government.\n\n  But Sam's tenure in the House was brief. In 1996, just 2 days after \nSenator Dole announced his plan to resign from the Senate to run for \nPresident, Sam announced he would seek the Republican nomination in a \nspecial election to serve out the final 2 years of Dole's term. Sam \nhandily defeated the former Lieutenant Governor who had been appointed \nto fill Senator Dole's seat earlier that spring.\n  In the general election, Sam's campaign message was simple. He called \nit the three Rs: reduce, reform, and return:\n\n       Reduce the size of and scope of the Federal Government. \n     Reform Congress. Return to the basic values that had built \n     the country: work and family and the recognition of a higher \n     moral authority.\n\n  Sam's message resonated with the people, many of whom feared their \ngovernment had become, as Sam stated, ``their master, not their \nservant,'' and easily defeated his opponent with 54 percent of the \nvote. Sam would go on to be reelected to full terms in 1998 and 2004, \ncapturing an astounding 65 and 69 percent of the vote.\n  While in the Senate, Sam has been a leader among his peers. He has \nbeen outspoken and has fought hard for the people of Kansas and for the \nunderprivileged around the world.\n  Sam is an ardent defender of life and of the protection of the \nunborn. ``I see it as the lead moral issue of our day,''\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\nSam said, ``Just like slavery was the lead moral issue 150 years ago.'' \nSam opposes Roe v. Wade, has a 100-percent pro-life voting record, and \nsponsored numerous bills in support of the unborn.\n  In 1995, Sam was diagnosed and treated for melanoma and it had a \nprofound effect on his life. Sam said:\n\n       With the cancer, I did a lot of internal examination. My \n     conclusion was that if this were to be terminal, at that \n     point in time I would not be satisfied with how I had lived \n     my life. I had tried to be a Christian, but I had failed. . . \n     .\n\n  Surviving cancer, Sam found out just how precious life was, and with \nhis new lease on life, Sam began to devote his life and work in the \nSenate to humanitarian causes around the world. Sam has actively fought \nto bring awareness to the genocide in Darfur. Sam supported the Sudan \nPeace Act of 2002 and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2002. \nIn 2004, Sam visited Darfur to see violence and suffering firsthand, \nand that same year he supported the Congressional Declaration of \nGenocide.\n  In addition to his advocacy work on Sudan, Sam has worked on numerous \nother humanitarian challenges throughout the world, including Iran, \nAfghanistan, Uganda, the Congo, Pakistan, Ukraine, China, North Korea, \nand Vietnam. The Weekly Standard wrote:\n\n       Arguably no Senator has done more to press for human rights \n     and democracy or to confront the spread of deadly disease, \n     such as malaria, which kills 800,000 children in Africa every \n     year.\n\n  In the Senate, Sam has crusaded for his humanitarian causes in a \nbipartisan fashion, including cosponsoring the Iran Democracy Act with \nSenator Evan Bayh, cosponsoring the North Korea Human Rights Act with \nthe late Senator Ted Kennedy, and what Sam calls his greatest \nachievement, cosponsoring the Trafficking in the Victims Protection Act \nwith the late Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  Another one of Sam's passions was his role as chairman of the Senate \nValues Action Team. The group, consisting of outside organizations, met \nweekly to discuss matters of faith, family, and religious freedoms. \nOver the years, they worked together to strategize on efforts to \nprotect the sanctity of life, school choice, and much more. Sam devoted \ncountless hours to this organization and rarely missed a meeting.\n  In the Senate, I relied heavily on Sam's expertise and his \nleadership. He was always someone I looked toward, whether it was for \nguidance or perspective on many different issues. Sam served on \nnumerous committees, including the Appropriations Committee, the Joint \nEconomic Committee, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, and the Senate Special Committee on Aging, as well as \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  In 2008, Sam announced he would honor his pledge to only serve two \nterms in this Chamber. Sam will be missed, but his service to Kansas \nwill continue. Last month, Sam was elected Governor of Kansas with 63 \npercent of the vote, winning 103 of the 105 counties. I wish to \ncongratulate Sam on his impressive victory, and I cannot think of a \nbetter public servant or leader than Sam Brownback for the people of \nKansas.\n  On top of all of Sam's accomplishments, he is a loving husband to \nMary. They met in law school and have been married for 27 years. \nTogether, Mary and Sam have five children, including one adopted from \nGuatemala and one adopted from China. Sam said:\n\n       My family has been personally touched by adoption. My wife \n     and I adopted our two youngest children, and I continue to \n     experience joy from the relationships we have built through \n     our adoption experience.\n\n  I think right there tells us all we need to know about the type of \ncharacter and person Sam Brownback is.\n  Sam, this Chamber honors you today for your service to this Nation, \nto the State of Kansas, and to the millions around the world who dream \nof a better life. Thank you from all of us, and good luck in the next \nchapter of your life.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we have enacted the National Defense \nAuthorization Act every year for the last 48 years. We need to do the \nsame thing this year.\n  This year's bill would continue the increases in compensation and \nquality of life that our service men and women and their families \ndeserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing military \noperations around the world.\n  For example, the bill would extend over 30 types of bonuses and \nspecial pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, reenlistment, and \ncontinued service by active-duty and reserve military personnel.\n  The bill would authorize continued TRICARE coverage for eligible \ndependents of servicemembers up to the age of 26.\n  The bill will improve care for our wounded warriors by addressing \ninequities in rules for involuntary administrative separations based on \nmedical conditions and requiring new education and training programs on \nthe use of pharmaceuticals for patients in wounded warrior units, and \nit will authorize the service secretaries to waive maximum age \nlimitations to enable certain highly qualified enlisted members who \nserved in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom to \nenter the military service academies.\n  The bill would also include important funding and authorities needed \nto provide our troops the equipment and support that they will continue \nto need as long as they remain on the battlefield in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. For example, the bill would enhance the military's ability \nto rapidly acquire and field new capabilities in response to urgent \nneeds on the battlefield by expanding DOD's authority to waive \nstatutory requirements when urgently needed to save lives on the \nbattlefield.\n  The bill will fully fund the President's request for $11.6 billion to \ntrain and equip the Afghan National Army and Afghan police--growing the \ncapabilities of these security forces to prepare them to take over \nincreased responsibilities for Afghanistan's security by the July 2011 \ndate established by the President for the beginning of reductions in \nU.S. forces at that time.\n  The bill will extend for one more year the authority for the \nSecretary of Defense to transfer equipment coming out of Iraq as our \ntroops withdraw to the security forces of Iraq and Afghanistan, \nproviding an important tool for our commanders looking to accelerate \nthe growth and capability of these security forces.\n  The bill also includes important legislative provisions that would \npromote the Department of Defense cybersecurity and energy security \nefforts--two far-reaching initiatives that should help strengthen our \nnational defense and our Nation.\n  If we fail to act on this bill, we will not be able to provide the \nDepartment of Defense with critical new authorities and extensions of \nexisting authorities that it needs to safeguard our national security. \nFor example, without this bill, the Department of Defense will either \nlose the authority it has requested to support counter-drug activities \nof foreign governments, use premium pay to encourage civilian employees \nto accept dangerous assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan, and\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\nprovide assistance to the Yemeni counterterrorism unit. A failure by \nthe Senate to provide these important authorities could have serious \nconsequences for the success or failure of ongoing military operations \naround the world.\n  I recognize this bill includes a handful of contentious provisions on \nwhich there is disagreement in the Senate. Some of those provisions I \nsupport and others I objected to and voted against in committee.\n  One of those provisions is the one that would repeal don't ask, don't \ntell 60 days after the President, the Secretary of Defense, and \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify to Congress that \nimplementation of repeal is consistent with the standards of military \nreadiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and \nretention in the Armed Forces.\n  The Armed Services Committee held two excellent hearings last week to \nconsider the final report of the working group that reviewed the issues \nassociated with the repeal of don't ask, don't tell.\n  The report concluded that allowing gay men and women to serve in the \nU.S. Armed Forces without being forced to conceal their sexual \norientation would present a low risk to the military effectiveness, \neven during a time of war, and that 70 percent of surveyed \nservicemembers believe that the impact on their units would be \npositive, mixed, or of no consequence at all.\n  General Casey, Chief of Staff of the Army, testified that the \npresumption underpinning don't ask, don't tell is that ``the presence \nof a gay or lesbian servicemember in a unit causes an unacceptable risk \nto good order and discipline.'' Then he said, ``After reading this \nreport, I don't believe that's true anymore, and I don't believe a \nsubstantial majority of our soldiers believe that's true.''\n  After considering the report, Secretary of Defense Gates urged \nCongress to pass this legislation this year, so that the repeal of \ndon't ask, don't tell could be implemented in a well-prepared and well-\nconsidered manner, rather than by abrupt judicial fiat, which he \ndescribed as ``by far the most disruptive and damaging scenario [he] \ncan imagine.''\n  To the extent that some of the service chiefs expressed concern about \nthe repeal of don't ask, don't tell, their concerns focused on the \ntiming of the repeal and adequacy of time to prepare for \nimplementation, rather than on repeal itself. Secretary Gates testified \nthat he ``would not make his certification until [he] was satisfied, \nwith the advice of the service chiefs, that we had in fact mitigated, \nif not eliminated to the extent possible, risks to combat readiness, to \nunit cohesion and effectiveness.'' All of the service chiefs testified \nthat they were comfortable with the ability to provide military advice \nto Secretary Gates and have that advice heard.\n  The only method of repeal that places the timing of the repeal and \nthe control of implementation in the hands of the military and the \nDepartment of Defense is the provision contained in this bill. By \ncontrast, if don't ask, don't tell is repealed by a court decision, the \nservice chiefs will have no influence over the timing of repeal or the \nimplementation of the repeal.\n  Despite differing views over this and other provisions where there \nare differences of opinion, we should not deny the Senate the \nopportunity to take up this bill, which is so essential for the men and \nwomen in the military, because we disagree with some provisions of the \nbill. These are legitimate issues for debate, and I believe the Senate \nshould debate this. But the only way we can debate and vote on these \nissues is if the Senate proceeds to the bill. The disputed provisions \ncan be addressed through the amendment process.\n\n  Madam President, as you well know, this is a crucial matter for \nresolution. Our Presiding Officer has played an instrumental role in \ngetting the don't ask, don't tell issue before this body and before the \ncountry. I commend her for that. We need to resolve it. The only way to \nresolve it is to get to the bill.\n  We currently have 50,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \non the ground in Iraq and roughly twice that many in Afghanistan. While \nthere are some issues on which we may disagree, we all know that we \nmust provide our troops with the support they need as long as they \nremain in harm's way. Senate action on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2011 will improve the quality of life \nof our men and women in uniform. It will give them the tools they need \nto remain the most effective fighting force in the world. Most \nimportant of all, it will send an important message that we, as a \nnation, stand behind them and appreciate their service.\n  This bill runs some 850 pages. The House bill--the counterpart bill--\nruns more than a thousand pages. Even if we get 60 votes today to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill, and even if we \nare able to consider amendments and pass this bill in a few days, it \nwill be possibly an insurmountable challenge to work out all of the \ndifferences with the House. Over the last 10 years, it has taken an \naverage of 75 days to conference the Defense authorization bill with \nthe House after we pass it. If we don't proceed on this bill this week, \nthen invoking cloture sometime next week--even if we can do it--would \nbe a symbolic victory. I don't believe there would be enough time to \nhammer out a final bill before the end of the session.\n  I don't believe in symbolic victories. This bill is a victory for the \npeople in uniform. It is essential for the people in uniform. We should \nnot act symbolically in their name and for their sake; we should act in \nreality. But the only way this will be real, and that the repeal of \ndon't ask, don't tell--assuming we continue to keep it in the bill--\nwill be real is if we proceed to this bill this week. We cannot and \nshould not delay this vote any longer.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the time on the \nquorum that I will call for be equally divided between both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak on a bill that the \nChair has spearheaded the charge for--and done it with such hard work \nand determination and commitment and vigor--and that is the bill to \nprovide health care for our 9/11 heroes, those men and women who at a \ntime of war rushed to danger to save lives and protect our freedom.\n  We have met with these brave men and women repeatedly. Some of them \nare suffering already with cancers they acquired for their acts of \nbravery. Others know it is an almost certainty that they will come down \nwith similar diseases and illnesses that are extremely costly to fight.\n  Madam President, we have had a grand tradition in America: Those who \nrisk their lives to protect us and volunteer to do it under no \ncompunction, we remember them when they get hurt in that brave \nendeavors. We do it for our veterans and we should be doing it for our \n9/11 heroes--the first responders, the police, the firefighters, the \nEMT workers, the construction workers, and the ordinary citizens who \nrushed into danger at a time when no one knew how many people might be \nliving and entrapped in those collapsed towers.\n  I plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, this \nshould not be a moment of politics. One can come up with reason after \nreason why not to vote for this bill, and we have heard many and the \nreasons keep changing. But one fact doesn't change: There are those who \nneed help and who deserve our help--from New York, New Jersey, \nConnecticut, and from every other State of the Union. To them, a \nparliamentary decision that we can't vote on this because there is \nanother bill we want to vote on first, because we would change this or \nthat, is going to ring very hollow.\n  This should not be a partisan issue. This should be an issue where \nAmerica unites. When it comes to helping our veterans, we are united. \nThat is not a Democratic or Republican issue. That\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nis not a northeast or southwest issue. It is an issue of being an \nAmerican. This vote is about being an American because from the days at \nBunker Hill, when the patriots put down their plows and took up muskets \nto defend and create our freedom, we have always tried to take care of \nthem, and we have done it better and better for our veterans. The \nheroes of 9/11 are no different.\n  So I beg, I plead, I implore two brave colleagues from the other side \nto join us. Put aside the political considerations. Remember what these \npeople did for us. You have seen them when they have visited your \noffices, the suffering, all for an act of voluntary heroism. They are \nnot asking for welfare. They are not asking for a huge handout. They \nare simply asking that they be able to meet the high health care costs \nthat occur when you develop cancers and other illnesses because \nparticles of glass and cement and other materials get lodged in your \nlungs or your gastrointestinal tract.\n  So this is our last call. It is a plea. We will keep at this, but \ntoday is the day to step to the plate. I urge my colleagues to please \nsupport those brave men and women who were there for us--for America. \nDo not come up with an excuse as to why you cannot do it. We have \nmarched and marched and marched, and this is the finish line. Help us \nget over it, please.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak on the two pending \nvotes before the Senate. First, I wish to follow my distinguished \ncolleague from New York, whose comments I want to echo regarding the \nPresiding Officer, who has made this one of her passions. She picked it \nup when I first introduced the James Zadroga Act and then took it up \nwhen she came to the Senate and has done a magnificent job and brought \nus to this moment.\n  Jim Zadroga was a New Jerseyan who spent 450 hours at the World Trade \nCenter site--a New York City police officer who simply had a paper mask \non as his only protection. He and so many others who answered on that \nfateful day did not question their personal security, did not give it a \nsecond thought. They did not think about their health, did not think \nabout the potential consequences that would flow from the exposure to \nwhich they were subjecting themselves. They thought only about \nresponding, saving lives, and meeting the Nation's need--the Nation's \nneed, not New York's need. For Jim Zadroga and so many others, the \nconsequence of that selflessness has been enormous. In many cases, they \nhave died. In other cases, they have serious life-threatening \nillnesses. In other cases, they have real disabilities as a result of \nthose illnesses.\n  I remember on that day, after the attacks on September 11, how we \ncame together on the Capitol steps and we declared our commitment of \nlove of country and a commitment to those who died on that fateful day, \nto their families, and to those who responded. I remember the \nincredible words--glowing, soaring--that were spoken about the bravery \nof those men and women who responded from all over the country.\n  Those who are the victims of the exposure they received on the ground \non September 11 come from every State in the Union. This is not simply \na New York issue or a New Jersey issue, where so many of our first \nresponders came from. These are individuals who came from across the \ncountry, who came together as Americans to respond on that fateful day. \nThis requires each and every one of us in the Senate to respond to all \nof those Americans from every State who ultimately find themselves, \nthrough their selflessness, exposed to life-threatening illnesses. A \ngrateful nation not only joins together in commemoration on September \n11 of each year but a grateful nation shows its gratitude to those who \nanswered the call without concern for their well-being by how we take \ncare of their health care, how we take care of their disabilities, and \nhow we take care of the families of those who ultimately lost their \nlives in service to the country.\n  This is no different than the men and women who wear the uniform of \nthe United States and go abroad to defend the Nation. These men and \nwomen wore uniforms too. Some of them wore the uniform of a police \nofficer, some of them wore the uniform of a firefighter, some wore the \nuniform of emergency management personnel. Some of them, ultimately, \nwere first-aid squads. But all of them on those fateful days wore a \nuniform that served the Nation. How can the Nation forget them now? \nThat is what this vote is all about.\n\n  I cannot accept as a moral equivalent that some oath not to vote on \nthose who serve the country, risk their lives, cannot take place \nbecause of some vote on some tax issue. No one in the Nation would \nbelieve that it is OK to say: I will not vote to give relief to the \nhealth of those individuals who sacrificed their health on September 11 \nand the days after because I have to wait for some pending tax vote.\n  Go back to the men and women who serve this country and look at them \nin their eyes and tell them it is some vote that we are waiting for on \ntaxes that determines whether their health needs will be responded to. \nShameless. I can't wait to see, when one of us stands for one of those \npictures on the commemoration of September 11, the comments about how \nheroic those individuals were but cannot cast a simple vote.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Finally, I want to move to the question of the DREAM Act. On the \nDREAM Act, the House of Representatives took a critical step yesterday \nin making a reality of the dreams and hopes and aspirations of young \npeople who know nothing but this country as their country. They made no \nchoices in their lives to come to the United States. Those choices were \nmade by their parents. All they know is that they stand every day as \nyoung students and pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States \nof America. All they know is the national anthem of the United States. \nAll they know is they worked hard and became salutatorians, \nvaledictorians, and done everything we expect of any one of us, \nparticularly of our children, to try to excel and exceed. \nOverwhelmingly, they have excelled and exceeded. Yet their dream of \nbeing able to continue to exceed and excel on behalf of the Nation is \nblunted by the fact that they have an undocumented status in this \ncountry through no fault of their own.\n  The DREAM Act says if you are willing to wear the uniform and serve \nin the Armed Forces of the United States, and you serve honorably for 2 \nyears, we will give you a pathway toward permanent residency. If you go \nto college--assuming that you ultimately qualify, that you are \naccepted, and that you do well--we will give you a pathway to permanent \nresidency. We will adjust your status and permit that dream to take \nplace.\n  This is not amnesty. Amnesty--which I have heard some of my \ncolleagues use, and they will use it on anything that is immigration \nrelated. Right away they roll out the word ``amnesty.'' Amnesty is when \nyou get something for nothing; when you did something wrong and you \nhave to pay no consequence. In this case I believe wearing the uniform \nof the U.S. Armed Forces, risking your life for your country, maybe \nlosing that life before you achieve your goal and your dream, is not \namnesty. I believe working hard and being educated so you can help fuel \nthe Nation's prosperity and meet its economic challenge, that is not \namnesty. That is paying your dues on behalf of the country. For if you \ndo all of that, you still have to wait a decade before your status can \nbe adjusted to permanent residency. So you have to be an exemplary \ncitizen, you have to do everything that is right, everything we cherish \nin America. That is what the DREAM Act is all about and that is why the \nSecretary of Defense has come out in strong support of the DREAM Act. \nThat is why Colin Powell came out in support of the DREAM Act. That is \nwhy the Under Secretary, Personnel and Readiness at the Department of \nDefense during the Bush administration, David Chu, came out and said \nthis is, in essence, the very effort we would like to see.\n\n       [For] many of these young people . . . the DREAM Act would \n     provide the opportunity of serving the United States in \n     uniform.\n\n  Moreover, university presidents, respected education associations, \nleading Fortune 500 businesses, such as Microsoft, also support this \nlegislation. Mike Huckabee explained the economic sense of allowing \nundocumented children to earn their way.\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\n  Let's not stop young men and women who know only this country as \ntheir country, who made no choices on their own. Let's be family-\nfriendly. Let's observe the values. Let's pass the DREAM Act today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask to be notified after 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the military has a very fine program \nnow that allows people legally and illegally in the United States to \njoin the military and put themselves on a pathway to citizenship. The \nfact is, in this bill, as it is going to work out in reality, 95 \npercent, probably 98 percent of the people who take advantage of this \namnesty that puts them on a guaranteed path to citizenship will do so \nby claiming they have a high school degree. They can be up to 30 years \nof age. They claim they have a high school degree and then do 2 years \nof community college or even correspondence college work. That is where \nthis huge loophole is and that is why we will have 1 to 2 million \npeople who are going to seek protection under this act.\n  What is this about? The American people understand it. They have \ntried to tell this Congress, but the Congress and the political \nleadership refuse to listen. What they are saying is do not continue to \nreward illegality. Do not continue to provide benefits for people who \nviolated our law, please. The first thing you do is don't reward it. \nThe second thing you want to do is to end the mass illegality that is \noccurring in our country--600,000 people were arrested last year trying \nto enter our country illegally at the border--600,000. This is a huge \nproblem.\n  This administration sued Arizona when it tried to do something about \nit. They have ended workplace raids that would have identified people \nwho were working illegally and provide Americans an opportunity to have \na job. This bill will cost $5 billion according to the CBO. It is not \ngoing to pay for itself, and it allows people with two misdemeanors--if \nyou only have two misdemeanors you can apply. Many people, if you know \nmuch about the law enforcement system in the country, plead to lesser \noffenses when they really are guilty of more serious offenses. A lot of \nthese misdemeanors are very serious offenses themselves. They will be \ngiven the advantage of this act.\n  It is not set up for military, it is not set up for valedictorians \nand salutatorians, it is not set up for people going to Harvard. It is \nset up for people who have come into the country, can be brought in \nillegally as a teenager, they go to high school--they have to be \naccepted. They get a GED or get a high school degree, and they apply \nand have a safe harbor in our country indefinitely.\n  I introduced yesterday a chart showing a Google page with a whole \nlong list of places you can order false high school diplomas, false \ntranscripts, false GED certificates. There are no people funded to \ninvestigate any of this. People are going to walk in and say: I am 30 \nyears old and I came at age 16. I'm in.\n  Who is going to go out and investigate that? Nobody is. There is no \nfunding to do it, and there is no plan to do it. It is a major \nloophole.\n  But, fundamentally, I would say this Nation will be prepared, as a \nnation, to wrestle with and try to do the right thing about people who \nhave been here a long time and who came here as a young person. But let \nme tell you, not until this country brings the lawlessness to an end, \nthat is what the American people have told us unequivocally. They shut \ndown our switchboards with so many phone calls not too long ago when we \ntried to pass amnesty here. We do not need to do this. Why don't we do \nthe responsible thing?\n  Finally, let me say this illegality can be ended. It is within our \ngrasp if we have leadership from the top and leadership in the Congress \nand leadership from the President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I say we have not had that \nleadership. What happens 3 years from now when we have another group \nthat has come illegally at age 15 or 16 because they have seen what \nhappens to the ones who came before? Are we then going to say they \ndon't get amnesty? No. We will have lost the moral high ground, the \nright, responsible effort to have a lawful system in America. We are \nsurrendering to it if we vote for this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to engage in a \ncolloquy with my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. As Members of this body know, for the past 9 months I \nhave come to the floor every week to offer a doctor's second opinion on \nthe new health care law. I do this as someone who has practiced \nmedicine, taken care of families around the State of Wyoming for a \nquarter of a century.\n  Each week I repeatedly criticize another one of the unintended \nconsequences of this health care law, a law that I think is bad for \npatients, bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who take care \nof those patients--and bad for the taxpayers.\n  Americans heard how this law breaks most of the President's promises \nabout health care reform. That is why, on election day, Americans \nacross our country spoke out. They called on Washington to work to \nrepeal and replace this law. The Republicans have answered. We realize \nwe cannot just object to the law, we must do our best to repeal and \nreplace it. That is why I am delighted this morning to be joined on the \nfloor by Senator Wicker from Mississippi. He is joining me to talk \nabout his new bill that he is introducing today that will allow State \nofficials to challenge Federal regulations before these regulations \nactually go into effect. This will allow States to fight back against \noutrageous health care regulations that continue to be written.\n  With that, I would like to ask my colleague if he would please share \nwith the body and with the country the remarkable bill that he is \nintroducing today.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, a \npracticing physician in his own right. I thank my friend for repeatedly \ncoming to the floor and simply bringing the facts to the attention of \nour membership and to the American people.\n  This was an unpopular piece of legislation when we were considering \nit. We wasted most of a year when we should have been talking about job \ncreation and the economy, talking about the overhaul of our entire \nhealth care system with the ObamaCare proposal. It was unpopular when \nit was enacted. It was unpopular when it was signed into law. We saw \nthat in election after election, the two elections in New Jersey and \nVirginia. We saw it in spades in the Massachusetts election where it \nwas the central issue. But this Congress persisted against the will of \nthe American people.\n  Because of the facts as presented by Dr. Barrasso and also the facts \nthat are coming to light as the people are finding out in their own \nlives with their own insurance policies, this law is even more \nunpopular and more unsatisfactory than it was at the very beginning, \nand it should be repealed lock, stock, and barrel. It should be \ndefunded and it should be replaced by something market driven and \nsomething workable.\n  In an additional attempt to address this very wrongheaded piece of \nlegislation, a few moments ago I introduced the Tenth Amendment \nRegulatory Reform Act. To remind my colleagues, the tenth amendment to \nthe Constitution explicitly states:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  This amendment, this part of the Bill of Rights, expressly limits the \npowers of the Federal Government for important reasons.\n  When we look back to the early days of the United States, it is clear \nthat the Founding Fathers believed in a limited Federal Government, \nhaving just defeated a monarchy with near absolute power. Our Founders \nsought a different way of governing, one based on controlled size and \nscope.\n  Our Founding Fathers repeatedly stated their opposition to a Federal\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\nGovernment with expansive powers. In Federalist No. 45, James Madison \nwrote:\n\n       The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the \n     Federal Government are few and defined.\n\n  When have we heard that last?\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Those which are to remain in State government are numerous \n     and indefinite.\n\n  This may come as a surprise to people who have viewed the Congress of \nthe United States in the past few years. Madison wrote, ``few and \ndefined.'' Dispute this fact, congressional limits on the Federal \nGovernment are rarely enforced today. I hope to change this through my \nlegislation.\n  Federal agencies routinely usurp the rights of States by promulgating \nregulations that are contrary to the spirit and the letter of the 10th \namendment to the Constitution. The Code of Federal Regulations now \ntotals an expansive 163,333 pages. While some of the rules contained in \nit are necessary, many of them simply are not--adding burdens, \nheadaches, and costs for millions of Americans and forcing unnecessary \nFederal spending at a time when the United States borrows 40 cents for \neach dollar we spend. These rules and regulations also take power from \nStates and they take power from individual Americans. This bill would \nallow States to challenge unconstitutional mandates before these \nmandates take effect.\n  Much of the new health care law gives unelected bureaucrats the power \nto write rules and regulations required to implement ObamaCare. \nOverall, the new health care law creates 159 bureaucracies, according \nto a study by the Joint Economic Council. Countless Federal regulations \nwill have to be written to implement the law.\n  A requirement for Americans to purchase government-approved health \ninsurance--a central piece of ObamaCare--explicitly oversteps the 10th \namendment. Under no other circumstances do we force individuals to pay \nfor something they may not want or cannot afford, simply because they \nare Americans, which is what this law attempts to do.\n  Many rules and regulations will be required to implement this \nprovision. According to one analysis, the Internal Revenue Service will \nneed to hire 16,000 new IRS employees to enforce this individual \nmandate. Each of those bureaucrats will be governed by agency rules \ncreated in the coming months and years, and we read in the paper today \nthat it may even be decades before all of these rules will be created.\n  Once these regulations are written, it will again require costly and \ntime-consuming court proceedings to overturn them. Instead of forcing \nthe American people to wait for a remedy, we should have agencies \naddress these problems at the outset. This bill would go a long way \ntoward doing that. It would provide special standing for designated \nState government officials to dispute regulations issued by \nadministration agencies attempting to implement new Federal laws or \nPresidential Executive orders. Under the legislation, any rule proposed \nby a Federal agency would be subject to constitutional challenges if \ncertain State officials determine the rule infringes on powers reserved \nto the States under the 10th amendment.\n  States are already challenging the massive Federal takeover in court \nbecause of the mandates on both States and individuals. I am proud to \nsay that 43 of the 50 States have either joined lawsuits or taken other \nofficial action to stop its unconstitutional provisions. This bill \nwould give State officials another tool at their disposal to challenge \nthe unconstitutional overreach of the Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this legislation. It is late in \nthis Congress, but there is another one looming with reinforcements \ncoming from the people.\n  I appreciate my colleague allowing me to join him today in this \ndiscussion of a doctor's second opinion.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I am very impressed by what the Senator have come \nup with. This leadership position takes that next step forward to \nprotect our rights that he and I believe are in the Constitution and \napply to the people of our States and apply to the people of this \ncountry.\n  One would hope everyone would join in, and I ask unanimous consent to \nbe added as an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The Senator mentioned the unelected bureaucrats in our \ncomments. There was a story today in the New York Times. I would like \nto ask a couple of questions of the Senator from that story because I \nthink it gets to the point he is making. This was by Eric Lichtblau and \nRobert Pear.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this story from today's New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 8, 2010]\n\n               Washington Rule Makers Out of the Shadows\n\n                  (By Eric Lichtblau and Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington.--Federal rule makers, long the neglected \n     stepchildren of Washington bureaucrats, suddenly find \n     themselves at the center of power as they scramble to work \n     out details of hundreds of sweeping financial and health care \n     regulations that will ultimately affect most Americans.\n       In Bethesda, Md., more than 200 health regulators working \n     on complicated insurance rules have taken over three floors \n     of a suburban office building, paying almost double the \n     market rate for the space in their rush to get started.\n       Executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been \n     meeting almost daily with financial rule makers to air \n     concerns about regulations they say threaten to curtail \n     commerce.\n       And at the White House, senior officials receive several \n     status reports a week on a process that all sides agree has \n     vast implications for the country as a whole and for the \n     Obama administration's political fortunes.\n       The boom in rule-making--the bureaucratic term for the \n     nitty-gritty of drafting regulations--is a result of the \n     mega-bills approved by Congress this year at the urging of \n     President Obama: the health care bill signed into law in \n     March, and the financial overhaul law signed in July.\n       ``There has never been a period like what we are going \n     through now, in terms of the sheer volume and complexity of \n     rule-making,'' said Paul Dennett, senior vice president of \n     the American Benefits Council, a trade group for large \n     employers.\n       And what was already shaping up as a rancorous lobbying \n     battle over the rules is likely to become more contentious \n     when Republicans take control of the House, having been swept \n     to power on a pledge to influence health care and financial \n     regulation.\n       At the very least, Republicans will be able to hold public \n     hearings to spotlight financial regulations they see as too \n     restrictive and health care rules they see as too disruptive, \n     and they could pressure regulators to soften them.\n       The debate over federal spending has already slowed the \n     development of financial rules, as hundreds of new rule-\n     making positions have gone unfilled because of a lack of new \n     financing.\n       Congress provided a road map for measures aimed broadly at \n     getting more Americans covered by health insurance and \n     providing more federal safeguards against risky financial \n     practices. But the laws were so broad and complex that \n     executive-branch regulators have wide leeway in determining \n     what the rules should say and how they should be carried out.\n       In all, the bills call for drafting more than 300 separate \n     rules on a rolling schedule by about 2014, plus dozens of \n     other studies and periodic reports. That may be only the \n     beginning. A recent report from the Congressional Research \n     Service said the publication of rules under the health care \n     law could stretch out for decades to come.\n       Regulators at various agencies are trying to answer \n     questions like these:\n       How much should a credit-card company be able to charge a \n     shopkeeper for administrative fees when you swipe your card \n     for a purchase?\n       Which types of financial companies are so ``systemically \n     important'' to the overall economy that they should be \n     subject to greater federal oversight?\n       What services must be covered by all insurers as part of \n     the ``essential health benefits'' package? And at what point \n     would an increase in an insurer's premiums be considered so \n     ``unreasonable'' that state and federal regulators could step \n     in?\n       These and many other questions are now in the hands of \n     government lawyers, doctors, bankers, accountants, actuaries \n     and other regulatory specialists. With the rules spread \n     across agencies, no one is certain how many employees are \n     working on them, but the number is certainly in the hundreds \n     or higher.\n       At the Federal Reserve, for instance, most of more than 50 \n     lawyers in the legal division are now spending significant \n     parts of their days on rule-making issues, like the question \n     of how to carry out and enforce the so-called Volcker Rule, \n     named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, \n     restricting banks from making certain types of speculative \n     investments.\n       No longer are these considered arcane questions that draw \n     scrutiny only from the few Washingtonians who read the \n     ``notices of\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\n     proposed rule-making'' in the Federal Register.\n       These days, the rule makers are attracting attention from \n     Congressional officials, industry advocates and lobbyists, \n     with dozens of executives from firms like Goldman Sachs, \n     Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse meeting with \n     federal regulators recently to give input on specific rules \n     and try to influence the outcome, according to public online \n     postings by federal regulators on many of the meetings.\n       ``I wake up in the morning thinking about this stuff, and I \n     go to sleep at night thinking about it,'' said Tom Quaadman, \n     a senior Chamber of Commerce executive who is leading a group \n     of 10 staff members seeking to shape the financial rules.\n       The discussions are in the early stages.\n       But though all sides talk of finding consensus, conflicts \n     have emerged.\n       The Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, made \n     up of leading chief executives, are suing the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission, arguing that a rule giving proxy access \n     on corporate boards to small shareholders did not get a \n     proper review and would undermine companies.\n       When these issues still rested with Congress this year, the \n     chamber spent millions on glitzy advertisements opposing the \n     health care and financial regulation. The chamber does not \n     plan anything so showy as the debate shifts to the regulatory \n     agencies, but is bracing for a long fight filled with low-key \n     meetings and court filings.\n       ``It's a substantial amount of resources we've brought to \n     bear on this,'' Mr. Quaadman said. ``We've always seen this \n     as being a marathon. This is a process that's going to take \n     years, and this is the start of the race.''\n       The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by \n     Congress as part of the financial overhaul, has been the \n     target of particularly intense lobbying, with industry \n     representatives and consumer advocates trying to shape the \n     agency's structure and mission.\n       Questions about the agency's allegiances have already \n     arisen, however, after it was disclosed that Elizabeth \n     Warren, the White House aide chosen to start up the agency, \n     had worked as a consultant on a lawsuit involving major banks \n     and credit-card companies and that one of her senior aides \n     had worked previously at a mortgage company with a spotty \n     record.\n       So far, health care regulators have a head start on their \n     financial counterparts. They not only started the process \n     four months earlier when the health care bill passed \n     Congress, but they also have the advantage of already \n     securing start-up funds for rule-making personnel and office \n     space.\n       In Bethesda, health care officials are leasing more than \n     70,000 square feet of space on three floors of an office \n     building for about 230 employees to work on rule-making and \n     other duties. The government agreed to pay $51.41 per usable \n     square foot of space, compared with an average of $27 in \n     Bethesda, because it wanted to get the operation running in \n     July, officials said.\n       In contrast, financial regulators have been unable to get \n     new financing for hundreds of additional rule makers because \n     Congress has not yet passed a budget, and they are largely \n     making do by reassigning existing staff members. Officials at \n     agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which \n     is responsible for drafting more than 60 rules, are warning \n     that there is an urgent need for the money.\n       Annette L. Nazareth, a former S.E.C. official who now \n     represents financial clients before rule makers as a lawyer \n     for the firm of Davis Polk, said short staffing and ``wildly \n     unrealistic'' deadlines set by Congress threatened the entire \n     process.\n       ``These regulators are overwhelmed, and this stuff is being \n     churned out on issues that are enormously complex,'' Ms. \n     Nazareth said. ``It's very bad for the markets to do it this \n     way, and it's bound to have an impact on how things come \n     out.''\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It talks about Federal rulemakers. That is whom I \nbelieve we are talking about, these unelected bureaucrats.\n\n       Federal rule makers, long the neglected stepchildren of \n     Washington bureaucrats, suddenly find themselves at the \n     center of power--\n\n  The bureaucrats--\n\n     as they scramble to work out details of hundreds of sweeping \n     financial and health care regulations that will ultimately \n     affect most Americans.\n\n  We are talking about not just the health care law but also the \nfinancial regulations.\n  The one part I want to ask the Senator about says:\n\n       But the laws were so broad and complex that executive-\n     branch regulators will have wide leeway in determining what \n     the rules should say and how they should be carried out.\n\n  Well, isn't that why we need this piece of legislation--to let the \nStates get in there before some of these rules and regulations are put \nonto the people of Mississippi, the people of Wyoming, the people all \nacross the country?\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. And this coming \nfrom the New York Times in particular, this article is an astounding \nbit of information for the American people, and they need to know about \nit. I think the American people have the quaint idea that their elected \nofficials, both in the executive branch and in the legislative branch, \nshould be the center of power. I did not come to Washington to be \npowerful. But at least I have to stand before my constituents every so \noften and get their approval. What this article says is that the \nbureaucrats are now at the center of power because of this ObamaCare \nlegislation and the financial services legislation.\n  We have enacted, over my vote and over the vote of the Senator from \nWyoming, a 2,700-page health care overhaul. Yet we are told the main \nthing it does is empower bureaucrats and make them the decisionmakers. \nCertainly, if this is the result of this unfortunate piece of \nlegislation, a Governor or a speaker of the house of representatives at \nthe State level ought to be able to quickly and expeditiously go to \nFederal court and say: Wait a minute, this violates the 10th amendment. \nAll we are saying is that they need a path to go quickly to the Federal \ncourts and challenge this.\n  I am sure the Senator noticed this--this is just one example. In \nneighboring Bethesda, MD, this new ObamaCare law has resulted in 200 \nhealth regulators rushing to a new facility there and paying twice the \nfair market value. This is Uncle Sugar coming in. They can pay as much \nmoney as they want. So they pay twice the fair market value in rent, \nand they have taken over three floors of a suburban office building to \nbegin getting started on actually writing the rules that will apply \nthis Federal mandate to the people. It is amazing.\n  You know, actually, I will say this to my friend: When we talk about \ndefunding the Federal Government, I would like for our Appropriations \nCommittees, our investigative committees, both House and Senate, to \nlook at how they got the right to pay twice the fair market value.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it is astonishing. I know the people of Wyoming \nas well as the people of Mississippi always oppose Washington's \nwasteful spending, but when I read that the health care officials are \nleasing more than 70,000 square feet of space on three floors of this \noffice building in Bethesda for 230 employees, rushing to rulemaking, \nand see that the government--Washington--agreed to pay over $51 per \nusable square foot, compared with the average of less than $30 a square \nfoot in Bethesda--why? Because it wanted to get the operation running \nin July. They were rushing to get to this.\n  But it says that this may only be the beginning. This may only be the \nbeginning. A recent report--not by my colleague from Mississippi and \nnot by me but by the Congressional Research Service--says that the \npublication of rules under the health care law could stretch out for \ndecades to come.\n  That is why I am going to cosponsor this legislation. I have great \nconcern about States rights and individual rights being trampled on by \na Washington government that is out of control in terms of spending, \nand it is doing it in spite of the cries of the American people.\n  So I congratulate and compliment my colleague from Mississippi for \nbringing this piece of legislation to the Senate today and thank him \nfor joining me on the floor as part of a doctor's second opinion \nbecause you don't have to be a doctor to know that this health care law \nis not good for patients, it is not good for providers, it is not good \nfor taxpayers. As more and more people see the rules and the \nregulations come, they will once again see the broken promises by this \nPresident, who said: If you like your health care program, you get to \nkeep it, and then they turn 2 pages in the rules and regulations into \n121 pages which said, for many people in this country, they are not \ngoing to be able to keep what they have, they are not going to be able \nto keep what has been promised them, and it is because the rules and \nthe regulations are so complicated. And the rulemaking continues.\n  Mr. WICKER. If I might add, this is really a new chapter in the \nhistory of the American Federal Government. According to the senior \nvice president of the American Benefits Council:\n\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\n\n       There has never been a period like what we are going \n     through now, in terms of the sheer volume and complexity of \n     rule-making.\n\n  My friend, this is unprecedented in American history. The scope, the \ncost, the magnitude of this legislation is unprecedented, according to \nthe American Benefits Council. And the point of my bill is that that \ndoes violence to the Bill of Rights, it does violence to the intent of \nthe Founding Fathers that the Federal Government be limited in its \npower and scope and that we leave most of the rights we are endowed \nwith by our creators to the people and to the States themselves. So it \nis a great privilege to join my colleague today in making this point.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. With that, I thank and congratulate my colleague for \nhis vision and his foresight and his leadership because this is, I \nbelieve, how the Founding Fathers would have seen it. I believe those \nwho wrote the Constitution would be on board with this piece of \nlegislation to say, as the 10th amendment does say, ``The powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by \nit to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \npeople.''\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to strongly urge my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to oppose cloture on the so-\ncalled DREAM Act. That will be one of our votes in a few minutes. All \nthese votes are important. That is the most important.\n  The reasons we should oppose cloture are simple and basic. They all \ngo to this past election. They all ask the question: Have we been \nlistening at all to the American people? The American people have been \nspeaking loudly and clearly on issues that pertain to the DREAM Act. I \npoint to three in particular.\n  No. 1, the DREAM Act is a major amnesty provision. There are no two \nways about it. It grants at least 2.1 million illegals amnesty. It puts \nthem on a path toward citizenship, which will also allow them to have \ntheir family members put in legal status. That means when we count all \nthose people, there are probably two to three times that initial 2.1 \nmillion people who will be granted some form of amnesty. When we are \nnot securing our borders adequately, when we are not putting a system \nin place to enforce workplace security, that is absolutely wrong.\n  No. 2, we are in the middle of a serious recession. The American \npeople are hurting. Things such as slots at public colleges and \nuniversities, things such as financial aid for those positions are very \nscarce and very sought after, more than ever before, because of the \nhorrible state of the economy. These young illegals who would be \ngranted amnesty would be put in direct competition with American \ncitizens for those scarce resources. Are we listening to the American \npeople about the struggles they are going through right now in this \ndesperate economy? If we do that, the answer would clearly be no.\n  Third, what about spending and debt? The American people have been \nspeaking to us loudly and clearly about that. Yet the DREAM Act would \nincrease spending and deficit and debt. Would we be listening to the \nAmerican people about that, were we to pass the DREAM Act? Absolutely \nnot. The DREAM Act has at least $5 billion of unpaid-for spending in \nit, by all reasonable estimates. If we grant amnesty to 2.1 million \npeople and then down the road we double or triple that when counting \nfamily members, of course, there is cost to that in terms of Federal \nGovernment benefits and programs and spending. Reasonable estimates say \nthat is at least $5 billion of cost, unpaid for, increasing spending, \nincreasing deficit, increasing debt. If we did that by passing the \nDREAM Act, would we be listening to the American people? Absolutely \nnot.\n  Let's come to the Senate Chamber and perform our first and most \nsolemn duty, which is to listen to the American people, listen to the \ncitizens of the States, and truly represent them in this important \nbody. Let's listen to them when they say no amnesty. Let's listen to \nthem when they say how difficult their lives are in this horrible \neconomy. Let's listen to them when they say control spending and \ndeficit and debt. Don't increase it yet again.\n  I propose we listen to them. I will listen to them and vote no on \ncloture on the DREAM Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said this morning when the Senate came \ninto session, the House passed, late last night, the DREAM Act. I have \nasked consent from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nvitiate the cloture vote, and that was not granted this morning, which \nI think is unfortunate because it is a waste of the Senate's time \nbecause we need to act on a piece of legislation that is already \npassed, so that when we pass it, it would go directly to the President.\n  We have been told by my Republican colleagues that they are not \nwilling to do any legislative business, which I think is untoward and \nunnecessary and unfair. But that is where they are. So that being the \ncase, Mr. President, I would again renew my request that we vitiate the \nvote on cloture that is pending before the Senate at this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, hearing the objection, I move to table the \nmotion to proceed to S. 3992, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 847.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the benefit of Senators, I have had a \nnumber of discussions with the Republican leader, and we hope we can \nvery quickly lay down the tax bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my friend yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding that it is complete and ready \nand, actually, we could move to that very soon--within the next hour or \nso.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee gave a speech on the Senate floor. I have such admiration and \nrespect for Senator Levin. He does such a wonderful job protecting \nAmerica in so many different ways, not only as chairman of that \nimportant Armed Services Committee but on the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations and all the other things he does. But he gave a speech \ntoday saying that if we don't get on the Defense bill today, we will \nnot get it done this year.\n  So in the next little bit I am going to make a decision whether I am \ngoing to reconsider the vote on that bill, and I want everyone to know \nthat is what I am going to do. I have a longer presentation I have \nworked on to make that presentation, but before getting into a lot of \ndetail on this, I just want to say I appreciate everyone's help on \nthis--Senator Levin, Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins,--those who \nhave worked with me in trying to see some way to get this completed. \nBut I will make that decision in the next little bit.\n  So having said that, we will have more information later as to what \nthe rest of the week holds as far as votes. If we are able to lay down \nthe tax bill early today--and, of course, I have had a number of \nrequests. Some people want something in it; some people want something \nout of it. But that notwithstanding, one of the most important things \nwe need to do, as I have been told, is we have to make sure people \ndon't think they are jammed--a word I just picked up from Senator Kyl--\non this legislation. We have to make sure people have the opportunity \nto read it.\n  That being the case, I will confer with my friend, the Republican \nleader, to find out what that means.\n  But let's assume we brought this to the floor and immediately filed \ncloture on it. That would mean a Saturday cloture vote. We will see \nwhat we can do to make sure people believe they have had an opportunity \nto look at the legislation and to make a considered decision on what \nshould be done with their vote on this very important piece of \nlegislation. So as far as future votes--stay tuned.\n  I heard one of my colleagues say over here, we are in a normal \nsituation in the Senate--a state of flux.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8669-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, there used to be a very strong \ntradition in the Senate that every new Senator gave a maiden speech, \nand in that tradition some Senators waited as long as a year before \nthey gave the speech. Then, when the time came, the more senior \nSenators would gather and take notes and then critique the newcomer on \nhow well he did.\n  Life has changed a good deal. I never gave a maiden speech. I plunged \nright into the debate when I got here. Now the tradition seems to be to \ngive a farewell speech. So I am grateful to my colleagues who will \ngather for this occasion as I contemplate saying farewell to the \nSenate. But I will warn them, this is probably not my last speech. I \nintend to be heavily involved in the debate over whether we pass a \ncontinuing resolution or an omnibus bill.\n  I have a history with the Senate, and it began when I was a teenager \nas a summer intern. I remember sitting in the gallery and watching Bob \nTaft prowl across the back of the Senate, watching to make sure things \nwere going according to his desire. He had been the majority leader. He \nhad stepped down from that position because of the cancer he had \ncontracted, but he was still paying attention to this body where he \nserved with such distinction.\n\n  Lyndon Johnson was sprawled out with his lanky frame at the \nDemocratic leader's desk, and I was watching from the gallery, thinking \nwhat an extraordinary place this was.\n  Ten years later, I came back as a staffer, and I served here. I was \nsitting in my cubicle in the Dirksen Building when word came that John \nF. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. We didn't know whether he was dead. \nWe all rushed over to the Senate, where there was a ticker tape back in \nthe back lobby, to see what was happening. I rushed in with the others \nto see what was there and then looked to see whom I had jostled aside \nin order to get to see the ticker tape. It was Mike Mansfield. I \nquietly withdrew, realizing I had done something that was not \nappropriate on that occasion.\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\n  But I was here in Washington when Martin Luther King gave his ``I \nHave a Dream'' speech. I was here as a staffer when the historic civil \nrights bill of 1964 was passed and was involved in the drafting of that \nbill at a very low kind of level and the conflict that occurred on that \noccasion.\n  Then I came back into government as the head of the congressional \nrelations function for a Cabinet-level department and worked with \nSenator Dirksen in trying to pursue the Nixon administration's goals \nforward and ran into a bright young Senator from Kansas with a sharp \nwit named Bob Dole and had the opportunity of working with Dirksen and \nDole and the others in that situation.\n  Watergate came along. I was given the dubious honor of being called \nto testify by a young Senator from Tennessee named Howard Baker. He \nassigned me to his staffer, who grilled me for 3 hours under oath--a \nfellow by the name of Fred Thompson.\n  There are great kinds of memories there. I did not realize I would \ncome back to the Senate myself, and as a political junky, what could be \nbetter? I was involved in the debate, I had access to all of the \nactivity, and they even gave me a vote. It was a great time, a great \nopportunity, and I have enjoyed it immensely and say farewell to it \nwith kind of mixed feelings.\n  What have I learned out of all of this, both that past history and my \nown history in the Senate? I will not bore you with all of the things I \nhave learned, but I have picked out several I want to highlight here \ntoday.\n  The first thing I have learned is that this is, indeed, an \nextraordinary place filled with extraordinary people. And the \ncaricature we get from the press and the movies and other places that \nthis is filled with people who have self-serving agendas and very low \nstandards of ethics is simply not true. The Senate is filled with \npeople with the highest standard of ethics--we have a few clunkers, I \nwill admit that, but overall the highest standard of ethics the \nAmerican people could want.\n  If I may dip back into my history to give you this example of how \nmuch better the present Senate is than some of the older ones, I \nremember that when I was prowling the halls in the circumstances I have \ndescribed, I ran into a friend who was distraught.\n  I said to him: What is the problem?\n  He said: I am taking a group of schoolchildren through the Capitol, \nand I sent a note in to a Senator to ask him if he would come out and \nspeak to them. And he did, and he is drunk. I can't get him to stop and \nget the schoolchildren back to the tour, and I don't know what to do.\n  You don't see that kind of behavior in today's Senate.\n  You don't see the kind of casualness toward personal campaign \ncontributions that existed. Why do you think, when they built the \nDirksen Building, they put a safe in every Senator's office? It was to \nhold the cash that would be brought into the office and handed to the \nSenator. And that was a routine kind of circumstance.\n  One of the things I enjoyed about the renovation of the Dirksen \nBuilding was being able to say to the Architect of the Capitol: Take \nthe safe out because we don't need it anymore. I notice now that I \nstarted a trend. If I leave no legacy other than this, it will be that \nthe safes are all coming out of the Dirksen Office Building, and I was \nthe first one to do that.\n  This is an extraordinary place filled with extraordinary people who \ntake their jobs very seriously and deserve the kind of respect that too \noften they do not get. Everybody says, when they leave this place, they \nwill miss the people. I certainly will. The friendships that have been \nmade here, the lessons I have been taught, and the mentors I have had \nhave all been a major part of it. I will not name names because once I \nget started in that, I will not be able to quit. But I do recognize the \nmentors I have had in the leaders, in my senior colleague, Senator \nHatch--and I will tell a story about him--and the staff. These are also \nextraordinary people who go to extraordinary lengths to serve the \ncountry. We should acknowledge that and give them the credit they \ndeserve.\n  Senator Hatch gave me this piece of advice. We were talking one night \nabout an issue, and we were on opposite sides. That didn't happen very \noften. Senator Hatch and I don't confer in advance of a vote very \noften. We come to our own conclusions, but, both being conservative \nRepublicans, we usually end up in the same place. On this occasion, we \nwere different. Orrin was giving me his full court press. You have all \nbeen exposed to Orrin's full court press on an issue.\n  Finally, he said to me: Bob, apply the driving home test.\n  I said: All right, what is the driving home test?\n  He said: After this is all over and the lights go out and you go get \nin your car and you are driving home, thinking back on the day and the \nvotes you cast, the driving home test is, how will you feel driving \nhome if you cast that particular vote?\n  I said: Orrin, that is some of the best advice I ever got.\n  I voted against him, and I felt great while I was driving home.\n  That is one of the first things I have learned. This is an \nextraordinary place filled with extraordinary people who are dedicated \nto the country, dedicated to doing the right thing, and who uphold the \nhighest ethical standards.\n  The next thing I have learned is that there are two parties and that \nthere is a difference between the two parties. There are those who say: \nOh, there is not a dime's worth of difference between the Republicans \nand the Democrats; they are the same people who say we are all corrupt. \nThere is a significant difference. The Democrats are the party of \ngovernment. Going back to their roots with Franklin Roosevelt, they \ncome to the conclusion that if there is a problem, government should \nsolve that problem. The Republicans are the party of free markets, and \nthey come to the conclusion that if there is a problem, it should be \nleft to the markets to solve it. And they are both right. That is the \nthing I have come to understand here. There are some problems where \ngovernment is the solution--but not always. There are some problems \nwhere free markets do provide the solution--but not always.\n  The tension between those two has run throughout the history of the \nRepublic. You can go all the way back to Thomas Jefferson and Alexander \nHamilton and the arguments they had as to what the proper role of \ngovernment should be, whether it should be big government or little \ngovernment, whether you should have this or that kind of power. It ran \nthrough the Constitutional Convention and arguments that occurred \nthere.\n  It is appropriate that those who believe in government should have \nstrong advocates on their side. Those who believe in free markets \nshould have equally strong advocates on their side. And because I \nbelieve in free markets, I am a Republican, and I have been happy to be \na Republican. I have been careful to stand up for those things I \nbelieve, and I have compiled a record that many of my friends on the \nDemocratic side would consider fairly miserable in terms of wisdom on \nvoting. But let us understand in the debate, as we go back and forth \nbetween these two concepts, that we do not question the motives or the \npatriotism of anyone on the other side--or within our own caucuses.\n\n  I remember an event where someone on the Republican side voted with \nthe Democrats in a way that some on this side felt was betrayal, and \nthere was a sense of, let's punish him, let's do this, that, and the \nother. Trent Lott taught me this lesson. He said: No, the most \nimportant vote is the next one. We are going to need his vote the next \ntime. And if we punish him for this last vote, we won't get it.\n  Yes, there is a difference between the two parties. Yes, we disagree. \nBut if we can disagree in an effort to solve the problems of the \ncountry and be willing on occasion to say maybe the other side is \nright, we will move forward.\n  Let me go back to the Civil Rights Act and that debate. Barry \nGoldwater was the Republican standard-bearer in the year that was \npassed. Barry Goldwater and many of his colleagues on the Republican \nside believed that the Civil Rights Act was an unwarranted intrusion on \npersonal liberty, that you were entitled to pick your own associations. \nAnd the Democrats--some of them--believed the civil rights bill had to \nbe passed to keep faith with the 14th amendment and government's role \nin securing liberty.\n  Everett Dirksen stood in the middle of that fight. The civil rights \nbill was\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\nwritten in Dirksen's office. Lyndon Johnson gets historic credit for \nit, as he deserves, but within this body where the cloture vote \ndetermined whether it would pass, the key figure was Everett Dirksen.\n  My father, with me as his chief of staff, was caught in that pressure \nwith the conservatives saying one thing, the liberals saying another, \nand dad trying to decide which way he would go. I remember a comment he \nmade as he made his decision--and he made his decision to go with \nDirksen, vote for the bill, vote for cloture. Being a businessman, he \nhad thought it through. He believed in free markets as well as I do. \nBut he made this comment which I have always held on to as an example \nof the way you deal with this challenge. He said: You know, I thought \nabout it, and many of these companies that refuse to serve Black people \nare public companies with their stock available on the stock exchange. \nSo what we are saying is, it is all right for the Black person to own \nthe company but it is not all right for him to patronize it. That is \nunsustainable.\n  So on this occasion, he sided with the people who believed in \ngovernment to solve the problem. He voted for the Civil Rights Act, and \nhe got a challenger for his next nomination and the toughest primary he \never had within the party. He overcame that challenger, and he got his \nfourth term.\n  I made the decision to act in concert with George Bush and my leader, \nMitch McConnell, and the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, and the \nRepublican standard-bearer, John McCain, to vote in favor of an act of \ngovernment as opposed to free markets when I supported TARP. And I got \na challenger as I sought a fourth term, and I was not as successful as \nmy father, so my career was ended. My father never regretted his civil \nrights vote. I don't regret my TARP vote because it was the right thing \nto do.\n  For those who say: Oh, what a terrible thing it is that your career \nhas ended, I go back again to the old Senate and a Senator named Norris \nCotton, from New Hampshire. Norris Cotton was a Republican. He used to \ntell this story.\n  Three fellows were sitting on a bench in New Hampshire in their \nrocking chairs contemplating what would happen after they had died. The \nfirst one said: You know, after I die, I want to be buried next to \nGeorge Washington, the Father of our country. I think it will be a \ngreat honor to be buried next to Washington.\n  The second one said: Well, that is fine, but I am more loyal to our \nState. I want to be buried next to Daniel Webster.\n  OK. They rocked for a while, and they turned to the third fellow and \nthey said: What about you?\n  He said: I want to be buried next to Elizabeth Taylor.\n  They said: But, Joe, Elizabeth Taylor is not dead yet.\n  He said: Neither am I.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to give this farewell speech and your \nwillingness to come listen to it. But I am not dead yet. The \ndemographers are saying, within the next three or four decades, the \nnumber of Americans over the age of 100 will be in the millions. I \nintend to be one of that number. I have loved being in the Senate. I \nhave loved the association. I have enjoyed hearing about the issues and \nbeing in the arena to try to solve them.\n  I do not intend to leave the arena of public debate and public \naffairs. I simply have changed venues. I am grateful to the Senate and \nto all my friends for all the things you have taught me. I view the \nSenate not as the end of my career but as the education and preparation \nfor the next stage.\n  My father lived until he was 95, my mother 96. I only have to beat \nthe demographic laws by a very small percentage to beat my goal. I \nappreciate the opportunity of being here and your courtesy in listening \nto me here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND.

Unemployment continues to rise and is nearly a staggering 10 \npercent, millions of families continue to face home foreclosure, and \nmany more are having difficulties finding financing to make large \npurchases or run businesses.\n  We face no more important task than stabilizing the economy. On \nNovember 2, Americans sent a clear message to Washington.\n  They have had enough of the runaway spending, the exploding debt, the \nbailouts, and the job-killing policies coming out of this Congress and \nadministration. The recent election showed us that Americans will not \nsettle for a Washington agenda that does not make economic recovery, \nfiscal restraint and job creation the top priority.\n  We need new jobs now. Plain and simple I cannot be any clearer about \nthis point. As I have said repeatedly on this floor, government cannot \ncreate jobs, but it can create the conditions to allow the private \nsector to flourish through low taxes, commonsense regulations, and \nenhanced trade opportunities.\n  Unfortunately, for the past 2 years, Washington has moved in the \nopposite direction, seeking to raise taxes, increase regulation, and \nallow trade agreements to wither.\n  We now have an opportunity to move towards more commonsense \napproaches that will help in job creation. And we can start now, during \nthis lameduck session.\n  We must address the looming tax hikes scheduled to hit every American \non January 1.\n  The proposal the President outlined earlier this week is an important \nstep., His efforts to stop the crippling tax hikes in January from \nhitting American families and small businesses show he has gotten the \nmessage.\n  I only hope he can convince Democrats in Congress what Republicans \nand the American people understand, raising taxes on the people and \nsmall businesses that create jobs is a really bad idea. The President's \nplan first and foremost ensures that our small businesses will not face \nthe largest tax increase in American history.\n  Why is this important? Because our small businesses: Represent 99.7 \npercent of all employer firms, employ just over half of all private \nsector employees, pay 44 percent of total U.S. private payroll and, \nhave generated 64 percent of net new jobs over the past 15 years.\n  As my colleagues know, most small businesses are taxed as individuals \nthrough their proprietorships, partnerships, or subchapter-S \ncorporations. So if you raise taxes on those earning above $200,000 or \n$250,000, you are raising taxes on small business owners--the ones most \nable to create jobs.\n  The President's compromise also ensures the death tax will not come \nback to life at the sky-high rate of 55 percent. This is an important \nprovision, because the death tax is anti-savings, anti-family, and \nanti-investment. It is quite simply unAmerican, and it should be \neliminated entirely. The President's plan increases the estate \nexemption from $3.5 million to $5 million and maintain the 2009 rate of \n35 percent is a step in the right direction. It will keep families \nproduction farms and businesses from having to sell the farm or \nbusiness to pay estate tax. We need to pass this compromise before we \nleave town.\n  Extending tax cuts is one way we can help the private sector create \njobs. That alone is not enough.\n  There is another area that Congress has direct control over, and that \nis spending. For the economy to recover and create jobs in the long \nterm, Congress simply must control spending. Today, our debt totals \nmore than $13.8\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\ntrillion, which breaks down to more than $44,000 for each citizen's \nshare of that mind-boggling amount.\n  Likewise, our annual deficit, the amount we add to our children and \ngrandchildren's credit cards, stands at roughly $1.34 trillion, but \nleft unaddressed, could reach as high as $9 trillion over the next \ndecade.\n  Both entitlement and discretionary spending must be cut. Runaway \nentitlement spending is stifling our prosperity and will continue to \nhold our economy back if not addressed promptly.\n  I am hopeful the next Congress will make this debate their top \npriority, enact necessary legislation to curtail our drastic runaway \nspending and raise revenue through a more fair and efficient tax \nregime.\n  I believe the debt commission has come up with a reasonable proposal. \nI may be so bold as to suggest that we establish a BRAC-type \ncommission, a BRAC-type proposal, to deal with that Commission and say \nit can be accepted or rejected on a simple up-or-down vote by both \nHouses. That is one good step.\n  The other step that has to be taken is to reform entitlements. I am \ndisappointed they did not deal with that. But the health care costs of \nMedicare and Medicaid plus Social Security are what is going to drive \nour spending through the roof.\n  Along with extending tax cuts and restraining spending, opening new \nmarkets to American businesses through free trade is another critical \ncomponent to future economic and job growth.\n  Up until President Obama's recent push for trade in Korea, our \npending free trade agreements have been held up to safeguard the \ninterests of labor and extreme environmentalists. I congratulate the \nPresident for moving forward on this important job-creating agreement.\n  With the election behind us, I hope that the politicization of trade \nin Congress will be behind us as well.\n  The new Congress must renew its efforts to expand and open up new \nmarkets abroad, particularly in Asia where the most dynamic growth in \nthis century will take place.\n  The Obama administration deserves credit for attempting to \nreinvigorate the U.S. focus on Asia and trade with this dynamic region.\n  Trips by the President and the Secretary of State to Asia have helped \nto elevate ties with longstanding friends and allies like Korea and \nJapan. They have also been working to forge deeper, stronger \nrelationships with India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.\n  Reaching an agreement on the U.S.-Korea FTA signals that the United \nStates can return to a leadership position on trade and create some \nmuch-needed jobs based on exports here at home.\n  We must play a leadership role in negotiating and pursuing new FTAs, \nlike the Trans-Pacific Partnership and approving the long-awaited \nagreements with Colombia and Panama.\n  Even the Chairman of the President's own Export Council, Jim \nMcNerney, CEO of Boeing, has warned that a failure to approve the free-\ntrade agreements will leave the United States at a ``significant \ndisadvantage'' to other nations that are working to lower barriers to \ntheir exports.\n  For example in Southeast Asia, where the United States exports as \nmuch as it does to China, China has negotiated a free trade agreement \nwith all 10 ASEAN countries.\n  We are languishing while our competitors are moving forward with \ntheir own FTAs to give their exporters and their workers a competitive \nedge.\n  One such opportunity to increase jobs in the U.S. and secure our \nstrategic interests in the paramount Asia-Pacific region, is the Trans-\nPacific Partnership or TPP. The TPP would ensure the United States \nremains fully engaged in the Asia-Pacific region where strong economic \ngrowth will occur in the 21st century.\n  The partners involved in the TPP discussions now include, in addition \nto the United States: Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, \nVietnam, Singapore and Brunei, which represent the fastest growing \nregions in the world.\n  Another way in which we ought to view the TPP, and other free trade \nagreements, is as a way to cash in on the peace dividends created in \nthe region from our efforts in World War II, the Korean war, and the \nVietnam war.\n  The TPP will open Asian markets to United States exports in a way \nthat we have never seen.\n  We are already the world's largest exporter. We can build on that and \ncreate millions of new jobs by aggressively competing in markets abroad \nand by rejecting isolationism at home.\n  In closing I will put these economic considerations in a larger \ncontext.\n  In the 24 years I have been in the U.S. Senate, I have traveled \naround the world and have seen the remarkable change that came with the \nfall of the Soviet Union.\n  With the fall of Socialism and Communism, countries around the world \nimmediately began to look to the United States as ``the'' economic \nmodel.\n  Our free enterprise system has demonstrated that successful \nbusinesses can provide job opportunities for all our citizens. This is \na classic case of the rising tide lifting all boats.\n  As the economy gets stronger, people up and down the economic scale \nbenefit, and people in low-wage jobs have the opportunity, through hard \nwork and/or education, to move on up the ladder.\n  These countries are not looking to Denmark or Sweden with their very \nhigh tax rates as a model.\n  They see the difference between a government-controlled economy and a \nfree economy with appropriate government regulation.\n  The European Socialist model has demonstrated that it does not grow \nas quickly as the U.S. economy.\n  High levels of unemployment generate more social welfare and transfer \npayments. These transfer payments put pressure on the government to \nraise taxes even higher, and make more people dependent upon the \nlargesse of the Federal Government.\n  Last year's ``stimulus'' program did a tremendous job of putting more \npeople on the government payroll. It did not do much for creation of \njobs in the private sector.\n  The private sector in the United States has historically been vibrant \nand it will create jobs despite increasing government taxation, \ndeficits, and regulation.\n  But the number of jobs created necessarily will be far less than what \nthe free market system could create if it were not inflicted with an \nincreasing government role.\n  Using history as our guide, high taxes and excessive spending, such \nas the new health care bill, will likely lead to a slower recovery, \ncontinued high unemployment, and a lower standard of living for all \nAmericans than would otherwise be possible.\n  There is a chance now for us to reverse course, stop tax hikes, put \nthe brakes on spending, reform entitlement programs, and to pursue new \ntrade opportunities that will create jobs. I believe that is what the \nAmerican people expect us to do.\n  Real growth is only possible if we get our fiscal house in order.\n  If we care about jobs in this country and the future of the economy, \nCongress cannot continue to vote for thousand-page bills that are full \nof job-killing provisions.\n  And Congress cannot continue spending in such a way as to destroy the \nprosperity of future generations stuck paying the bill.\n  I am hopeful that the next Congress will make this debate their top \npriority and enact necessary legislation to curtail drastically our \nrunaway spending and to raise revenue through a more fair and efficient \ntax regime.\n  Madam President, I wish to include for the Record my discussion of \nthe role housing played in the bubble we had, the crash, and the \nrecession we have gone through. I have spent all my time in the Senate \neither looking at housing on the Banking Committee or as a member and \nthen chairman or ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that \nfunds housing. Most of my friends are not interested in hearing a full \ndescription of the\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nhousing crisis and what needs to be done. I will give them the \nopportunity to read it at their leisure.\n  Promoting what we think is the American dream by giving people no-\ndownpayment homes, homes which they don't have the financial ability to \nafford, is not the American dream. It leads to the American nightmare. \nThe American nightmare, unfortunately, for too many families, has \nresulted in home foreclosures, and communities with large numbers of \nforeclosed houses that are deteriorating thanks to the genius of Wall \nStreet which, through its wonderful, innovative efforts, created high-\ntech computer game derivatives on which they made profits by selling \naround the world, which crashed and brought not only our economy but \nthe world economy down. We have to stop that trend. We need a \nresponsible housing policy to rein in Fannie and Freddie, keep them \nfrom buying up housing mortgages which are not subject to underwriting \nstandards which could cause problems in the future. These items are all \nlaid out in the statement I include.\n  If anybody reads them, I would be happy to answer any questions they \nhave.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the statement printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As I prepare to leave the Senate after 24 years, I have had \n     the opportunity to reflect upon some of my most rewarding \n     work in various issue areas.\n       If my colleagues will indulge me for a few minutes, I have \n     some thoughts to share about America's housing and community \n     development policy.\n       This is not typically an area that gets a lot of attention, \n     though certainly it has gotten some negative attention \n     because of the recent housing market meltdown.\n       But good housing is fundamental. It is fundamental to each \n     of us as people. And it is the foundation of any community.\n       To a community, good housing means economic development and \n     jobs. It means kids are safer, healthier and happier.\n       To an individual, a home means safety and security, a \n     starting point from which to do everything else in life.\n       And good housing goes hand-in-hand with community and \n     economic development. One cannot sustain a community very \n     long if there are no jobs. And there won't be jobs if \n     companies don't locate in a particular area, and so forth.\n       Early in my Senate career, I joined the Housing \n     Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee. A few years \n     later, during the 102nd Congress, I became a Member of the \n     VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.\n       Since that time I have been either Chairman or Ranking \n     Member of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee.\n       And I have had the good fortune of having as partners in my \n     work the Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski and the \n     Senator from Washington, Patty Murray. I cannot say enough \n     good things about each of these fine colleagues and the work \n     they do.\n       While bipartisanship has become something of an anachronism \n     in today's Washington, that is not the case on this \n     Subcommittee. These Senators have always been willing to work \n     on a bipartisan basis to get things done for the American \n     people, and I deeply appreciate each of them.\n       So I have had the opportunity to be involved in housing \n     issues both from a policy and from a funding perspective.\n       As I have worked on these issues through the years, I have \n     discovered that housing and economic development are the glue \n     that holds our communities together, even though urban and \n     rural areas often face difference issues and concerns. Both \n     are important and I have worked to promote their unique \n     needs.\n       If we provide the right incentives and investments for \n     growth and opportunity, then families and individuals will \n     prosper and grow, with a tax base that will allow the needed \n     investment for infrastructure, schools, hospitals, libraries \n     and all the necessary amenities that make our Nation great.\n       As we are all painfully aware, we are at a crossroads when \n     it comes to housing policy in this country. We have seen the \n     devastating after-effects of a housing ``bubble,'' and how \n     the housing market meltdown nearly precipitated a worldwide \n     economic depression.\n       In part, this crisis was preceded by unrealistic \n     expectations in housing.\n       Homeownership is perceived by many as key to achieving the \n     ``American Dream.'' However, most of us now recognize that \n     homeownership, while a blessing for many, is not an ideal \n     solution for all. For example, in many cases, rental housing \n     is appropriate for families.\n       It provides flexibility while limiting exposure to frequent \n     variations in market conditions.\n       Homeownership is a great way to build wealth for those able \n     to maintain financial stability throughout the life of a home \n     loan.\n       However, by subsidizing homeownership, and encouraging all \n     families to own homes, even those without realistic resources \n     to maintain their mortgages, the government has turned the \n     American Dream into a nightmare for homeowners, neighbors, \n     communities, the global financial system, and taxpayers.\n       Since 2007, millions have had their homes foreclosed; \n     millions more are at risk. In the aftermath of this meltdown, \n     the government's efforts to date fall far short of what is \n     required to address adequately the growing number of \n     foreclosures that are hurting homeowners and communities.\n       As we have seen with previous housing bubbles, the taxpayer \n     ends up bearing the brunt of the costs and the government \n     ends up holding foreclosed properties. The last time I \n     checked, the government did not do a good job of being a \n     landlord.\n       It is critical that policy-makers address our overall \n     housing policy and the proper role of government versus the \n     private sector.\n       I believe that three essential areas of our housing system \n     must be reformed. We must address:\n       Housing finance issues;\n       Tax policy;\n       Affordable housing for all.\n       With a comprehensive but balanced approach, I believe the \n     United States can join other nations in creating a market \n     where responsible consumers buy and retain their homes with \n     confidence; where those who should rent are able to access \n     affordable, safe housing; and where the needs of the homeless \n     and vulnerable are met.\n\n\n                            HOUSING FINANCE\n\n       First, we need to make changes in the amount of involvement \n     the federal government has in housing.\n       The federal government is now responsible for 95% of the \n     mortgage market. The Federal Housing Agency (FHA), Fannie \n     Mae, and Freddie Mac guarantee nearly all mortgage loans in \n     the U.S. They are fully backed by the federal government. \n     This means it is the taxpayer who will ultimately be on the \n     line to foot the bill as these entities pay for defaults.\n\n\n                                  FHA\n\n       As many of you may know, I not-so-fondly refer to FHA as a \n     ``powder keg'' or ``ticking time bomb.'' FHA's market share \n     has increased dramatically while its capital reserves have \n     significantly decreased.\n       FHA's rapid growth in the mortgage market is largely due to \n     the fact that the average homebuyer receives a guaranteed \n     loan with a down payment of only 3.5%--lower than any sane \n     lender would require.\n       I remember growing up in an era where you did not buy a \n     home unless you had 20% of the loan upfront.\n       But who would put that much cash down if they are \n     incentivized by the federal government to pay far less?\n       The current ceiling for an FHA loan is over $720,000 \n     dollars. While I realize that there are some areas of the \n     country considered ``high-cost,'' keeping the loan limits at \n     such high levels perpetuates big government and increases the \n     risk to taxpayers. It is time to reduce the FHA loan limits.\n       There is a private housing market ready to fill the FHA gap \n     and we need to restart the private housing market and let HUD \n     return to helping first-time homeowners and the more marginal \n     housing applicants.\n       Rather than continuing to extend these expiring limits, I \n     hope that my colleagues will begin to take a comprehensive \n     look at our nation's housing policies and determine who truly \n     needs the government to back their home loans.\n       High loan limits and low down-payments combined with the \n     FHA's seeming inability to prevent waste and fraud, sets up \n     the taxpayers for another huge bailout (estimates range from \n     $54 billion to $100 billion). With FHA's capital reserves \n     already at dangerously low levels (below the mandated level \n     of 2 percent), raising the loan limits is equivalent of \n     pouring more gasoline on the fire. The recently-retired HUD \n     IG testified that the increased loan limits are a \n     contributing factor to FHA's growing risk.\n       In the 2010 housing appropriations bill, I worked with my \n     colleagues on the committee to include $20 million dollars \n     for FHA anti-fraud activities and $5 million dollars in \n     additional funding for the HUD Inspector General to conduct \n     oversight.\n       FHA has had long-standing management and resource \n     challenges, so we provided $180 million dollars to modernize \n     their information-technology systems to track better mortgage \n     and associated obligations.\n       In a rational world, Congress and the White House would \n     tighten FHA underwriting standards, in particular by \n     eliminating the 100 percent guarantee.\n       That guarantee means banks and mortgage lenders have no \n     skin in the game; lenders collect the 2 percent to 3 percent \n     origination fees on as many FHA loans as they can push out \n     the door regardless of whether the borrower has a likelihood \n     of repaying the mortgage.\n       The bottom line: Congress must take stronger action to \n     shore up the weakening insurance fund to prevent another \n     financial meltdown for another federal entity.\n\n\n                         fannie mae/freddie mac\n\n       Not only did this Congress fail to address our housing \n     finance system, the Financial Regulatory Reform bill passed \n     without any Republican participation and failed to address \n     the problem of Fannie and Freddie when these two government \n     sponsored entities were, I believe, at the heart of the \n     housing finance bubble collapse.\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\n       The legislation did nothing to rein in the future role of \n     the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), even though many \n     of us encouraged the leadership to do so during the financial \n     reform debate. Some of my colleagues proposed a finite end to \n     the government conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \n     Others favor a gradual move towards reducing the government's \n     exposure to risk by lowering loan limits to a level which is \n     sustainable.\n       We have already experienced the pain that the GSEs, Freddie \n     and Fannie, can cause, and that pain is expected to continue.\n       The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) reported recently \n     that the total cost to the federal government since taking \n     Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship could rise from $148 \n     billion dollars to an astounding $363 billion dollars.\n       Responsible reform would put an end to the taxpayer-funded \n     bailout of Fannie and Freddie and refocus them on promoting \n     affordable housing. I believe strongly that whatever path is \n     chosen for the future of the GSEs, it is essential that any \n     cost to the government for supporting these entities be \n     placed in the annual budget and accounted for with all other \n     programmatic spending.\n       I believe the operations of the GSEs must be dramatically \n     wound down to shift the risks from the taxpayers to the \n     private housing finance market.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n       Today, the tax code provides generous incentives to \n     encourage homeownership through the mortgage interest \n     deduction, property tax deduction, and capital gains tax \n     exclusion. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that for \n     2008 these tax incentives totaled just over $108 billion.\n       The tax code needs to be fair and not skewed toward those \n     who are able to purchase million-dollar homes; it should \n     treat homeowners on a level playing field that helps preserve \n     an effective tax code.\n       Specifically, the mortgage interest deduction can be \n     claimed by anyone whose mortgage balance is less than $1 \n     million.\n       Like many, I believe that the federal government should not \n     provide a hefty deduction for mortgage interest paid for \n     million-dollar homes when many families are struggling to \n     maintain homes that average $500,000 dollars or less. This \n     deduction level needs to be revisited soon.\n       Other government gimmicks such as the First-Time Homebuyers \n     Tax Credit simply kicked the reality of our housing market \n     woes down the road further, and today we are feeling that \n     pain.\n       Initially, I supported the creation and first extension of \n     the home-buyer tax credit. As a long-time housing advocate, I \n     believed the credit, combined with other tools such as \n     housing counseling and refinancing efforts by state housing \n     finance agencies would help in the stabilization and recovery \n     of the housing market.\n       Like many of my colleagues, I believed that it was critical \n     to address the housing market that was at the root of the \n     credit crisis and led to our recession. However, the housing \n     crisis evolved from a crisis caused by loose lending through \n     risky subprime loans to a crisis where job loss has become \n     the primary cause of foreclosures and delinquencies.\n       Today, we can look back and see that the newly-formed tax \n     credit was costly and a target of fraud.\n       Congress needs to stop trying prescriptive programs to cure \n     a systemic disease that has plagued U.S. housing for too \n     long. Rather than credits or incentives for some, we should \n     allow the market to correct itself and truly feel the bottom \n     of the recession so that a genuine, solid recovery can be \n     realized.\n       So the question I ask my colleagues is: why are we \n     continuing these debt-fueled policies that led to our housing \n     and economic troubles? Why do we keep using taxpayer dollars \n     to distort and manipulate the housing market?\n       Americans expect Congress to address fully the causes of \n     the recent financial crisis. As we work toward a full \n     economic recovery, it is essential that Congress address the \n     root of the problem--failed housing policies that were pushed \n     by the government and manipulated by the private market to \n     reap unprecedented profits for a few bad actors.\n       I strongly urge my colleagues to consider carefully the \n     future role of government in housing, so that the people of \n     this great nation do not bear the burden of a housing crisis \n     ever again.\n\n\n                           Affordable Housing\n\n       As is always the case, the housing collapse and subsequent \n     recession have hit vulnerable people the hardest.\n       We must continue to look forward and renew our commitment \n     and energy to ensure that all Americans have fair access to \n     safe and affordable housing.\n       It is unacceptable that people with disabilities, families \n     with children and minority residents still meet severe \n     challenges for fair housing.\n       It is unacceptable that the 20 percent of Americans who \n     suffer a physical disability face a significant shortage of \n     accessible and affordable housing.\n       It is unacceptable that one-in-five Hispanics, African \n     Americans, Asians or Native Americans still face \n     discrimination when renting, buying, or financing a home.\n       And it is unacceptable that so many families, veterans and \n     the mentally ill are homeless.\n\n\n                            VA-HUD Committee\n\n       HUD has a number of primary ``core'' programs to address \n     these needs, including Section 8 housing assistance, public \n     housing, Section 202 housing for the elderly, Section 811 \n     housing for persons with disabilities, the Community \n     Development Block Grant program, the Housing Block grant \n     program, the FHA mortgage-insurance programs and the Homeless \n     Assistance program.\n       I think it is safe to speak for my colleagues, Ms. Mikulski \n     and Mrs. Murray, in saying that it has not always been easy \n     to garner support for these programs, particularly during \n     tight budget years.\n       But we did, in fact, increase funding and make these \n     programs more effective through our partnership on the \n     Subcommittee, even when successive Administrations--\n     Democratic and Republican--were not supportive.\n       In fact, many of the innovations that provide cohesion \n     among the programs were first included in the VA-HUD \n     Appropriations bill at our insistence.\n       Looking ahead, public housing still faces a crisis of some \n     $20 billion-$30 billion in a backlog of capital needs.\n       It will take vision and will to persevere and make progress \n     addressing this, but there are some good ideas that can help \n     move us forward. Choice Neighborhoods is one such program \n     that provides a mixture of ideas and perspectives for \n     addressing public housing challenges.\n       And this is an expansion of the HOPE VI program which \n     dramatically changed the way we think of public housing in \n     this country.\n\n\n                                HOPE VI\n\n       A few of my colleagues will remember our efforts in the \n     early 1990s to rid cities of dilapidated public housing \n     projects which forced residents to live in substandard \n     housing and had become breeding grounds for crime and drug \n     abuse.\n       The federal government had a rule at that time requiring a \n     one-for-one hard unit replacement of any housing units slated \n     for demolition.\n       The intention was good, but in practice this meant that \n     cities could not replace housing stock, even if it was \n     uninhabitable.\n       So with the help of Senator Mikulski, I convinced my \n     colleagues to include a provision in the National Affordable \n     Housing Act of 1990 that would allow St. Louis, in \n     particular, to replace a dilapidated complex called Pruitt-\n     Igoe with both vouchers and hard units.\n       This demonstration led to what is now known as the HOPE VI \n     program, which has been very successful in developing mixed-\n     income housing and transforming many distressed communities \n     into revitalized neighborhoods with new jobs and economic \n     investment.\n\n\n                         Fighting Homelessness\n\n       In 2009, I teamed up with Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) to \n     introduce comprehensive legislation designed to get homeless \n     individuals and families into permanent supportive housing \n     where appropriate and to assist others at risk of \n     homelessness so they do not end up on the streets.\n       The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to \n     Housing Act (HEARTH) builds upon recent research showing that \n     providing permanent supportive housing is a more effective \n     way to fight homelessness than providing only emergency \n     shelter programs.\n       Our legislation:\n       Provides $2.2 billion for targeted homelessness assistance \n     grant programs;\n       Allocates up to $440 million for homelessness prevention \n     initiatives, like those serving people who are about to be \n     evicted, live in severely overcrowded housing, or live in an \n     unstable situation that puts them at risk of homelessness;\n       Expands the definition of homelessness to allow families on \n     the verge of becoming homeless to qualify for assistance.\n       The HEARTH Act was approved by the Senate as part of the \n     Helping Families Save their Homes Act, and signed by the \n     President in May of 2009.\n\n\n                           Homeless Veterans\n\n       According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, \n     about 20 percent of the homeless using shelters in the U.S. \n     are veterans. Homelessness is a major problem among Iraq and \n     Vietnam veterans, particularly those who may have both \n     physical and psychological problems like Post-Traumatic \n     Stress Disorder (PTSD) or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).\n       Senator Murray and I started a new partnership between HUD \n     and the VA to help homeless veterans in the 2008 \n     Transportation-Housing spending bill.\n       The program, known as the Veterans Affairs Supportive \n     Housing Program, or HUD-VASH, combines rental housing \n     assistance with case management and clinical services to \n     assist homeless veterans. Veterans use Section 8 rental \n     assistance and the supportive services they need to be \n     integrated back into their communities and former lives.\n       We have continued to fund the program in the years since \n     and I hope that will continue after I am gone.\n       In closing, I note that many Americans have experienced a \n     very rough time when it comes to housing recently. We have \n     the opportunity now of learning from the mistakes that were \n     made and taking steps to ensure that such a crisis does not \n     happen again.\n       One simple principle I hope everyone in this body will \n     remember is that a successful housing program requires that \n     every participant in the process must have ``skin in the \n     game.''\n\n[[Page S8675]]\n\n       To ensure that everyone has ``skin in the game'' we must:\n       (1) End ``no-down payment'' purchases by homeowners, and \n     require at least a 5 percent down payment;\n       (2) End the 95-100% government guarantee of loans; make \n     lenders and loan promoters face a real economic loss for any \n     bad loan they promote; and\n       (3) Require that any loan securitizer keep a stake in the \n     loan or mortgage that will be wiped out if the security \n     fails.\n       In sum, good housing does not require home ownership; a \n     family can live in rental housing when appropriate to their \n     financial circumstances, and we can encourage the \n     availability of such housing.\n       There are a number of ideas worth pursuing in the \n     affordable-housing arena that will ensure that more Americans \n     have stability in their housing arrangements so they can \n     pursue their lives with some security.\n       While I will no longer have the opportunity to participate \n     in Senate debates over housing policy, I look forward to \n     continuing my involvement in these issues in the next phase \n     of my life.\n       Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor to my good friend and fellow retiring \nSenator from my neighboring State of Kentucky, who has been known for \nhis talents on the baseball diamond but also has some, I am sure, very \ncandid comments on what he thinks the Senate has done and ought to do. \nI will listen with great interest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8675-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8675-S8677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri, a \ndear friend of mine and someone who has unusual wisdom in his remarks \ntoday. I listened to many of them. I just hope I have a few that are as \nwell thought out as my good friend from Missouri.\n  I wish to take a few moments to thank all my colleagues and other \nindividuals who have come to the Chamber to hear me bid farewell. That \ndoesn't mean I will not speak again. That just means I am bidding \nfarewell and this is a farewell speech.\n  I have had the great fortune of having three wonderful careers during \nmy life: one as a husband and father of 9 children and a grandfather of \n40, one as a Major League baseball player for 27 years, and one in \npublic service for 30 years. Many people often talk to me about how \ndifferent my baseball and public service careers are, but they really \nare not so different.\n  I have been booed by 60,000 fans in Yankee Stadium, standing alone on \nthe mound, so I have never cared if I stood alone in the Congress, as \nlong as I stood by my beliefs and my values. I have also thought that \nbeing able to throw a curve ball never was a bad skill for a politician \nto have.\n  I came to Washington, DC, in 1987, when the people of the Fourth \nDistrict in northern Kentucky gave me the distinct honor to serve them. \nI did not know then that the people of Kentucky had bestowed upon me \nthe privilege of representing them for 24 years. I have the same \nconservative principles in 2010 that I had when I first was elected to \nCongress.\n  Over the years, I have always done what I thought was right for \nKentucky and my country. I did not run for public service for fame or \npublic acclaim. When I cast my votes, I thought about how they would \naffect my grandchildren and the next generation of Kentuckians, not \nwhere the political winds at the time were blowing. Words cannot \nexpress my gratitude to the people of Kentucky for giving me the \ndistinct honor of serving them for 12 years in the House of \nRepresentatives and 12 years in the Senate.\n  Here I stand, though, in the Senate Chamber about to say goodbye \nafter nearly a quarter of a century in Congress. I have reflected much \nabout my time here. As I stand here at the desk of Henry Clay, the \ngreat Kentuckian, I am proud to have had the opportunity to serve in a \nplace in history. I thought it fitting to discuss the legislative items \nof which I am most proud.\n  I have three bills I am particularly proud I was able to accomplish \nsigning into law. One of the things I am most proud of during my time \nin Congress is helping pass legislation that repealed the earnings \nlimit on older Americans under the Social Security system. Social \nSecurity used to penalize many older Americans for working by reducing \ntheir Social Security benefits by $1 for every $3 they earned, if they \nmade more than the earnings limit which was about $12,000 in 1995. This \nwas an unfair tax on seniors and punished them for continuing to work. \nI worked hard for many years in both the House and Senate to get this \nunfair earnings limit eliminated.\n  Finally, in 2000, after I had been elected to the Senate, it passed \nand was signed into law. This law has helped many hardworking seniors \nstay involved in their communities, remain independent, and contribute \nto society.\n  Another bill I am proud of is the 2004 Flood Insurance Reformation \nAct. In 2004, I wrote the last reauthorization of the national flood \ninsurance program. That law provided significant reforms to the program \njust in time for the 2004-2005 hurricane season, including Hurricane \nKatrina. Had the law not been in place, homeowners all over the gulf \ncoast would not have had coverage for the flood damage to their homes. \nThe 2004 law is still the framework for the program today. It was not a \nRepublican accomplishment or a Democratic accomplishment. It was a \nbipartisan accomplishment.\n  I worked very closely with Senator Sarbanes and Representatives \nBereuter and Blumenthal to write and pass that law. While I believe \nthat further changes are still needed to the program, the 2004 law made \nmeaningful changes that put the program on a more sound financial \nfooting.\n  Unfortunately, passage of the bill was not the end of the story. What \nhappened or, more accurately, what did not happen illustrates one \nreason people are fed up with Washington: because government does not \ndo what it is supposed to do. Despite the fact the bill passed both the \nSenate and the House unanimously, FEMA refused to implement all of its \nprovisions in a timely manner. The most glaring example was the appeals \nprocess created by the bill for property owners to appeal claims they \nthought were not settled fairly or correctly. The law gave FEMA 6 \nmonths to write the rules. FEMA, instead, took almost 2 years from the \nday the bill passed to put even draft rules out. They probably would \nnot have done it then, if it was not for the right of one Senator to \nobject. I had to hold the nominee to head the agency to get the \nattention of the Bush administration and move the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to finally publish the rules. It should not have been that \nway.\n  The third bill I am grateful was signed into law is the Emergency \nEmployee Occupational Illness Compensation Program. The Paducah, KY, \ngaseous diffusion plant is the only operating uranium enrichment plant \nin the United States. When I came to the Senate, I held the first \nhearing to look at cleaning up the contamination the Department of \nEnergy left at the site. After the hearing, I focused on cleaning up \nthe site. A lot has been cleaned up since that first hearing 10 years \nago. I also worked hard to provide compensation to workers who suffered \nserious illnesses as a result of their employment at the DOE nuclear \nweapons program plant.\n  This energy employment compensation program was set up because many \nworkers served our country's nuclear programs during the Cold War and \ntheir health was put at risk without their knowledge--the first \ncompensation bill passed in 2000, with the help of a bipartisan group \nof Congressmen and Senators. I then became aware that DOE was slow-\nwalking claims processing and payment to many claimants and their \nportion of the compensation program. So in 2004, again, with the help \nof a bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen, I spearheaded \nlegislation that moved the entire program over to the Department of \nLabor which had sped up and streamlined compensation for the sick \nnuclear workers.\n  Along with many of my achievements, I also had time to reflect on \nsome of the disappointments I wish I had been able to fix during my \ntime here. I am deeply concerned about the state of entitlement \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. It is clear that our \ngovernment cannot meet its future obligations and ultimately the \nAmerican people will suffer, unfortunately. Too many Members of \nCongress are willing to look the other way and let the financial \nproblems of these programs fester instead of making hard \ndecisions. Congress just cannot get the courage together to address \nthese issues head on.\n\n[[Page S8676]]\n\n  In fact, after President Bush's second election, Congress briefly \nfocused on the problems of Social Security solvency. At the time, I was \na strong supporter of private investment accounts but certainly \nrealized that the whole system needed an overhaul and was open to many \ndifferent options. Toward the end of the debate, I was willing to \ntackle Social Security reform even if we did not do investment \naccounts, as long as we did something. However, it quickly became \napparent that many Members of Congress--even some in my own party--were \nnot willing to get serious about this. Six years later, Congress still \nhas not touched Social Security reform, and the program is even in \nworse financial shape.\n  Medicare and Medicaid are in the same position. In 2006, Congress \nfinally got serious about spending in these programs and passed the \nDeficit Reduction Act. This bill slowed the rate of growth--the rate of \ngrowth--in Medicare by $6 billion and in Medicaid by $5 billion over 5 \nyears. Let me be clear about this. We were not cutting spending in \nthese programs. We were just slowing the growth.\n  Well, you would have thought the sky was falling when we did this. \nThe longer Congress takes to honestly tackle these fiscal challenges, \nthe harder it will be to fix these programs. This means bigger cuts, \nbigger deficits, and bigger tax increases.\n  Health care is another area where Congress should have done better. \nThe other side of the aisle's stubborn refusal to compromise and, more \nimportantly, listen to the desires of the American people on health \ncare reform led to the passage of a bill that is one of the worst \npieces of legislation I have seen in Congress in 24 years.\n  The health care bill is clearly unconstitutional, will force millions \nof Americans to lose the health insurance they currently enjoy, give \nthe IRS--that is the Internal Revenue Service--the power to police and \ntax Americans who do not have health insurance, and takes over $500 \nbillion out of Medicare programs to pay for new spending.\n  Despite all the rhetoric from the administration and Democratic \nleaders about being transparent and open and willing to compromise, it \nquickly became clear that they only wanted Republican support if we \nagreed to everything they wanted to do. Well, compromise does not work \nlike that. A compromise means you actually have to take ideas from \nother people instead of just giving lip service.\n  One of the other recent disappointments was the financial regulation \nbill passed earlier this year. Before my first election, I spent 31 \nyears working in the security business. That was back when baseball \nplayers did not make millions of dollars a year and had to have jobs in \nthe off-season to pay the bills. I spent nearly all of my time in \nCongress on either the old House Banking Committee or the Senate \nBanking Committee, so this is something I know a great deal about and \ncare about.\n  There were, and are, real problems in our financial system. But that \nbill is not going to fix them and almost certainly sows the seeds for \nthe next banking and financial crisis while, at the same time, adding \nmore burdens on the economies struggling to recover.\n  That bill did not replace bailouts with bankruptcy. It made bailouts \na permanent part of the financial system. The bill did not force the \ntoo-big-to-fail banks to get smaller. It gave them special status. The \nbill ignored the role of housing finance and left Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac alone. The housing crisis could not have happened without \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  The Senate failed to act on a bill to reform Fannie and Freddie \npassed by the Banking Committee in 2006, and that failure is going to \nend up costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Congress has \nto do something soon to get them off the taxpayers' life support they \nhave been on since 2008. But, unfortunately, that did not happen in the \nfinancial reform bill.\n  The bill also ignores the Federal Reserve's failures as a regulator \nand, instead, gave them more power. And, worst of all, the bill did \nnothing to rein in the largest single cause of the current financial \ncrisis and most other financial crises in the past: flawed monetary \npolicy by the Federal Reserve.\n  Nothing Congress has done will stop the next bubble or collapse if \nthe Fed continues with its easy money policies. Cheap money will always \ndistort prices and lead to dangerous behavior. No amount of regulation \ncan contain it.\n  For many years, I was a lone critic of the Federal Reserve. \nParticularly, no one questioned Alan Greenspan, despite his policies \ncausing two recessions and two asset bubbles. I was the lone vote \nagainst Ben Bernanke in 2006. I was the lone vote because I thought he \nwould continue the Greenspan monetary and regulatory policies. Well, he \ndid. He kept it up--a flawed monetary policy--and was slow to regulate. \nThen, in 2008, he took the Federal Reserve into fiscal policy by \nbailing out Bear Stearns and, later, AIG, and just about every other \nmajor financial institution in the country. As we saw, even last week \naround the world, Chairman Bernanke compromised the independence of the \nFed and turned it into an arm of the U.S. Treasury.\n  Things have not gotten better since then either. Chairman Bernanke is \ncontinuing with the easy monetary policy, and a month ago started the \nprinting presses again to buy up more Treasury debt. While the Fed may \nbe propping up the banks with plenty of cheap money, he is undermining \nour currency.\n  Other central banks are moving away from the dollar and gold is \ncontinuing to climb. Just like the soaring national debt and \nentitlement costs, the destruction of the dollar is not sustainable. \nCongress must act to rein in the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and \nthe Fed before they destroy our currency and permanently damage our \neconomy and financial system.\n  Public awareness of what the Fed is doing is increasing, while public \nopinion of the Fed is falling. Chairman Bernanke had nearly twice as \nmany votes cast against him in the Senate earlier this year than any \nother Fed Chairman in history. It is just not outside the Fed that \nopposition is growing. Regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents are \nspeaking up and voting against Fed policy. Even some members of the Fed \nBoard are recognizing the dangers of Chairman Bernanke's policies. I am \nmore hopeful now than ever that Chairman Bernanke and the Fed will not \nbe allowed to continue the flawed policies and act as an arm of the \nTreasury and the major banks.\n  As I stand here and reflect upon my time in Congress, I can honestly \nsay I am gratified, despite the ups and downs, to have had the \nopportunity to serve my country and serve the people of the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Twenty-four years is a very large portion of my life and my family's \nlife. I thank my nine children: Barb, Jim, Joan, Cat, Bill, Bridget, \nMark, Amy, and David, and my 40 grandchildren, who inspired me to try \nto make this country better and better for the next generation to live.\n  I also want to give a special thanks to my wife Mary, the mother of \nmy nine children and my childhood sweetheart from the fourth grade. I \nthank her for being at my side through all of the road trips, the late \nnights I spent in the House and the Senate. She is my better half, who \nsupported and stood by me. She is my lighthouse that always shone in \nthe dark during the good and the bad times of public service. She \nprayed me to my wins in public service and in baseball, and I never \ncould have done any of these achievements without her.\n  As this chapter in my life comes to an end and I flip the page into a \nnew chapter, I thank very much all the other people in my life who have \nstood by me. Without the friendship and support of so many over the \nyears, I never would have been able and had the privilege to represent \nKentucky in the House and the Senate.\n  As I leave here today, I offer a little prayer for the next Congress. \nPope John Paul II once said:\n\n       Freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having \n     the right to do what we ought.\n\n  This is the motto I have tried to live by during my time in Congress. \nI pray that the Members of the next Congress do what is right for the \ncountry, not what is right for their fame and their future aspirations. \nMy hope is that Congress will focus on the astronomical debt instead of \ncontinuing down the path of spending our future generations into higher \ntaxes and a lower standard of living than we have now.\n\n[[Page S8677]]\n\n  Godspeed and God bless.\n  With a sense of pride and gratitude, I will say for the last time, \nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, those of us who are leaving the Congress \nat the end of this year are given the opportunity to make a farewell \nspeech. But more, it is an opportunity to say thank you to a lot of \npeople to whom we owe a thank-you, and to colleagues, to family, to the \nstaff here in the Senate and our state staff, and the people of North \nDakota, in this case, who gave me the opportunity to serve. It is the \nopportunity for me to say thank you.\n  One of my colleagues the other day talked about the number of people \nwho have served in the Senate. Since the beginning of our country, \nthere have been 1,918 people who have served in the Senate. When I \nsigned in, I signed on the line, and I was No. 1,802. There have been \n212 Senators with whom I have served in the years I have been in the \nSenate. It is hard to get here and it is also hard to leave. But all of \nus do leave, and the Senate always continues. When finally you do \nleave, you understand this is the most unique legislative body in the \nworld.\n  I arrived 30 years ago in Congress, and when we all show up the first \nday, we feel so very important and we believe the weight of the world \nrests on our shoulders. Then we begin getting mail from home.\n  I have long described a letter that was sort of leavening to me, sent \nto me by a schoolteacher early on after I arrived here. Her class was \nto do a project to write to Dorgan in Washington, DC. I paged through \nthe 20 letters from fourth grade students, and one of them said: Dear \nMr. Dorgan, I know who you are. I see you on television sometimes. My \ndad watches you on television too. Boy, does he get mad.\n  So I knew the interests of public service, of trying to satisfy all \nof the varied interests in our country. It is important, it seems to \nme, that we do the right thing as best we can and as best we see it. \nThat dad from that letter showed up at a good many of my meetings over \nthe years, I think. He didn't introduce himself. But in most cases, the \npeople I represented over these many years were people, ordinary folks \nwho loved their country, raised their families, paid their bills, and \nwanted us to do the right thing for our country's future.\n  I have a lot of really interesting memories from having served here, \n12 years in the House and 18 years in the Senate. The first week I came \nto Washington, in the House, I stopped to see the oldest Member of the \nHouse, Claude Pepper. I had read so much about him, I wanted to meet \nhim. I walked into his office, and his office was like a museum with a \nlot of old things in it, really interesting things. He had been here \nfor a long, long time. I have never forgotten what I saw behind his \nchair--two photographs. The first photograph was of Orville and Wilbur \nWright, December 17, 1903, making the first airplane flight, signed \n``to Congressman Claude Pepper with admiration, Orville Wright.'' \nBeneath it was a photograph of Neil Armstrong stepping on the surface \nof the Moon, signed ``to Congressman Pepper, with regards, Neil \nArmstrong.'' I was thinking to myself, here is a living American and in \none lifetime, he has an autographed picture of the first person who \nlearned to fly and the first person who walked on the Moon. Think of \nthe unbelievable progress in a lifetime. And what is the distance \nbetween learning to fly and flying to the Moon? It wasn't measured on \nthat wall in inches, although those photographs were only 4 or 5 inches \napart; it is measured in education, in knowledge, in a burst of \naccomplishments in an unprecedented century.\n  This country has been enormously blessed during this period. The \nhallmark, it seems to me, of the century we just completed was self-\nsacrifice and common purpose, a sense of community, commitment to \ncountry, and especially, especially leadership. In America, leadership \nhas been so important in this government we call self-government.\n  There was a book written by David McCullough about John Adams, and \nJohn Adams described that question of leadership. He would travel in \nEurope representing this new country, and he would write letters back \nto Abigail. In his letters to Abigail, he would plaintively ask the \nquestion: Where will the leadership come from for this new country we \nare starting? Who will become the leaders? Who will be the leaders for \nthis new nation?\n  In the next letter to Abigail, he would again ask: Where will the \nleadership come from? Then he would say: There is only us. Really, \nthere is only us. There is me, there is George Washington, there is Ben \nFranklin, there is Thomas Jefferson, there is Hamilton, Mason, and \nMadison. But there is only us, he would plaintively say to Abigail.\n  In the rearview mirror of history, of course, the ``only us'' is some \nof the greatest human talent probably ever assembled. But it is \ninteresting to me that every generation has asked the same question \nJohn Adams asked: Where will the leadership come from for this country? \nWho will be the leaders?\n  The answer to that question now is here in this room. It has always \nbeen in this room--my colleagues, men and women, tested by the rigors \nof a campaign, chosen by citizens of their State who say: You lead, you \nprovide leadership for this country.\n  For all of the criticism about this Chamber and those who serve in \nthis Chamber, for all of that criticism, I say that the most talented \nmen and women with whom I have ever worked are the men and women of the \nSenate on both sides of this aisle. They live in glass houses. Their \nmistakes are obvious and painful. They fight, they disagree, then they \nagree. They dance around issues, posture, delay. But always, always \nthere is that moment--the moment of being part of something big, \nconsequential, important; the moment of being part of something bigger \nthan yourself. At that moment, for all of us at different times, there \nis this acute awareness of why we were sent here and the role the \nSenate plays in the destiny of this country.\n  The Senate is often called the most exclusive club in the world, but \nI wonder, really, if it is so exclusive if someone from a town of 300 \npeople and a high school senior class of 9 students can travel from a \ndesk in that small school to a desk on the floor of the Senate. I think \nit is more like a quilt-work of all that is American, of all the \nexperiences in our country. It allows someone from a small town with \nbig ideas to sit in this Chamber among the desks that were occupied by \nHenry Clay, Daniel Webster, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and so many \nmore, and feel as if you belong. That is the genius of self-government.\n  I announced about a year ago that I would not seek reelection after \nserving here 30 years, 12 in the House and 18 years in the Senate. I am \nrepeatedly asked, as is my colleague Senator Dodd, I am sure, who is \nleaving at the end of this year, what is your most significant \naccomplishment? While I am proud of so many things I have done \nlegislatively, the answer is not legislative. I have always answered it \nby saying: Well, the first month I was here, 30 years ago next month, I \nstepped into an elevator on the ground floor of the Cannon Office \nBuilding of the U.S. House of Representatives. That step into that \nelevator changed my life. There was a woman on that elevator, and \nbetween the ground floor and the fourth floor, I got her name. And that \nis a pretty significant accomplishment for a Lutheran Norwegian. This \nyear, we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. My life has been so \nenriched by my wife Kim and children, Scott and Shelly and Brendon and \nHaley; grandchildren Madison and Mason--they serve too. Families are \ncommitted too, to this life of public service, weekends alone, and I am \nforever grateful to the commitment and sacrifice of my family.\n  I wish to say two things about some other people as well.\n  First, there is our staff. All of us would probably say--but, of \ncourse, I\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\nsay with much greater credibility--I have the finest staff in the U.S. \nSenate. I have been so enormously blessed. I am so proud of all of \nthem. They are talented, they are dedicated to this country, and I have \nbeen blessed to work with them. In fact, I have worked with most of \nthem for many, many years.\n  Then I wish to say to the floor staff of the Senate that I come here, \nas do my colleagues, and we say our piece and we get involved in the \ndebates, and the floor staff does such an unbelievable job. When we are \ndone speaking, we often leave. They are still here. They are the ones \nwho turn out the lights. They refrain from rolling their eyes when I \nknow they want to during these debates. Boy, are they professional, and \nall of us owe them such a great debt of gratitude.\n  To my colleagues, I kind of feel like Will Rogers: There is nobody in \nhere I do not like.\n  It is a great place with some terrific colleagues, especially Senator \nKent Conrad. We have been friends for 40 years. For 40 years we have \nbeen involved in the political fights and the political battles in \nNorth Dakota. He is a great Senator. I said last night at a reception: \nHe is the best Senator in the United States Senate come January. But \nwhat I should just say right now is, he is an outstanding Senator and \nmakes a great contribution to this body. Congressman Pomeroy, with whom \nI have served, the other part of Team North Dakota, three of us who \nworked together on campaigns 40 years ago, in North Dakota and who then \nfor 18 years were the only three members of North Dakota's \nCongressional Delegation. It has been a great pleasure. We will \ncontinue these friendships. But I say thanks to Senator Conrad \nespecially for the work we have done together.\n  Now, you know--and it shows--I love politics. I love public service, \nalways have. John F. Kennedy used to say every mother kind of hopes her \nchild might grow up to be President, as long as they do not have to be \nactive in politics. But, of course, politics is the way we make \ndecisions about America. It is an honorable thing. I have always been \nenormously proud of being in politics. I have run 12 times in statewide \nelections since age 26. I have served continuously in statewide \nelective office since the age of 26--never outside of statewide \nelective office--for a long time, 40 years. It has been a great gift to \nme to be able to serve, and I am forever grateful to the people of \nNorth Dakota who have said to me: We want you to represent us.\n  Now it is time for me to do some other things that I have long wanted \nto do. That is why I chose not to seek reelection this year.\n  Let me be clear to you. I did not decide not to run for the Senate \nbecause I am despondent about the state of affairs here. That is not \nthe case. These are difficult and troubling times. But I did not decide \nnot to run and to criticize this institution, although there is plenty \nof which to be critical. I do not want to add to the burdens of this \ninstitution. This institution is too important to the future of this \ncountry.\n  I could talk, by the way, for hours about the joys of serving here \nwith all of my colleagues.\n  I was thinking about the late Ted Kennedy, when I was jotting a few \nnotes, standing at his desk back in that row for many years. I know no \none will mind me saying this: I think he is the best legislator I have \never seen in terms of getting things done. Ted Kennedy, full of \npassion, and on certain days when he was agitated and full-throated, \nyou could hear him out on the street fighting and shouting for the \nthings he knew were important for America.\n  I think of Bob Dole who would saunter onto this floor, and he almost \nseemed to have an antenna that knew exactly what was going on, what the \nmood was, and what he could and could not do and how you must \ncompromise at certain times. He had a knack like that, unlike any \nothers I have seen.\n  I think of Strom Thurmond, who left us at age 101. If anybody could \nknow his life story, what an unbelievable, courageous story. One of the \nthings that I remember about Strom Thurmond is my involvement with \nlegislation for organ transplantation to save people's lives. I did a \npress conference on a bill I was introducing on organ transplants, and \nStrom Thurmond showed up. I think he was 90 years old. He signed an \norgan donor card. He said after he signed the organ donor card at age \n90: I do not know if I've got anything anybody wants, but if I am gone, \nthey are welcome to it.\n  Robert C. Byrd, who sat where my colleague is sitting now--they do \nnot make them like Robert C. Byrd anymore. I recall one day when \nanother colleague was on the Senate floor, Robert C. Byrd got very \nangry about what the other colleague was saying. He believed it was \ndisrespectful. So he rushed up to the Chamber, and the other colleague \nhad left by that time. I do not know that our colleague ever understood \nwhat happened to him. But Senator Byrd, being very angry at what the \nother Senator had said, said simply this: I have been here long enough \nto watch pygmies strut like Colossus. He said: They, like the fly in \nAesop's Fables, sitting on the axle of a chariot observe, my, what dust \nthy do raise. Then he sat down. And I thought, you know, they do not \nmake Senators like that anymore. The Senator who left did not \nunderstand what Senator Byrd had just done, cutting him off at the \nknees.\n  But I take a treasury of memories. I should mention as well one of my \nbest friends, Tom Daschle, who served here, a wonderful friend and a \ngreat leader for a long while as well. I just take a treasury of \nmemories from this place.\n  This place, however, has substantial burdens ahead of it, and will \nhave to make good decisions, tough decisions, and exhibit the courage \nneeded for the kind of future we want; we are going to have to put some \nsacrifice on the line for our country's future.\n  I want to talk for a bit about a couple of those issues. While there \nare always big issues, and I have always been interested in debating \nthe big issues, my principal passion has been to support family \nfarmers, small business folks, and the people who go to work every \nmorning at a job; the family farmers out there who live on hope, plant \na seed, and hope it grows, who risk everything; the Main Street \nbusiness owner who this morning got up and turned the key in the front \ndoor and went in and waited because they have everything in their \nfinancial lives on the line, hoping their small business works; and the \nworker who goes to a job in the morning every day, every day, and they \nare the ones who know ``seconds,'' those workers at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder. They know second shift, secondhand, second mortgage. \nThey know it all. The question is, who speaks for them? The hallways \noutside the Chamber are not crowded with people saying: Let me speak \nfor those folks.\n  In the first book I wrote, the first page, a book called ``Take This \nJob and Ship It,'' about trade, on the first page of that book I \ndescribe a story that was told about Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \nfuneral. As they lined up in this Capitol to file past the casket of \nthe deceased President, a journalist was trying to capture the mood of \npeople who were waiting in line. He walked up to a man, a worker who \nwas holding his cap in front of him standing there with tears in his \neyes, and the journalist said to this working man: Well, did you know \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt?\n  The man said: No, I didn't. But he knew me.\n  The question is, it seems to me, for every generation in this \nChamber, who knows American workers? Who stands up for the people who \ngo to work every morning in this country? As I said, there are big \nissues that relate to workers and farmers and businesspeople and others \nin this country.\n  Let me just mention a couple. We know that for America to succeed we \nhave to fix our schools. Thirty percent of the kids going to schools \nare not graduating. That cannot continue. We cannot have schools that \nare called dropout factories. We need the best schools in the world \nwith the best teachers in the world if we are going to compete. We need \nsubstantial education reform.\n  We also have to get rid of this crushing debt. We know we cannot \nborrow 40 percent of everything we spend. We know better than that. All \nof us know that. We have been on a binge, and it has to change. We \ncannot borrow money from China, for example, to give tax cuts to the \nwealthiest Americans. Somehow we have to change all of\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nthese issues. It is time for this country to sober up in fiscal policy \nand leadership from this Chamber as well.\n  We need a financial industry that stops gambling and starts lending, \nlending especially to those businesses that want to create jobs and \nwant to expand. We need a fair trade policy that stands up for American \nworkers for a change and promotes ``made in America'' again. We are not \ngoing to be a world economic power if we do not have world class \nmanufacturing capability. It is dissipating before our eyes. This is \nall about creating good jobs and expanding opportunities in this \ncountry. It is not happening with our current trade policy. It is \ntrading away America's future, and we know better than that.\n  On energy, we have ridden into a box canyon. Sixty percent of the oil \nwe use comes from other countries, some of it from countries that do \nnot like us very much. That holds us hostage, and we cannot continue \nthat. We need to produce more of all kinds of energy at home. We need \nto conserve more. We need more energy efficiency. We need to do all of \nthese to promote stability and security in this country.\n  Another issue that I have spent a lot of time working on deals with \nAmerican Indians. They were here first. We are talking about the first \nAmericans. They greeted all of us. They now live in Third World \nconditions in much of this country, and we have to do better. We have \nto keep our promises and we have to honor our treaties. In this \nCongress, I have had the privilege of chairing the Indian Affairs \nCommittee. This Congress, however, as tough as it has been, has done \nmore on Indian issues than in the previous 40 years. We passed the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act, the first time in 17 years. We \npassed the Tribal Law and Order Act that I and others helped write, \nwhich is so very important. We just passed yesterday the special \ndiabetes provisions that are so important to the Indians. We put $2\\1/\n2\\ billion in the Economic Recovery Act to invest in health care \nfacilities and education and the other things that are necessary in \nIndian Country.\n  We just passed the Cobell settlement which deals with a problem that \nhas existed for 150 years in which looting and stealing from Indian \ntrust accounts went on routinely. President Obama signed the bill last \nnight at the White House.\n  Those five things are the most important elements together that have \nbeen done in 40 years by a Congress dealing with Indian issues. But the \nwork is not nearly over, and we have to keep our promises and honor our \ntrust agreements.\n  We face some pretty big challenges. But the fact is, our grandparents \nand great-grandparents faced challenges that were much more significant \nas well, and they prevailed.\n  All of us in politics especially know the noise of democracy is \nunbelievable. It is relentless, incessantly negative, and it goes on \n24/7. We have bloviaters all over the country who are trying to make \nsounds from the chest seem like important messages from their brain. \nThey take almost everything they can find in any paper from any corner \nof this country that seems stupid and ugly and just way out of line, \nand they hold that up to the light on their program and they say: Isn't \nthis ugly?\n  Sure it is ugly, but it is not America. It is just some little \nobscene gesture somewhere in the corner of our country. It is not \nAmerica. There is this old saying, ``bad news travels halfway around \nthe world before good news gets its shoes on.'' That is what is \nhappening all the time. This country is full of good. It is full of \ngood things, good people, and good news. Every day people go to work to \nbuild, create, and invent, and they hope the future will be better than \nthe past.\n  There was a book titled ``You Can't Go Home Again'' by Thomas Wolfe. \nHe said there is a peculiar quality of the American soul, a peculiar \nquality of the American soul that has an almost indestructible belief, \na quenchless hope that things are going to be better, that something is \ngoing to turn up, that tomorrow is going to work out, and somehow that \nhas been what has been the hallmark of American aspirations.\n  When I graduated college with an MBA degree and got my first job in \nthe aerospace industry at a very young age, the first program or \nproject I worked on was called the Voyager Project. We were, with \nMartin-Marietta Corporation, building a landing vehicle for Mars. That \nwas 40 years ago. That program was discontinued after about 4 years.\n  But 5 years ago, the new program resulted in firing two missiles, two \nrockets from our country, 1 week apart. We aimed them at Mars. One week \napart the rockets lifted off with a payload. When they landed, 200 \nmillion miles later, they landed 1 week apart on the surface of Mars. \nThe payload had a shroud and it opened and a dune buggy drove off the \nshroud and started driving around on the surface of Mars. First one \ndid, and then a week later the second arrived. They were named Spirit \nand Opportunity. Five years ago, we began driving Spirit and \nOpportunity on the surface of Mars. They were American vehicles. They \nwere supposed to last for 90 days. We are still driving those dune \nbuggies on the surface of Mars 5 years later.\n  Spirit, very much like old men, got arthritis of the arm. So they say \nit hangs at kind of a permanent half salute.\n  Spirit also has five wheels, and one wheel broke. So the wheel didn't \nbreak off, but now it is digging a trench about 2 inches deeper on the \nsurface of Mars and the arthritic arm just barely gets there, but it \ndoes. It gets back to sample even a slightly bit deeper into the soil \nof Mars to tell us a little bit about what is going on. Spirit, by the \nway, also fell asleep about 1 year ago. They couldn't reach it. It \ntakes 9 minutes to communicate electronically, by radio, with these \ndune buggies on Mars. So they sent a signal to a satellite we have \ncircling Mars and had the satellite send a signal to Spirit and Spirit \nwoke right up. So two dune buggie-sized vehicles are traveling on the \nsurface of Mars driven by American genius.\n  My point in all this is, first of all, they are very aptly named \nduring challenging times--``Spirit'' and ``Opportunity,'' manufactured \nto last only 90 days but still driving around on the surface of Mars 5 \nyears later. If American invention and American initiative can build \nrockets and dune buggies and drive them on the surface of Mars, surely \nwe can fix the things that are important on planet Earth. I was going \nto say this isn't rocket science, but I guess it is.\n  This country is an unbelievable place. This is all a call to \nAmerica's future. Where we have been and what we have done, all these \nthings together ought to inspire us that we can do so much more.\n  George Bernard Shaw once said:\n\n       Life is no brief candle to me. It is a splendid torch which \n     I am able to hold but for a moment.\n\n  This is our moment. This is it.\n  About 15 years ago, I was leading a delegation of American \nCongressmen and Senators to meet with a group of European members of \nParliament about our disputes in trade. About an hour into the meeting, \nthe man who led the European delegation slid back in his chair, leaned \nacross to me, and he said: Mr. Senator, we have been speaking for an \nhour about how we disagree. I want to tell you something. I think you \nshould know how I feel about your country. I was a 14-year-old boy on a \nstreet corner in Paris, France, when the U.S. liberation Army marched \ndown the Champs-Elysees. An American soldier reached out his hand and \ngave me an apple as he marched past. I will go to my grave remembering \nthat moment, what it meant to me, what it meant to my family, what it \nmeant to my country.\n  I sort of sat back in my chair, thinking, here is this guy telling me \nabout who we are and where we have been and what we have meant to \nothers. It was pretty unbelievable. Our problems are nothing compared \nto where we can go and what we can be as a country, if we just do the \nright thing.\n  This Senate has a lot to offer the American people. I know its best \ndays are ahead. That splendid torch, that moment, that is here. That \ntorch exists in this Chamber as well.\n  I feel unbelievably proud to have been able to serve here with these \nmen and women for so long. I am going to go on to do other work. But I \nwill always watch this Chamber and those who will continue to work in \nthis Chamber and do what is important for this country's future. I will \nbe among the cheerleaders who say: Good for\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\nyou. Good for you. You know what is important, and you have steered \nAmerica toward a better future.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have just heard from Senator Dorgan, an \nextraordinary Senator and even more extraordinary as a friend. He has \nserved in the Congress for 30 years. He has served in public office in \nmy State for more than 40 years. It has been my privilege to call him \nmy best friend for 42 years. We just heard the remarkable ability he \nhas, a gift, to paint word pictures that communicate with people, that \nhelp us understand the consequences of the actions we take here.\n  In recent weeks, I have become very interested in the universe and \nthe vastness of what surrounds us. One of the things I have found most \nstriking is that 1 light-year takes light 1 year, it goes 5.8 trillion \nmiles and the universe is 12 to 15 billion light-years across. This is \na vastness that is hard for us to calculate. Scientists tell us it all \nstarted with a big bang almost 14 billion years ago. Now scientists are \nsaying it may not just be one big bang but there is a cycle that takes \nplace over 1 trillion years that leads to repeated big bangs. Byron \nDorgan has been a big bang in the Senate. He has made a difference \nhere. He has made an enormous difference in our home State of North \nDakota. He helped build a foundation that has made North Dakota, today, \nthe most successful State in the country--the lowest unemployment, the \nbest financial situation, the fastest economic growth. Byron Dorgan \nhelped build a foundation that has transformed our State. We are \nforever in his debt.\n  As his friend and colleague, we are forever grateful to the \ncontributions he has made to North Dakota and to the Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from North Dakota and add my voice as well to celebrate Senator \nDorgan's tenure in the Senate. I wish he was going to stay. He has been \nsomeone about getting things done. As somebody who has sat in the \npresiding chair a number of times, I have heard Senator Dorgan. Even \nwhen I don't fully agree with him, no one is more persuasive in arguing \nhis case.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8680-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Robert Bennett\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry I was tied up in other matters \ntoday and not able to hear speeches of some of our Senators who are \ndeparting. I will have more to say at a later time. I did want to say \non two of the Senators, I watched some of their remarks.\n  Senator Bennett from Utah is a very dear friend of mine. We have \ntraveled around as Members of the Senate, visiting places all over the \nworld. His wife Joyce is an accomplished artist. She is a flutist. She \nis well known here and in Utah. Senator Bennett is a very courageous \nman. What a disappointment he was not reelected. I am not usually \ngiving speeches for my Republican colleagues, but it is a real loss to \nthe country that Senator Bennett will not return to the Senate. He is a \nvery courageous man. He represents the ideals of the State of Utah. He \nis a very devout member of his church. He is a person who calls his \npolitical issues the way he sees them. His having been criticized for \nsupporting his President, a Republican President, on the Toxic Asset \nRelief Program is unfair. This was one of the most important issues we \nfaced in ages in this country, and I think the proof is in the pudding. \nOf the hundreds of billions of dollars--almost $1 trillion--that were \nput out for that fund, all but $25 billion is paid back and most of the \neconomists say we will get more than that back from some of the things \nthat were invested in.\n  I admire the public service of Senator Bennett. It has been \noutstanding. It meets the accomplishments of his father who also served \nvery well in the U.S. Senate. I am going to miss him a great deal. What \na wonderful human being. He is an author. He has in the past been a \nvery successful businessman, and I think one of the most accomplished \nlegislators I have had the pleasure to deal with.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Byron Dorgan from North Dakota is such a fine person. He for many \nyears has had the same job I had under Senator Daschle, the head of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee, and he rendered valuable service to the \ncaucus, to the Senate, and the whole country in his capacity there. We \nserved together in the House of Representatives. We have traveled \ntogether. His wife Kim is such a fine human being. I am going to miss \nByron. He is and has been one of my close advisers, close friends. I \nhope I am not being boastful here, but I don't think Tom Daschle had \ntwo better friends in the Senate than Dorgan and Reid. We were very \nclose to him. We admired our friend Tom Daschle and did everything we \ncould to make his life here as pleasant as possible.\n  As far as being a good speaker, he is very good. He has a unique way \nof communicating that very few people I have known have had. He is \nsomeone who, as far as the finances of this country and the world, is \nwithout peer as a legislator. He knows it all, and he has a way of \narticulating his views that is unique and I think very powerful. So I \nam going to miss Byron Dorgan very much. He is a wonderful human being. \nI care a great deal about him. I have watched his son and daughter grow \nup. They are in college now. I remember them when they were little \nkids. In fact, my son Key, who was a fine athlete at the University of \nVirginia, when he was playing on those national champion soccer teams \nat the University of Virginia, gave Byron's son Brendon a few soccer \nlessons. So I am grateful for the friendship of Senator Bennett and \nSenator Dorgan.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  Senator Bunning, I of course admire because of his great athletic \nskills. He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. To think I have \nhad the opportunity to serve in the Senate with one of the great \npitchers of all time. I love talking to Jim Bunning about his baseball \ndays. Some of the stories he has told I have repeated many times and I \nwill never forget them. One of the things he said that I have repeated \non a number of occasions--Jim Bunning was a great pitcher, an All-Star \nwith no-hitters in both leagues. But he has some humility, because he \nsaid there was Sandy Koufax and there was the rest of us. He and I \ndon't vote often the same way, but he is a man who has a strong \nopinion, and I am going to miss Jim Bunning and the ability for me to \ntalk to him about his athletic feats. I certainly wish him well in \nwhatever his endeavors may be in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8680-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8680-S8683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011--MOTION TO \n                            PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, discrimination has never served America very \nwell. When it applies to those who serve America in the Armed Forces, \nit is both disgraceful and counterproductive.\n  The theory behind don't ask, don't tell is a thing that happened way \nin the past. The theory behind this should be a thing of the past, and \nwe should put the policy behind us. It is obsolete, it is embarrassing, \nand it weakens our military and offends the very values we ask our \ntroops to defend. We need to match our policy with our principle and \nfinally say that in the United States, everyone who steps up to serve \nour country should be welcomed. That is the only argument that is right \nand it should be enough.\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\n  That is not the only reason we should repeal it. Repealing it will \nmake our military stronger. It doesn't make America safer to discharge \ntroops with critically needed skills, and that is exactly what has \nhappened. This policy is responsible for the discharge of about 14,000 \nhighly qualified service men and women--people whom we have spent \nmillions of dollars training--and we never will know how many wanted to \nsign up but stayed away because of don't ask, don't tell. It doesn't \nmake us stronger to limit military readiness of an all-volunteer force. \nDon't ask, don't tell doesn't help morale; it hurts morale.\n  The other side may feel passionately that our military should \nsanction discrimination based on sexual orientation, but they are \nclearly in the minority and they have run out of excuses. The Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff supports repealing it. So does the \nSecretary of Defense. The vast majority of the military say that it \nwould not oppose repeal. The majority of Americans support repealing it \ntoo. There is simply no evidence and no justification--legal, military, \nor otherwise--for keeping this policy in place. There is no reason to \nkeep America's citizens from fighting for a country they love because \nof whom they love.\n  The next Speaker of the House has asked why we would get into this \ndebate. He said, Why should we get into this debate during a time of \ntwo wars and ongoing security concerns? I think wartime is exactly the \nright time to do everything we can to strengthen our military. It \ncouldn't be a better time.\n  What opponents of don't ask, don't tell don't want to ask is what \nthis policy tells us about equality between our principle and our \npractice. We can no longer ask our troops to die for a flag that \nrepresents justice and ask them to be false to themselves while they do \nit.\n  The other side knows it doesn't have the votes to take this repeal \nout of the Defense Authorization Act, so they have been holding up this \nbill for a long time--for months. And the latest--the Chair certainly \nhas known about it--is a letter from 42 Senators in a further effort to \nstall this legislation, saying we have to finish the tax bill and we \nhave to finish the spending bill before you can do anything of a \nlegislative nature. What kind of sense is that, when we are so crammed \nwith things to do? With all the things we have to do, why would they do \nthat, other than simply trying to avoid it, and they have been doing it \nfor a long time. We tried every possible way to move forward. When they \nrefuse to debate it, they also hold up the other good and important, \nurgently needed parts of the bill. It is not only don't ask, don't \ntell.\n  The bill before us contains an across-the-board pay raise for all of \nthe members of the military. More than that, we authorized over 35 \ndifferent bonuses and special pay incentives that our troops depend on \nto make ends meet. Let me be clear: Failure to pass this bill means our \ntroops will lose these benefits.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee was on the floor today \nsaying if we don't do it today, we can't do it. In fact, everyone knows \nthey have stalled this so long, they have stalled this so long that \nmeeting cloture--the average time for a conference committee on this \nbill is 70 days--70 days; not 7, 70 days.\n  The bill also contains provisions that would expand health care for \ntroops and their families and significantly enhance mental health care \nfor servicemembers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. It would fund \ncritical troop protection needs such as MRAPs and up-armored humvees, \nwhich are desperately needed on the battlefield. It would support \ncritical missions in Afghanistan, including expanding intelligence \ncollection efforts, disrupting Taliban finances, and building the \nAfghan National Army so that Afghanistan can take responsibility for \nits own security. These are not minor or unimportant issues. These are \nlife-and-death matters for real Americans risking their lives for us, \nfor our defense. We ask our troops to trust us and fight for us and be \nbrave enough to stand in the line of fire. When we send our troops into \nbattle, we do so because we believe strongly that we stand on the right \nside of history. We have to believe that, because we know the \nconsequences of war and the terrible burdens it carries.\n  Not far from here--I hope the Presiding Officer has the opportunity \nto see this during his tenure here in the Senate--is the Congressional \nCemetery. It is worth going and seeing. It is 2 miles southeast of \nwhere we stand right now on the banks of the Anacostia River. It is a \nfinal resting place of veterans of every war this Nation has ever \nfought. It is not Arlington. It is the Congressional Cemetery. It is \nalso where 19 U.S. Senators, more than 70 Congressmen, a former Speaker \nof the House, and a former Vice President are buried. One tombstone \nthere belongs to an Air Force sergeant who fought in Vietnam. He became \nfamous shortly after that war ended when he tried to be in the military \nand out of the closet at the same time.\n  He lost that fight. His tombstone at Congressional Cemetery reads as \nfollows:\n\n       When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for \n     killing two men and a discharge for loving one.\n\n  America is better than that. When it comes to equality in the \nmilitary, we know which side is the right side of history. The only \nquestion is whether we are brave enough to stand there.\n  In a few moments, I will move to reconsider the motion to proceed to \nthis bill. This legislation is critical for our troops, and it is \nunconscionable to leave here without passing it. I bent over backward \nto find a way to get this bill done. It is clear that Republicans--a \nfew of them--don't want to vote on repealing don't ask, don't tell. \nThey are all doing what they can to stand in the way of the bill. They \nwant to block a vote on this issue at all costs, even if it means we do \nnot pass the Defense authorization bill for the first time in 48 years, \neven if it means our troops don't get the funding and protections they \nneed.\n  What we have gone through to try to get this bill on the floor \nreminds me of a story--it is not a story; it is an experience I had as \na boy. I don't know how old I was. Let's say I was about 11. As \neveryone knows now, I was born in a little town on the southeastern tip \nof Nevada. I never traveled anyplace. I was a teenager before I went to \nNeedles, CA, which was about 50 miles from Searchlight.\n  My brother, 10 years older than I, got out of high school and got a \njob in Ash Fork, AZ, working for Standard stations. It was a big deal \nthat he was going to take his little brother there to spend a week. I \nwas excited. It was wonderful. Ash Fork was quite a ways from \nSearchlight--a couple hundred miles. But the reason I am telling you \nthis story is that my brother was busy after work with his girlfriend--\nmore so than with his little brother--so he palmed me off a lot of the \ntime on his girlfriend's brother, who was a little bit older than I. \nThere wasn't a thing in the world her little brother could do as well \nas I could. In all the games we would play, do you know something? I \nnever won a single game. Why? Because he kept changing the rules during \nthe game. It didn't matter what the game was, he kept changing the \nrules. So I was always the loser.\n  Well, that is what is happening here on this bill. It doesn't matter \nwhat I do; before we get to the end of it, they change the rules again. \nHow about four amendments--two on each side? No. Anyway, we have gone \nthrough all these different iterations and everything. No, we can't do \nit.\n  I have already tried to bring this bill to the floor twice this year. \nIn fact, I offered to bring it up this summer, with no restrictions, \nbut the Republicans refused this request. It is just like I talked \nabout my trip to Ash Fork, AZ, where I could not win because the rules \nkept being changed--because my friends on the other side of the aisle \nblocked both of these attempts. Now we are trying to get this bill done \nin a lameduck session when everybody knows we have so much to do and we \ndon't have time for unlimited debate. Some of the requests have been \nreally unusual. Seven days of debate. Think about that. Seven days of \ndebate in a lameduck session. I have tried my best to find a way \nforward that would ensure a fair and reasonable opportunity for \ncolleagues on the other side to offer and vote on amendments.\n  Over the last 20 years, we have had rollcall votes on an average of \n12 amendments during consideration of the Defense authorization bill. \nSo in an\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\neffort to be as fair as possible, I have made it clear to my colleagues \nthat I am willing to vote on 15 relevant amendments, 10 from the \nRepublicans and 5 from the Democratic side--some Democrats don't like \nthat, but we would do it--with ample time for debate on each amendment, \nbut we never can get enough time. We started out with an hour, but that \nis not enough. My colleagues on this side of the aisle are demanding \neven more time--time they know is not available. There are not enough \ndays in this calendar year to do what the minority is asking, and they \nknow this. They want the tax and the spending bills done first, as we \nhave talked about. At the same time they say we need to wait, they say \nthey need as much time as possible to consider the bill. It is \nimpossible to do both. It is illogical and unreasonable. It is quite \nclear that they are trying to run out the clock. Senator Levin said \nhere this morning that they probably would have done it anyway. That is \ntoo bad.\n  I want to be clear that my remarks should in no way be taken as a \ncriticism of my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. Quite the \ncontrary. She has tried. I have respect for her, and I have worked with \nher as the only Republican on a number of occasions--and two or three \nothers on occasion--to try to move forward on many of the Nation's top \npriorities. I believe she has been doing her very best. But for her I \nwould not have been able to get any of these arrangements that they \nturned down. At the same time, members of her caucus are working \nequally as hard to defeat this measure at all costs.\n  In my effort to get this done, I don't know how I could have been \nmore reasonable. Despite the critical importance for our troops, for \nour Nation, and for justice that we get this bill done, we have not \nbeen able to reach an agreement. I regret that our troops will pay the \nprice for our inability.\n  I now move to reconsider the vote that has previously been made on \nthis matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President----\n  Mr. REID. It is nondebatable. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the motion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to S. 3454 be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be agreed to, and the Senate now \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. \n3454, upon reconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader a \nquestion through the Chair.\n  Unfortunately, I was not able to hear the majority leader's speech, \nfor which I apologize. I was in a meeting, and as soon as I found out \nhe was speaking, I rushed to the floor. I want to make sure, since this \nis an important bill and an important issue, that I understand \nprecisely what it is the majority leader is proposing. So I ask through \nthe Chair whether the majority leader is proposing a procedure where \nthere would be no amendments and the tree would be filled or whether \nthe majority leader is proposing an agreement that he and I and Senator \nLieberman discussed yesterday, which would have allowed for 15 \namendments, 10 on the Republican side and 5 on the Democratic side. \nAgain, if the majority leader explained this and I missed it, I \napologize. I received conflicting information about how the majority \nleader intends to proceed on this important bill.\n  I note that we have been in quorum calls for hours during which we \ncould have proceeded to the tax bill and started working on it, and we \ncould be working this weekend as well.\n  But I would very much appreciate hearing from the majority leader \nexactly what his intent is.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope my friend heard the nice things I \nsaid about her in my statement.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Unfortunately, I missed those as well.\n  Mr. REID. They were pretty good. I want to be very candid with my \nfriend. In an effort to do the things the Senator from Maine and I \ntalked about with Senator Lieberman on a number of occasions, including \nyesterday and the day before, all of those require filling the tree, \nevery one of them. That is just the way it is. The only way we can have \nsome control over amendments is to do it that way.\n  The answer to my friend's question--would I fill the tree--the answer \nis yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could pose a further question to the \nmajority leader through the Chair, I understand what the majority \nleader is saying, but as he discussed his plan with me, he would, in \nfact, allow 15 amendments--10 to be offered on the Republican side that \nwould be amendments of the Republican side's choice as long as they \nwere relevant to the bill--and he would ensure that there would be \nvotes on those amendments. So I am confused when I hear he is going to \nfill the tree because that implies to me that he would not be allowing \nthose 15 amendments we discussed--10 on our side, of our choice, as \nlong as they were relevant to the bill. So I am truly trying to find \nout what the agreement is.\n  Mr. REID. The agreement is that I have made a number of different \noffers and have made other suggestions. In direct answer to the \nSenator's question, we have to fill the tree, of course. We have to \nwork through the amendments. I tried to come up with some agreement on \namendments and time and what some of the amendments would be. That is \nhow we always do things here.\n  I will also say this: I have had kind of a hard thing to work through \nbecause all I have worked on in the last few weeks has been with the \noverhanging problem of not--42 Republicans, in a letter, have said: You \nare not going to do anything legislatively. Mr. President, they have \nproved that they are not allowing us to do anything legislatively. \nCertainly, this is a legislative matter.\n  I think I have been as clear as I can be. I, of course, would be \nwilling to work on the amendment process with my friend. But as far as \nagreeing to something right now, I cannot do that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it seems evident to me that, \nunfortunately, the majority leader is not pursuing the path we \ndiscussed, or at least that is my interpretation of what he is saying. \nI think that is so unfortunate.\n  I want to vote to proceed to this bill. I was the first Republican to \nannounce my support for the carefully constructed language in the Armed \nServices Committee that would repeal don't ask, don't tell. But that is \nnot all that is in this bill. This is an enormously important bill to \nour troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. It authorizes a pay raise that is \nimportant to my home State. It is a vitally important bill.\n  I just do not understand why we can't proceed along a path that will \nbring us to success and that will allow us to get the 60 votes to \nproceed, which I am willing to be one of those 60 votes. I thought we \nwere extremely close to getting a reasonable agreement yesterday that \nwould allow us to proceed. I was even willing to consider a proposal by \nthe majority leader that we would start the DOD bill and then go to the \ntax bill, finish the tax bill, and then return to finish the DOD bill. \nI think there is such a clear path for us to be able to get this bill \ndone, and I am perplexed and frustrated that this important bill is \ngoing to become a victim of politics. We should be able to do better.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have been bargaining in good faith with the \nmajority leader. He, too, has been creative in his approaches.\n  So I just want to say that I am perplexed as to what has happened and \nwhy we are not going forward in a constructive way that would lead to \nsuccess.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I stated in my remarks earlier, this is \nnot any kind of a legislative wrangle I am having with my friend from \nMaine. She has been the only person I could talk to about this \nlegislation. I appreciate her time and efforts. But the only way we can \ndo this--and we do it all the time--is I fill the tree and we will try \nto work through the amendments with some agreement after that is done. \nThis has been taking months to do--months. The time has come, as \nSenator Levin said, to stop playing around.\n  Mr. President, I simply make the following request: I ask upon \nreconsideration, cloture is invoked--the reason I\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\ndo this, we can get to where I want to go. It takes three votes. We can \ndo it with three votes or one vote. Upon reconsideration, cloture is \ninvoked on the motion to proceed. Then the Senate can proceed to the \nbill and would be able to enter into an orderly process for \nconsideration of the bill, allowing different amendments. We have \nalready been through that. There is no need to go through that number. \nBut we have talked about 15--5 from us, the Democrats.\n\n  So I make my request. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \ninvoked on the motion to proceed to S. 3454 be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be agreed to, and the Senate now vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3454, upon \nreconsideration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, did the Chair rule on my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 414, S. 3454, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.\n         Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Tom Udall, Jack Reed, Barbara A. \n           Mikulski, Jon Tester, Al Franken, Richard J.

The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the motion to proceed to S. 3454, the Department of \nDefense authorization bill, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I wish to be \nconsidered--I wish to have been recorded as voting ``yes.''\n  Apparently, I cannot be recorded, and I understand that. I just \nwanted to make note that had I been here I would have voted ``yes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so note.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Great. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8683-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8683-S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3463\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have alerted the other side I am about \nto make a unanimous consent request on an important piece of \nlegislation. Unfortunately, in the last couple of years we have gotten \ninto this habit of: Nobody wants to vote yes or no, they want to vote \nmaybe. It is easier to block things from even being considered.\n  Frankly, in my State of Vermont people expect if they elect you to \nthe Senate that you have the courage to vote yes or no, but not maybe.\n  We just saw another example of this. We cannot even get a yes-or-no \nvote on Defense authorization at a time when our Nation is in two wars. \nWe cannot get a yes-or-no vote; we get a maybe.\n  I find it frustrating. Over and over we have done it today. People \nare prepared to vote yes or no, but the other side says, no; it is \neasier to vote maybe. Then you never have to explain anything.\n  We all know what has happened in the Deepwater Horizon BP spill. A \nnumber of brave families' members were lost. I would note for the sake \nof the Senate, if they had been building the Deepwater Horizon drilling \nplatform, and they were assembling it on land and something was \nnegligently done and someone lost their life, they could recover for \nthe value of the life. Because of a quirk in the law, because it \nhappened at sea, even though it may have been caused by the same thing, \nthese people--their lives are almost valueless. There is a way to fix \nthem. We have drawn, after months of negotiation, a very tightly put \ntogether piece of legislation that will only affect the families of the \n11 hard-working men who died when the Deepwater Horizon was destroyed. \nI am going to make this so we can vote yes or no and not maybe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience and Transportation be discharged from further consideration of \nthe Survivors Equality Act, S. 3463; that the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; the Rockefeller-Leahy amendment that is at the \ndesk be adopted; the bill, as amended, then be read a third time and \npassed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; and all \nstatements and the text of the amendment that has been hotlined for \nmore than a week be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, this is a nation of laws \nnot of men. It destroys that whole foundation of our legal system when \nwe make retroactive law. This bill has not been vetted properly by a \ncommittee. Again, it undermines our whole system of the rule of law. So \nI am compelled to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, of course, this bill has been given an \nenormous amount of scrutiny by both Republicans and Democrats. Six \nmonths ago, I introduced the Survivors Equality Act, S. 3463, with \nSenator Durbin and Senator Whitehouse, to help the families of those \nwho die on the high seas. In fact, the day of the hearing, we had \nMichelle Jones, pictured here, in our mind when we held that hearing.\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\nThat same day, June 8, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nliability cap that harms victims' families. We heard testimony from \nMichelle Jones's brother-in-law, Chris Jones. He is the brother of \nGordon Jones, one of those who died aboard the Deepwater Horizon. It \nwas very moving testimony. I think everybody, both parties, felt the \nemotion in that room.\n  A few weeks later, the Commerce Committee also held a hearing on the \nsame matter. I think it is unfortunate and a slam to the families to \nsay that this matter has not been vetted. The Commerce Committee also \nhad a hearing. Then we had months and months of work, Republicans and \nDemocrats meeting, trying to make as tightly drawn piece of legislation \nas possible.\n  After these months and months of work, I hope the Senate is finally \ngoing to do justice to the families of the men who died when the \nDeepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. At least stand up and \nsay yes or no. Vote either to give them justice or vote not to give \nthem justice. Do not do this unfortunate habit we are getting into of \nvoting maybe. Let's not vote on this bill. Let's not take a position \none way or the other. We will object to the bill coming up.\n  It allows everybody to be a maybe. It allows people to go and say: \nWell, we are so sympathetic for your family. We wish we could help your \nfamily. Certainly, if the bill comes up, I may vote.\n  Well, we have a whole lot of people ready to vote for the bill. Vote \nyes; vote no. That is what I have been trying to do since that \ncatastrophic event. We did have a lot of negotiations, and we did have \nto whittle it back at the request of people on the other side of the \naisle. The proposal has been so narrow that it will help only the \nfamilies of the 11 hard-working men who died when the Deepwater Horizon \noil rig exploded last April.\n  So by saying there are a lot of things that can be done for them if \none second before that oil rig left land when it was being constructed, \nif it exploded there and they lost their lives, but it is a different \nrule if you have gone 100 yards further, a few seconds later, and you \nare at sea.\n  That is why I came to the floor today to seek the Senate's consent to \npass this legislation without further delay. It is designed to provide \na more equitable remedy under the Death on the High Seas Act, the Jones \nAct, for the survivors of those killed on Deepwater Horizon. When I \nrefer to it as the difference between when it is on land or on sea, as \nthe law is now, the families will be given far less protection simply \nbecause their loved ones died on the open seas rather than if they had \ndied in a well, for example, if they are working at a well and there is \nan explosion, but the well is on land.\n  That is not fair. It reminds me of an earlier era in our history. The \nlaw should be modernized for those families without further delay. Of \ncourse, I would like the modernization to be broader, to cover victims \non cruise ships, for instance. Some here in this body have objected to \ncovering victims on cruise ships.\n  That is why I said: OK. You might not be willing to cover victims in \nother accidents on the high seas, but at least the U.S. Senate should \nnot turn its back on the families of these 11 men.\n  I am also concerned about timeliness. These victims' families' claims \nhave been unnecessarily delayed because they are thoughtlessly lumped \nin with thousands of other claims for economic damage. It should be \npretty easy to spot the 11 where the people died. This legislative \nproposal, on which I have worked with Senators Rockefeller, Whitehouse, \nand others, would ensure fairness and timeliness for these families. We \nhave had strong bipartisan support. We have a number of Republicans who \nsupport this legislation. Senators on both sides of the aisle have \nheard from these families. They understand the inequities they face. \nThe proposal has been circulating through the Senate for more than a \nweek. It should not be stopped. Let us vote yes or no. If you don't \nlike this legislation, vote against it. But don't vote maybe. Don't \nhave the Senate give that kind of procedural slap in the face to these \nfamilies by saying: We don't have the courage to vote yes or no so we \nare going to vote maybe.\n  Time is running out for these 11 families to know they are going to \nbe treated fairly and not be forced to wait for years to see if their \nlosses are addressed. The legislation only applies to the Deepwater \nHorizon disaster, the largest oil spill in our Nation's history. Let us \nact for the widows and children of these men before we head home to be \nwith our own families during the holiday season. They need our help \nnow. We should at least be able to agree to this limited fix. Again, \nvote yes or vote no. Don't vote maybe. Stop the months of delay. There \nis no justification for the failure to act on this deeply personal \ntragic issue. It has been pending for months. Both sides have been \nrunning hot lines on it for more than a week. It is a 5-page proposal. \nIt is easy to understand.\n  I will never forget the testimony of Chris Jones before the Judiciary \nCommittee. His father was sitting there. He talked about his brother \nlosing his life and meeting his brother's widow Michelle Jones. \nMichelle has lost the love of her life, but her two young sons have \nlost their father.\n  This is not about politics. This should not be partisan. This is \nabout justice for these kids who are facing a Christmas without their \nfathers, justice for widows who want closure, who are bravely fighting \nfor their families.\n  Can we not at least once in this body not vote maybe but have the \ncourage to vote yes or no, not hide behind an objection to a bill \ncoming up that many Republicans and Democrats support, at least allow \npeople to be on record?\n  Look at this family, say: I am going to vote yes or no, not, gee, I \ndon't have time. We just voted maybe. I think it is unfortunate. It \nshows disdain for these families. I regret the objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the draft of the Rockefeller, Leahy, and \nSchumer amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage \nthe chairman in a brief colloquy regarding this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank him for his leadership, for his compassion. I \nwas proud to join him as a cosponsor of his legislation. It is \ndisturbing to me that his effort to speak for these families who have \nlost their loved ones has fallen on deaf ears and on a procedural \nobjection that could just as easily have not stood. As we stand here in \nthis empty room, where right now we could be voting on help for these \n11 families, instead, we are milling about, killing time and waiting \nfor something to happen.\n  I want to ask the chairman: If this oil rig that exploded and burned \nhad been on land and these same 11 workers had been killed, would they \nbe treated differently and far more generously, and would their \nfamilies be treated differently and far more generously than in this \nactual case just because it happened to be out in the ocean as a \ndeepwater drilling rig?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator is absolutely correct. When \nwe held these hearings, he was an indispensable part. This is an \ninexplicable anomaly of the law that reflects a different era. Had they \nbeen assembling, for example, this oil rig, had they had it on land and \nit exploded, they would be able to recover as anybody could. If it was \nan onshore oil rig--of course, we have many in this country and \nthroughout the world--if they had been working on that and there had \nbeen an explosion and they lost their lives, there would have been \nremedies available. But because it was at sea and even if it is just \nbarely at sea, the remedies are entirely different. To put it in \nlaymen's terms, they are basically limited to the value of what is \nleft. Of course, there is nothing left.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Under the circumstances of this case, I know the \nobjection was founded upon concern that this would defeat the \nexpectations of potential defendants who might otherwise have to pay \nthis verdict. As I understand it, the two most likely responsible \nparties--indeed, the one already decreed by the government for \npollution purposes to be the responsible party--are BP and Halliburton, \ntwo enormous multinational corporations. If I am not mistaken, what we \nhave done today is to send 11 American families, whose father, brother, \nor husband was lost through no fault of that individual from a tragic \naccident that has been described as being the result of real ineptitude \nand very poor safety practices out on that rig by big corporations, we \nare now taking the side of BP and Halliburton against those 11 families \nhere on the eve of the Christmas holidays, taking away rights they \nwould have if this accident had happened on the land.\n  My question is, don't we think that BP and Halliburton could afford \nthis? It is not as though it is the little Sisters of Mercy whom we are \ngoing to put out of business if we allow this to go forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is correct. Basically what the Senate has said \nis, we will protect British Petroleum and Halliburton over the rights \nand needs of the families of 11 men who died because of negligence. Is \nthis what the Senate has come to? Is this what it has come to? By our \nfailure to even vote, our unwillingness to stand up and vote, our \neffort to do a maybe instead of a yes or no, we are sending a Christmas \npresent. I suppose we should say Merry Christmas, British Petroleum, \nMerry Christmas, Halliburton. We protected you and saved you from \nhaving to pay for your negligence. That is a pretty cold signal to send \nto these families of the 11 men who died.\n  Frankly, as I have often said, the Senate should be the conscience of \nthe Nation. How do we express our conscience when we don't even have \nthe courage to vote yes or no on a matter of this significance?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chairman for his leadership and for his \ncompassion. I am proud to join him today in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8685-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Madam President, we have again witnessed \ngridlock at its worst on the heels of the vote that just concluded. \nWhen the Senate was given a chance to lead on critical issues crucial \nto our national security, to our troops and to our leadership in the \n21st century, the Senate let politics obstruct progress that we should \nmake.\n  This is the second time this year we have prevented ourselves, if you \nwill, from debating critical national security issues. Like so many \nother debates that we wanted to have this year, this one was derailed \nby obstruction before it even began.\n  The last time the minority party blocked debate of a national defense \nauthorization act, they argued that the DREAM Act should not be \nconsidered as an amendment to the bill and that we needed to wait on \nthe report of the Pentagon study group on how to repeal don't ask, \ndon't tell before we can vote on the broader bill.\n  This time we did consider the DREAM Act in a separate vote and this \ntime, after voting today, we voted after the Pentagon's task force on \ndon't ask, don't tell has weighed in with the most comprehensive review \nof a personnel policy that DOD has ever conducted on any policy being \nproposed. But the obstruction continues. There are new excuses this \ntime. Opponents now say we need to extend tax breaks before we can \nconsider legislation necessary to ensure our national security. It \ndoesn't seem to matter to those who voted no today that the Pentagon \nstudy group looking at repeal confirmed what many of us have been \nsaying for years, that don't ask, don't tell can be overturned without \ndisrupting our Nation's military readiness. It doesn't seem to matter \nto these opponents that Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and a host of \nother military and civilian leaders believe that repeal by a Federal \njudge would be far more disruptive and damaging to readiness and morale \nthan repeal through legislation that has been thoughtfully and \ncomprehensively drafted by the Congress. This wide-ranging and highly \nrespected group of military and civilian leaders has strongly urged us, \nthe Senate, to act on this Defense authorization bill this month.\n\n  Unlike what some on the other side of the aisle have claimed, the \nrepeal language in this legislation respects the Pentagon's timeline \nand it gives our military leaders the flexibility they say they need to \nimplement repeal in a way that tracks with military standards and \nguidelines. The best way to change the policy is for elected \nrepresentatives--that is us--to pass the\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nlegislation before us now and to do it this year.\n  But the vote we just had means we will have no debate on don't ask, \ndon't tell. And just as importantly--and I know the Presiding Officer \nserves on the Foreign Relations Committee--it thwarts a serious \ndiscussion about pressing national security issues. Imagine that. We \nare prevented from debating fundamental national security concerns at a \ntime of two wars. People in my State of Colorado do not understand such \nobstruction, and I do not think Americans all across the country do.\n  This is further illuminated because every year for nearly a half \ncentury, Congress has taken up and passed a bill renewing our defense \npolicies for the Nation for the coming year. That is 48 years \nconsecutively. And this Defense authorization bill, like all those that \ncame before it, is as critically important as the 48 that have preceded \nit. It provides funding for our military operations in Afghanistan and \nPakistan and Iraq. It supports our servicemembers and keeps Americans \nsafe through needed resources and policies, including fair and \ncompetitive pay and benefits for our men and women in uniform.\n  The bill also includes many important provisions directed at the \nhealth and needs of our servicemembers' families. Specifically, if I \nmight, I want to mention a provision I authored with help from other of \nmy colleagues which would extend health insurance for military \nfamilies, enabling children of active-duty servicemembers and retirees \nto stay on their parents' policies until they turn age 26. It is \nsimilar to what we did in the Affordable Care Act last year and this \nyear more broadly for Americans.\n  Also importantly, this legislation provides improved care for our \nwounded servicemembers and their families--not just the physical wounds \nof war but also the mental wounds of war.\n  As I conclude, I have to tell you I remain hopeful that somehow this \nCongress can find a way, even in the midst of this partisan rancor, to \npass this Defense authorization bill for the 49th consecutive year. I \nam willing to stay until Christmas, even through Christmas, and the \nweek after, to get this done.\n  I will tell you, if we cannot get don't ask, don't tell repeal as \npart of the Defense authorization bill, I am willing to stay through \nthe holidays to debate it on the floor as a stand-alone measure, and I \nwill urge my colleagues to join me in that debate.\n  So despite the vote today, I have to say I am optimistic about our \nfuture, and I am committed, as I know the Presiding Officer is, to a \nnew kind of politics where we can find consensus among our \ndisagreement. I know the people of our States and Americans at large \nwant us to tackle tough decisions. It is why they sent us here: to \nresolve the tough problems. But I think opportunities that are inherent \nin those problems led us to want to serve in the Nation's capital.\n  Let's reach out to each other. Let's find common ground. Let's call \non each other to work together to accomplish our shared priorities and \ndemonstrate support for our Armed Forces. After all, they are standing \nup for us. We can stand up for them. Americans sent us here to do no \nless.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in these closing weeks of the 111th \nCongress, the Senate will be saying goodbye to a number of retiring \ncolleagues. But, for my part, I will miss them all, but I have to be \nhonest, the most poignant farewell will be to my dear friend, Senator \nChris Dodd of Connecticut.\n  Chris and I have much in common. We are both proud of our Irish \nroots. We were both elected to the House of Representatives at the same \ntime, in the famous post-Watergate election of 1974. Chris moved over \nhere to the Senate in 1980, and I followed 4 years later. We both ran \nfor President--with similarly unambiguous results. Over the years, we \nhave collaborated on many legislative initiatives, including, most \nrecently, the historic Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--the \nhealth reform bill.\n  As we all know, Chris Dodd is almost literally a son of the Senate. \nWith good reason, he is enormously proud of his father, Thomas J. Dodd, \nwho was a lead prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials and served two terms \nin the Senate, from 1959 to 1971. Chris worked as a Senate page at age \n16, and was elected to the Senate at age 36. For three decades, Chris \nhas embodied everything that is good about this body: a passion for \npublic service, a sincere desire to reach out across the aisle, a great \ntalent for forging coalitions and bringing people together, and a \nwillingness to work extraordinarily long hours in order to accomplish \nbig and important things.\n  Over the decades, Senator Dodd has been a leading champion of working \nAmericans, fighting for safer workplaces, the right to organize, \nstronger public schools, better access to higher education, and, of \ncourse, quality health care as a right not a privilege. He was the \nauthor of 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, which for the first time \nentitled every American to have leave from their job to take care of \nchildren or elderly relatives.\n  Make no mistake, Senator Dodd is leaving the Senate at the very top \nof his game. Last year, when Senator Kennedy fell ill, Chris picked up \nthe torch of health care reform. When I became chair of the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee, I asked him to continue to take the \nlead in forging the final bill, which he had led so expertly on before, \nand which will go down in history as one of America's great progressive \naccomplishments, on a par with Social Security and Medicare.\n  Even before final passage of health reform, Senator Dodd, as chair of \nthe Banking Committee, was hard at work crafting yet another historic \nbill: the most sweeping reform of Wall Street and the banking industry \nsince the Great Depression.\n  To be sure, other Senators played important roles in passing health \nreform and Wall Street reform. But it was Senator Dodd's dogged work \nand virtuoso skills as a legislator that ultimately won the day. These \ntwo landmark laws are a tremendous living legacy to the senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut. He has made his mark as one of the great reformers in \nthe history of the U.S. Senate.\n  Chris Dodd has accomplished many things during his three decades in \nthis body. But, in my book, the highest accolade is simply that Chris \nDodd is a good, generous and decent person, with a passion for fairness \nand social justice.\n\n  For me, it has been a great honor to be his friend and colleague for \nthe last 36 years. Our friendship, of course, will continue. But I will \nmiss the day-to-day association with Chris here on the floor, in \ncommittee, and elsewhere here on the Hill.\n  Paul Wellstone used to say that ``the future belongs to those with \npassion.'' By that definition, our friend Chris Dodd has a wonderful \nfuture ahead of him. No question he is full of passion, passion for \ndoing what is right for the people of this country. But no question, \nthe Senate is losing a giant--one of our most accomplished and \nrespected members. We are also losing a happy warrior in the mold of \nFDR and Hubert Humphrey. As the columnist E.J. Dionne has written, \n``The happiness quotient in the Senate will definitely drop when \n[Senator] Dodd leaves.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  For 36 years in Congress, Chris Dodd has faithfully served the people \nof Connecticut and the people of the United States. And there is no \ndoubt that he will pursue new avenues of public service in retirement.\n  As I said, I will miss his friendship and counsel here in the Senate. \nBut I wish Chris, his wonderful wife Jackie, and their wonderful young \nchildren, Grace and Christina, the very best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              ted kaufman\n\n  Madam President, when our colleague Ted Kaufman, who is leaving, was \nsworn in as Senator in January 2009 to succeed the newly elected Vice \nPresident, Senator Joe Biden, he made it clear that he would not run \nfor election in 2010. He noted that he had not\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nraised money to become a Senator and would not raise money to be \nelected 2 years later. He would be a free man, beholden to no special \ninterest, determined to do only what is right for the people of \nDelaware and the United States.\n  Senator Kaufman has made good on that pledge. He may no longer be a \nMember of the Senate since the swearing in of the new Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Coons, but in just 2 years in the Senate, he left his \nmark--both legislatively and in the esteem of Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Of course, it should come as no surprise that Ted Kaufman excelled in \nthis body, and had influence and clout far beyond what is typical for a \nreshman Senator whose tenure was only going to be 2 years. After all, \nhe came to this body with a distinguished and diverse background in \ngovernment, business, and the academy. He holds a degree in mechanical \nengineering from Duke, which led to a job with DuPont chemical company. \nHe went on to earn an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and taught at Duke \nUniversity's schools of law and business. And, of course, as we all \nknew Ted before, he served for 20 years on the staff of Senator Joe \nBiden, most of that time as chief of staff.\n  Like most Senators, I have enormous respect for the role of the \nSenate's professional staff members. In fact, we often joke that \nSenators are ``a constitutional impediment to the smooth functioning of \nstaff.''\n  In Senator Ted Kaufman, we saw the best of both worlds, combining the \nexpertise and competence of a veteran staffer with the leadership and \npolitical skills of a first-rate Senator. This made Senator Kaufman a \nformidable presence in this body for the last 2 years.\n  No question, Senator Kaufman's influence was felt most impressively \nin the effort to reform Wall Street in the wake of the financial \nmeltdown of 2008.\n  Soon after becoming Senator, he cosponsored, along with Senator Leahy \nand Senator Grassley, a bill to give Federal prosecutors more effective \ntools for rooting out financial fraud. President Obama signed that bill \ninto law in May of last year.\n  And when the Senate undertook the sweeping reform of the financial \nsystem earlier this year, Senator Kaufman quickly stepped forward as \none of the toughest critics of Wall Street, giving speech after speech \nhere on the floor proposing and demanding fundamental changes in \nAmerica's broken financial system.\n  I listened with particular interest to his explanations and \ncriticisms of high-frequency trading and other opaque trading practices \nof hedge funds and big Wall Street firms.\n  I was proud to cosponsor the SAFE Banking Act, cosponsored by Senator \nKaufman and Senator Brown.\n  This legislation would have dramatically reduced the size and \nconcentration of the largest financial institutions, thereby making our \nfinancial system safer. I was disappointed this proposal was not \nincluded in the financial bill. But getting 33 votes for this ambitious \nmeasure was no small feat, and, no question, Senator Kaufman's tireless \nefforts helped to rally support in the Senate for reforming our \nfinancial institutions. Thanks in no small measure to Senator Kaufman's \nexpertise and relentless advocacy, the worst aspects of Wall Street's \ncasino capitalism have been eliminated, and our financial system is \nbetter able to allocate capital to areas of the economy that need it \nthe most.\n  So the junior Senator from Delaware was true to his word. For the \nlast 2 years, he was a Senator's Senator, giving his all, beholden to \nno interest, serving the people of Delaware and the United States with \ncompetence, character, courage, and, I might add, with rock-solid \nintegrity.\n  I have valued Ted Kaufman's friendship and counsel here in the \nSenate, as I said, going back for nearly 20 years. I look forward to \ncontinuing that relationship now that he has departed from this body. \nSo I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Ted and Lynne much \nhappiness and success in the years ahead.\n\n\n                            George Voinovich\n\n  With the close of the 111th Congress, the Senate will lose to \nretirement again one of our most seasoned and respected Members on the \nother side of the aisle, Senator George Voinovich of Ohio.\n  Senator Voinovich and I have much in common. We are both proud \nmidwesterners. But here is what we really have in common: My mother \nimmigrated to America from what is now Slovenia, the nation of \nSlovenia, and George's mother was a first-generation American of \nSlovenia descent. Both of us were--and I think we are the only two \nSenators ever--awarded the Golden Order of Merit by the Republic of \nSlovenia, in part for our efforts to assist Slovenia in its campaign to \nrid the world of landmines and to assist the victims of landmines. We \nboth care very deeply about the success of democracy in Slovenia, a \nvery small nation that has set a powerful example of political \nstability, economic reform, true democracy, and ethnic inclusiveness in \nthe Balkans.\n  For nearly 4\\1/2\\ decades, George Voinovich has devoted himself to \npublic service at just about every level of government--quite amazing--\nas a member of the Ohio House of Representatives, Cuyahoga County \ncommissioner, Mayor of Cleveland, Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, Governor \nof Ohio, and, for the last 12 years, U.S. Senator from the State of \nOhio. Across those 44 years of service, he has been respected for his \nindependence, his pragmatism, and his insistence on putting ideology \nand partisanship aside in order to accomplish important things for \nordinary working Americans.\n  Another constant in the career of George Voinovich has been his \ninsistence on fiscal discipline and his willingness to advance \ncreative, tough-minded, nonideological approaches to help government \nlive within its means. As mayor of Cleveland, he took a municipality \nthat had recently declared bankruptcy and turned it around to become a \nthree-time All-American City winner. As Governor, he returned the State \nbudget to balance despite a bad economy. And for the last 12 years, he \nhas been one of the Senate's leading champions of fiscal conservatism. \nBy that, I mean true fiscal conservatism, which means a willingness \nboth to cut spending and to raise revenues as necessary in order to \nbring down deficits and balance the books. On that score, on matters of \ntaxing and spending, Senator Voinovich had the courage to break ranks \nwith his own party on many occasions.\n  Our colleague Senator Voinovich has many accomplishments in this \nbody. I do not have time to mention them all, but I know he is \nparticularly proud of his work as chair and, most recently, ranking \nmember of the Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, wherein he played a key role \nin passing the National Energy Security Act of 2009, which is helping \nour Nation to lessen its dependance on imported petroleum.\n  He is also deservedly proud of his long leadership in the fight to \npreserve and protect Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes--a cause that \nhas been a constant throughout his career in public service. Here in \nthe Senate, he has been a cochair of the Great Lakes Task Force, and he \nintroduced a bill that, when signed into law in 2008 by President Bush, \nratified the Great Lakes Compact to protect these national treasures \nthrough better water management and conservation--a singular \naccomplishment by Senator Voinovich of Ohio.\n  Senator Voinovich has achieved much during his distinguished career \nin public service. I could use any number of superlatives to describe \nhis character and work: sterling character, an honest individual, \nsomeone who, when he gave you his word, gave you his word. To Senator \nVoinovich, a handshake was a handshake. It was a commitment, and he \nwould never go back. But in my book, the highest accolade is simply \nthat George Voinovich is a generous, sincere, decent person, dedicated \nto public service, always determined to do the right thing for the \npeople of Ohio and the entire United States, a man lacking in \nideological rigor but still a person dedicated to true conservative \ncauses he has championed all his life.\n  It has been a great honor to be his friend and colleague for these \nlast years. Our friendship, of course, will continue. I wish George and \nJanet the very best in the years ahead.\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  I know others are here. If I can indulge them just for a few more \nminutes, I would like to make one more speech in praise of another \ncolleague who is retiring, again on the other side of the aisle, and \nwho is a good friend and someone for whom I have had not only great \nfriendship but great respect, and I have served with him a lot on our \ncommittees--Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.\n  Senator Gregg can be a very effective and persuasive partisan for the \nconservative causes he holds dear. He also has a strong New Hampshire \nindependent streak and is willing to buck his party when he thinks it \nis wrong--for example, when he voted against President Bush's Medicare \nprescription drug benefit bill because it was unpaid for and would add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the debt. Indeed, as ranking member \nand former chair of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg has been one of \nthe Senate's leading champions of fiscal discipline.\n  I especially admire Senator Gregg's capacity for reaching across the \naisle, building bridges, and getting important work done. On that \nscore, he has represented New Hampshire and the United States at his \nvery best. This quality has made him a standout member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which I chair. He forged a \nvery productive working relationship with my predecessor as chair, \nSenator Ted Kennedy. For example, he played a key role with Senator \nKennedy in crafting the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act, and a few \nyears later, I was proud to work with both of those New England \nSenators again--especially Senator Gregg--to reauthorize and improve \nthe Americans with Disabilities Education Act.\n  In 2008, Senator Gregg was a key leader in crafting and forging \nbipartisan support for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Many \nhave criticized the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, but facts are \nfacts: TARP prevented a total meltdown of our financial system. And \nalmost the entire $700 billion taxpayer investment has been or soon \nwill be paid back to the U.S. Treasury. In fact, just this week, the \nTreasury booked a $12 billion profit on its previous $45 billion \ninvestment in Citigroup.\n  This year, Senator Gregg has played a key role on the HELP Committee \nin bringing together Senators from both parties to advance food safety \nlegislation. Frankly, there were many times when sharp policy \ndisagreements threatened the survival of that bill. But at every turn, \nSenator Gregg played a constructive role in working through the \noptions, crafting bipartisan compromises, and keeping the legislation \non track to passage. I have nothing but admiration and gratitude to \nSenator Gregg for his leadership on the food safety bill, which, as you \nknow, passed the Senate, and because of a little glitch, the House had \nto return it, and it is coming back to us on the continuing resolution \nbill. We will put it on our omnibus bill and send it back to the House. \nI do not think there is any doubt that this will be signed into law by \nthe President this year.\n\n  That is the first modernization of our Food and Drug Administration \ninspection systems in 70 years--70 years. Again, I wish to publicly \nthank Senator Gregg for hanging in there over several years' period of \ntime to make sure we kept it on track from one Congress to another, \nfrom one Congress to another, up and down, but we finally got it done. \nAs I just said, I have the utmost admiration and gratitude to Senator \nGregg for hanging in there and making sure we got the job done.\n  As many of our colleagues will remember, several years ago, Senator \nGregg bought a $20 Powerball lottery ticket and won $850,000. Again, we \nall want to go up and touch him and see if it will rub off on us a \nlittle bit. To this day, Senator Gregg is the only person I have ever \nknown who won a Powerball lottery ticket. Well, as we have often said, \nthat was Judd Gregg's personal good fortune, but it has been our good \nfortune to have a Senator of his high caliber and character in this \nbody for the last 18 years. During that time, I have placed great store \nby his friendship and his counsel. Of course, that relationship and \nfriendship will continue, but I am sorry we are going to miss him here \nin the Senate.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Judd and Kathleen the \nvery best in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I first say how proud and \nprivileged I feel to have been on the floor during the distinguished \nspeeches of the senior Senator from Iowa on behalf of his friends and \ncolleagues, many of decades' duration. I am still in my first term \nhere. I know I still have a lot to learn, but one thing I have learned \nis that this place operates on friendship and that the friendships here \nare special ones, forged in cooperation, tempered in combat, and \nsustained in mutual respect. The Senator's eloquent words about our \ncolleagues are a great testament to that fine characteristic of this \nbody. So I felt very touched and pleased to be here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8688-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8688-S8689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here to draw attention to what \nI consider to be an urgent need that we include an extension of the \nTreasury grant program for renewable energy projects in any upcoming \ntax legislation considered by the Senate. These are called 1603 grants \nbecause they were created by section 1603 of the Recovery Act. This \ngrant program has been vital to the renewable energy industry, which \ncreates jobs, promotes energy independence, and is a vital foundation \nof the emerging clean energy revolution.\n  Section 1603 of the Recovery Act allows for cash grants in place of \nthe 30-percent investment tax credit for renewable energy projects. \nThat direct cash payment provides an immediate jump-start to renewable \nenergy projects. Many renewable energy projects were funded using what \nwere called tax equity partnerships, and much of this funding dried up \nduring the recent credit crunch.\n  The 1603 grant program is a lifeline to renewable energy developers, \nand it has allowed hundreds of projects to go forward that otherwise \nwould have stumbled or failed. According to the American Wind Energy \nAssociation, the cash grants enabled the construction of 10,000 \nmegawatts of new wind capacity in 2009, while just 4,000 megawatts \nwould have been built without the program.\n  The transition for America to a clean energy economy is long past \ndue. This country has run on the same fuel at basically the same \nefficiency levels since the start of the Industrial Revolution at the \nSlater Mill in Pawtucket, RI. This was acceptable maybe in 1900, \nperhaps even in 1950, but where does it leave us today in 2010? Sadly, \nit leaves us behind the international competitive curve.\n  The next big economic revolution--the green, clean energy \nrevolution--will dwarf the digital revolution in terms of jobs and \nwealth creation. We have heard testimony in this Senate that the \nInternet is a $1 trillion industry worldwide, while energy is expected \nto be a $6 trillion energy industry. That means jobs. We know other \ncountries are making significant investments in clean energy to claim \nthose jobs and to claim a commanding position in the race for \nleadership to a clean energy future for our planet.\n  Half of America's existing wind turbines were manufactured overseas. \nOf the two wind turbines installed in Portsmouth, RI, one was \nmanufactured by a Danish company and the other by an Austrian company. \nMeanwhile, our pace of wind turbine installation is also lagging \nbehind. It looks like in 2010, the United States will have installed \nabout one-eighth of the wind power installed by Germany. The United \nStates invented the first solar cell, but we now rank fifth among \ncountries that manufacture solar components. The United States is home \nto only 1 of the top 10 companies manufacturing solar energy components \nand to only 1 of the top 10 companies manufacturing wind turbines.\n  Companies in other countries see the demand for clean energy, and \nthey are moving swiftly ahead of us in the race to meet that demand. An \nextension of the section 1603 Treasury grant program would help us \ncreate and sustain jobs and build the foundation for our long-term \neconomic growth.\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\n  A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that wind \nenergy projects made possible by section 1603 were responsible for more \nthan 55,000 jobs. Extending the grant program would continue this \nimpressive job creation in a sector of promising growth and at a time \nwhen it is desperately needed.\n  Already I have seen the seeds of green innovation take root in Rhode \nIsland. The U.S. Navy is decommissioning part of a naval station in \nNewport that it no longer needs. Instead of that land going to waste, a \nPortsmouth developer is planning to convert 85 of these acres for a \nlarge solar power energy project. His plans also include an incubator \nspace for renewable energy projects and a green technology museum.\n  We have a company based in East Greenwich that develops renewable \nenergy technologies and products to maximize energy efficiency. In the \npast year, the company has filed for patent protection on three \ndifferent renewable energy technologies, including an exciting new \ntechnology that will generate electrical power from wind turbines \nmounted on boats and marinas.\n  Another example is Hodges Badge, the largest manufacturer of ribbons, \nbuttons, and medals in the country. It is located in Portsmouth. If \nyour kids have ever won a ribbon at a track meet or a horse show or \nsome other competition, it was probably made at Hodges Badge in \nPortsmouth. This family-owned company is on track to become the first \nmanufacturer in Rhode Island powered entirely by clean energy, having \njust broken ground this month on installation of a 149-foot tall wind \nturbine behind the factory.\n  Company President Eric Hodges said:\n\n       It'll be nice to say we're first, that we're 100-percent \n     renewable. It's a nice marketing message. But really it's \n     because it's the right thing to do.\n\n  Putting up the turbine will cost about $900,000 and Hodges readily \nadmits that he wouldn't have pursued the project if it were not for \nrenewable energy grants from the State and Federal Government. That \nproject and its jobs would be lost. Hodges Badge does the type of \ntraditional manufacturing that Rhode Island has unfortunately been \nlosing for decades, that our country has been losing for decades. \nFinding a way to save on energy is one way to ensure this company, \nwhich has 95 employees in Rhode Island, can succeed and doesn't leave \nour State. Extending the section 1603 program would proliferate \nhundreds of small renewable projects across the country.\n  For example, in Rhode Island the program would help a 100-kilowatt \nproject at a low-income housing project in Portsmouth, a 1.5-megawatt \nproject at a water treatment facility in Jamestown, and a 300-kilowatt \nsolar project in Wakefield. Without the grant program, these types of \nprojects and the jobs associated with them would dry up. That goes for \nlarge-scale projects too. A renewable energy company in Rhode Island \nhas proposed the country's largest offshore wind farm off the coast of \nRhode Island, a 200-turbine, 1,000-megawatt project with a goal of \nstarting construction in 2014. This impressive project would provide \npower to States all along the east coast. We cannot let innovative \nprojects such as these, job-creating projects such as these, \nentrepreneurial projects such as these, be stopped in their tracks by \nthis bill.\n  What would extending the Treasury grant program cost? The tax cuts \nfor wealthy Americans that are part of the newly announced tax deal \nwould pay for the extension of the Treasury grant program supporting \nthese renewable jobs 20 times over.\n  It is time for us to lead again. Just imagine if every one of the \nwind turbines to be sited in Rhode Island waters and all up and down \nthe Atlantic coast was manufactured in the United States or imagine if \nwe converted brownfields across the country to solar farms, creating a \nprofitable use for this property and bringing jobs to blighted \nneighborhoods or finally, for a minute, imagine 1 million more \nmanufacturing facilities like Hodges Badge running their assembly lines \nentirely on solar, wind, geothermal and other renewable energy sources \nand no longer being held hostage to rising fuel costs. A clean energy \neconomy beckons with vast promise and jobs, efficiencies, and \nentrepreneurship. We must not, we cannot ignore the call.\n  I urge our leaders to include in any tax compromise we take up an \nextension of the renewable energy tax credits and the 1603 program.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his patience and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8689-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8689-S8690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              START TREATY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I think most of us believe we should not \nplay partisan politics when it comes to nuclear weapons. But in a \nspeech this morning at the Heritage Foundation, my colleagues, our \ncolleague, Senator Jim DeMint, claimed the new START treaty weakens our \nnational security. I like our colleague from South Carolina. He has \nbeen the ranking member on the European Affairs Subcommittee of the \nForeign Relations Committee, which I have chaired for the last 2 years, \nand we have worked very well together. But on this issue he is just \nwrong.\n  Nearly the entire foreign policy and national security establishment, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, completely disagree with him. Senator \nDeMint is arguing that this treaty somehow weakens our national \nsecurity and limits our strategic options. That argument has little \nbasis in reality and is opposed by every living former Republican \nSecretary of State, five former Secretaries of Defense, seven former \ncommanders of our strategic nuclear weapons, foreign policy and \nnational security giants from seven former Presidential administrations \nand former President George H.W. Bush. All of these national security \nheavyweights argue the exact opposite of Senator DeMint, and they all \nagree the new START treaty strengthens our national security.\n  The new START treaty has the unanimous backing of America's military \nleadership and America's NATO allies. According to the most recent CBS \nnews poll, the treaty now has the support of 82 percent of Americans. \nNow is the time to vote on the new START treaty. No one is rushing this \ntreaty. Since the treaty was signed back in April, the Senate has had \n245 days--I want to repeat that, 245 days--to thoroughly review and \nconsider this agreement. After 20 Senate hearings, more than 31 \nwitnesses, over 900 questions and answers, and 8 months of \nconsideration, including a significant delay during the August recess \nfor additional time before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the \nconsensus is clear. New START is in our national security interest, and \nthe Senate should not wait any longer to ratify this treaty.\n  I ask the opponents of this treaty to consider our broader national \nsecurity interests. Think about the effect stalling this treaty or \npublicly rejecting it will have not only on our ability to monitor \nRussia--because we have had no inspectors on the ground in Russia for \nover a year now because the treaty expired on December 5, so it has \nbeen over a year--but on all of our counterproliferation efforts around \nthe world. Failing to ratify New START this year tells the world we are \nnot serious about the nuclear threat.\n  I know my colleagues don't want Iran or North Korea or al-Qaida to \nhave the bomb. We have heard that from everyone in this Chamber. \nEveryone is clear about that. Last week five former Republican \nSecretaries of State from five former Republican Presidents connected \nthe passage of New START to our efforts on Iran and North Korea.\n  Again, I ask opponents of this treaty, are ideological goals worth \nthe risk to our national security? Delaying a vote on New START into \nnext year is a dangerous and unnecessary gamble with this Nation's \nsecurity. I hope the opponents of this treaty will reconsider their \nopposition and recognize how important it is to this country's security \nto pass this treaty this year in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 581, S. 2925.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2925) to establish a grant program to benefit \n     victims of sex trafficking, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Minor Sex \n     Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It is one of \n     the fastest-growing, and the second largest, criminal \n     enterprise in the world. Human trafficking generates an \n     estimated profit of $32,000,000,000 per year, world wide.\n       (2) In the United States, human trafficking is an \n     increasing problem. This criminal enterprise victimizes \n     individuals in the United States, many of them children, who \n     are forced into prostitution, and foreigners brought into the \n     country, often under false pretenses, who are coerced into \n     forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.\n       (3) Sex trafficking is one of the most lucrative areas of \n     human trafficking. Criminal gang members in the United States \n     are increasingly involved in recruiting young women and girls \n     into sex trafficking. Interviews with gang members indicate \n     that the gang members regard working as an individual who \n     solicits customers for a prostitute (commonly known as a \n     ``pimp'') to being as lucrative as trafficking in drugs, but \n     with a much lower chance of being criminally convicted.\n       (4) National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, \n     Runaway and Throwaway Children, the definitive study of \n     episodes of missing children, found that of the children who \n     are victims of non-family abduction, runaway or throwaway \n     children, the police are alerted by family or guardians in \n     only 21 percent of the cases. In 79 percent of cases there is \n     no report and no police involvement, and therefore no \n     official attempt to find the child.\n       (5) In 2007, the Administration of Children and Families, \n     Department of Health and Human Services, reported to the \n     Federal Government 265,000 cases of serious physical, sexual, \n     or psychological abuse of children.\n       (6) Experts estimate that each year at least 100,000 \n     children in the United States are exploited through \n     prostitution.\n       (7) Children who have run away from home are at a high risk \n     of becoming exploited through sex trafficking. Children who \n     have run away multiple times are at much higher risk of not \n     returning home and of engaging in prostitution.\n       (8) The vast majority of children involved in sex \n     trafficking have suffered previous sexual or physical abuse, \n     live in poverty, or have no stable home or family life. These \n     children require a comprehensive framework of specialized \n     treatment and mental health counseling that addresses post-\n     traumatic stress, depression, and sexual exploitation.\n       (9) The average age of first exploitation through \n     prostitution is 13. Seventy-five percent of minors exploited \n     through prostitution have a pimp. A pimp can earn $200,000 \n     per year prostituting 1 sex trafficking victim.\n       (10) Sex trafficking of minors is a complex and varied \n     criminal problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, \n     cooperative solution. Reducing trafficking will require the \n     Government to address victims, pimps, and johns, and to \n     provide training specific to sex trafficking for law \n     enforcement officers and prosecutors, and child welfare, \n     public health, and other social service providers.\n       (11) Human trafficking is a criminal enterprise that \n     imposes significant costs on the economy of the United \n     States. Government and non-profit resources used to address \n     trafficking include those of law enforcement, the judicial \n     and penal systems, and social service providers. Without a \n     range of appropriate treatments to help trafficking victims \n     overcome the trauma they have experienced, victims will \n     continue to be exploited by criminals and unable to support\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\n     themselves, and will continue to require Government \n     resources, rather than being productive contributors to the \n     legitimate economy.\n       (12) Human trafficking victims are often either not \n     identified as trafficking victims or are mischaracterized as \n     criminal offenders. Both private and public sector personnel \n     play a significant role in identifying trafficking victims \n     and potential victims, such as runaways. Examples of such \n     personnel include hotel staff, flight attendants, health care \n     providers, educators, and parks and recreation personnel. \n     Efforts to train these individuals can bolster law \n     enforcement efforts to reduce human trafficking.\n       (13) Minor sex trafficking victims are under the age of 18. \n     Because minors do not have the capacity to consent to their \n     own commercial sexual exploitation, minor sex trafficking \n     victims should not be charged as criminal defendants. \n     Instead, minor victims of sex trafficking should have access \n     to treatment and services to help them recover from their \n     sexual exploitation, and should also be provided access to \n     appropriate compensation for harm they have suffered.\n       (14) Several States have recently passed or are considering \n     legislation that establishes a presumption that a minor \n     charged with a prostitution offense is a severely trafficked \n     person and should instead be cared for through the child \n     protection system. Some such legislation also provides \n     support and services to minor sex trafficking victims who are \n     under the age of 18 years old. These services include safe \n     houses, crisis intervention programs, community-based \n     programs, and law-enforcement training to help officers \n     identify minor sex trafficking victims.\n       (15) Sex trafficking of minors is not a problem that occurs \n     only in urban settings. This crime also exists in rural areas \n     and on Indian reservations. Efforts to address sex \n     trafficking of minors should include partnerships with \n     organizations that seek to address the needs of such \n     underserved communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the Attorney General should implement changes to the \n     National Crime Information Center database to ensure that--\n       (A) a child entered into the database will be automatically \n     designated as an endangered juvenile if the child has been \n     reported missing not less than 3 times in a 1-year period;\n       (B) the database is programmed to cross-reference newly \n     entered reports with historical records already in the \n     database; and\n       (C) the database is programmed to include a visual cue on \n     the record of a child designated as an endangered juvenile to \n     assist law enforcement officers in recognizing the child and \n     providing the child with appropriate care and services;\n       (2) funds awarded under subpart 1 of part E of title I of \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) (commonly known as Byrne Grants) should \n     be used to provide education, training, deterrence, and \n     prevention programs relating to sex trafficking of minors;\n       (3) States should--\n       (A) treat minor victims of sex trafficking as crime victims \n     rather than as criminal defendants or juvenile delinquents;\n       (B) adopt laws that--\n       (i) establish the presumption that a child under the age of \n     18 who is charged with a prostitution offense is a minor \n     victim of sex trafficking;\n       (ii) avoid the criminal charge of prostitution for such a \n     child, and instead consider such a child a victim of crime \n     and provide the child with appropriate services and \n     treatment; and\n       (iii) strengthen criminal provisions prohibiting the \n     purchasing of commercial sex acts, especially with minors;\n       (C) amend State statutes and regulations--\n       (i) relating to crime victim compensation to make eligible \n     for such compensation any individual who is a victim of sex \n     trafficking as defined in section 1591(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code, or a comparable State law against commercial \n     sexual exploitation of children, and who would otherwise be \n     ineligible for such compensation due to participation in \n     prostitution activities because the individual is determined \n     to have contributed to, consented to, benefitted from, or \n     otherwise participated as a party to the crime for which the \n     individual is claiming injury; and\n       (ii) relating to law enforcement reporting requirements to \n     provide for exceptions to such requirements for victims of \n     sex trafficking in the same manner as exceptions are provided \n     to victims of domestic violence or related crimes; and\n       (4) demand for commercial sex with sex trafficking victims \n     must be deterred through consistent enforcement of criminal \n     laws against purchasing commercial sex.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I support the goals of this legislation and believe that \nslavery, in any form, is morally reprehensible. Sex trafficking is a \nglobal epidemic, and we should endeavor to eliminate this industry, \nespecially due to its effects on minors who are victims of this \npractice. However, I believe we can and must do so in a fiscally \nresponsible manner that avoids duplication of existing laws and \nprograms and upholds the Constitution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his constructive \nwork in helping to craft an agreement to pass S. 2925. As he notes, sex \ntrafficking is modern day slavery. It is a morally reprehensible \nepidemic that ensnares far too many children, and there is far too \nlittle awareness of the scope of this criminal enterprise in the United \nStates. I also agree that in combating this heinous crime, and \nproviding law enforcement agencies and services providers with \neffective tools, Congress must take care to do so in a manner that is \nfiscally responsible and that avoids inefficiency and duplication.\n  Mr. COBURN. Although the Subcommittee on Human Rights held a hearing \non child prostitution this year, it did not fully explore the \neffectiveness of existing law and grant programs, and whether there are \nloopholes or problems that need to be fixed in order to make the \nFederal Government's efforts more effective. There are multiple \nprograms for trafficking victims under existing law, but some of them \nremain unclear and confusing. In fact, many of them have never received \ncongressional funding. Thus, while I agree with the Senator from Oregon \nthat there seems to be a disparity between the resources provided to \ndomestic victims and those provided to international victims, I \nconveyed to him in our negotiations that I question whether we cannot \nalready provide most of those resources under existing law. As a \nresult, I am committed to vigorous oversight of these issues during the \nreauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization \nAct, TVPRA, which expires next year.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma that an important \nrole of Congress is to provide oversight to help make Federal programs \nmore effective, to increase efficiency, and to reduce duplication, \nwaste, and unnecessary expenditures. I have discussed with the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma his work on the deficit commission, and as he knows, I \nserve on the Senate Budget Committee and I am very concerned about \ncontrolling government spending and working to ensure the most \nefficient and effective use of government resources. The level of debt \nthat our nation has accumulated is very concerning and is a threat to \neconomic growth and sound fiscal policy. In accordance with these \nconcerns, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma that when the TVPRA \nreauthorization occurs, the Senate should carefully consider all \nprograms to combat human trafficking, including S. 2925, to determine \nwhich programs provide the most effective impact, and whether there is \nduplication, inefficiency, or waste that can and should be reduced.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator from Oregon for recognizing the dire \nstate of our economy and his willingness to offset the cost of this \nlegislation. The U.S. national debt is now over $13.8 trillion and \ngrowing. As a result, it is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize \nthe future standard of living of our children by borrowing from future \ngenerations. In the TVPRA reauthorization next year, it is imperative \nthat we examine all trafficking victims grant programs, including this \none, for waste, fraud and abuse, as well as their effect on the \ndeficit. Our country is too fragile and these minor victims are too \nimportant for Congress to shirk its duty to perform oversight. I look \nforward to working with the Senator from Oregon to ensure this and \nother trafficking victims grant programs are performing effectively, \nefficiently and within the bounds of the Constitution.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be considered; that the two Wyden amendments which \nare at the desk be agreed to en bloc; that the committee substitute, as \namended, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and \nthat a budgetary pay-go statement be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Minor Sex \n     Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It is one of \n     the fastest-growing, and the second largest, criminal \n     enterprise in the world. Human trafficking generates an \n     estimated profit of $32,000,000,000 per year, world wide.\n       (2) In the United States, human trafficking is an \n     increasing problem. This criminal enterprise victimizes \n     individuals in the United States, many of them children, who \n     are forced into prostitution, and foreigners brought into the \n     country, often under false pretenses, who are coerced into \n     forced labor or commercial sexual exploitation.\n       (3) Sex trafficking is one of the most lucrative areas of \n     human trafficking. Criminal gang members in the United States \n     are increasingly involved in recruiting young women and girls \n     into sex trafficking. Interviews with gang members indicate \n     that the gang members regard working as an individual who \n     solicits customers for a prostitute (commonly known as a \n     ``pimp'') to being as lucrative as trafficking in drugs, but \n     with a much lower chance of being criminally convicted.\n       (4) National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, \n     Runaway and Throwaway Children, the definitive study of \n     episodes of missing children, found that of the children who \n     are victims of non-family abduction, runaway or throwaway \n     children, the police are alerted by family or guardians in \n     only 21 percent of the cases. In 79 percent of cases there is \n     no report and no police involvement, and therefore no \n     official attempt to find the child.\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n       (5) In 2007, the Administration of Children and Families, \n     Department of Health and Human Services, reported to the \n     Federal Government 265,000 cases of serious physical, sexual, \n     or psychological abuse of children.\n       (6) Experts estimate that each year at least 100,000 \n     children in the United States are exploited through \n     prostitution.\n       (7) Children who have run away from home are at a high risk \n     of becoming exploited through sex trafficking. Children who \n     have run away multiple times are at much higher risk of not \n     returning home and of engaging in prostitution.\n       (8) The vast majority of children involved in sex \n     trafficking have suffered previous sexual or physical abuse, \n     live in poverty, or have no stable home or family life. These \n     children require a comprehensive framework of specialized \n     treatment and mental health counseling that addresses post-\n     traumatic stress, depression, and sexual exploitation.\n       (9) The average age of first exploitation through \n     prostitution is 13. Seventy-five percent of minors exploited \n     through prostitution have a pimp. A pimp can earn $200,000 \n     per year prostituting 1 sex trafficking victim.\n       (10) Sex trafficking of minors is a complex and varied \n     criminal problem that requires a multi-disciplinary, \n     cooperative solution. Reducing trafficking will require the \n     Government to address victims, pimps, and johns, and to \n     provide training specific to sex trafficking for law \n     enforcement officers and prosecutors, and child welfare, \n     public health, and other social service providers.\n       (11) Human trafficking is a criminal enterprise that \n     imposes significant costs on the economy of the United \n     States. Government and non-profit resources used to address \n     trafficking include those of law enforcement, the judicial \n     and penal systems, and social service providers. Without a \n     range of appropriate treatments to help trafficking victims \n     overcome the trauma they have experienced, victims will \n     continue to be exploited by criminals and unable to support \n     themselves, and will continue to require Government \n     resources, rather than being productive contributors to the \n     legitimate economy.\n       (12) Human trafficking victims are often either not \n     identified as trafficking victims or are mischaracterized as \n     criminal offenders. Both private and public sector personnel \n     play a significant role in identifying trafficking victims \n     and potential victims, such as runaways. Examples of such \n     personnel include hotel staff, flight attendants, health care \n     providers, educators, and parks and recreation personnel. \n     Efforts to train these individuals can bolster law \n     enforcement efforts to reduce human trafficking.\n       (13) Minor sex trafficking victims are under the age of 18. \n     Because minors do not have the capacity to consent to their \n     own commercial sexual exploitation, minor sex trafficking \n     victims should not be charged as criminal defendants. \n     Instead, minor victims of sex trafficking should have access \n     to treatment and services to help them recover from their \n     sexual exploitation, and should also be provided access to \n     appropriate compensation for harm they have suffered.\n       (14) Several States have recently passed or are considering \n     legislation that establishes a presumption that a minor \n     charged with a prostitution offense is a severely trafficked \n     person and should instead be cared for through the child \n     protection system. Some such legislation also provides \n     support and services to minor sex trafficking victims who are \n     under the age of 18 years old. These services include safe \n     houses, crisis intervention programs, community-based \n     programs, and law-enforcement training to help officers \n     identify minor sex trafficking victims.\n       (15) Sex trafficking of minors is not a problem that occurs \n     only in urban settings. This crime also exists in rural areas \n     and on Indian reservations. Efforts to address sex \n     trafficking of minors should include partnerships with \n     organizations that seek to address the needs of such \n     underserved communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the Attorney General should implement changes to the \n     National Crime Information Center database to ensure that--\n       (A) a child entered into the database will be automatically \n     designated as an endangered juvenile if the child has been \n     reported missing not less than 3 times in a 1-year period;\n       (B) the database is programmed to cross-reference newly \n     entered reports with historical records already in the \n     database; and\n       (C) the database is programmed to include a visual cue on \n     the record of a child designated as an endangered juvenile to \n     assist law enforcement officers in recognizing the child and \n     providing the child with appropriate care and services;\n       (2) funds awarded under subpart 1 of part E of title I of \n     the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) (commonly known as Byrne Grants) should \n     be used to provide education, training, deterrence, and \n     prevention programs relating to sex trafficking of minors;\n       (3) States should--\n       (A) treat minor victims of sex trafficking as crime victims \n     rather than as criminal defendants or juvenile delinquents;\n       (B) adopt laws that--\n       (i) establish the presumption that a child under the age of \n     18 who is charged with a prostitution offense is a minor \n     victim of sex trafficking;\n       (ii) avoid the criminal charge of prostitution for such a \n     child, and instead consider such a child a victim of crime \n     and provide the child with appropriate services and \n     treatment; and\n       (iii) strengthen criminal provisions prohibiting the \n     purchasing of commercial sex acts, especially with minors;\n       (C) amend State statutes and regulations--\n       (i) relating to crime victim compensation to make eligible \n     for such compensation any individual who is a victim of sex \n     trafficking as defined in section 1591(a) of title 18, United \n     States Code, or a comparable State law against commercial \n     sexual exploitation of children, and who would otherwise be \n     ineligible for such compensation due to participation in \n     prostitution activities because the individual is determined \n     to have contributed to, consented to, benefitted from, or \n     otherwise participated as a party to the crime for which the \n     individual is claiming injury; and\n       (ii) relating to law enforcement reporting requirements to \n     provide for exceptions to such requirements for victims of \n     sex trafficking in the same manner as exceptions are provided \n     to victims of domestic violence or related crimes; and\n       (4) demand for commercial sex with sex trafficking victims \n     must be deterred through consistent enforcement of criminal \n     laws against purchasing commercial sex.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, with the passage of S. 2925, the Senate is \nsending to the House the first ever all-out battle plan to defeat one \nof the fastest growing criminal enterprises in our country; that is, \ntrafficking children for sex.\n  Senator Cornyn and I have worked together on this issue for many \nmonths on a bipartisan basis with tremendous help from Chairman Leahy, \nfrom Senator Sessions, from Senator Durbin, and Senator Kyl, and before \nI begin my statement tonight, I wish to express my thanks to them. This \nis a textbook for how the Senate ought to work together on an important \nissue in a bipartisan way, and I am very grateful to my colleagues for \ntheir leadership.\n  When I first approached Senator Cornyn, he said in our very first \nconversation: This has nothing to do with Democrats and Republicans; \nthis is about doing what is right for young people. So I am very \ngrateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the support \nthey have shown on this matter.\n  Each year, an estimated 100,000 children in America are trafficked \nfor sex. They are recruited by violent criminals, and their average age \nis between 12 and 14. The fact is, sex trafficking in children is \nmodern day slavery, pure and simple.\n  Tragically, my home State of Oregon has become a hub for those who \nwould exploit women and young girls, and the tragedy is my State is not \nalone. What we have seen--and this was brought out in hearings--is that \nthe reason this is such a fast-growing crime is it is so easy to \nperpetrate and there is such big money involved.\n  For example, experts in the field said for some time, you would see \ngangs zero in on drugs. The fact is, trafficking in children, according \nto many of the experts, is easier than trafficking in drugs, and today, \nwith the Internet and the anonymity that the Internet provides these \ndangerous criminals who traffic in children, it is, as I say, one of \nthe fastest growing crimes in American life.\n  I got a sense of what this was all about this summer when I had a \nchance to go out with Portland police officers in my hometown on 82nd \nAvenue. What I saw is something I will never forget: a heart-wrenching \nexample of why this bipartisan legislation is so important. I saw a 15-\nyear-old girl essentially out there with the tools of the trade. She \nhad a cell phone so she could be in constant contact with her pimp, and \nall night long they were getting messages: Made $80, made $100 on a \ncustomer here or somewhere else. So she had her cell phone. She had a \nbutcher knife because she knew she needed a butcher knife to protect \nherself, and she had a purse full of condoms, because she knew she was \ngoing to have a bunch more customers during the course of the evening. \nSo what you have--and this is not primarily about statistics. If one \nyoung woman, whether it is in the State of West Virginia or Oregon or \nanywhere else, is prostituted this way, trafficked this way, that is \none young woman too many.\n  What the Senate has done now with the passage of S. 2925 is draw a \nline in the sand and say, for the first time, that we are going to put \nin place a comprehensive strategy, bring together the law enforcement \npeople and the human services people to deal with this in a way that is \ngoing to allow us to send a message on the streets of this country--and \nparticularly the interstate highways which have become such a magnet \nfor sex trafficking--that the odds are going to be different; that this \ntime those who traffic in young women are going to face real prospects \nof a deterrent.\n  The reality is these young women don't end up working as prostitutes \nby accident. The growing army of pimps I mentioned--violent, ruthless \ncriminals--see this group as an ideal group of young people to prey on. \nThe fact is, a pimp can make $200,000 a year trafficking just one \nvictim. Of course, many of those pimps traffic multiple victims on any \nparticular occasion. Once a young girl is under the control of a pimp, \nit is very difficult for that youngster to escape. The pimps use \nviolence to control girls, as well as traumatize them. They move the \ngirls constantly from city to city, keeping them isolated from any \nsource of support and preventing them from developing any kind of other \nmore healthy relationships.\n  In talking to law enforcement officials, I learned that removing sex \ntrafficking victims from the control of a pimp is very difficult. It is \none that requires training, resources, and in effect a strategy, \nbringing together law enforcement people and social services people in \norder to break this degrading and often deadly spiral of sex \ntrafficking in youngsters.\n  There are a variety of needs these young people have. One that \nSenator Cornyn and I learned about in the course of our work is the \nneed for dedicated shelter for these youngsters who have been \ntrafficked. Without shelter, for example, there is no place to keep \ntrafficking victims safe from the pimps and to give them the counseling \nand services they need. If there is no safe place for the victims to \nstay, there is no way the law enforcement authorities can build a case \nagainst the pimp. So this is a perfect example of how the important \nwork being done by our social service providers, in terms of the work \nin the shelters, is absolutely a prerequisite to tough, aggressive \nprosecution of the pimps because if you don't have a safe place for the \nyoung women, there is no place for them to get the health care and \nservices and counseling they need.\n  In fact, the night when I was out in Portland and saw, in particular, \nthat 15-year-old with what I call the tools of the trade, when the \npolice picked her up--and Portland's professionals in the sex \ntrafficking field are extraordinarily talented. I saw that firsthand, \nand officials from around the country tell me the same thing. One of \nthe big questions they were faced with was, where would they send the \nyoung women they found that evening for the next couple of days in \norder to just work out a more permanent living arrangement? In \nPortland, we have been able to do it. But even in our city, which is \nnow mobilizing all through the community, it has been very difficult.\n  At present, there are only about 70 shelter beds for sex trafficking \nvictims in the whole country. So that is why I mentioned that pimps \nknow their chances of getting prosecuted for forcing girls to engage in \nprostitution are very low. We have some laws on the books, but we also \nneed a strategy bringing together shelters, training for law \nenforcement officials and other resources if we are going to have the \nstrongest possible battle plan against sex trafficking.\n  Senator Cornyn and I got together to introduce this legislation. We \nwould set up what amounts to model projects across the country to test \nout the best approaches for combating sex trafficking of children. We \ndo make clear these approaches have to bring together law enforcement \npeople and social services.\n  It makes me very proud. The Chair, having served as Governor of West \nVirginia, knows from time to time you see some debates between law \nenforcement people and social services folks. Law enforcement people \nbelieve prosecution is the way to go. The social services folks believe \ntheir model is more effective.\n  What Senator Cornyn and I found is that this is an area where the law \nenforcement people support the social services folks and vice versa \nbecause they know both elements--social services and law enforcement--\nare going to be necessary to fight this scourge.\n  I mentioned shelters. There would also be block grants available for \nmental and physical health care, treatment for substance abuse and \nsexual abuse, and also assistance with trauma care. There would be help \nfor the victims\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\nwith food, clothing, and other necessities; and together it means the \nyoungsters--primarily young women--who are going to be in these \nshelters will know from the time they get to the shelter that caring \nindividuals want them to have a different life.\n  That is what drew me to this legislation. When you are talking about \npreying on young people, every Member of the Senate is concerned. What \nI think galvanized my attention was that a lot of these young women \ndon't think anybody cares about them except their pimp. They have \ngotten to the point in life where they believe there isn't anybody in \ntheir corner.\n  Their pimp says: You know, sweetheart, I care about you. You are \nwhat's really important to me. Let's just make some money, and \neventually you will be out on your own.\n  What you have with these shelters, and also the law enforcement \npeople I saw in Portland, is young women saying for the first time that \nthere is an adult, a role model, who wants them to have a different \nlife, who wants them to have the prospect of a different future, where \nthey are not degrading themselves, where they are not victimized, where \nthey have a different set of possibilities for their lives.\n  The human services aspects of this legislation are extremely \nimportant, and they complement the help that law enforcement would get \nas well. I was particularly struck, as we got into the law enforcement \naspect of this fight against sex trafficking, that there, again, had \nbeen some model approaches. The law enforcement official I was \nparticularly impressed with was the Dallas, TX, police sergeant Byron \nFassett. He explained to me that without the right training, law \nenforcement officers would not know how to spot the signs of sex \ntrafficking and would not know how to handle the victims.\n  So Senator Cornyn and I thought, with the counsel of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, it would be important to provide \nspecialized training for police officers and prosecutors to help them \nunderstand how to handle sex trafficking cases. The fact is, Sergeant \nFassett of Dallas, TX, can only be at one place at a time.\n  What this legislation is going to do is make it possible for other \nleaders in the law enforcement field to get the training out across the \ncountry, the state-of-the-art approaches about how to best fight the \nviolent criminals who engaged in this activity, and I am very pleased \nthat we were able to make possible part of the grant in this \nlegislation assistance for the law enforcement community.\n  Finally, the bill would address another issue that is a major \ncomponent of sex trafficking, and that is runaway children. One-third \nof runaway children are lured into prostitution within 48 hours of \nleaving their home. The evidence also shows that the children who have \nrun away multiple times are at the greatest risk of being drawn into \nsex trafficking.\n  So what we are doing in this legislation is making it possible for \nlaw enforcement officials to, in effect, make priority the children at \ngreatest risk; that is, these runaways. I am very pleased we were able \nto work out a bipartisan agreement for our approach in this area.\n  It would be hard to give appropriate thanks to all who participated \nin this effort--certainly, to do it without keeping you here until \nbreakfast time. Let me name just a small number of the many groups and \nindividuals who provided extremely valuable insight: the Polaris \nProject, Shared Hope International, National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, the FBI's Innocence Lost Project, and ECPAT-USA. I \ncould go on with the list of many groups.\n  Mr. President, I will tell you I am especially grateful to the faith \ncommunity for all of their efforts. Throughout this debate, Senator \nCornyn and I have been contacted by religious leaders from all over the \ncountry, from all particular denominations, talking about how important \nthis legislation is to them; and what they conveyed to us is that this \nis what they see in their congregations. This is what parents go to bed \nat night worrying about--the prospect of seeing one of their youngsters \ncaught up in this vicious cycle of degradation, crime, and lost hope \nfor the future.\n  We could not be here tonight if it wasn't for the faith community \nthat, all across the country, contacted their Senators, contacted \nvarious civic groups, and made common cause with rallies and marches \nand petitions. This is what has made this night possible.\n  So I have tried to make sure the Senate knows that a whole host of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked on this. I will say \nmy older daughter said the other night: Dad, I have figured it out. You \nare in the only profession on Earth where somebody your age is \nconsidered one of the young guys. I thought about that, because I have \nhad the honor of serving in the Senate for some time--recently was \nreelected--and I can't recall a time when I felt prouder of the Senate \ncoming together to deal with something that would make a real \ndifference.\n  This one piece of legislation is not going to wipe out this \nreprehensible, heinous crime, where youngsters who are 12 and 13 and 14 \nare trafficked for sex. But with this legislation, from Portland, OR, \nto Portland, ME--and, frankly, this will have benefits internationally \nbecause a lot of these youngsters are also trafficked for sex far from \nthe shores of the United States--tonight the Senate is making a \ndifference. Tonight, the Senate is giving hope to parents who are \nconcerned about their kids' future. For young women who are literally \ngoing to be hiding tonight near some of these interstates--Interstate \n5, which goes all through the West--with the passage of this \nlegislation and, hopefully, quick action by the House, this is a chance \nto make a difference for these young people.\n  This is what public service is supposed to be all about--making a \ndifference for young people and families and doing it not on the basis \nof Democrats and Republicans but on the basis of what is right, what is \nmoral, what is just. There are a lot of people who deserve credit here \ntonight, especially my friend and colleague, Senator Cornyn, but I am \nvery hopeful the House will act on this legislation. I am going to put \nadditional remarks into the Record, but Joel Shapiro, of my office, did \nyeoman's work on this legislation and deserves considerable credit \ntonight. I will leave my additional remarks for the Congressional \nRecord, but tonight, through the good-faith efforts of lots of \ncommunity and faith leaders, there is an opportunity to help reduce one \nof the fastest growing criminal enterprises in our country--certainly \none of the most immoral--the trafficking of young people for sex.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8701-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8701-S8708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2010--Resumed\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill, with Reid amendment No. \n     4727 (to the House amendment to the Senate amendment), to \n     change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4728 (to amendment No. 4727), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to refer the message of the House on the bill \n     to the Committee on Finance, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 4729, to provide for a study.\n       Reid amendment No. 4730 (the instructions) (to amendment \n     No. 4729), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 4731 (to amendment No. 4730), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as I think almost everyone knows, \nPresident Obama and the Republican leaders have reached an agreement on \ntaxes. It is, in my view, a bad deal, and I think we can do a lot \nbetter. Tonight, I wish to speak briefly, and I think I will have some \nother Senators join me. Tomorrow, I intend to be back to speak a lot \nlonger about this issue because I think this is an issue the American \npeople want serious discussion about.\n  I can tell my colleagues that representing the small State of \nVermont, we have received in the last 3 days thousands--thousands--of \nphone calls from my State and from other States, and what I will tell \nmy colleagues is that 99 percent of those calls were against this \nagreement. What I wish to do tonight, briefly, and at greater length \ntomorrow, is to tell my colleagues why I vigorously oppose the deal \nthat has been cut and how we have to move in a very different way if we \nare going to save the disappearing middle class of our country.\n  In my view, the American people are against this agreement. They want \nto hear Members of the Senate speak out against this agreement, and \nthat is what I will do this evening.\n  Let me explain, very briefly, why I am opposing the agreement reached \nby the Republican leadership and President Obama. First, at a time when \nour country has a recordbreaking $13.8 trillion national debt and a \ncollapsing middle class, it is unconscionable to me that we could \nsupport an agreement that drives up our national debt because we have \ngiven huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires who don't need \nit. Here is an interesting irony: In many cases, they are telling us \nthey don't even want it. Two of the richest people in the world, Bill \nGates and Warren Buffett, have said: Thank you. We don't need this tax \nbreak.\n  This country has serious problems. Use the money on those problems, \nnot giving billionaires a tax break.\n  In my own State, the founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Ben Cohen, \nsaid: Yes, I would like a tax break, but I don't need it. You know \nwhat.\n  There are millionaires all over this country who are saying the same \nthing.\n  We have been told that the extension of the tax breaks for the rich \nwill go on for only 2 years. The Bush tax breaks for the rich will go \non for 2 years. Maybe that is the case, but I personally don't believe \nthat. I believe that given the political reality that exists in \nWashington, my guess is that 2 years from now, when this same debate \nhappens again, these tax breaks for the rich will once again be \nextended. Our Republican colleagues have been very clear they wanted a \n10-year extension. It is hard for me to believe that 2 years from now \nthey are going to say: Oh, 2 years, that is fine. That is enough. We \ngive up. I don't think so.\n  The difficulty is, we have a President who campaigned vigorously \nagainst extending these tax breaks for the rich, but those tax breaks \nfor the rich are in this agreement. So my fear is that if the President \nis the Democratic nominee 2 years from now and he says: Trust me, we \nare going to stop these tax breaks for the rich, I think his \ncredibility might not be too high.\n  So my fear is, in fact, if these Bush tax cuts for the top 2 percent, \nmany of whom are millionaires and billionaires, are extended over a 10-\nyear period, we are looking at a $700 billion increase in the national \ndebt.\n  Secondly, extending income tax breaks for the top 2 percent is not \nthe only unfair tax proposal in this agreement. This agreement struck \nby the President and the Republican leadership continues the Bush-era \n15-percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends, meaning that those \npeople who make their living off their investments will continue to pay \na substantially lower tax rate than the vast majority of the people in \nthe middle class--people such as firemen, teachers, and nurses.\n  On top of all that, this agreement includes a horrendous proposal \nregarding the estate tax, a Teddy Roosevelt initiative which was \nenacted in 1916. It will be celebrating its 100th birthday in a few \nyears. Under the agreement we will be debating here, the estate tax \nrate, which was 55 percent under President Clinton, will decline to 35 \npercent under this agreement, with an exemption on the first $5 million \nof an individual's estate, $10 million for couples.\n  I suspect there are people who are watching this evening and they are \nsaying: Oh, my goodness. I don't want to pay a 55-percent estate tax. \nSo let me be very clear in saying this, in telling you something the \nRepublicans do not tell you: that the estate tax applies only to the \ntop three-tenths of 1 percent, so 99.7 percent of American families do \nnot pay 5 cents in the estate tax. So this is not just a tax for the \nrich; this is a tax for the very rich.\n  I know many of my Republican colleagues would like to abolish, repeal \nthe estate tax altogether, and that would cost us $1 trillion over 10 \nyears to our national debt, but they are making significant progress by \nlowering the rate to 35 percent.\n  Does my colleague from Ohio wish to respond?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \nhear what the Senator says about the tax burden in this country; that \nit falls predominantly on the middle class. When I hear him talk about \nthe estate tax, couples pay no estate tax on the first $10 million of \ntheir assets after they both die. Considering they shelter a good bit \nbeyond that, then the tax rate only on the dollars above $10 million \nwere lowered significantly in this proposal--and then what has happened \nwith extending the tax cuts.\n  I was intrigued, I guess it was yesterday, when the Senator offered a \nmotion on the floor. In light of the fact that a relatively small group \nof people are getting huge tax cuts--millionaires and billionaires--\nwhether it is the estate tax upon their death that their heirs enjoy \nthis huge tax break or whether it is when earning $1 million or $2 \nmillion or $5 million a year and getting a huge tax cut, the motion \nyesterday simply said, if I recall, that every Social Security \nbeneficiary--and that is tens of millions--\n  Mr. SANDERS. Over 50 million.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Fifty million people would get a check for $250 \nfrom the government, because, I believe, about $13 billion for 1 year, \nit wouldn't have been a long-term deficit issue; it would have been a \none-time cost for people who didn't get a cost-of-living adjustment \nthis year. So we know the average Social Security beneficiary gets \nabout $14,000 a year. We know an awful lot of Social Security \nbeneficiaries live mostly on their Social Security. Most people have a \nlittle bit more than that, but an awful lot have only a little bit more \nor nothing more so that is what they live on. They have no cost-of-\nliving adjustment this year because of this sort of complicated \nformula.\n  But what was pretty amazing to me is how at the same time, every \nRepublican signed a letter, 42 Republican Senators signed a letter \nsaying they will do nothing else until they get their tax cuts for the \nrich. It is almost like a work stoppage. It is almost like the \nRepublican Senators are on strike, saying: We are not going to vote or \nwe are not going to do anything around here. We are not going to work \nor vote yes on anything around here until you give my people a tax cut, \nmy wealthy friends and contributors in my States.\n  So the contrast of their saying we will not do anything for anybody \nelse except millionaires and billionaires, we will not--even a $250 \ncheck, since there was no cost-of-living adjustment to seniors who are \nmaking about $14,000 a year from Social Security.\n  What that check would mean to them is--I think that contrast made was \nso important to understand. Give us some more about what that contrast \nmeans with those Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for his very strong ethics in trying \nto get that $250 emergency check out to senior citizens on Social \nSecurity and disabled vets--over 15 million people.\n  Mr. BROWN from Ohio. One more point. A majority of Senators voted for \nit.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, 53.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. It was filibustered again, blocked by a minority \nof Senators, right?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Absolutely. We won 53 to 45, but around here the \nmajority does not rule. The Republicans filibustered, as they almost \nalways do on anything of substance, and we could not get the 60 votes \nbecause we did not get one Republican vote.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n  The point the Senator was making gets to the heart of this entire \nissue, which is that our friends over there are fighting vigorously for \n$700 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent--$70 billion a year \nfor the richest people in this country. And when we say to them that \nsenior citizens and disabled vets who are living on $14,000 or $15,000 \na year need a check of $250, oh, we can't afford that. But we can \nafford to give a billionaire a $1 million tax break.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. That $750 billion is $75 billion a year for 10 \nyears for millionaires and billionaires versus $13 billion once for \nsenior citizens. In essence, that $750 billion--without getting too \nmuch into the weeds on numbers--in essence, we are borrowing that money \nfrom China, charging it to our children and grandchildren, putting it \non their credit cards. They will pay it off who knows when. Then we are \ngiving that $750 billion to people who are fabulously wealthy already, \nright? But they are unwilling to move forward on unemployment benefits \nor on your proposal to help a senior with $250 because they really are \non strike.\n  They say: We are not doing anything until you give tax cuts to the \nrich, to my people.\n  Mr. SANDERS. That is right. Most of us--I am sure Senator Brown has \nreceived a lot of calls from people in Ohio--I know seniors who are \nhanging on by their fingernails, trying to pay their bills, heat their \nhomes, pay prescription drug costs, and take care of their health care \nneeds. And $250 will not profoundly impact people's lives, but it will \nhelp a little bit. These guys say: Sorry, we can't afford a $250 check \nfor a senior or a disabled vet because that would cost $13 billion or \n$14 billion a year. But we can afford $70 billion a year to go to the \ntop 2 percent.\n  Frankly, I think that is what this whole debate is about. That is \nwhat it is about.\n  What I want to do is continue for a moment on some of the other \nobjections. Senator Brown made an excellent point in contrasting the \npriorities we are seeing in the Senate, especially from our Republican \nfriends. We didn't get one vote--not one--for a $250 check for seniors \nor disabled vets. I want to continue with some of the problems that I \nsee in this agreement struck by the President and the Republican \nleadership.\n  Some folks may have heard a bit about the so-called payroll tax \nholiday. What that would do is cut about $120 billion in Social \nSecurity payroll taxes for workers.\n  On the surface, this sounds like a great idea. Instead of paying 6.2 \npercent, they will be paying 4.2 percent. They might think: Hey, that \nis great. I am paying less in taxes. My paycheck is a bit bigger. It is \na great idea.\n  Well, let's stop for a minute and ask: Where did this idea originally \ncome from? Well, the truth is this payroll tax holiday originated from \nconservative Republicans whose ultimate goal is the destruction of \nSocial Security.\n  What does that mean? Well, it is not very hard to figure out. If you \nare substantially cutting the amount of money that goes into Social \nSecurity by cutting back on the payroll tax, that makes Social Security \nless financially viable. Today, Social Security can pay out every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American for the next 29 years. Those of \nus who believe strongly in Social Security--that it has worked \nextraordinarily well for the last 75 years--and want to see it work \nwell for the next 75 years, we want to strengthen it.\n  I know the occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Oregon, has ideas \nabout putting increased revenue into the Social Security trust funds. \nThose are the ideas we should be looking at, not cutting funding that \ngoes into that trust fund. Furthermore, while this payroll tax holiday \nis a 1-year provision, and this agreement says the money will be \ncovered, for the very first time, by Federal dollars from the Treasury \ngoing into the Social Security trust fund, which historically has \ngotten all of its money from the payroll tax--while the proponents of \nthis agreement say don't worry about it, it is a 1-year agreement, I \nmake the same argument on this point that I made on the other. A year \nfrom now, people will be discussing whether we extend that payroll tax \nholiday. While those of us will say Social Security needs that money \nand you can't expend it, our Republican friends will say you are \nraising taxes on workers, and you can't do that. Then what we would be \ntalking about over a period of years is less money going into Social \nSecurity, making it less financially solvent, which is exactly what \nmany Republicans want to do. I think that is a bad idea.\n  I will tell you, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, which is led by a woman named Barbara Kennelly, who used \nto be in the House--I know Barbara very well--says this about that \nprovision:\n\n       Even though Social Security contributed nothing to the \n     current economic crisis, it has been bartered in a deal that \n     provides deficit busting tax cuts for the wealthy. Diverting \n     $120 billion in Social Security contributions for a so-called \n     ``tax holiday'' may sound like a good idea for workers now, \n     but it is bad business for the program that a majority of \n     middle-class seniors will rely upon in the future.\n       Conservatives have long dreamed of a payroll tax holiday \n     because it fulfills two ideological goals, lower taxes and \n     weakening Social Security finances. The White House claims \n     the 2 percent payroll tax cut won't impact Social Security; \n     however, we disagree.\n       There's no such thing as a ``temporary'' tax cut.\n\n  And the fear right here is that cut will, in fact, go on \nindefinitely.\n  Mr. President, I talked about the payroll tax for a moment. Let me \ntalk about another aspect of the agreement the President signed with \nRepublicans; that is, while some of the business tax cuts in this \nagreement may work well to create jobs and some may not, economists on \nboth ends of the political spectrum believe the better way to spur the \neconomy and create jobs is to spend money rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  With corporate America already sitting on close to $2 trillion in \ncash on hand, the problem we are seeing in our economy today is not \nthat large corporations are taxed too highly, it is that the middle \nclass doesn't have enough money to purchase their goods. Creating \ndecent-paying jobs and rebuilding our infrastructure could seriously \naddress that problem.\n  What we have right now, as I think you know, Mr. President, is an \ninfrastructure that is crumbling. There are very credible estimates out \nthere that we need to invest, in the next 5 years, several trillion \ndollars in rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater \nplants, our mass transportation, our railroads. China is exploding with \nhigh-speed rail. We do not have any significant high-speed rail in this \ncountry. If we are serious about creating jobs, in my view, the most \neffective way to do that is to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, \nwhich makes our entire country stronger, more competitive and, at the \nsame time, short term it gives us the best bang we can get for the buck \nin terms of job creation. That is another issue.\n  Tax breaks for businesses may work; maybe they won't. But I don't \nthink that type of investment is anywhere near as effective in terms of \njob creation as investing in the infrastructure.\n  The fifth point I want to make on why I think this agreement is not a \ngood one: One of the positive aspects of the agreement--one that I \ncertainly support, and I know you do, Mr. President--is the need to \nextend unemployment benefits for millions of workers today who face the \npossibility that within a few weeks those extended unemployment \nbenefits may end. These are workers who are experiencing \nextraordinarily difficult times through no fault of their own, often \ncaught up in the Wall Street crisis, but they have lost their jobs.\n  In various parts of this country it is awfully hard to get a job. \nMore and more people are applying for jobs, and the jobs are not there. \nWe have the moral responsibility to extend unemployment benefits and \nallow those working families the opportunity to pay their bills and \ngive them at least a modicum of security.\n  Here is the point I want to make. I strongly, absolutely believe any \nagreement has to have an extension of unemployment benefits for at \nleast 13 months, maybe longer. But when folks who support this \nagreement say we want a great compromise, we managed to get an \nextension of unemployment benefits there, what I would say is that for \nthe past 40 years, under both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, whenever the unemployment rate has been above 7.2 \npercent--now we are\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nlooking at 9.8 percent--unemployment insurance has always been \nextended.\n  So this great compromise is simply doing what we have already been \ndoing as a matter of costs for the last 40 years, when Republicans ran \nthe Senate and when Democrats ran the Senate, with Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Presidents. There was a consensus that we \ncannot leave fellow Americans high and dry when unemployment is high. \nWell, unemployment today is very high. In my view, this is not a great \ncompromise. This is simply doing what this country has done under both \nDemocrats and Republicans for 40 years.\n  Mr. President, I have been mentioning my concerns about this \nagreement, but let me also say, absolutely, there are positive elements \nto this agreement. I don't want to suggest for a moment there are not. \nExtending middle-class tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans is \nsomething that must be done, absolutely.\n  As you know, during the Bush years, median family income declined by \nover $2,000. What we are seeing in many parts of this country is that \nwages are actually going down, not up. People are working longer hours \nfor lower wages.\n  Does the middle class of this country need to continue to have that \ntax break? Of course they do. I will fight as hard as I can to make \nsure they do. So this proposal is, in fact, an important proposal. \nThere are other good proposals in it. The earned-income tax credit for \nworking Americans is very important. The child and college tax credits \nare also very important. These proposals will keep millions of \nAmericans from slipping out of the middle class and into poverty, and \nthey will allow millions more to send their kids to college.\n\n  But when we look at the overall package, we must put it in a broader \ncontext. What will the message of this legislation mean for the future \nof our country? And I think one point that has to be made is that if we \npass this agreement as written, it says we are going to continue the \nBush policy of trickle-down economics for at least 2 more years. To my \nmind, that is absurd. This is a policy--based on all of the evidence--\nthat grotesquely failed. After 8 years of Bush-style economics, with \nall of these tax breaks for the rich, we ended up losing 500,000 \nprivate sector jobs--not a very impressive record. In fact, it is about \nthe worst record in job creation in modern history.\n  Here is another concern that I have that I think folks are not \ntalking about enough. This is what I believe will happen right after \nthis agreement is passed. And I am going to do everything I can to see \nthat it is not passed, and I hope very much that it is not passed, but \nif it is passed, no one should have any illusions that our Republican \nfriends will not be back in a month or two saying the following: Gee, \nour national debt is getting close to $14 trillion, we have a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit, and, you know what, we are going to have to cut. We \nare going to have to cut and cut and cut. Nobody should have any \nillusion that in 2 months there will not be ferocious debates on the \nfloor of the Senate on the part of people who want to cut Social \nSecurity, who want to cut Medicare, who want to cut Medicaid, who want \nto cut childcare and education in general and environmental protection. \nTax breaks for billionaires is good, but cutting back on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid is also what they want to do.\n  I think Senator Sherrod Brown, a moment ago, just crystallized that. \nThat is what it is about. We can afford to give $70 billion a year to \nthe top 2 percent, the wealthiest people, but we can't afford to spend \n$14 billion a year to make sure senior citizens and disabled vets get a \n$250 check. That is what this whole thing is going to be about--tax \nbreaks for the rich and cutbacks on all of the programs the middle-\nclass and working families of this country desperately need.\n  Mr. President, I will be back tomorrow because there is a lot more \nthat has to be said on this issue, but let me conclude by saying I will \ngive credit to my Republican colleagues in that they have been pretty \nhonest and straightforward about what they intend to do. There is \nnothing mysterious about it. What they want to do is to take this \ncountry back to the 1920s. They want to take us back to the days where, \nwhen you were old, there was no Social Security and you had to fend for \nyourself in the waning years of your life when you couldn't work. They \nwant to ultimately destroy Medicare.\n  I would suggest to all of the senior citizens in this country--the \npeople who are 70, 75, 80; people who are maybe struggling with one \nillness or another--good luck in going to a private insurance company \nto get help when you are low-income and sick. It ain't gonna happen. \nThey are not going to be there because they can't make any money off of \nyou.\n  Those people are going to be out there on the street all alone \nbecause they are not going to be able to get the help they need if \nMedicare is destroyed, and the same thing with Medicaid.\n  You know, Mr. President, you and I heard in this Chamber the great \ndebate over the death panels, the famous death panels that were \nincluded, supposedly, in the health care reform bill we passed. Well, \nit turns out that death panels are, in fact, now arising in America but \nnot because of the health care reform passed here in Washington.\n  In Arizona, right now the Governor there apparently is deciding they \ndo not have the money in their Medicaid Program to provide transplants \nto people who, without those transplants, will die. That is called a \ndeath panel. If you are poor and you need a transplant and you are \nliving in Arizona, good luck to you.\n  Let me conclude by simply saying that I believe very strongly that we \ncan forge a much better agreement than the current one before us. I \nbelieve, in my State of Vermont and all over this country, that the \nvast majority of people do not think it makes any sense at all to give \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest people \nin this country so that we can drive up the national debt and have our \nkids and grandchildren pay higher taxes in order to pay off that debt. \nThat doesn't make sense to progressives like me, and it doesn't make \nsense to conservatives out there.\n  So I think the American people are on our side--at least the side \nthat opposes this agreement. Our job here--I know it is a shocking \nidea--is to represent the middle-class and working families, not just \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to share some of my \nconcerns about the package that has been negotiated between the \nPresident and the Republicans and has now been presented here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  First, I wish to emphasize the size of the decision that is going to \nbe made in the next couple of days. This deficit spending stimulus \npackage is a $1 trillion package. Let's turn the clock back to the \ndebate over the stimulus package we had in 2009. That stimulus was \nabout $800 billion--only 80 percent of the size of this package. That \nstimulus had in it direct construction jobs across America. Every \ncommunity, every county benefited from an increase in production. It \nalso had the making work pay tax deduction. It had a host of small \nbusiness tax deductions, and it had direct assistance to our States to \nenable them to meet some of the crises they were experiencing in health \ncare and in education, so we could keep our schools across America open \nduring this great Bush recession.\n  I have listened over the last year and a half to tremendous attacks \non that stimulus package. Yet this is a much larger decision. This is a \n$1 trillion decision, and it is a package that much less thought has \ngone into. We have this package here on the floor, but we haven't \nactually gotten the paper in our hands as to what is in it. We have to \nrely on newspaper accounts as to what is going to be in it.\n  Tonight, in offices across this Nation, folks are trying to get it \noff the Internet, and they are going to be trying to analyze it and \nunderstand it. We\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nknow the basic outlines, and the basic outlines raise a significant \nnumber of concerns. I encourage our citizens to look at this package \nover the weekend and to share their concerns with their Congressmen and \nCongresswomen and certainly with their Senators.\n  This is a $1 trillion deficit. There has been a lot of talk on the \nfloor not only about the stimulus last year but about the size of our \nnational debt. This is a $1 trillion increase in our national debt. I \nwould think that is something we would be tearing apart and looking at \nevery part of it and asking if each dollar is being spent to the \nmaximum effect. We should have amendments that say: Hey, we can create \na lot more jobs if we spend these few million dollars over here rather \nthan here, so that every dollar makes a maximum impact in putting \nAmerica back to work. But not a single amendment is going to be allowed \non this bill, as far as we are aware tonight. I believe that in a \ndecision of this magnitude, there should be amendments that compare the \neffect of spending money here versus there and about what is going to \nhave the greatest impact in a favorable way for America.\n  My good colleague from Vermont pointed out that this reduces the flow \nof resources into Social Security. I think we should have an extensive \ndebate about coming to rely on the general fund, which is what the \nadministration wants to do. They are going to substitute payroll \nrevenue for general fund revenue. I think we should have a substantial \ndebate about depending upon general revenue to supply funds to the \nSocial Security fund.\n  Let me explain this. The approximately $120 billion that will flow \ninto Social Security from the general fund under this program comes \nfrom borrowed funds. Those borrowed funds come primarily from China. So \nSocial Security--a program for Americans in which we save our own money \nand invest that money so there can be a very modest steady income in \nthe retirement years--now is going to rely upon borrowed funds from \nChina. That is the American retirement plan? We should be debating that \non the floor of the Senate, and it should be an extensive debate, not a \ndebate in which cloture is going to be rushed on Monday and then have \n30 hours split among 100 Members, because we are spending $1 trillion \nof deficit money under this plan.\n  My first main concern is that we are taking a step to greatly \nincrease the national debt with this plan. My second concern is this \nplan 100 percent endorses the Bush tax structure that has so deeply \ndamaged our Nation. Many of you will recall that when the economy grew \nunder President Bush II, the living wages of working Americans actually \nfailed to increase. The economy grew but the wages didn't grow for \nworking Americans. In addition, we doubled our national debt.\n  That is what happens when we say we are going to create a plan that \ngives away our national treasure to the most affluent. We are going to \ndo so in a manner that doesn't create living wage jobs, doesn't reward \nthe productivity of American workers.\n  I am going to tell you that we made a major decision in about 1974, \nabout the year I graduated from high school, and that was to adopt \nstrategies, which failed, to link the productivity of American workers \nto their compensation. Up until that point in the postwar era, as our \nproductivity as a nation grew, the financial success of our working \nfamilies grew along with that increase in productivity. But since 1974, \nthe tremendous, spectacular increase in the productivity and national \nwealth of our Nation has not been shared with the workers of our \nNation. Is that the type of America we want, where many work to make \nthis Nation a success and do not share in the reward? The Bush tax cut \nstructure is the ultimate embodiment of that philosophy of carving off \nthe national treasure for the very few.\n  I do not think our success as a nation should be measured by the \nsuccess of our wealthiest families. I applaud them for their \nentrepreneurship. I applaud them when the strategies to create \ncompanies succeed. But it is up to us to create a structure that says, \nas the work product increases we are going to enable all families to \nthrive--not for a few to thrive spectacularly while everyone else stays \non a level plain.\n  Back in my home community, the community in which I grew up, a \nworking class community of three-bedroom ranch houses, so many children \nnow consider it a success if they can simply afford to purchase their \nparents' home because it is only their parents' home, with the \nassistance from their parents, that they can afford on a working \nAmerican family's salary because while the worker's share of the \nnational income has not increased with productivity, housing prices \nhave gone up enormously, making it harder and harder for a working \nfamily to afford a home.\n  Embodied in these Bush breaks that have so deeply damaged our Nation \nwe have a very interesting feature, and that is that under this plan \nPresident Obama has proposed with the Republicans--it says we are going \nto extend breaks not just so the wealthiest can enjoy the same breaks \non their first $1 million that others receive for the money they are \nearning up to $1 million, but bonus breaks on top of that.\n  Let me give you a sense of that. The amount of the tax break that is \ngiven to everyone who earns their first $1 million is about $43,000. \nLet's round it off: $40,000. Under this plan, those families earning \nover $1 million receive an average of an additional bonus of $100,000 \nper taxpayer, a $100,000 bonus to the most successful families in the \ncountry. That is pretty generous. That is enormously generous. Are we \ngoing to be generous with our working families? Unfortunately, no. \nUnder this plan a family earning in the vicinity of $40,000 to $50,000 \ngets about $1,700. A family that earns $40,000 or less gets somewhere \nin the nature of $1,000. So $1,000 for a working family versus $43,000 \nplus a $100,000 bonus for our wealthiest families in America.\n  Let's see, $1,000; $143,000. There is very little to those who are \nbuilding the success and wealth of our Nation through the productivity \nof our workmanship, and a whole lot to those who are spectacularly \nwealthy already.\n  The structure of the capital gains tax under this proposal and the \nstructure of the estate tax add to the impact of the income tax \nbrackets I was just describing. If you add it all up, and if you have \nbeen spectacularly successful through this recession, then you can \ncount on a whole lot of help, generous gifts from Uncle Sam. If you \nhave been struggling and you are earning near minimum wage, or maybe \nyou are working 60 hours a week, three jobs, each 20 hours earning a \nminimum wage, you get about $1,000 under this plan. That sort of \nreinforcement of the fundamental disparity between working families and \nthose who are best off is not healthy for America. That does not build \nthe financial foundation so families can afford to give their children \nsubstantial opportunities.\n  The America in which I grew up, the vision of my father and mother's \ngeneration was that we would have an America with opportunity for every \nfamily. We are leaving that vision behind with this bill.\n  Let me turn to my next main concern. The $1 trillion package is \ndesigned to be a stimulus. But has it been designed well, to spend \nevery tax dollar in a smart way? There are many folks in this Chamber \nwho say they are fiscal conservatives. I am a fiscal conservative \nbecause I believe every dollar needs to be spent in a smart way. Let's \ntest this.\n  Parts of this package get an A, and parts of this package get an F. \nThe part that gets an A is unemployment insurance. This is important \nand fundamental to our families. We have always had the philosophy that \nwhen there are no jobs to be had, when people cannot get a job through \nno fault of their own, we are going to extend unemployment benefits to \nhelp families through that rough time. We have always done it, \nDemocrats and Republicans, until this year when our Republicans have \nturned their backs on working families and said: Not now. We will not \nsupport extending support unless we take it away from some other \nimportant part of the budget. But, they said, we will support $100,000 \nbonuses without taking anything away from anyone else.\n  That unity of support for our working families during hard times \ndisappeared this year. That is too bad. That is a tragedy.\n  The fundamental premise has been, by my colleagues across the aisle: \nWe are going to hold those families hostage to get a $100,000 bonus on \ntop of a\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nvery generous basic tax break for the wealthiest, hold working families \nhostage for a lot of help for the very few at the very top. Those bonus \ntax breaks are rated dead last by the Congressional Budget Office in \ncreating jobs in this Nation. Unemployment assistance is rated at the \ntop, the most effective way of creating jobs in this Nation--and it \nshould be in any package. It should be extended and has been extended \nin a bipartisan manner in the past until this year when, unfortunately, \nit seems that my colleagues across the aisle became all about the few \nand not about helping families when there are no jobs.\n  There is great irony in this because we don't have jobs in this \nNation because of the great Bush recession created by my friends across \nthe aisle. First of all, they deregulated the retail mortgages, and \nthey allowed predatory loans. Those predatory loans meant, according to \nthe Wall Street Journal, 60 percent of the families in America who \nqualified for a basic, amortizing, inexpensive, prime mortgage were \nsteered into subprime mortgages. Then my good friends said: Let's let \nWall Street do whatever it wants in packaging these mortgages. Let's \nend the oversight and let's end the caps on leverage. So they created \nsecurities; that is, packages of mortgages. And they sold the rights to \nthose packages. Those securities were doomed to blow up when the \npredatory features of the mortgages kicked in after 2 years and \ninterest rates jumped from 4.5 percent to 9 percent.\n  We have been dealing, since I came into office in the Senate, with \nthe tremendous economic bomb produced by the Bush policies, the great \nBush recession that created the unemployment so that people cannot get \njobs. Now the same folks who created that disaster are saying: We are \nnot going to help those who are being hurt by the disaster we created. \nIt is like setting your house on fire and then cutting off the water to \nthe fire hose.\n  If my Republican friends are so determined to adopt the very worst \njob-creating strategy, we should take it out of this bill, or at least \nhave a debate on this floor of the Senate about whether we put it in \nthe worst strategy or move those funds over here to the best strategy \nor to some other good job-creating strategy. Maybe all the features \ndon't need to be As or A-pluses. But we have the Republican F plan \nbecause it is the worst as rated by the CBO. We have the Democratic A \nplan, support for the uninsured--it should be in here.\n  What about some of the other things? One of the very best ways to get \nour country going is low-cost loans to create energy-saving renovations \nin homes and buildings. It creates a tremendous number of jobs for \ndollars spent because it is a low-cost jobs program, not a grant \nprogram. It is ranked very high in the number of jobs it creates. We \nhave a construction industry in this country that would love to go to \nwork, and we have three bills sitting here before the Senate.\n  We have the HOME Star bill for families to do energy saving \nrenovations to their home. We have the Building Star bill to allow \ncommercial buildings, office suites, industrial site buildings to be \nimproved in energy renovation. The loans are paid back through the \nenergy savings. So it creates a long-term positive in terms of the \nenergy strategy of this Nation. It works very well for the families, \nvery well for the businesses, and puts the construction industry back \nto work. That is the type of program we should be weighing against the \nF plan--that is from A to F, F for last, F for failure, F in CBO's \nanalysis for the worst job-creating plan, which is what the Republicans \nhave forced into this package.\n  Without amendments to this package, we cannot have that debate. There \nis a tradition of saying the Senate is the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Don't we have to have amendments to do that? Don't \nwe have to have a debate on where to put different pieces of this \npuzzle to do that? I have been advocating for a guaranteed way to make \nsure the minority and the majority get to have amendments on this \nfloor.\n  I happen to be a member of the majority right now, but I will be a \nmember of the minority down the road--if I am here long enough, and I \nguess that is a big if--because the pendulum swings back and forth. But \nto be accountable before the people of this Nation, amendments have to \nbe offered and debate has to be held and votes have to be taken and \nthat is not being done on this bill as far as we know.\n  I know there is a possibility. I praise leaders of both sides in \nadvance if they work out a deal that everyone can offer their \namendments, or even a modest number of amendments on both sides.\n  Because that is the way it should be on the floor. That is what I \nhave been advocating, that we have regular order that allows \namendments. But I am afraid that Monday will come, that a deal will not \nget worked out, and we will not have the ability to have that debate, \nwill not have the ability to be transparent before the American people \nin where we stand.\n  My good colleague from Vermont has shared a concern I also share; \nthat is, the payroll tax being cut off, snuffed out as a supply of \nSocial Security, that our retirement plan that we pay for ourselves is \nbeing changed to a retirement plan financed by China.\n  So the national debt, $1 trillion--that is a concern. The structure \nof the Bush tax breaks that so deeply damaged our Nation over the last \ndecade being extended into the next decade is a major concern, as is \nthe poor design of the stimulus where every dollar has not been tested \nagainst its ability to create jobs at a time we desperately need jobs, \nand the change in our funding of Social Security, and it is dependent \nupon Chinese funds. Those items need to be debated. They are profound \nconcerns. Maybe there are answers that make sense. I look forward to \nhearing such answers, if they exist. I would like to see those answers \ntested through amendments offered on this floor.\n  I have an amendment I would like to see offered on the floor. I have \nan amendment that says: Take the $100,000 bonus breaks for the \nwealthiest 2 percent and instead dedicate that to Social Security. \nLet's make sure our seniors who need basic support in their retirement \nare well-secured before handing out $100,000 bonus breaks to the very \nfew. Well, I do not know if that would pass on this floor. I do not \nknow where people would stand. But I know people should have to declare \nwhere they stand so the voters can decide if they like it or not, so \nthe voters can call and say: We would encourage you to vote this way or \nthat way.\n  The other thing I like about that particular approach is it says: If \nwe are going to reduce the payroll tax in the short term to create \njobs, we are going to do something else to make sure our Social \nSecurity does not depend on funds from China. I would like to see that \ndebate.\n  I would like to see the energy tax credits debated. They are not in \nthis package as of now, as far as we know. Energy tax credits pay us \nback in a number of ways. The first is that currently we import a \ntremendous amount of oil from the Middle East and from Venezuela, from \nNigeria, from places that do not necessarily share our national \noutlook. A lot of that money ends up in the hands of terrorist \norganizations.\n  Military security analysts now say this is the first set of wars we \nare in right now--the first wars in which we are funding both sides. \nAnd how are we doing that? Through our energy policies which send funds \nto countries that then pass on funds to terrorists. That is not smart. \nIt makes more sense to free our energy here at home.\n  I will tell you something else. In addition to increasing our \nnational security and spending those dollars here at home on energy we \ncreate ourselves, red, white, and blue American energy, that keeps \nthose dollars here in our communities, and when those dollars stay in \nour communities, they create jobs in our communities. It means families \nget jobs, and they spend the money from those jobs in these \ncommunities. So it cycles through into the retail stores, into the \ngrocery markets, keeping those dollars here creating jobs rather than \nshipping them overseas for oil.\n  It does another thing as well; that is, it reduces our energy \nconsumption from abroad, which largely means shifting from oil to clean \nsources. And those clean sources will put less carbon dioxide in the \nair. That means we do a much better job being good stewards of our \nplanet.\n  So energy tax credits encourage clean energy, keep jobs here, \nimproving our national security and being\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\ngood stewards of the planet. Why don't we have that debate on the floor \nof this Senate before we send this bill back to the House?\n  Another colleague has amendments that say: OK, we are going to vote \non a trillion-dollar stimulus package that creates a trillion-dollar \ndebt. Shouldn't we tie it to some kind of trigger for fiscal \nresponsibility that will kick in maybe 24 months out so we do not head \nrecklessly down a path into extraordinary debt that deeply damages our \nNation even further?\n  So fiscal responsibility--tie some fiscal responsibility measures to \nthis package. That is a good idea. I applaud my colleague from Oregon \nwho has raised that idea, Senator Wyden, who has done a lot of work on \nhow we can create fiscal responsibility tied to a package going through \nnow. It will say something to the international financiers that this \nshort-term deficit spending is going to be marked by substantial fiscal \ndiscipline, and that in itself may serve other things, such as keeping \nthe interest rate low that we pay, so fewer of our dollars go out in \ninterest.\n  These ideas, these amendments deserve a debate on this major decision \nfacing this body over the next few days.\n  I will close by saying that I am deeply concerned--deeply concerned--\nabout the deficit and the debt. I am deeply concerned about the Bush \ntax breaks that have done so much damage and are being extended into \nthe next decade. I am deeply concerned about the poor design of the \nstimulus, deeply concerned about Social Security being made dependent \nupon borrowing from China, deeply concerned that this package is being \nput together and may not have the opportunity to have the debate over \nelements that should be debated because if they do not stand up on the \nfloor of the Senate in debate, they do not belong in this package.\n  So with that, I say to our friends across the Nation, you have a few \ndays only to weigh in. Please do weigh in. Let us hear your voice. Let \nus consider your views. And let us fully deliberate on this package \nbefore we pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8708-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                            Byron L. Dorgan\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in honoring the \nservice of Senator Byron Dorgan. Over his nearly 30 years in Congress, \nSenator Dorgan has been a strong and dedicated advocate for the people \nof the State of North Dakota.\n  Senator Dorgan's long career in public service began in 1969 when he \nwas appointed North Dakota State Tax Commissioner. Assuming this \nposition at the age of only 26, Senator Dorgan became the youngest \nconstitutional officer in North Dakota's history.\n  Since 1980, Senator Dorgan has been a voice for the people of North \nDakota in Washington, DC. After serving six terms in the House of \nRepresentatives, he was first elected to the Senate in 1992.\n  It is clear that Senator Dorgan's upbringing in the small town of \nRegent, ND, has shaped his tenure in Congress. Throughout his years in \nCongress, Senator Dorgan has been a formidable advocate for rural \nAmerica and the family farmers of his state. He led the effort to make \npermanent the disaster aid program, which provides an essential safety-\nnet for farmers and ranchers affected by severe weather, in the 2008 \nfarm bill.\n  Senator Dorgan also has been a great advocate for North Dakota's \nenergy sector. As the country moves toward renewable and domestic \nenergy sources, he has worked to put his state at the forefront of the \nindustry.\n  After so many years of public service for the people of North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan's time in the Senate is coming to a close. I am proud to \nhave served with him, and I thank him for his service in the Senate. I \nwish Senator Dorgan and his family the best in the next chapters in \ntheir lives.\n\n\n                           Robert F. Bennett\n\n  Mr. President, I also join my colleagues in recognizing Senator \nRobert Bennett of Utah.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Senator Bennett since I \nentered the Senate in 1997, four years after Senator Bennett began his \nSenate service. I have admired his enthusiasm and dedication to serving \nthe people of Utah ever since.\n  It was clear that public service was in his blood. From his election \nas student body president at the University of Utah, to his time in the \nUtah Army National Guard, Senator Bennett's priority for his entire \nadult life has been serving the people of his home State.\n  His first taste of real politics came in the 1960s when he helped his \nfather Wallace Bennett win re-election to this very Chamber. And while \nhe did not seek office himself until almost 20 years following his \nfather's retirement, he worked in the private sector in Utah, deepening \nhis ties to the State and his devotion to the people of Utah.\n  I have had the privilege of working side-by-side with Senator Bennett \non the Appropriations Committee for many years. I have seen his passion \nfor service, his respect for the Senate, and above all else, his love \nof Utah.\n  He has managed to stay true to the fiscal principles that he gained \nas a businessman and CEO, while understanding the need for compromise \nwhen it was required of him for the sake of his State and the rest of \nAmerica.\n  During his tenure here, Utah has become a premiere destination of the \nWest--he has worked for quality education for Utah's children, fought \nto preserve its natural landscapes, and paved the way for the \ndevelopment of 21st century infrastructure back home.\n  Senator Bennett also made America proud in 2002 when he helped the \nSalt Lake City Winter Olympics become one of the most successful and \nsafe Olympic games in recent memory.\n  Of course, Senator Bennett and I have not always seen eye-to-eye on \nmany issues. But my respect for his beliefs has always been deep.

Mr. President, I rise today in solemn remembrance of a \ndear friend of mine from Ashland, KY, who passed away peacefully at his \nhome this Veterans Day. Mr. Charles Wheeler was a consummate small \nbusinessman, local official, and advocate for higher education. I knew \nCharles for over 30 years, and I can tell you that the love he felt for \nhis community in the Commonwealth was surpassed only by his affection \nfor his beloved wife of 60 years, Mary Kathryn Wheeler.\n  Born in Paintsville, KY, Charles owned and operated a local hardware \nstore in Boyd County for nearly 40 years--helping to build his \ncommunity and assist all who met him, literally and figuratively. It is \nno wonder then, that Charles's friendly manner and smart tact got him \nelected as an Ashland city commissioner by the age of 28. Before long, \nhis friends and neighbors elected him to represent them in the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly, where he served for 8 years.\n  My friend continued to serve his community by serving on the Morehead \nState University Board of Regents for a decade during a period when \nthat institution saw great growth. His pursuit of excellence in higher \neducation undoubtedly changed the lives of countless students.\n  I could surely continue to draw to mind the instances when Charles \nhelped meet the need of his community, and this Senator, but I would \nsimply ask that my colleagues join me in remembering the life of a \nhumble man who showed incredible character throughout his entire life. \nAnd I would further ask that they join me in expressing my sincerest \ncondolences to Charles's beloved wife, children, grandchildren, great-\ngrandchildren, siblings and other family members.\n  The Ashland Daily Independent recently published an editorial that \nhighlights some of Charles Wheeler's accomplishments, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Ashland Daily Independent, Nov. 17, 2010]\n\nCharles Wheeler: He Was a Leader in Business, Politics and Education in \n                                  Area\n\n       Ashland.--Charles Dona Wheeler spent most of his adult life \n     as a business, political and education leader in this region. \n     He died quietly at his residence on Veterans Day. He was 81.\n       As a business leader, he owned and operated Wheeler-\n     Williams Hardware in Boyd County from 1962 until he closed \n     the business in 2000. He also was a developer of Southern \n     Hills Estates, a beautiful, upscale subdivision off Boy Scout \n     Road.\n       Wheeler's political career began early in life when he was \n     elected to the Ashland Board of City Commissioners at the age \n     of 28. He went on to serve for eight years--or four terms--as \n     the representative from the 100th District in Kentucky. After \n     leaving office, he remained a leader of the Republican Party \n     in Boyd County and in Kentucky for many years.\n       Although he never earned a college degree, Wheeler helped \n     open the doors to a college education for thousands of young \n     people in this region by serving on the Morehead State \n     University Board of Regents. His decade of service on the MSU \n     governing body during a time of great growth for the \n     university continues to benefit this region by the many \n     students the university has helped train who continue to play \n     important roles in this area's business, educational, \n     cultural and social life.\n       To his wife of 60 years, Mary Kathryn Wheeler, and his \n     large extended family, Charles Wheeler was a loving husband, \n     father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother and uncle. To \n     others in this community, Charles Wheeler was a leader who \n     made a difference through his many years of quietly working \n     for the betterment of this community and this region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8709-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PROJECT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that \ntakes a tremendous personal and economic toll on both the individual \nand the family. Today, an estimated 5.3 million Americans--including \nmore than 25,000 Mainers--are living with Alzheimer's disease, more \nthan double the number in 1980. If nothing is done to change the \ncurrent trajectory, 13.5 million Americans over the age of 65 will have \nAlzheimer's disease by 2050.\n  In addition to the suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United \nStates $172 billion a year, primarily in nursing home and other long-\nterm care costs. This figure will only increase exponentially as the \nbaby boom generation ages. If nothing is done to slow or stop the \ndisease, Alzheimer's will cost the United States $20 trillion over the \nnext 40 years.\n  At a time of mounting deficits, the increasing number of Alzheimer's \ncases has dire implications for our Federal budget as well. The average \nannual Medicare payment for an individual with Alzheimer's is three \ntimes higher than for those without the condition. For Medicaid, \naverage payments are nine times higher. Failure to achieve progress in \nthe fight against the disease will result in Alzheimer's costs to \nMedicare skyrocketing more than 600 percent and costs to Medicaid \ngrowing more than 400 percent by 2050.\n  Despite these alarming projections, to date there is no national \nstrategy to defeat Alzheimer's, and our efforts to combat the disease \nhave lacked coordination and focus. That is why I am so pleased that \nthe Senate last night passed the National Alzheimer's Project Act, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Bayh, to create a coordinated strategic \nnational plan for combating Alzheimer's disease.\n  The National Alzheimer's Project Act, which is based on a key \nrecommendation of the nonpartisan Alzheimer's Study Group led by former \nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, \nwill launch a campaign within the Federal Government to overcome \nAlzheimer's disease. First, it directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to create a coordinated National Alzheimer's Disease \nPlan to combat Alzheimer's disease. This plan will be updated annually \nand a report will be submitted to Congress assessing the Nation's \nprogress in preparing for the growing burden of Alzheimer's disease.\n  The legislation also establishes an Interagency Advisory Council to \nadvise the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the plan, which is \nalso to include implementation steps and recommendations for priority \nactions. The advisory council is also charged with coordinating all \nFederal efforts on Alzheimer's research, care, institutional services, \nand home and community-based programs.\n  Funding for these activities will come from existing funding \nappropriated for the Department of Health and Human Services. No new \nfunding is authorized. The coordinated effort called for in the \nlegislation will simply ensure that our existing resources are \nmaximized and leveraged to combat Alzheimer's disease.\n  Our legislation has broad, bipartisan support. It was passed out of \nthe Senate HELP Committee unanimously, and it has now been approved \nunanimously by the full Senate, clearing it for action by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8709-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAJOR LANCE BURNETT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize MAJ Lance Burnett's \nservice to his country and as an Air Force fellow on my staff. Major \nBurnett joined my office through the Congressional Fellows Program. \nOver the past year, he has been an invaluable addition to my staff. He \nhas demonstrated an expertise with military policy issues and built \nclose relationships both within the office and on Capitol Hill.\n  As a member of my staff, Major Burnett has been closely involved in a \nnumber of policy areas. He has assisted with the defense appropriations \nprocess, liaised with the Veterans Affairs Committee, and coordinated \ncongressional delegations. He has served as an adviser on issues \nrelating to the armed services to me and my staff, adding invaluable \nperspective. He has exemplified the Air Force values of ``Integrity \nFirst, Service before Self, and Excellence in All We Do'' through his \nwork. The Air Force has recognized his service through his selection \nfor promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel on August 26, 2010.\n  Major Burnett hails from Cameron, TX. He received his bachelor of \nscience degree from Texas A University and his commission from the \nAir Force Officer and Training School. Since earning his flight wings \nin 1998, Major Burnett has become a senior navigator, completing over \n2,800 flight hours of with 613 hours of them in combat.\n  Major Burnett has served as an instructor and evaluator navigator in \nboth the Air Mobility Command and the Air Force Special Operations \nCommand, flying support missions for Operations Southern Watch, Joint \nForge, Joint Endeavor, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, as well as \nnumerous counternarcotics missions in South America.\n  Prior to being accepted into the Congressional Fellows Program, Major \nBurnett was the MC-130E/H standardization and evaluation branch chief \nat Headquarters Air Force Special Operations Command where he was \nresponsible for all 30 MC-130E Combat Talon and MC-130H Combat Talon II \naircraft in the USAF inventory and their associated 390 aircrew \nmembers. He has been honored with the Meritorious Service Medal, the \nAir Medal with six Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal, \nthe Air Force Combat Action Medal, and the 2006 General P.K. Carlton \nAward for Valor. Major Burnett and his wife Andrea have two children, \nPeyton and Andrew.\n  I would like to pay a special tribute to Major Burnett's tremendous \npublic service and recognize his work on behalf of Pennsylvanians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8709-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8709-S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAKE A VETERAN TO SCHOOL\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my profound \nappreciation for the Take a Veteran to School Day program in my home \nState of Maine with ceremonies that took place on November 9 and 10 of \nthis year, appropriately right before Veterans Day on November 11. And \nit is especially fitting that we recognize these events this week as we \npaused this past Tuesday, on December 7, to remember those who perished \n69 years ago at Pearl Harbor, a day that President Franklin Roosevelt \ndeclared ``will live in infamy.''\n  First and foremost, I want to extend my enormous gratitude to the \nMaine\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nNational Guard, and especially MG John Libby, Maine's Adjutant General, \nwho not only reached out to our veterans to encourage their engagement \nin the program, but who also participated in the Rockland District \nMiddle School ceremony. In addition, joining with the Guard in bringing \nthe History Channel's national award-winning program to fruition in \nMaine was Time Warner Cable, which sponsored the program and should be \ncommended for its example and dedication to this outstanding endeavor.\n  Together, leaders of our military and our media have combined efforts \nin the noble undertaking of saluting our veterans through the Take a \nVeteran to School Day initiative, which brings veterans into our \nschools to share their personal stories of service and sacrifice for \nthe Nation with students and educators. It has become an invaluable \nopportunity for students to learn what Veterans Day and serving our \nNation in uniform truly means--and it provides a unique chance to \nexpress a heartfelt and well-earned ``thank you'' to the brave men and \nwomen who from generation to generation have woven the fabric of \nAmerica's greatness.\n  And I couldn't be more pleased that more than 650 students and \neducators, 200 local community members, and 100 veterans from every \nmilitary conflict since World War II made Maine's inaugural Take a \nVeteran to School Day program a resounding success. This year, in my \nState of Maine, three schools--York Middle School, Biddeford High \nSchool, and Rockland District Middle School--shared in paying tribute \nto our veterans in our first ever program.\n  I cannot thank the sponsors and supporters of this program enough for \nrecognizing how vital it is that young Americans are able to hear the \npersonal stories of service in the military, and to remember the \nsacrifices made by Maine veterans for our country. In fact, Time Warner \nCable recorded 20 veterans' stories for the Library of Congress's \nVeterans' History Project, which will be added to its archives so that \nfuture generations will have an opportunity to hear veterans speak \nabout their service to the Nation, bringing a personal perspective to \nmilitary history that students otherwise would only learn about through \nbooks.\n  As The York Weekly reported, York Middle School Principal Steve \nBishop introduced the veterans in attendance by saying, ``my hope is \nthat you gain a sense that the opportunities you have today are made \npossible by the veterans behind me.'' As you can imagine, I am looking \nforward to next year's program, and I hope that States and school \ndistricts around the Nation will follow suit in shining a spotlight on \nour veterans through this wonderful enterprise. Make no mistake, it is \nbecause of our veterans that America is the greatest Nation on Earth, \nand the Take a Veteran to School Day program is a shining testament to \nthat immutable truth.\n  When we pay homage to our courageous veterans, we are demonstrating \nthat we always reserve our deepest respect and praise for those who \nhave summoned the courage to place themselves in harm's way on our \nbehalf. That they have done so in order to ensure the blessings of \nliberty makes us grateful beyond words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8710-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                AIRBORNE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, America has maintained its role as \nthe world's most innovative and predominant economy in large part due \nto its 27.5 million small businesses. And many of these companies \npartake in significant Federal contracting and subcontracting \nopportunities, affording these businesses with the ability to \nparticipate in the development of new and cutting-edge technologies and \nproducts. I rise today to recognize one Maine company that has taken \npart in the Federal procurement process and\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\ncontributed tremendously to a number of highly advanced projects.\n  Fiber Materials was established in the southern Maine town of \nBiddeford in 1969 and has become a global leader in the design, \nmanufacture, and testing of a variety of advanced composites in its 40 \nyears of operation. The company produces a wide range of materials, \nfrom carbon/carbon composites used in the construction of heatshields \nand missile nosetips, to quartz products designed for printed circuit \nboards or electrical and thermal insulation. Fiber Materials now \nemploys roughly 180 employees at its facilities in Biddeford and \nPresque Isle, and its Space Technology Division in Columbus, OH.\n  Fiber Materials has earned a number of financial awards to fund the \ndevelopment of critical projects through the Small Business Innovation \nResearch, or SBIR, program at the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA. The SBIR program provides funding to small \nbusinesses with innovative, early stage ideas that align with the \nresearch and development goals of 11 different Federal agencies, \nincluding NASA, the Department of Defense, and the National Institutes \nof Health. One of the most recent systems that Fiber Materials \ncontributed to under NASA's purview is ORION Launch Abort System, which \nwill allow the crew to escape the spacecraft in the case of an \nemergency. The system was successfully tested in May 2010.\n  In recognition of Fiber Materials' dedicated efforts to NASA, the \nJohnson Space Center recently recognized the company with its 2010 \nSmall Business Subcontractor of the Year Award. According to NASA's \nOffice of Small Business Programs, the award acknowledges `` successful \nand innovative practices that promote small business participation in \nthe initiatives that NASA undertakes.'' Fiber Materials has been an \ninvaluable resource to the Federal government from the beginning, and I \ncommend the company for playing such an integral part in some of NASA's \nmost critical initiatives.\n  Small businesses that are versatile and multifaceted such as Fiber \nMaterials will be critical as the United States seeks to continue in \nits role as a world leader. Undoubtedly, participating in programs like \nSBIR will provide the company with countless additional opportunities \nto simultaneously contribute to NASA's mission and create jobs in \nMaine. I thank everyone at Fiber Materials for their strong work ethic, \ningenuity, and dedication, and I wish them continued success in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8711-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN GEORGE M. VUJNOVICH\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I wish to honor an outstanding \nSerbian-American, Captain (Ret.) George M. Vujnovich, who was recently \nawarded the Bronze Star Medal, for his heroic actions during World War \nII.\n  The Bronze Star is awarded to military service personnel for bravery, \nacts of merit or meritorious service. When awarded for bravery, it is \nthe fourth-highest combat award of the U.S. Armed Forces. Captain \nVujnovich's determination to rescue and save the trapped airmen and \nsubsequent participation in the planning and execution of Operation \nHalyard--resulted in one of the most successful air force rescue \nmissions in history; and an operation so secret that the records were \nonly declassified in 1997.\n  I was made aware of the Halyard Mission as a boy in 1946. I was in \nattendance at a social event in my parents' home to honor Captain Nick \nLalich as one of the leaders who was part of the military team that \nparachuted into Serbia to execute and carry out Captain Vujnovich's \nplan to rescue and evacuate the airmen.\n  Captain Vujnovich served with the Office of Strategic Services; the \npredecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, and the \nwartime organization charged with coordinating activities behind enemy \nlines for the branches of the U.S. military. Operation Halyard evolved \nin wake of the Allied bombing campaign to destroy Nazi Germany's vast \nnetwork of petroleum resources in occupied Eastern Europe. The most \nvital target of bombing was the facilities located in Ploesti, Romania, \nwhich supplied 35 percent of Germany's wartime petroleum. Beginning in \nApril 1944, bombers of the Fifteenth Allied Air Force began a \nrelentless campaign to blast the heavily guarded facilities in Ploesti \nin an attempt to halt petroleum production altogether. By August, \nPloesti was virtually destroyed--but at the cost of 350 bombers lost, \nwith their crews either killed, captured, or missing in action.\n  The assault on Ploesti forced hundreds of Allied airmen to bail out \nover Nazi-occupied eastern Serbia, an area patrolled by the Allied-\nfriendly Chetnik guerrilla army. When the Chetnik commander, General \nDraza Mihailovich, realized that Allied airmen were parachuting into \nhis territory, he ordered his troops, as well as the local peasantry, \nto aid the aviators by taking them to Chetnik headquarters in Pranjani, \nSerbia for evacuation.\n  General Mihailovich's attempts to alert American authorities to the \nsituation regrettably initially failed to produce action. Fortunately, \nfate would have it that when Mirjana Vujnovich, a Serb employee of the \nYugoslav embassy in Washington, DC, heard of the trapped airmen, and \nimmediately wrote to her husband, Captain Vujnovich, stationed in Bari, \nItaly. As an American, descending from Serb parents, Vujnovich knew the \nregion intimately and also knew how to escape from Nazi-occupied \nterritory: he had been a medical student in Belgrade when Yugoslavia \nfell to the Axis powers in 1941, and he and his wife spent months \nsneaking through minefields and begging for visas before they finally \nescaped from Nazi-occupied Europe.\n  I was excited that someone with a name like mine was such a hero and \nwas the genesis of my interest in Yugoslavia. In fact it left such an \nimpression on me that my first paper in undergrad school was titled \n``How the U.S. sold out Yugoslavia at Yalta and Tehran''.\n  Captain Vujnovich made it his personal crusade to get the airmen \nhome. From the outset though, Operation Halyard encountered opposition \nfrom Allied leaders--from the U.S. State Department, from communist \nsympathizers in the British Special Operations Executive, SOE, even \nfrom British Prime Minister Winston Churchill himself. It was an \noperation that seemed condemned from the start, but Captain Vujnovich \npersevered rather than let the mission die. His persistence paid off. \nEven thought the operation endured from August 9, 1944, through \nDecember 27, 1944, within only the first 2 days, Operation Halyard \nsuccessfully retrieved 241 American and Allied airmen. By the time the \nOperation was officially ended, Vujnovich's team had airlifted 512 \ndowned Allied airmen to safety without the loss of a single life or \naircraft--a truly impressive accomplishment.\n  Captain George Vujnovich's recognition as a hero and valued asset to \nthis country and the U.S. Air Force is long over due. Frankly, had the \nrecords of the operation not remained sealed until 1997, I feel certain \nCaptain Vujnovich would have received this honor years ago. \nNevertheless, the decades do not and cannot diminish the valor and \npatriotism of this extraordinary man. I ask all my colleagues to join \nme now to honor this Serbian-American hero, to thank him for his \ndedicated service to our country and to congratulate him for winning \nthe Bronze Star. Captain Vujnovich, I salute you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8711-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8711-3", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8711-4", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8711-S8712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nMrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agreed \nto the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3082) making \nappropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2010, and for other purposes, with an amendment.\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 10:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3789.

A bill to reduce the ability of terrorists, spies, \ncriminals, and other malicious actors to compromise, disrupt, damage, \nand destroy computer networks, critical infrastructure, and key \nresources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Internet has had a profound impact on \nthe daily lives of millions of Americans by enhancing communications, \ncommerce, education, and socialization between and among persons \nregardless of their location. However, computers and other devices that \nconnect to the Internet may be used, exploited, and compromised by \nterrorists, criminals, spies, and other malicious actors. As a result, \nthey pose a risk to computer networks, critical infrastructure, and key \nresources in the United States. Users of computers and other devices \nthat connect to the Internet are generally unaware that these devices \ncan be easily used, exploited and compromised by others with spam, \nviruses, and other malicious software and agents. Internet and \ncybersecurity safety has therefore become an urgent homeland security \nissue that needs to be addressed by internet service providers, \ntechnology companies, other entities that enable devices to connect to \nthe Internet, and by individuals.\n  I have been focusing on cybersecurity issues for quite some time. \nMore than a year ago, as chairman of the Terrorism and Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I chaired a \nSubcommittee hearing titled ``Cybersecurity: Preventing Terrorist \nAttacks and Protecting Privacy in Cyberspace.'' The hearing included \nwitnesses from key Federal agencies responsible for cybersecurity, as \nwell as representatives of the private sector. We reviewed governmental \nand private sector efforts to prevent a terrorist cyber attack that \ncould cripple large sectors of our government, economy, and essential \nservices. It was both illuminating and frightening.\n  The expertise that I have developed in regard to cybersecurity has \nconvinced me that the Government and the private sector need to work \ntogether to develop and enforce minimum Internet and cybersecurity \nsafety standards for users of computers and\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nother devices that connect to the Internet. In the same way that \nautomobiles cannot and should not be sold or operated on public \nhighways unless they meet certain minimum safety standards, minimum \nInternet and cybersecurity safety standards are essential for the \nnation's information superhighway.\n  As a result, today I am introducing the Internet and Cybersecurity \nSafety Standards Act, ICSSA. My bill will require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Commerce, to conduct an analysis to determine the costs \nand benefits of requiring internet service providers and others to \ndevelop and enforce minimum Internet and cybersecurity safety \nstandards. The Secretary will be required to consider all relevant \nfactors in this analysis, including the effect that the development and \nenforcement of minimum Internet and cybersecurity safety standards \nwould have on homeland security, the global economy, innovation, \nindividual liberty, and privacy. My bill will also require the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof Commerce to consult with relevant stakeholders in the Government \nand, most importantly, the private sector, including the academic \ncommunity and groups or institutions that have scientific and technical \nexpertise related to standards for computer networks, critical \ninfrastructure, or key resources. The private sector must be a partner \nin the efforts to secure the nation's information superhighway. Under \nmy bill, the Secretary of Homeland Security will be required to report \nto Congress within one year with specific recommendations for minimum \nvoluntary or mandatory Internet and cybersecurity standards for \ncomputers and other devices that connect to the Internet, so that we \ncan prevent them from being used, exploited, and compromised by \nterrorists, criminals, spies, and other malicious actors.\n  In December of 2009, I praised the appointment of Howard Schmidt as \nthe new White House Cybersecurity Coordinator to make sure that \nagencies are all working together on this critical challenge. In April \nof this year, I also stressed with Secretary Napolitano, at a Senate \nJudiciary Committee oversight hearing for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the need to continue to make cybersecurity a top priority. \nBut we can and must do more. My bill will help secure our nation's \ndigital future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet and Cybersecurity \n     Safety Standards Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Computers.--Except as otherwise specifically provided, \n     the term ``computers'' means computers and other devices that \n     connect to the Internet.\n       (2) Providers.--The term ``providers'' means Internet \n     service providers, communications service providers, \n     electronic messaging providers, electronic mail providers, \n     and other persons who provide a service or capability to \n     enable computers to connect to the Internet.\n       (3) Secretary.--Except as otherwise specifically provided, \n     the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the Internet has had a profound impact on the \n     daily lives of the people of the United States by enhancing \n     communications, commerce, education, and socialization \n     between and among persons regardless of their location, \n     computers may be used, exploited, and compromised by \n     terrorists, criminals, spies, and other malicious actors, \n     and, therefore, computers pose a risk to computer networks, \n     critical infrastructure, and key resources in the United \n     States. Indeed, users of computers are generally unaware that \n     their computers may be used, exploited, and compromised by \n     others with spam, viruses, and other malicious software and \n     agents.\n       (2) Since computer networks, critical infrastructure, and \n     key resources of the United States are at risk of being \n     compromised, disrupted, damaged, or destroyed by terrorists, \n     criminals, spies, and other malicious actors who use \n     computers, Internet and cybersecurity safety is an urgent \n     homeland security issue that needs to be addressed by \n     providers, technology companies, and persons who use \n     computers.\n       (3) The Government and the private sector need to work \n     together to develop and enforce minimum Internet and \n     cybersecurity safety standards for users of computers to \n     prevent terrorists, criminals, spies, and other malicious \n     actors from compromising, disrupting, damaging, or destroying \n     the computer networks, critical infrastructure, and key \n     resources of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Analysis.--The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Commerce, shall conduct an analysis to determine the costs \n     and benefits of requiring providers to develop and enforce \n     minimum Internet and cybersecurity safety standards for users \n     of computers to prevent terrorists, criminals, spies, and \n     other malicious actors from compromising, disrupting, \n     damaging, or destroying computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, and key resources.\n       (b) Factors.--In conducting the analysis required by \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider all relevant \n     factors, including the effect that the development and \n     enforcement of minimum Internet and cybersecurity safety \n     standards may have on homeland security, the global economy, \n     innovation, individual liberty, and privacy.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONSULTATION.\n\n       In conducting the analysis required by section 4, the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of Commerce, shall consult with relevant \n     stakeholders in the Government and the private sector, \n     including the academic community, groups, or other \n     institutions, that have scientific and technical expertise \n     related to standards for computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, or key resources.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a final report on the \n     results of the analysis required by section 4. Such report \n     shall include the consensus recommendations, if any, for \n     minimum voluntary or mandatory Internet and cybersecurity \n     safety standards that should be developed and enforced for \n     users of computers to prevent terrorists, criminals, spies, \n     and other malicious actors from compromising, disrupting, \n     damaging, or destroying computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, and key resources.\n       (b) Appropriate Committees of Congress.--In this section, \n     the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--\n       (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n     and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8714-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8714-S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 698--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n   TO THE TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF GEORGIA AND THE SITUATION WITHIN \n              GEORGIA'S INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BORDERS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 698\n\n       Whereas, since 1993, the territorial integrity of Georgia \n     has been reaffirmed by the international community and 36 \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act resulting from the \n     Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1975 \n     states that parties ``shall regard as inviolable all one \n     another's frontiers'' and that ``participating States will \n     likewise refrain from making each other's territory the \n     object of military occupation'';\n       Whereas the United States-Georgia Strategic Charter, signed \n     on January 9, 2009, underscores that ``support for each \n     other's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and \n     inviolability of borders constitutes the foundation of our \n     bilateral relations'';\n       Whereas, in October 2010, at the meeting of the United \n     States-Georgia Charter on Strategic Partnership, Secretary of \n     State Clinton stated, ``The United States will not waiver in \n     its support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity'';\n       Whereas the White House released a fact sheet on July 24, \n     2010, calling for ``Russia to end its occupation of the \n     Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia'' and for \n     ``a return of international observers to the two occupied \n     regions of Georgia'';\n       Whereas Vice President Joseph Biden stated in Tbilisi in \n     July 2009 that the United States ``will not recognize \n     Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states'' and went \n     on to ``urge the world not to recognize [Abkhazia and South \n     Ossetia] as independent states'';\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\n       Whereas the August 2008 conflict between the Governments of \n     Russia and Georgia resulted in civilian and military \n     causalities, the violation of the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of Georgia, and large numbers of internally-\n     displaced persons;\n       Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement, agreed to \n     by the Governments of Russia and Georgia, provides that all \n     Russian troops shall be withdrawn to pre-conflict positions;\n       Whereas the August 12, 2008, ceasefire agreement provides \n     that free access shall be granted to organizations providing \n     humanitarian assistance in regions affected by violence in \n     August 2008;\n       Whereas the International Crisis Group concluded in its \n     June 7, 2010, report on South Ossetia that ``Moscow has not \n     kept important ceasefire commitments, and some 20,000 ethnic \n     Georgians from the region remain forcibly displaced'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch concluded in its World Report \n     2010 that ``Russia continued to exercise effective control \n     over South Ossetia and . . . Abkhazia, preventing \n     international observers' access and vetoing international \n     missions working there'';\n       Whereas, in October 2010, Russian troops withdrew from the \n     small Georgian village of Perevi;\n       Whereas the withdrawal of Russian troops from Perevi is a \n     positive step, but it does not constitute compliance with the \n     terms of the August 2008 Russia-Georgia ceasefire agreement;\n       Whereas, on November 23, 2010, before the European \n     Parliament, Georgian President Saakashvili committed Georgia \n     to not use force to restore control over the Georgian \n     territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Clinton stated in Tbilisi on \n     July 5, 2010, ``We continue to call for Russia to abide by \n     the August 2008 cease-fire commitment . . . including ending \n     the occupation and withdrawing Russian troops from South \n     Ossetia and Abkhazia to their pre-conflict positions.'';\n       Whereas the Russian Federation vetoed the extension of the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) \n     Mission to Georgia and the United Nations Observer Mission in \n     Georgia, forcing the missions to withdraw from the regions of \n     South Ossetia and Abkhazia;\n       Whereas Russian troops stationed in the regions of Abkhazia \n     and South Ossetia continue to be present without a mandate \n     from the United Nations or other multilateral organizations;\n       Whereas the Senate supports United States efforts to \n     develop a productive relationship with the Russian Federation \n     in areas of mutual interest, including non-proliferation and \n     arms control, cooperation concerning the failure of the \n     Government of Iran to meet its international obligations with \n     regard to its nuclear programs, counter-terrorism, \n     Afghanistan, anti-piracy, economics and trade, and others; \n     and\n       Whereas the Senate agrees that these efforts must not \n     compromise longstanding United States policy, principles of \n     the Helsinki Final Act, and United States support for United \n     States allies and partners worldwide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that it is the policy of the United States to \n     support the sovereignty, independence, and territorial \n     integrity of Georgia and the inviolability of its borders and \n     to recognize the areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as \n     regions of Georgia occupied by the Russian Federation;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of Russia to take steps to \n     fulfill all the terms and conditions of the 2008 ceasefire \n     agreements, including returning military forces to pre-war \n     positions and ensuring access to international humanitarian \n     aid to all those affected by the conflict;\n       (3) urges the Government of Russia and the de facto \n     authorities in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to \n     allow for the full and dignified return of internally-\n     displaced persons and international observer missions to the \n     territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia;\n       (4) supports constructive engagement and confidence-\n     building measures between the Government of Georgia and the \n     de facto authorities in the regions of South Ossetia and \n     Abkhazia; and\n       (5) affirms that the path to lasting stability in this \n     region is through peaceful means and long-term diplomatic and \n     political dialogue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "09", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/09/senate-section/article/S8715-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 699--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION \nIN CITY OF ST.

In the event that the Secretary determines \n     there exists a safety need, the Secretary shall initiate \n     rulemaking under section 30111 of title 49, United States \n     Code, to extend the standard to conventional motor vehicles.\n\n     SEC. 4. FUNDING.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, $2,000,000 of \n     any amounts made available to the Secretary of Transportation \n     under under section 406 of title 23, United States Code, \n     shall be made available to the Administrator of the National \n     Highway Transportation Safety Administration for carrying out \n     section 3 of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4751.
