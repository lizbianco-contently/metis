Mr. President, Republicans are fully engaged in the \nhealth care debate. It is our view that there is no more important work \nwe can do here than to show Americans what the Democratic plan for \nhealth care would mean to them. Once we return to the debate, \nRepublicans will be ready with two important amendments.\n  One of those amendments, by Senator Crapo, would enable the President \nto keep one of the pledges he made as a candidate and as President \nabout what the Democratic plan for health care reform would look like. \nHe said that no family making less than $250,000 a year and no \nindividual making less than $200,000 a year would see a tax increase of \nany kind. The Crapo motion would ensure that promise is kept.\n  An amendment by Senators Hutchison and Thune would ensure that none \nof the taxes imposed by this bill would go into effect a day earlier \nthan the benefits. In other words, you don't get taxes before you get \nbenefits. This is a commonsense amendment. You certainly wouldn't ask \nsomeone to pay for the mortgage on a house 4 years before they were \nallowed to move in. In the same way, we should not tax people for a \nbenefit they don't get for 4 long years.\n  The Hutchison-Thune amendment also aims to keep government honest, \nbecause most Americans have a hard time believing Washington would \ncollect taxes on one thing for 4 years and actually have the discipline \nnot to use the money on something else. This amendment would guard \nagainst that.\n  For the moment, the majority has decided to take us off health care. \nIt has moved to an Omnibus appropriations bill that has all the \nhallmarks of all the other bloated spending bills we have seen this \nyear. It is really outrageous, actually. At a time of double-digit \nunemployment, at a time when Democrats are talking about increasing by \nnearly $2 trillion the amount of money the government is legally \nallowed to borrow, the majority has moved us off of one $2.5 trillion \nspending bill and on to a 1,000-page omnibus that would cost the \nAmerican taxpayer another $\\1/2\\ trillion right in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  Once again, the majority has shown a lack of restraint when it comes \nto spending. At a moment of record debt, at a moment when inflation is \nnearly flat, this bill represents a 12-percent annual increase in \ngovernment spending. Let me say that again. Inflation is flat. Yet we \nare increasing discretionary spending by 12 percent in this omnibus \nspending bill. The American people are not increasing their spending 12 \npercent. Moreover, it includes a number of controversial, unrelated \nprovisions, including, among other things, language to weaken \nrestrictions on abortion funding.\n  This $\\1/2\\ trillion spending bill spends $50 billion more than last \nyear. All this spending comes right on the heels of a new report from \nTreasury that says the government ran a deficit of nearly $300 billion \nin October and November--the worst deficit we have ever had at this \npoint in a fiscal year, ever. At a time when families across the \ncountry are struggling to make ends meet, lawmakers almost seem to be \nflouting their ability to spend taxpayer money. This bill contains many \nworthy projects. Unfortunately, the majority has piled on so much \nspending, so much debt and new controversial policies that I certainly \ncan't support it.\n  As you may know, the Senate is considering a bill that would make \nbasic changes in the country's health care system. We have been \ndebating it for weeks. What I keep hearing on the other side is no \nreference to what the American people think. I hear these arguments \nabout making history. Ignoring the public is not a great way to make \nhistory. We have not seen poll data for months that indicate the \nAmerican people support the Reid bill. The most devastating one came \nout last night. A CNN opinion research poll taken December 2 and 3, \nthis week--not exactly a bastion of conservatism--indicates that 61 \npercent of the American people oppose this health care bill and only 36 \npercent favor it.\n  We are looking for one courageous Member of the other side of the \naisle--just one--to stand up and say he or she will not ignore the \noverwhelming opinion of the American people, he or she will not be so \narrogant as to assume we have the right answer here and 61 percent of \nthe American people somehow don't know what they are talking about.\n  The American people are pretty smart. They have been watching this \ncarefully. This health care bill, like no other issue, affects every \nsingle American regardless of age. Everybody is interested in the \nsubject. They have watched the debate closely. They are telling us: \nPlease, Congress, please do not pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S12972-5", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I think the Republican leader just \nstated the case for why it is so important that we have the votes and \nthat we go back to the drawing board on this bill. Americans are \nlooking at the fine print of this bill. They are seeing $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin taxes.\n  Just this week, the President has had a jobs summit because we are \nall concerned about jobs. My goodness, since the President took the \noath of office, more than 3.5 million Americans have lost their jobs--\n300,000 Texans--our budget has tripled to $1.4 trillion, and the \nFederal debt as a portion of the U.S. economy has risen to its highest \nlevel since World War II. So we are very concerned about these taxes. \nIn fact, the small businesses of our country have said: No, do not do \nthis to us.\n  The NFIB, which is the National Federation of Independent Business, \nsent a letter just this week saying:\n\n       When evaluating healthcare reform options, small business \n     owners ask themselves two specific questions. First, will the \n     bill lower insurance costs? Second, will the bill increase \n     the overall cost of doing business?\n\n  Well, the answer to the first question is clearly no because the \nbusiness taxes start on January 1, 2010--3 weeks or so from now--and \ngoing forward, the mandates and taxes in 2014 to small business are \negregious. It could be $750 per employee or it could be $3,000 per \nemployee if you do not have exactly the right mix of health care \ncoverage for your employees. Well, at $3,000 per employee, small \nbusinesses are telling me: I am out of here. We are just going to let \npeople go to the government option because we cannot afford that.\n  So the answer to question No. 2 in the NFIB letter--which is, ``Will \nthe bill increase the overall cost of doing business?''--is, well, of \ncourse it will, at a time when we are seeing the numbers of people \nemployed go down.\n  We are in a financial crisis in this country. People are jobless. We \nare in a holiday season. People are very stressed, and here we have a \nhealth care bill being rushed through, without amendments being able to \ncome forward with a real chance for passing them. The cost of business \nis going to go up, which means more people are going to be laid off.\n  Now, I want to ask my friend, the Senator from South Dakota, a \nquestion because he and I are teaming up on an amendment. If we are \ngoing to have taxes increase in 3 weeks, you would say: Oh, OK, well \ntaxes are going to start in 3 weeks, so, then, where is the package I \nsigned up for that is going to lower my health care costs? So I would \nask the Senator from South Dakota, when do the programs that are \nsupposed to lower health care costs take effect?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to my friend from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \nthat as we have examined this legislation and have looked at its cost \nand its benefits and how that is distributed over time, it has become \nclear that what the other side has tried to do--the Democrats have \ntried to do--with this bill is understate its true cost by front-\nloading the tax increases and back-loading the spending. In other \nwords, the tax increases kick in right away, when much of the benefit \nof the bill does not kick in for several years.\n  So I want to point something out, just to illustrate what the Senator \nfrom Texas has said; that is, the tax increases in the bill begin on \nJanuary 1 of this year. So 21 days from now, Americans, individuals, \nfamilies, and small businesses are going to see their taxes go up. \nUnfortunately, they are not going to see any benefit come until 1,482 \ndays later.\n  What that, in effect, does is it understates the total cost of this \nlegislation. They have said: We want to get this under $1 trillion. The \nPresident said: I need a bill under $1 trillion. So they have tried to \ncome up with a bill that is about $1 trillion. But what they do not \ntell you is that by delaying the benefits and front-loading the tax \nincreases, you are actually going to have a 4- or 5-year period where \npeople are having to experience tax increases. That is going to impact \nthe small businesses because you have a Medicare payroll tax increase, \nwhich, by the way, for the first time, will not be used for Medicare \nbut will be used to create a whole new entitlement health care program.\n  You have an employer mandate which is going to hit small businesses. \nYou have the tax on medical device manufacturers, on prescription \ndrugs, on health plans. You have all these taxes that kick in right \naway.\n  So what happens? These taxes get passed on to the consumers in this \ncountry in the form of higher premiums, so people are going to see \ntheir premiums go up. Small businesses are going to see their taxes go \nup immediately--well, 21 days from now. But Americans are not going to \nsee any benefit from this for 1,482 days. So what we have is a gimmick \nthat has been used to disguise the total cost of this bill, which we \nall know when fully implemented is not $1 trillion but $2.5 trillion.\n  So the Senator from Texas and I have a motion, which I believe is \nsupported by the Senator from Wyoming, who is in the Chamber, that \nwould delay the tax increases until such time as the benefits begin so \nwe synchronize or align the tax increases and the fees to begin at the \nsame time the benefits do so we will reflect the true cost of this \nlegislation to the American people and not unfairly begin punishing \nsmall businesses by raising their taxes before a single dollar of \nbenefit is going to be distributed to the American people.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So I would ask the Senator from South Dakota--because \nit is our amendment, the Hutchison-Thune amendment--and surely the \nAmerican people, who would look at the debate, would say: We are \nmissing something. This cannot be right. We can't have taxes that are \nincreasing our premiums, increasing our prescription drug costs, \nincreasing our medical devices we must have for our health care for 4 \nyears. Did he say that right? Did he say we would be paying those \nhigher costs for 4 years before there is any option available to allow \nmore people to have health care coverage?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to my friend from Texas, it is kind of the \nsame old Washington game, the same old Washington gimmick, the same old \nbackroom deal that has been cut basically that, of course, we have had \nno input into. Incidentally, there is another now, the latest \npermutation of this discussion, going on right now behind closed doors, \nwhich is the Medicare expansion, which is a subject for a whole other \nday.\n  But I think the American people are looking at this and saying: How \ndoes this impact me? More than anything else, they are watching this \nbig debate in Washington, DC, and saying: How does this impact me? I \nthink what they are concluding is that 90 percent of the American \npublic, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would see their \npremiums stay the same at best or at worst go up, and when I say ``stay \nthe same,'' that means double the rate of inflation annual increases in \ntheir health insurance premiums.\n  So the best you can hope for, if you are an American today, is the \nstatus quo when it comes to your health insurance premiums.\n  If you buy in the individual marketplace, your premiums are going to \ngo up 10 to 13 percent above the annual, double the rate of inflation \nincreases that we are currently seeing.\n  So that is what happens to the American public, the average person \nout there, in terms of their health insurance premiums. If you are a \nsmall business, you are looking at tax increases. You are looking at a \nwhole new raft of tax increases that you are going to end up having to \npay, which is why all of the small business organizations--the Senator \nfrom Texas pointed out the letter from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, which says this is going to drive the cost of \ndoing business up. This is going to increase the cost of health care, \nnot lower it. What they want to see in reform--small businesses that \nare the economic engine that creates jobs in this economy--is they want \nto see health care reforms put in place that drive health care costs \ndown.\n\n  We know from every estimate that has been done, such as from the \nCongressional Budget Office--we have some data now from the CMS actuary \nthat just came out yesterday that says overall health care expenditures \nare\n\n[[Page S12974]]\n\ngoing to go up, health insurance premiums are going to go up. So small \nbusinesses are looking at higher taxes.\n  If you are a senior citizen in America, and one of the 11 million \npeople who get Medicare Advantage, your benefits are going to be cut. \nSo you have higher premiums, increased taxes on small businesses, \nMedicare benefit cuts to senior citizens across this country, and cuts \nto providers, and if you are a young American, you are faced with a \n$2.5 trillion new entitlement program that you are going to have to pay \nfor.\n  That is what the American people, as they are observing this debate, \ncan expect to come out of this, if the bill that has been proposed by \nthe majority is enacted. That is why we are working so hard to defeat \nthat and put in place some commonsense reforms that actually make sense \nto the American people.\n  I know the Senator from Wyoming, who is a physician, knows full well \nthe impact of many of these policies from being on the front line. He \nis someone who has had to deliver health care services in a rural \nState. So I would ask him to give us his thoughts about what these tax \nincreases and Medicare cuts are going to mean to health care delivery \nin places such as Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank my colleague from South Dakota because South \nDakota and Wyoming are very similar in many ways. Both have rural areas \nall spread across the State, with people needing health care.\n  And I have seen it. I have seen the concerns from people, but also \nfrom small businesses. My colleagues mentioned the National Federation \nof Independent Business. A lot of businesses in Wyoming are members of \nthat organization, and rightfully so, because small business is the \nengine that drives the economy. They are the job creators in this \ncountry.\n  I see these taxes--4 years of taxes--before the first health care \nservices are given as going to hurt our small businesses in Wyoming. It \nis going to hurt small businesses all around the country.\n  In one of the morning papers, it talks about the plans that are being \npresented by the Democrats, with all the increases in health costs--the \nfines, the taxes, that this will cost 1.6 million jobs before the first \nhealth care services are given in 2013--1.6 million jobs across the \ncountry. That affects all of our States.\n  At a time when unemployment is at 10 percent, at a time when \nInvestor's Business Daily, this morning, says: ``Job Cuts Hit Hardest \non Low-Skill Men; Outlook Is Gloomy,'' at a time when we are looking at \nan outlook which they call in the headlines of the front page of their \npaper ``gloomy,'' why would we say: Lets increase taxes on Americans, \nand then cut Medicare from our seniors who depend upon Medicare, and \nlets not improve services for 4 more years?\n  It is no surprise then that the Republican leader would come to the \nfloor and say we have now reached an all-time high of American people \nopposed, completely opposed, to this piece of legislation. The \nRepublican leader read a poll that said 61 percent of Americans now \noppose this bill. Well, it is because they are learning more about it. \nThe more people of America see what is in this bill, the more they \nrealize they cannot believe any of the promises that were made by the \nDemocrats, by the administration, the promises that were made, and the \npolling shows it.\n  Two specific questions that were asked in the poll were two specific \npromises that the President made. One is, he said he will not sign a \nbill if it adds one dime to the deficit. OK. We do not want to add to \nthe deficit, although the Democrats want us to vote this weekend on \nraising the debt level by well over $1 trillion. And why? Because they \ncannot control the spending. But the question was, do you think the \nFederal budget deficit would or would not increase if this bill is \npassed--when the President said it will not raise it by a dime?\n  Mr. President, 79 percent of Americans said this is going to increase \nthe deficit. Only 19 percent believe what the President is telling the \nAmerican people.\n  Then the question of taxes. The President said: My plan will not \nraise your taxes one penny. What do the American people think when the \nPresident speaks? Question: Do you think your taxes would or would not \nincrease? This is the CNN poll the Republican leader just talked about, \ndone earlier this month: Do you think your taxes would or would not \nincrease? The number of people who believe their taxes will increase if \nthis passes, 85 percent. Eighty-five percent of the American people \nbelieve they are not getting it straight from the President of the \nUnited States. Only 14 percent believe him when he says he will not \nraise taxes a penny.\n  So we have the Democrats bringing forth a bill--to me, as a \npracticing physician in Wyoming, taking care of families in Wyoming, \ntalking to doctors, talking to patients, having townhall meetings in \nthe State, having telephone townhall meetings, the Democrats bring \nforth a bill that the people of Wyoming and the people of America \nrealize is going to cost them more, is going to add to the deficit, and \nhurt the health care they receive.\n  Eighty-five percent of Americans are happy with the health care they \nreceive. They do not like the cost. They do not like the price. But \nthis bill we are looking at is going to raise premiums for people who \nhave insurance. The President promised that for families all across \nAmerica, their premiums would drop by $2,500 per family. But if you go \nout there trying to buy insurance, if this bill passes, you are going \nto end up paying $2,100 more than you would otherwise if nothing \npasses. That is why the majority of Americans say we would be better \noff if nothing passed. That is what the American people say. The \nDemocrats seem to be ignoring the voice of the American people. At a \ntime of 10 percent unemployment, at a time when the National Federation \nof Independent Business points out that we will lose over a million \nmore jobs if this passes, we should be looking at ways to help small \nbusinesses hire more workers, hire more people.\n\n  The small businesses continue to be the engines that drive up the \neconomy. Senator Collins from Maine was on the floor and gave an \nexplanation of some of the taxes on all of the small businesses in \nMaine. If you have 10 employees and you go to an 11th employee, if this \nbill passes, that small business gets penalized for growing their \nbusiness.\n  We want to have an opportunity to hire people.\n  She also explained that if we actually try to work ways through small \nbusinesses to give raises to people, those businesses get penalized \nfrom a tax standpoint.\n  As I look at this health care bill, we need health care reform that \nis going to bring down the cost of care. This bill is going to raise \nthe cost of care for all Americans. It is going to hurt our seniors by \ntaking almost $500 billion out of Medicare, a program on which the \nseniors depend. It is going to raise $500 billion in taxes which is \ngoing to hurt the engine that drives the economy. It is going to hurt \nsmall business. It is going to cause people to lose their jobs. I think \nit is foolish for people to continue to support this bill. It makes no \nsense.\n  I listened to my colleague from South Dakota who showed the chart \nthat says 21 days until the tax increases begin but almost 4 years \nuntil the benefits begin. What do the people in South Dakota have to \nsay about this?\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me, if I might, enter into a discussion with the \nSenator from Wyoming because, as he said, his State and my State are \nnot unlike in terms of the composition of population. We have big \ngeographies in Wyoming and in South Dakota and in the West and a lot of \nrural health care delivery. The primary job creator in places such as \nWyoming and South Dakota is small business. Small businesses are the \neconomic engine that creates jobs.\n  As the Senator from Wyoming mentioned, according to many of the \nanalyses that have been done of this legislation, it would be a job \nkiller. It has been suggested by the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness that 1.6 million jobs would be lost.\n  What is ironic about that is I have heard our colleagues on the other \nside repeatedly say this is going to be great for jobs. This is going \nto be good for the economy. If that is true, then why are all of these \nbusiness organizations coming out and saying it would increase the cost \nof doing business and it would increase health care costs? We\n\n[[Page S12975]]\n\nhave that now validated by the Congressional Budget Office, by the CMS \nChief Actuary at Health and Human Services saying overall health care \ncosts under this legislation are going to go up, not down, both as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product as well as for individuals who \nare going to see it in the form of higher health insurance premiums.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, because he and I represent similar \nconstituencies and the economies are similar, although he has--we wish \nwe had more oil and gas in South Dakota along the lines of what they \nhave in Wyoming--but the small business sector is what creates jobs.\n  He mentioned the National Federation of Independent Business. I wish \nto mention one other letter we received from an organization called the \nSmall Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care. In it they state \nthat these reforms fall short of long-term, meaningful relief for small \nbusiness. Any potential savings from these reforms are more than \noutweighed by the new taxes, new mandates, and expensive new government \nprograms included in the bill. This is signed by 50 small business \norganizations, one of which, by the way, is the American Farm Bureau \nAssociation, which is a big presence in my State, represents a lot of \nfarmers and ranchers, small business people, and I am sure represents a \nlot of members in the State of Wyoming as well as in the State of \nTexas.\n  I think what they are saying is, what all of these business groups \nare saying, and that is we don't find anything in this--there may be \nsome good things in it, but we find the overall core elements of this \nbill to be a detriment to job creation, will kill jobs, and will drive \nup the cost of doing business in this country.\n  It is hard for me to believe that some of the statements made by the \nother side--and I assume they are making them with the greatest \nsincerity, but they are factually wrong. If they weren't, we wouldn't \nhave every business organization in this country coming out and saying \nwe are opposed to this because it is going to increase the cost of \ndoing business, it is going to kill jobs, and it is going to increase \nthe cost of health care.\n  So to our colleague from Texas I would say I suspect she has a lot of \nsmall businesses in her State, not unlike Wyoming and South Dakota, \nthat share that view.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am glad you mentioned the Farm \nBureau because my constituents in the Farm Bureau, 400,000 members of \nthe Texas Farm Bureau, have contacted me repeatedly about how bad this \nwill be for the farmers, the small businesses they own, and the few \npeople they employ. Maybe they have five employees. This will be a \nkiller for them.\n  To reinforce the letter that the Senator from South Dakota read from \nthe Small Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care, they say in \nthe letter:\n\n       If this bill is enacted, the small business community will \n     be forced to divert resources away from hiring and expansion, \n     the very investments our country so desperately needs as it \n     continues to struggle in a faltering economy with double-\n     digit unemployment.\n\n  Then they go on to talk about what those costs are going to be: a \nsmall business health insurance tax; an employer mandate that \nencourages job cuts, not job creation; and the temporary small business \ntax credit falls short.\n  I am glad they mentioned this temporary small business tax credit \nbecause I have heard them say on the other side of the aisle: But there \nis a tax credit for small business that will alleviate the pain.\n  Well, that credit is for employers with fewer than 25 employees with \naverage annual wages of less than $40,000. Very few small businesses \nare going to be able to qualify for this tax credit. That is a very \nstrict standard. The average annual wages of less than $40,000 are \ngoing to be very difficult. However, if they qualify, the credit is \ntemporary. The credit is temporary. It is not a permanent credit that \nhelps people who would be able to qualify for this credit. So, in \neffect, this is not a tax credit at all, and certainly when it goes \naway it will help no one.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Small Business Coalition for Affordable Healthcare.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                December 10, 2009.\n       Dear Representative: Representing the country's largest, \n     oldest and most respected small business associations who \n     have spent more than a decade working to increase access and \n     affordability of private health insurance, the Small Business \n     Coalition for Affordable Healthcare is writing to express our \n     opposition to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (H.R. 3590).\n       Small business has been a constructive participant in the \n     current healthcare debate. Our small business and self-\n     employed entrepreneurs have been clear about what they need \n     and want: lower costs, more choices and greater competition \n     for private insurance. These reforms are critical, but to be \n     workable and sustainable, they must be balanced against the \n     overall cost of doing business. Unfortunately, with its new \n     taxes, mandates, growth in government programs and overall \n     price tag, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     costs too much and delivers too little.\n       While a few of the provisions in the bill reflect some of \n     the insurance market reforms that the small business and \n     self-employed communities have long sought, those reforms \n     fall short of long-term meaningful relief for small business. \n     Any potential savings from those reforms are more than \n     outweighed by the new taxes, new mandates and expensive new \n     government programs included in the bill. Those new costs of \n     doing business are also disproportionately targeted at small \n     business. If this bill is enacted, the small business \n     community will be forced to divert resources away from hiring \n     and expansion--the very investments our country so \n     desperately needs as it continues to struggle in a faltering \n     economy with double-digit unemployment. Those new costs \n     include:\n     A small business health insurance tax\n       Though small business has repeatedly called for reducing \n     the cost of health insurance, the Senate bill includes a \n     devastating new $6.7 billion annual tax ($60.7 billion over \n     ten years) that will fall almost exclusively on small \n     business and the self-employed because they purchase in the \n     fully-insured market. While the fee is levied on the \n     insurance company, a recent CBO report confirms the small \n     business insurance tax ``would be largely passed through to \n     consumers in the form of higher premiums for private \n     coverage.'' This will send costs upward--the opposite of what \n     the nation's small employers need.\n     An employer mandate that encourages job cuts, not job \n         creation\n       The only certainty of an employer mandate is that it \n     punishes both the employer and employee. The employer bears \n     the first blow in trying to afford the new unfunded mandate \n     and the second blow is borne by the employee in the form of \n     lower wages and job loss. The mandate in H.R. 3590 devastates \n     the small business community in two ways. First, since the \n     bill does little to make insurance more affordable and the \n     tax credit is so limited, few will be able to obtain \n     affordable insurance. Second, the penalties assessed on \n     firms--both offering and non-offering--will most certainly \n     result in a reduction of full-time workers to part-time \n     workers and discourage the hiring of those entrants into the \n     workforce who might qualify for a government subsidy. \n     Overall, the mandate included in this legislation is \n     especially troubling because it fails to recognize how the \n     cost of health benefits directly impacts wages of the \n     employee. Instead, H.R. 3590 blames the employer for a cost \n     (health insurance) that is beyond their control.\n     The temporary small business tax credit falls short\n       A short-term tax credit only puts off the inevitable--\n     increased cost in future years. The effectiveness of the tax \n     credit in H.R. 3590 is limited: the full value of the credit \n     is only available to those with wages of less than $20,000 \n     and phases out at $40,000. While the credit is designed to \n     offset the cost of insurance, its ``savings'' potential is \n     merely temporary since it only applies if you buy insurance \n     in the exchange and it expires after just two years.\n     Health insurance exchange plans lack affordable choices\n       Small business has long sought a simpler and more efficient \n     way to shop for insurance. H.R. 3590 creates a framework for \n     exchanges that can help ease administrative and overhead \n     costs. However, those savings are quickly erased if the \n     exchange plans are more expensive than what small employers \n     can afford. A recent CBO analysis of premiums under H.R. 3590 \n     paints a disheartening picture: small group premiums, at \n     best, would decrease by about 2 percent and could increase 1 \n     percent. The impact on non-group premiums is even more \n     devastating, as they are expected to increase an average of \n     10-13 percent per person. Those estimates, in addition to the \n     financing provisions included in the bill, slam the `savings' \n     door shut. Steps must be taken to ensure that a greater \n     variety of more affordable plans are available to small \n     employers and their employees.\n     Limited value of Simple cafeteria plans\n       The inclusion of Simple cafeteria plans in H.R. 3590 has \n     the potential to bring about a new option for small employers \n     seeking to offer coverage in an employer-sponsored setting. \n     The bill, however, currently lacks language to permit owners \n     of many ``pass-\n\n[[Page S12976]]\n\n     through'' business entities to participate in cafeteria \n     plans. Unless owners can participate in the plan, they will \n     be less likely to provide insurance to their workforce.\n     Insurance rating reforms that result in ``rate shock''\n       Employers in the small group and non-group market have long \n     lived with the fear that a single illness could either price \n     them out of affordable insurance or that they could be \n     rejected for coverage altogether. While H.R. 3590 attempts to \n     ensure that insurance will be more widely available to all, \n     the restrictive rating (3:1 on age) and lack of a phase-in \n     for existing plans threatens to undermine the viability of \n     both plans that people own today or plans that they will buy \n     in the future through the exchange. Only balanced rating \n     reforms that are phased-in over an appropriate timeframe have \n     the potential to transform these poorly functioning insurance \n     markets.\n     New paperwork burdens and costs for small businesses\n       The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposes a \n     new tax-compliance paperwork burden on small businesses. The \n     ``corporate reporting'' provision is an expansion of \n     reporting requirements (for transactions of more than $600), \n     which adds another $17 billion to the cost of doing business \n     for small business.\n     A waiting period that lacks flexibility\n       Small employers, including those who employ full-time, \n     part-time, temporary and seasonal workers, face much higher \n     turnover rates than their large business counterparts. They \n     face significant challenges related to providing healthcare \n     benefits to their workforces. The Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act presents two specific problems. First, it \n     defines a full-time employee as working an average workweek \n     of 30 hours. Second, it outlines a 90-day waiting period, but \n     then implements fines (at the 30-60-day and the 60-90-day \n     timeframe) of $400 and $600 per affected worker respectively. \n     In industries with above average turnover (e.g. the \n     restaurant industry has roughly a 75 percent turnover rate \n     annually) these provisions would lead to fewer full-time \n     workers and less hiring overall.\n     Employers and employees lose flexibility and choice\n       Small employers need more affordable health insurance \n     options. However, the prohibition of HSA, FSA and HRA funds \n     to purchase over-the-counter medications, along with the \n     $2,500 limit on FSA contributions, diminishes flexibility and \n     threatens to further limit the ever-shrinking options \n     employers have to provide meaningful healthcare to their \n     employees.\n     An unprecedented increase in the Medicare payroll tax\n       Since its creation the payroll taxes dedicated to Medicare \n     programs have been dedicated specifically to funding \n     Medicare. However, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act changes the purpose of the tax while setting the \n     precedent to use payroll taxes to pay for other non-Medicare \n     programs. Furthermore, it will raise taxes for some small \n     businesses.\n     No meaningful liability reform\n       Our medical liability litigation system creates a \n     disincentive for affordability and efficiency while creating \n     a climate where the practice of defensive medicine increases \n     healthcare spending, and overall costs. Those increased costs \n     extract a particularly heavy toll on the ability of small \n     business to access affordable healthcare for their employees \n     and dependents. Meaningful liability reform will inject more \n     fairness into the medical malpractice legal system, and \n     reduce unnecessary litigation and legal costs.\n     A public option that threatens choice and competition\n       A government-run plan cannot compete fairly with the \n     private market and threatens to destroy the marketplace, \n     further limiting choices. We believe that, with proper \n     reforms, the private market can be held accountable and \n     provide greater competition and lower-cost solutions where \n     insurers compete based on their ability to manage, rather \n     than shed risk.\n       While our nation's entrepreneurs in the small business and \n     self-employed communities strongly believe that the status \n     quo is unsustainable, the measure of success is not simply to \n     produce reform legislation. As some in the media have \n     recently emphasized, the choice is not between the status quo \n     and the bills we have seen emerge from this process. The \n     choice is between flawed legislation and workable \n     alternatives. In short, the legislation must improve the \n     status quo. H.R. 3590 fails to provide those much-needed \n     improvements, and instead makes things worse than they are \n     today. We greatly hope that the Senate will refocus its \n     energy and work with small business to develop the \n     commonsense solutions that make our core needs a top \n     priority.\n           Sincerely,\n         Aeronautical Repair Station Association; American Bakers \n           Association; American Farm Bureau Federation  ; \n           American Hotel & Lodging Association; American \n           International Automobile Dealers Association; American \n           Rental Association; AMT--The Association For \n           Manufacturing Technology; Associated Builders and \n           Contractors, Inc.; Associated Equipment Distributors; \n           Associated General Contractors of America.\n         Association For Manufacturing Technology; Association of \n           Ship Brokers & Agents; Automotive Aftermarket Industry \n           Association; Automotive Recyclers Association; \n           Commercial Photographers International; Electronic \n           Security Association; Independent Electrical \n           Contractors; Independent Office Products & Furniture \n           Dealers Alliance; International Foodservice \n           Distributors Association; International Franchise \n           Association.\n         International Housewares Association; International Sleep \n           Products Association; National Association of \n           Convenience Stores (NACS); National Association of Home \n           Builders; National Association of Manufacturers; \n           National Association of Mortgage Brokers; National \n           Association of Wholesaler-Distributors; National \n           Automobile Dealers Association; National Club \n           Association; National Federation of Independent \n           Business.\n         National Lumber Building Material Dealers Association \n           (NLBMDA); National Retail Federation; National Retail \n           Lumber Association; National Roofing Contractors \n           Association; National Tooling and Machining \n           Association; National Utility Contractors Association; \n           Northeastern Retail Lumber Association; Precision \n           Machined Products Association; Precision Metalforming \n           Association; Printing Industries of America.\n         Professional Photographers of America; Self-Insurance \n           Institute of America (SIIA); Service Station Dealers of \n           America and Allied Trades; Small Business & \n           Entrepreneurship Council; Society of American Florists; \n           Society of Sport and Event Photographers; Stock Artist \n           Alliance; The PGA of America; Tire Industry \n           Association; U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am from a State that has big cities, \nbut the vast majority of my State is rural, as is Wyoming and as is \nSouth Dakota. I see my employers, my small business owners, which are \nthe largest bulk of the employers in my State, every day. I talk to \nthem or I see them. Unfortunately, we are in Washington every day right \nnow, 7 days a week, but when I am home I see them and when I am here \nand talking to them on the phone, or they are visiting me, I talk to \nthem and they are aghast. They are aghast that Congress would actually \nbe putting more strain on small business at a time when we know the \njobless rate is the highest since World War II and people are trying to \ndo their part to increase our economy and they can't do it with more \ntaxes, more mandates, more burdens. So it is time we look at the tax \nburden and do something about it.\n  The Senator from South Dakota and I are trying to do something about \nit. We are saying, at the very least we should not allow this bill to \ngo forward when the taxes start next month--January 2010--because none \nof the programming gets up and running until 2014. So we are going to \nhave the mandates and the business taxes and we are going to have the \nprogram that is supposed to alleviate the health care crisis in our \ncountry in 2014. Shouldn't we start all of the taxes in 2014 rather \nthan asking people to pay for 4 years the taxes that will increase \ninsurance premiums, increase prescription drug costs, and increase \nmedical equipment costs--$100 billion in new taxes on those items--\nshouldn't we at least put it off until the supposed program comes into \nplace. Because in 4 years, with any luck in America, we won't have \nthese programs start.\n  There is hope for America that we can stop this program by 2014 as \npeople learn what is in it and protest enough that the Members of \nCongress who are elected in 2010, elected in 2012, will say: No, we now \nknow that this would be a disaster for our country. There is hope.\n  I would ask the Senator from Wyoming, when people start learning \nabout the Medicare cuts about which you have spoken so eloquently, and \nthe taxes on the small businesses in your State and all of our States, \ndo you think that perhaps not putting these taxes in place is a good \npolicy, because maybe we can still stop this when people find out what \nis in it, when it is supposed to take effect 4 years from now?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would respond to my colleague from \nTexas that I think she is absolutely right. The more people learn about \nthis bill and the details of the bill, the more the American people \noppose this bill.\n  My colleague from Texas made a wonderful point yesterday and again \ntoday when she said if they start this\n\n[[Page S12977]]\n\ntax collecting right now, do we even know the money is going to be \nthere 4 years from now to start supplying the services. There was a \nstory in today's USA TODAY talking about unemployment in this country, \nand the story says:\n\n       Public Gain, Private Pain. For Federal workers there is a \n     hiring boom. The Federal Government is adding jobs this year \n     at a rate of nearly 10,000 per month.\n\n  We have read about all of the different bureaucracies that will be \nbrought into play if this passes: over 70 new bureaucracies, 150,000 \nmore Federal employees, more Washington bureaucrats to make rules and \nregulations that affect the people of America. It talks about the 10-\npercent unemployment in the country. It says, it is the new Federal \njobs--not the small business jobs, the Federal jobs--that have helped \nbring down the unemployment rate from 10.2 to 10 percent. It is the \nFederal jobs.\n  I am looking at all of this money that Washington is going to \ncollect. I used to think it was a big gimmick so they could say, Well, \nwe have kept the number under $900 billion. I still believe it is a big \ngimmick, but I am concerned they are going to spend the money as well \nso the money won't be there, which is the point of the Senator from \nTexas, who has been very fiscally conservative, out there always making \nsure we are not spending the taxpayer money in any way that is not a \nwise use of the money.\n  Is that one of the concerns the Senator has? I know the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has similar concerns: Will the money be there if they are \ngoing to hire more Washington bureaucrats, which is what USA TODAY \nsays?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is exactly what our concern is. I would also add this \nrecent study that came out yesterday by the CMS chief actuary sheds a \nlot of additional light on what is a very bad proposal, a big \ngovernment proposal that does create 70 new programs here in \nWashington, DC, but does nothing to affect in a positive way the health \ncare costs that most Americans are dealing with right now. The actuary \ngoes on to say that access to care problems is plausible and even \nprobable under the Reid bill.\n  So the issue we have talked about in States such as Wyoming and South \nDakota, where people travel long distances to get access to health \ncare, would be aggravated by this legislation because there would be a \nneed for more and more providers--hospitals, physicians--who currently \ndon't take Medicaid patients. You expand Medicare, which is the latest \nproposal the Democrats have put forward, and as a consequence of that \nyou get fewer and fewer hospitals, fewer and fewer physicians who are \naccepting Medicare patients, because Medicare and Medicaid are both \nunderreimbursed, therefore creating a cost shift where the cost is \nshifted over to private payers whose premiums continue to go up and up.\n  So that is why we see all of these studies coming out saying premiums \nare going to go up, taxes are going to go up, and Medicare benefits are \ngoing to be cut, particularly for seniors who have Medicare Advantage. \nAt the end of the day, this ends up being a $2.5 billion expansion of \nthe government here in Washington, DC.\n  But to the point the Senator from Texas made--and I think--I know we \nare running out of time. We want to vote. We want to vote on this \nmotion. We don't think you ought to start taxing people in 21 days and \nnot start delivering benefits for almost 1,500 days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. THUNE. That is what our motion would do: Synchronize the tax \nincreases with the benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that until the \nDemocrats take over, we may continue to talk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, to continue with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, I am glad he made the point because we are very much \nhoping our amendment will be in the order when we start voting on the \nhealth care amendments.\n  The amendment is so clear; it is very simple. I have it here. For \nWashington, it is half a page. That is something everyone will be able \nto appreciate--the motion to commit with instructions:\n\n       Senator Hutchison and Senator Thune move to commit the bill \n     to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report back \n     to the Senate with changes to align the effective dates of \n     all taxes, fees, and tax increases levied by such bill so \n     that no such tax, fee, or increase takes effect until such \n     time as the major insurance coverage provisions of the bill, \n     including the insurance exchanges, have begun.\n       The committee is further instructed to maintain the deficit \n     neutrality of the bill over the 10-year budget window.\n\n  That is what was promised. This was going to be deficit neutral. It \nis not deficit neutral. The cost of this bill is $2.5 trillion over the \n10-year period when it starts, in 2014 until 2023. It is $2.5 trillion. \nThe ``offset''--I put that in quotes because the offsets are $500 \nbillion in tax cuts to Medicare, which will lower the ability of \nhospitals to stay in business and treat Medicare patients and doctors \nto be able to treat Medicare patients.\n  So the quality of Medicare is going to go down. Medicare Advantage \nwill be severely restricted. So you have $500 billion in cuts to \nMedicare, and then you have $500 billion in tax increases and mandates. \nThat is a total of $1 trillion in offsets in a bill that costs $2.5 \ntrillion.\n  What the Senator from South Dakota and I are trying to do is let's \nkeep our word. Let's keep our word and do two things that the American \npeople should expect: No. 1, that we would not start the taxes until \nthe program takes effect; No. 2, that it would be deficit neutral.\n  By my math, I ask the Senator from South Dakota, it looks to me like \nwe are $1.5 trillion into the deficit, and we are already at a debt \nceiling that is higher than we have had as a percentage of our GDP \nsince World War II. So it is a $12 trillion debt ceiling we are hitting \nright now, and we are talking about a $1.5 trillion deficit in the bill \nwe are being asked to vote for.\n  I ask the Senator from South Dakota, who is my cosponsor on this very \nimportant amendment, don't we owe the American people the transparency, \nas well as the policy, that we would eliminate the deficit and we would \nstop these disastrous taxes from taking effect, so maybe we would have \na chance to change this product going forward in the next 4 years so \nthe American people will not be saddled with these expenses, taxes, and \nmandates?\n  Mr. THUNE. We do want to get a vote--a vote on our amendment and on \nother amendments. Right now, that is being prevented or blocked. We \nhaven't had a vote since Tuesday. We have amendments that are ready to \ngo.\n  The other side said they are open to amendments and they want to get \nthe bill moving forward, but we are being prevented from getting votes \non amendments. In the meantime, this backroom deal that is being cut, \nwhich we haven't seen--supposedly it has been sent to the CBO to find \nout what it will cost. We are waiting for that deal to emerge. In the \nmeantime, we are looking at a piece of legislation that costs $2.5 \ntrillion when fully implemented.\n  As the Senator said, it relies on Medicare cuts and tax increases to \nfinance it. Just yesterday, the chief actuary at the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services basically said the savings that are \nrelied upon, in terms of Medicare cuts, are unlikely to be sustainable \non a permanent basis. They raise the question about whether those cuts \nare actually going to occur and, if they do, whether they will be \nsustained. If they are not, then you have the question of whether a lot \nof these providers out there--if the cuts do occur, and they continue \nto lose more and more every time they see a Medicare patient, then they \nare going to quit participating in the Medicare Program. You will have \nfewer providers offering services, making it more difficult for \npeople--especially in places such as Wyoming and South Dakota--to get \naccess to health care.\n  You are assuming all these cuts in Medicare are going to occur, and \nyou are assuming all these tax increases. Even with all that, you have \na $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, which inevitably \nis going to rely more and more on borrowing. You are going to see more \nand more of this going on the debt, and we will pass it on to future \ngenerations.\n\n[[Page S12978]]\n\n  As CMS pointed out, it is unlikely these Medicare payment cuts are \ngoing to be sustainable without driving hospitals and doctors and other \nhealth care providers out of business. When they start reacting to this \nand those Medicare cuts are no longer sustainable, then you have built \nin all this new spending, and there is no way to pay for it without \nraising taxes dramatically, which would be, I guess, something the \nother side--since they have already demonstrated a significant \nwillingness to raise taxes in this bill or borrowing, neither of which \nis good for the future of the country or our economy.\n  Right now, our economy is trying to come out of a recession. Small \nbusinesses, which create the jobs in our economy, are faced with higher \ntaxes under this bill. They have come forward and said--every \nconceivable business is saying this will drive up the cost of doing \nbusiness, and it will raise the cost of health care in this country.\n  So you have all these small businesses saying we are not going to be \nable to create jobs. You have that specter out there. You also have the \nidea of the Medicare cuts, which are, according to the CMS actuary, \nunlikely to be sustainable, leading to borrowing and debt, which means \nwe are already running a $1 trillion deficit every year and piling more \non the Federal debt and there will be a movement here to raise the debt \nlimit by almost $2 trillion. So we will pass this on to future \ngenerations, future young Americans, who are going to bear the cost of \nthis massive expansion of the Federal Government.\n  There isn't anything in this that is good for the American public, \nwhich is why they are reacting the way they are, and why you are seeing \nthese 61 percent of Americans coming out in the polls against it.\n  I say to my friend from Wyoming, his thoughts with regard to this \nissue, these Medicare cuts being sustainable, how it is going to impact \nthe delivery of health care around this country, and what it will do to \nfuture generations in terms of the additional debt and borrowing.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. As my friend knows, small communities----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am sorry to interrupt my friend. I ask unanimous \nconsent that he have 1 minute to finish, after which the floor would go \nto the majority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. To follow up, the small communities of this Nation have \ngreat concerns about these cuts in Medicare because the small community \nhospitals that stay open know they have to live within their means. \nWhen Medicare cuts total over almost $\\1/2\\ trillion, it is the small \ncommunities that have just one hospital in a frontier medicine mode \ntaking care of people who may live 50, 100, or 150 miles away, those \nhospitals' very survivability is at stake.\n  That is why we cannot pass this bill, which will hurt seniors, raise \ntaxes on the American people, cost jobs, and cause people who have \ninsurance to have their premiums raised. For all these reasons, this \nbill is the wrong prescription for America.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amount of time by which the other side went over the allotted time \nbe added to our block of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S12978-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nsomething a colleague of mine spoke about last night, which I think he \nbelieves separates us when, in fact, it doesn't.\n  Before I do that, I wish to talk for a moment about the amendment of \nmine now pending on the floor of the Senate, dealing with the issue of \nprescription drug pricing.\n  I offered this amendment, along with my colleague, Senator Snowe, \nwith the support of a broad bipartisan group of Members of the Senate--\nRepublicans and Democrats--at a time when there has been so few \nbipartisan amendments. The amendment I have offered is, in fact, \nbipartisan and had bipartisan speeches in favor of it in the last \nseveral days. That is unusual, but I think it is also refreshing.\n  The amendment is very simple. It has been around for a long time. It \nhas been hard to get passed because the pharmaceutical industry is a \nvery strong, assertive industry. It is a good industry, but I have \nstrong disagreements with their pricing policies. This amendment simply \nsays the American people ought to have the freedom to access FDA-\napproved drugs wherever they are sold--as long as they are FDA \napproved--and offered at a fraction of the price they are sold at in \nthe United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show on the floor, once again, two bottles \nof pills.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This bottle contained Lipitor, perhaps the most popular \ncholesterol-lowering drug in the world. This was made by an American \ncompany in an Irish plant--made in Ireland and shipped around the \nworld. This bottle, as you can see, is identical to this one. One has a \nred label and one has a blue label.\n  The only difference in a circumstance, where you have the same pill, \nput in the same bottle, made by the same company, is the price. \nAmericans pay $4.78 per tablet and, in this case, folks in another \ncountry pay $2.05. Why the difference? Again, it is not just one \ncountry. This bottle is shipped to virtually every other country, \nincluding Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Canada, and it is sold \nat a much lower price.\n  The question is, Should the American people be required to pay the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs and not have the \nfreedom to access those drugs in the global marketplace?\n  Some say: Well, if you did that--if you allow the American people to \naccess that drug from Canada or Germany at a fraction of the price, we \nwould get counterfeit drugs.\n  It is interesting that in our amendment we actually have more safety \nprovisions than exist in our domestic drug supply. There does not now \nexist a tracing capability, pedigree, or batch lots. That would be a \npart of our amendment. That doesn't exist for America's drug supply \ntoday. We will actually improve the safety of the drug supply with this \namendment.\n  I didn't offer this amendment to cause trouble for people. I know \nthis is causing great angst in the Senate. We have been tied up several \ndays now on this issue. I know the pharmaceutical industry has a great \ndeal of clout. This issue revolves around $100 billion, $19 billion of \nwhich will be saved by the Federal Government in the next 10 years and \nnearly $80 billion saved by the American consumers because they can \naccess FDA prescription drugs at a fraction of the price.\n  So I understand why some are fighting hard to prevent this. But this \nis important public policy. The price of prescription drugs has gone up \n9 percent this year alone. Every single year, the price of prescription \ndrugs goes up. Every year since 2002, drug price increases have risen \nabove the rate of inflation. We can't, in my judgment, pass health care \nreform through the Congress and say: Yes, we did that, but we did \nnothing about the relentless increases in the price of prescription \ndrugs. We will solve that not by imposing price controls but by giving \nthe American people freedom. They are told it is a global economy. \nWell, it is a global economy for everything except the American people \ntrying to access prescription drugs at a fraction of the price in most \nother countries.\n  Again, I didn't offer this amendment to try to cause trouble; I \noffered this amendment to try to solve a problem. This Congress should \nnot, in my judgment, move ahead with health care reform and decide it \nought to leave the question of the American people paying the highest \nprices for prescription drugs--leave that alone and let that continue \nto be the case for the next 10 years or the next 20 years. I will speak \nmore about it later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S12978-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12978-S12980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE WITH CUBA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about a \nspeech a colleague, for whom I have great affection, gave yesterday on \nthe floor of the\n\n[[Page S12979]]\n\nSenate. He was concerned about a provision in the appropriations bill \nthat is now being considered, a provision dealing with the sale of \nagricultural commodities to Cuba.\n  My colleague said the provision would undo current law, where the \nCastro regime in Cuba would have to pay in advance for goods being sold \nto them because of their terrible credit history.\n  That is not an accurate statement. I expect there is just a \nmisunderstanding. I would be very happy if my colleague would wish to \nhave a colloquy on the floor to set out the law and the provision in \nthe bill so all of us understand the same thing.\n  No. 1, I helped write the law that finally opened just a small \ncrevasse--the ability of our farmers in America to sell their \nagricultural commodities into the Cuban marketplace. Why did I do that? \nBecause we have an embargo on Cuba that, in my opinion, has failed for \n40 or 50 years. At the time that embargo included restricting the sale \nof food to the Cuban people.\n  I do not think we ought to ever embargo food shipments anywhere in \nthe world. I think it is immoral. I do not think we ever ought to use \nfood as a weapon. Yet that is exactly what has been done.\n  Our farmers could not sell agricultural commodities into Cuba. \nCanadian farmers could. French farmers could. German farmers could. \nAmerican farmers could not.\n  I changed the law, along with a Republican colleague, with a Dorgan-\nAshcroft amendment. We changed the law. We opened it just a crack so \nAmerican farmers could sell their commodities into the Cuban \nmarketplace. But it had to be for cash. The Cubans had to pay cash in \nadvance. I support that. I helped write the law.\n  In fact, what I would like to do is put up a copy of the current law. \nThe current law indicates ``cash in advance.'' We have sold about $3 \nbillion of agricultural commodities into the Cuban marketplace since \nthe law was passed, and they have paid cash in advance.\n  What happened was, President Bush decided just prior to an election \nthat he wanted to send a signal that he was really tightening things \nwith Cuba. He decided to change the definition--not by law but by \nadministrative fiat--and he said ``cash in advance'' will mean the \nCubans have to pay for the commodity even before it is shipped from a \nport in the United States. For four years up to then, the government \nallowed U.S. farmers to ship the goods from the port and then have the \nCubans pay cash when the commodity arrives in Cuba. The President made \nthat change as an attempt to shut down the sale of agricultural \ncommodities to Cuba.\n  Here is what the Calgary Herald, a Canadian newspaper, said: ``Cuba \nto Buy $70 Million of Canadian Wheat.'' Then in the body of the article \nit says:\n\n       Cuban food purchases from Canada will increase 40 percent \n     this year due to difficulties buying from the United States \n     which is requiring payment before shipment of the food sales.\n\n  As I said, President Bush tightened the rules to say that ``cash in \nadvance,'' in a law I wrote, shall be interpreted as meaning you must \npay even before the shipment. I have never even considered the phrase \ncould be interpreted like that, but that is the way the law is now \nbeing administered.\n  In the pending appropriations bill, there is an amendment I included. \nIt is not, in my judgment, something we ought to debate. It is just \nthere. We ought to understand it. It very simply says this.\n\n       During fiscal year 2010, for purposes of . . . the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 . . . the \n     term ``payment of cash in advance'' shall be interpreted as \n     payment before the transfer of title to, and the control of, \n     the exported items to the Cuban purchaser.\n\n  It takes the definition of ``payment of cash in advance'' back it to \nhow it was originally interpreted after I got my bill passed and we \nstarted selling into the Cuban marketplace. It restores it to what it \nwas.\n  My colleague yesterday said this would undo the current law where the \nCastro regime would have to pay in advance. Obviously, that is not the \ncase. It is just not the case. ``Payment of cash in advance shall be \ninterpreted'' to mean ``payment before the transfer of title to, and \ncontrol of, the exported items . . . '' There is nothing here \nsuggesting credit be offered to the Cuban regime. This only resolves an \nissue that was created when President Bush wanted to shut off \nagricultural commodity shipments to the country of Cuba. As I \nindicated, the result of the Bush administration's interpretation is \nwhat the Calgary Herald wrote about: American farmers, watch the \nCanadians grab your market.\n  Why on Earth should we withhold food shipments anywhere? It makes no \nsense to me. Why should we say to our farmers who produce foods--and we \nneed to export that food--that the Canadians can have an advantage, the \nEuropeans can have an advantage, they can service that market but we \ncannot, even though we require cash in advance. Lets make it even \nharder by requiring payment before shipping even. That makes no sense \nto me. That is why I wanted to correct it. I wanted to correct it to \nget it back to what the law reads.\n  My colleague who spoke on this issue yesterday is a good Senator and \nsomebody I like a lot, but he indicates that this amendment of mine \nundoes current law where the Castro regime would have to pay in \nadvance. That is just not the case. That is not the case.\n  Maybe the best way for us to resolve this is, let's do a colloquy on \nthe floor to put in the Record the exact language, because the shipment \nof agricultural commodities to Cuba in the future will continue to \nrequire cash payments in advance. That is just a fact.\n  Let me say also, my colleagues--I use the term plural--who feel very \nstrongly about this issue, the Cuba issue, we have common cause. I have \nno truck for the Cuban Government. I want the Cuban people to be free. \nI have no sympathy for the Cuban Government. But it is interesting to \nme that our engagement with Communist China and Communist Vietnam, for \nexample, is to say that constructive engagement through trade and \ntravel is the best way to address those issues. We believe that. Except \nwe say in Cuba that we do not believe it. We restrict the right of the \nAmerican people to travel to Cuba, which is slapping around the rights \nof the American people in order to poke our finger in the eye of Fidel \nCastro, I guess. And we do other things that make no sense.\n  My colleagues who have raised these issues actually won on one issue \nthat kind of bothers me. I also put an amendment in this legislation \nthat I understand now has been emasculated. Let me describe what that \nwas.\n  Most people do not know this, but we have airplanes flying over Cuba, \nat least in international waters, broadcasting television signals to \nCuba. I was able to get that shut down in an amendment in the \nappropriations process because we are broadcasting television signals \nto Cuba to tell the Cuban people how great freedom is--they can hear \nthat on a Miami station 90 miles away--but we are broadcasting \ntelevision signals being broadcast by an airplane and the signals are \nsignals the Cuban people cannot see. Isn't that interesting? It is \ncalled TV Marti. Here is a picture of what TV Marti broadcasts. That is \nthe television screen for TV Marti. The Cubans block it easily, and the \nCuban people do not see it and cannot see it.\n  We started out broadcasting that with aerostat balloons. They called \nit Fat Albert. This is the second one. The first one got loose. Fat \nAlbert got loose. It was tethered on a big, long tether, hanging way up \nin the air, to broadcast television signals to the Cuban people that \nthe Cubans were blocking. So we are spending a lot of money \nbroadcasting television signals that nobody can see. In the first case, \nwe had aerostat balloons, huge balloons, tethered way up in the air, \nspending millions of dollars a year. One got loose and flew over the \nEverglades, and they had a devil of a time trying to capture Fat \nAlbert. So they got a second Fat Albert and kept broadcasting signals \nno one could see. But that wasn't good enough. In fact, they decided: \nYou know what, we are going to get ourselves a big fat airplane and we \nwill fly that airplane around and broadcast signals to Cuba from an \nairplane. And those signals, too, by the way, are routinely blocked and \nno one can see them. In my judgment we should not waste that kind of \nmoney.\n  John Nichols, professor of communications and international affairs \nat Penn State University had this to say.\n\n[[Page S12980]]\n\nHe is one of the experts on communications policy.\n\n       TV Marti's quest to overcome the laws of physics has been a \n     flop. Aero Marti, the airborne platform for TV Marti, has no \n     audience currently in Cuba, and it is a complete and total \n     waste of $6 million a year in taxpayer dollars.\n\n  The $6 million is just for the airplane. They spend much more than \nthat on TV Marti.\n\n       It is a total and complete waste of $6 million a year in \n     taxpayer dollars. The audience of TV Marti, particularly the \n     Aero Marti platform, is probably zero.\n\n  We have been doing this for 10 years and more. Since I raised this \nissue, we have spent $\\1/4\\ billion broadcasting television signals \ninto a country that cannot see them.\n  Let me continue:\n\n       TV Marti's response to this succession of failures over a \n     two-decade period has been to resort to ever more expensive \n     technological gimmicks, all richly funded by Congress, and \n     none of those gimmicks, such as the airplane, have worked or \n     probably can work without the compliance of the Cuban \n     Government. It is just the law of physics.\n       In short, TV Marti is a highly wasteful and ineffective \n     operation.\n\n  I put in an amendment that cut $15 million out of this program. I \nknow it is radical to say you should not broadcast to people who cannot \nsee them. I suspect this must be considered some sort of jobs program. \nThat would be the only excuse for continuing funding.\n  I had an amendment that shut down TV Marti. If ever--ever, ever--\nthere were an opportunity to cut government waste, this is it. This is \njust a program that accomplishes nothing and has no intrinsic value at \nall. But in the middle of a very significant economic downturn, when \ndeficits have spiked up, up, way up, I apparently cannot even get this \ndone. I got it done in the Senate, but it did not get through the \nconference. I guess for the next year or so--Fat Albert is retired--the \nairplane will still fly. And here is a television set in Cuba sees of \nTV Marti snow, static. We will continue to spend $15 million or so so \nthe Cubans can look at static on their television sets. It is not much \nof a bargain for the American taxpayer, I would say.\n  I only point this out because I lost on this issue. Those who feel \nstrongly that we ought to continue to do this won. I hope that one day, \nperhaps we could agree that when we spend money, let's spend it on \nthings that work, spend it on things that are effective, spend it on \nthings that advance our interest and our values. This certainly does \nnot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about health \ncare and our children and the health care reform, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, as relates to our children.\n  The chart on my left makes a couple of fundamental points.\n  For children, health care reform must follow one simple principle, \nand I also say it is only four words: No child worse off. When I say \n``no child,'' of course I am speaking of children who do not often have \na voice. Obviously, if they are children from a family that is very \nwealthy, I think they will be just fine no matter what happens here. \nBut children who are poor and children who experience and have to live \nwith special needs are the ones I am talking about when I say ``no \nchild worse off.''\n  I filed many weeks ago--actually, months ago now--a joint resolution, \nNo. 170. I was joined in that resolution by Senator Dodd, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Brown, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Sanders. We \nfiled that resolution just to make this point with a couple more words \nthan ``no child worse off,'' but that was the fundamental point to \nguide us through this process because sometimes in a debate on \nsomething that is this significant, and parts of it are complicated to \nbe enacted into law--it is a challenge to pass health care reform. I \nthink we will. I think we must. But we do need guiding principles, and \nI believe one of these should be ``no child worse off'' for special \nneeds children.\n  A lot of the child advocates across America have told us, for many \nyears, something so simple but something very meaningful in terms of \nproviding further guidance for this debate. Children are not small \nadults. That does not sound so profound, but it really matters when it \ncomes to health care. We can't just say: If you have a health care plan \nfor adults, it will work for kids, do not worry about it. \nUnfortunately, that is not the case.\n  If we do not do the right thing, we could lose our way on that basic \nprinciple. We have to get it right, and we have to give poor and \nspecial needs children a voice in this debate. I do not think there is \nany question that Senators on this side of the aisle are guided by that \nbasic principle.\n  I want to next turn to the bill, the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, and walk through some of the provisions. There are \nmany good provisions in the bill for children, but I want to walk \nthrough a couple.\n  How does it help children? That is a fundamental question. You cannot \nescape the basic implications of that. First, the bill eliminates \npreexisting condition exclusions. That is in the first couple pages of \nthe bill. Obviously, it has an enormously positive impact for adults. \nWe have heard story after story of literally millions of Americans \ndenied coverage year after year because of the problem of preexisting \nconditions. It has special meaning when it comes to children.\n  No. 2, the bill ensures that benefits packages include oral and \nvision care. We know what that means for children, and in particular we \nare thinking about the horrific, tragic, and preventable death recently \nof Deamonte Driver of Maryland, a young boy who lost his life because \nhis family did not have the coverage for an infected tooth--an infected \ntooth, not something that is complicated to deal with. His family \ncouldn't afford the care. A child in America died from an infected \ntooth that would have cost $80 to treat.\n\n  So when we talk about insuring benefit packages that include oral and \nvision care, that doesn't say it too well until you connect it to the \nlife and the death--the tragic death--of a young child not too far from \nWashington, DC.\n  Thirdly, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will mandate \nprevention and screenings for children. This is so important. We know \nour poorest children, who have the benefit of being covered by \nMedicaid, get these kinds of services so we can prevent a child from \ngetting sicker or prevent a disease or a condition or a problem from \nbecoming that much worse for that child.\n  As I said before, children are not small adults, so we have to make \nsure we have strategies and procedures in place that deal with the \nspecial needs and the special challenges that children face in our \nhealth care system.\n  Finally, the act has increasing access to immunizations. I don't \nthink I have to explain to any American how important immunizations \nare. The Centers for Disease Control will provide grants to improve \nimmunizations for children, adolescents, and adults.\n  Let me move to the third chart. The third chart outlines some other \nprovisions for children. Here are three more ways the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act helps children, among many others. \nIt creates pediatric medical homes. People may say: What is a medical \nhome? What does that mean? Well, I need simplicity just like anyone \ndoes. This is my best summary of a medical home.\n  A medical home obviously isn't a place. It is treating people in the \nway they ought to be treated in our health care system. The ideal--and \nI think this bill gets us very close to meeting this goal--is that \nevery American should have a primary care physician and then be \nsurrounded by the expertise of our health care system. Children \nespecially need that kind of help. So we want to make sure every child \nnot only has a primary care physician--in this case a pediatrician--but \nalso has access to all of the expertise that pediatricians and our \nsystem can give them access to.\n  Next, the act strengthens the pediatric workforce. We can't just say \nwe want children to have access to pediatric care. We have to make sure \nwe have the workforce in America to provide that kind of care.\n  Thirdly, the act expands drug discounts to children's hospitals. \nBefore this act, before the act that we are debating, children's \nhospitals did not have access to a program that provides discounts on \nthe drugs they need for\n\n[[Page S12981]]\n\nsick children. Now children will benefit from the discounted prices \nthat result from the passage of this act. This is vitally important.\n  Let me go to one more chart.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes.\n  Mr. CASEY. Two minutes. I will just do one chart and then we will \nmove quickly.\n  This chart makes a very fundamental point. At a time in our history \nwhen over the course of a year the national poverty rate went up by \n800,000, and the number of people without insurance is going up--and in \nthe midst of a recession, you would understand and expect that--the one \nthing we don't focus on is that because of the effectiveness of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, there is one number on this chart \nthat is going down--and we hope it keeps going down--and that is the \nnumber of uninsured children.\n  It is interesting that on this chart between 2007-2008, as the child \npoverty rate went up by 800,000 children, the number of children \nwithout insurance is down by that same number--800,000. It shows the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program is working, even in the midst of a \nrecession. So I have an amendment that strengthens the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program in the bill.\n  I know I am out of time, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have gone \nover the original allocation of time, and Senator McCain is coming to \nthe floor. We will, of course, offer to the minority side whatever \nextra time we will use so that there will be a like amount available to \nthem, and I will make every effort to shorten my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has not exceeded its \ntime. There is 12 minutes remaining on the clock.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sorry, I was misinformed. But whatever we promised the \nminority side, they will receive like treatment on whatever time we \nuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S12981-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12981-S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3590\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the majority leader propounded \na unanimous consent request to have four votes with respect to the \nhealth care bill. The Republican leader objected to the consent, since \nhe indicated they had just received a copy of Senator Lautenberg's \nside-by-side amendment to the Dorgan amendment and so they needed time \nto review the amendment.\n  Therefore, I now ask unanimous consent that following the period of \nmorning business today, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3590 \nfor the purpose of considering the pending Crapo amendment to commit \nand the Dorgan amendment, No. 2793, as modified; that Senator Baucus be \nrecognized to call up a side-by-side amendment to the Crapo motion; \nthat once that amendment has been reported by number, Senator \nLautenberg be recognized to call up his side-by-side amendment to the \nDorgan amendment, as modified; that prior to each of the votes \nspecified in the agreement, there be 5 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nLautenberg amendment; that upon disposition of the Lautenberg \namendment, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the Dorgan \namendment; that upon disposition of that amendment, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the Baucus amendment; and that upon disposition \nof that amendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Crapo \nmotion to commit; that no other amendments be in order during the \npendency of this agreement, and that the above referenced amendments \nand motion to commit be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold; \nthat if they achieve that threshold, they then be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; if they do not achieve \nthat threshold, they then be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are going \nto have three Democratic amendments and one Republican amendment voted \non, and the Democrats wrote the bill. The Democrats are doing a side by \nside to their own amendment.\n  It looks to me like they ought to get together and get some things \nfigured out. There ought to be a little bit more fairness on the number \nof amendments. So I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the second time we have offered to \ncall amendments for a vote, and the complaint from the other side is, \nyou are not calling amendments for a vote.\n  How many times do we have to ask for permission to call amendments \nfor a vote, run into objections from the Republican side, and then hear \nthe speech: Why aren't we voting on amendments?\n\n  I am certain that in the vast expansion of time and space, we can \nwork out something fair in terms of the number of amendments on both \nsides. In fact, maybe the next round will have more Republican \namendments than Democratic amendments. I don't know how many Republican \namendments or Democratic amendments we have voted on so far. We can get \nan official tally, but that really seems like a very minor element to \nstop the debate on health care--because we need to have an equal number \nof amendments. Can't grown-ups work things out like this and with an \nunderstanding that we will resolve them? If we can't, then for \ngoodness' sake don't subject us to these arguments on the Senate floor \nthat we are not calling amendments for a vote. We have just tried 2 \ndays in a row, and the Republicans once again have stopped us with \nobjections. That is a fact.\n  I would implore the leadership--not my friend from Wyoming; I know he \nis doing what he is instructed to do by the leaders--for goodness' \nsake, let's break this logjam. Let's not, at the end of the day, say, \nwell, we stopped debating this bill when we should have been debating \nit, when we have offered 2 days in a row in good faith to have actual \namendments offered and debated.\n  I would also say, Mr. President, this is the bill we are considering, \nH.R. 3590, when we return to it. This is the health care reform bill, \nand this is a bill which has been the product of a lot of work. A lot \nof work has gone into it both in the House and in the Senate. In the \nSenate, two different committees met literally for months writing this \nbill, and they should take that time because this is the most \nsignificant and historic and comprehensive bill I have ever considered \nin my time in Congress--more than 25 years. This bill affects every \nperson in America--every person in the gallery, everyone watching us on \nC-SPAN, every person in America. It addresses an issue that every \nAmerican is concerned about--the future of health care, how we are \ngoing to make it affordable.\n  At a time when fewer businesses offer the protection of health \ninsurance, at a time when individuals find themselves unable to buy \nhealth insurance that is good and that they can afford; at a time when \nhealth insurance companies are turning down people right and left for \nvirtually any excuse related to preexisting conditions, we cannot \ncontinue along this road. Those who are fighting change, those who are \nresisting reform, are basically standing by a broken system.\n  There are many elements in American health care that are the best in \nthe world, but the basic health care system in America is fundamentally \nflawed. This is the only civilized Nation on Earth where you can die \nfor lack of health insurance--literally die.\n  Mr. President, 45,000 people a year die because they do not have the \nhealth insurance they need to bring them to the doctor they need at a \ncritical moment in life. They do not have the health insurance they \nneed to afford the surgical procedure they need to avoid a deadly \ndisease.\n  If a person has a $5,000 deductible on their health insurance, and a \ndoctor tells them--as a man who wrote me from Illinois said--you should \nhave a colonoscopy, sir; there is an indication you could have a \nproblem that could develop into colon cancer and it could be fatal.\n  The man says: How much is the colonoscopy?\n\n[[Page S12982]]\n\n  Well, it is $3,000 out of pocket.\n  The man says: I can't afford it. I just can't pay for it.\n  So he doesn't get the colonoscopy and bad things can occur. That \nhappens in America, but it doesn't happen in any other civilized \ncountry.\n  It is true in some systems he may have had to wait an extra week or a \nmonth, but he gets the care he needs. He doesn't die for lack of health \ninsurance. That is what is going on in America. Almost 50 million \nAmericans without health insurance today--almost 50 million in this \ngreat and prosperous Nation--went to bed last night without the peace \nof mind of the coverage of health insurance. This bill addresses that.\n  At the end of the day, 94 percent of the people living in America \nwill be able to sleep at night knowing they have a decent health \ninsurance plan. That is an amazing step forward. That is a step \nconsistent with the establishment of Social Security, which finally \ntook the worry away from seniors and their families about what would \nhappen to grandma and grandpa when they stopped working.\n  I remember those days. There was a time when grandma and grandpa \nretired and moved in with their kids. Remember that era? I do. It \nhappened in our family, and they didn't have any choice. They had to \nbecause they had modest jobs and not a lot of savings and they put it \non their kids to find that spare bedroom or let them sleep in basement \nthat was made over so that they would have a comfortable and safe place \nto be.\n  Social Security changed that for most American families. This bill \nwill change health care for most American families. The same thing is \ntrue with Medicare. The critics of Medicare--and they have been legion \non the floor of the Senate--ignore the obvious: 45 million Americans \nwill have peace of mind to know that they can get affordable health \ncare once they reach the age of 65. They would not lose their life \nsavings. They will get a good doctor, a good hospital, and a good \noutcome.\n  Isn't that what America is all about? Isn't that why we are supposed \nto be here? Why don't we have more support? The Republican side of the \naisle only comes to say what is wrong with the idea of health care.\n  Steven Pearlstein, in this morning's Washington Post--which I hope \nsome of my Republican colleagues will read--talks about a lost \nopportunity which the Republicans have.\n  We have invited the Republicans from day one to be part of the \nconversation about health care reform. Senator Enzi of Wyoming is one \nwho assiduously gave every effort, spent 61 days trying to reach a \nbipartisan agreement. It failed, but at least he tried. I commend him \nfor trying.\n  Too many others on the other side didn't try. But Steven Pearlstein \nwrites:\n\n       One can only imagine how Republicans could have reshaped \n     health-reform legislation in the Senate . . . Without \n     question, they could have won more deficit-reducing cost \n     savings in the Medicare program by setting limits on spending \n     growth and reforming the way health care is organized, \n     provided and paid for. And they could have begun to realize \n     their goal of ``consumer-driven health care'' by insisting \n     that the new insurance exchanges offer at least one plan \n     built around individual health savings accounts and \n     catastrophic coverage.\n\n  Pearlstein goes on to talk about the possibilities. He says:\n\n       They could have taken a page from John McCain's platform \n     and insisted on replacing the current tax exclusion of \n     health-care benefits with a flat tax credit that would be \n     more progressive and put downward pressure on insurance \n     premiums.\n  I am not guaranteeing that any of those proposals would have been in, \nbut they all could have been in if we had a dialog. Instead of a \ndialog, we have a shouting match, one side of the aisle shouting at the \nother side of the aisle. It is exactly the stereotype of Washington \nwhich America has come to hate. America wants us to solve problems, not \nget into these, you know, fur-flying debates, where we see who can get \nthe rhetorical better of the other. They want us to solve problems but, \nunfortunately, we are still waiting for the first Republican to cross \nthe aisle on the passage of this bill and work with us. The door is \nstill open. The invitation is still there. The idea of doing nothing is \nunacceptable and that should be the message.\n  The fact is, there is no comprehensive Republican health care reform \nbill--period. Senators come to the floor, such as Senator Coburn, and \nsay: I have some good ideas. I bet he does. I may even subscribe to \nthem. But his ideas have not gone through the rigor this bill has gone \nthrough. This bill was sent to the Congressional Budget Office and \nscored, asking the basic questions: No. 1, will it add to the deficit? \nThey came back and told us: No, the Democratic health care reform bill \nwill, in fact, save money, $130 billion in 10 years; $650 billion in \nthe second 10 years. We asked them: Is it going to insure more \nAmericans? They came back and said: Yes, 94 percent will be insured \nwhen this is over. That same rigor has not been applied to the \nRepublican ideas because it is hard, it is tough, and it takes time. I \ncommend them for their thoughtful ideas, but to say they have something \nthey can match against this bill, comprehensive reform--just go to the \nRepublican Senate Web site and look for the Republican comprehensive \nreform bill. Do you know what you will find? You will find the \nDemocratic bill. That is all they can talk about. They don't have a \ncomprehensive health care reform bill.\n  But we are not going to quit. America, we cannot go home for \nChristmas until we get this job done.\n  After we have been here 12 straight days debating, we kind of get \ninto a trance-like, catatonic state, where we can't remember what our \nlast speech was about and we go to sleep at night thinking about what \nwe might have said on the floor or what we are going to say tomorrow. \nBut the fact is, we have to stay and do our job, not just in passing \nhealth care reform but doing something significant to help the \nunemployed and deal with jobs and the economy before we leave here to \ntry to enjoy Christmas, or what is left of it or the holiday season, \nwith our families.\n  This is a job that has to be done. I am sorry we have reached a point \nwhere the Republicans have not been actively involved in creating this \nbill. We tried for the longest time. In the HELP Committee, where \nSenator Enzi serves as the ranking Republican, more than 100 Republican \namendments were accepted as part of this debate and still not one \nsingle Republican Senator would vote for the bill in that committee.\n  So far the scorecard on Republican participation in health care \nreform debate is a lot of speeches, a lot of press releases, a lot of \ncharts on the floor but only two votes--one from a Republican \nCongressman in Louisiana for the House bill; one from Senator Snowe of \nMaine for the Senate Finance version of this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is it. I urge my colleagues to join us in a \ncooperative effort to try to come up with something more positive than \njust our lonely speeches on the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while my friend from Illinois----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent morning business \nbe closed. I wish to make sure Senator McCain has time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for an additional 10 minutes of morning business so \nI could maybe engage in a colloquy with my favorite combatant here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe we can talk a little bit about his remarks.\n  I have to say, I appreciate the eloquence and the passion the Senator \nfrom Illinois has brought to this debate. He makes some very convincing \npoints. One of the major points--and I would be glad to listen to the \nSenator. I think it is fair for us to respond to each other's comments \nvery quickly. The Senator from Illinois said we have been engaged in \nthe negotiations and inputs have been made into the formulation of this \nbill.\n  I have to tell the Senator from Illinois, I have been engaged in many \nbipartisan compromises, whether it be issues such as campaign finance \nreform, whether it be--a whole large number of issues, including \ndefense weapons acquisition reform. I say to the Senator from Illinois, \ndo you know what the process was? People sat down\n\n[[Page S12983]]\n\nat the table together when they were writing the legislation. I am a \nmember of the HELP Committee, OK? I say to the Senator from Illinois, \ndo you know what the process was--because I am on the committee. A bill \nwas brought before the committee without a single--Senator Enzi will \nattest to this--without a single period of negotiations, where we sat \ndown together with the chairman of the committee, where they said: What \nis your input into this legislation?\n  We had many hours of amendments in the committee, all of which, if \nthey were of any real substance, were rejected on a party-line vote.\n  I have to tell the Senator from Illinois he can say all he wants to \nthat there have been efforts to open this to bipartisanship. There have \nnot. My experience in this Senate--I know how you frame a bipartisan \nbill and that has not been the process that has been pursued by the \nmajority.\n  I understand what 60 votes mean. But in all due respect, I say to the \neloquence of my friend from Illinois, that has not been the process \nwhich I have successfully pursued for many years, where people have sat \ndown together at the beginning, where you are there on the takeoff and \nalso then on the landing.\n  I would be glad to hear the response of the Senator from Illinois.\n  I ask unanimous consent if the Senator and I could engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, those who are watching, this is perilously close \nto a debate on the floor of the Senate, which rarely occurs in the \nworld's most deliberative body, where Senators with opposing views \nactually, in a respectful way, have an exchange. I thank the Senator--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Respectful but vigorous.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Arizona. Here is what I \nunderstood happened. I know Senator Dodd came to the HELP Committee \nwith a base bill to start with, but it is my understanding, in the \nprocess, 100 Republican amendments were accepted on that bill. If I am \nmistaken, I know the Senator will correct me, but----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to correct the Senator from Illinois. \nSenator Enzi is here. None of those amendments were of any significant \nsubstance that would have a significant impact on the legislation, I \nhave to say to the Senator from Illinois. For example, medical \nmalpractice, we proposed several amendments that would address what we \nall know, what the Congressional Budget Office says is $54 billion--\nother estimates as much as $100 billion--in savings. There were no real \nfundamental amendments.\n  I have to say that some of those amendments were accepted. But it \nstill doesn't change the fact that at the beginning, as the Senator \nfrom Illinois said--the bill came to the committee without a bit, not 1 \nminute of negotiation before the bill was presented to the committee. \nThe ranking member is on the floor. He will attest to that. Please go \nahead.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, I went through \nbankruptcy reform with Senator Grassley and a similar process was \nfollowed when the Republicans were in the majority. He produced the \nbase-line bill, and I made some modifications and, ultimately, at one \npoint in time, we agreed on a bill, came up with a common bill. The \nstarting point is just that, a starting point. But I say to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, look at what happened to the issue of public option. I \nbelieve in public option passionately. I believe it is essential for \nthe future of health care reform, for competition for private health \ninsurance companies to give consumers a choice, to make sure we have \none low-cost alternative at least in every market. Yet, at the end of \nthe day, I did not get what I wanted and what is being proposed, now at \nthe Congressional Budget Office, is not my version of public option.\n  We ended up bending toward some of the more moderate and conservative \nmembers of the Democratic caucus and toward the Republican point of \nview. I don't know of a single Republican who came out for public \noption. Maybe I am forgetting one. At the end of the day, the point I \nam making to the Senator is there was an effort at flexibility and an \neffort at change to try to find some common ground. Unfortunately, the \nground we are plowing has only 60 Democratic votes. It could have been \nmuch different. It could still be much different.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my friend, wasn't the reason the public option \nwas abandoned was not because of a Republican objection, it was because \nof the Democratic objection? The Senator from Connecticut stated, \nunequivocally, the public option would make it a no deal.\n  I appreciate the fact that Republican objections were observed. But I \ndon't believe the driving force behind the abandonment of this public \noption, if it actually was that--we have not seen the bill that is \ngoing to come before us--was mainly because of the necessity to keep 60 \nDemocratic votes together.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Arizona is correct. But I add, Senator \nSnowe has shown, I believe, extraordinary courage in voting for this \nbill in the Senate Finance Committee and made it clear she could not \nsupport the public option. We are hoping, at the end of the day, she \nwill consider voting for health care reform. That was part of the \ncalculation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We are hoping not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I understand your point of view, but I would say--you are \nright. But we were moving toward our 60 votes, but it would be a great \noutcome if we end up with a bill that brings some Republicans on board, \nand it was clear we couldn't achieve that if we kept the public option \nin. There are other elements here. We are going to have a real profound \ndifference when it comes to the issue of medical malpractice and how to \napproach it. But I think, even on that issue, we could have worked \ntoward some common ground, and I hope someday we still can.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend about the situation as it exists \nright now? Right now, no Member on this side has any idea as to the \nspecifics of the proposal the majority leader, I understand, has sent \nto OMB for some kind of scoring. Is that the way we want to do \nbusiness, that a proposal that will be presented to the Senate sometime \nnext week and voted on immediately--that is what we are told--is that \nthe way to do business in a bipartisan fashion? Should we not at least \nbe informed as to what the proposal is the Senate majority leader is \ngoing to propose to the entire Senate within a couple days? Shouldn't \nwe even know what it is?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, I am in the dark \nalmost as much as he is, and I am in the leadership. The reason is, \nbecause the Congressional Budget Office, which scores the managers' \namendment, the so-called compromise, has told us, once you publicly \nstart debating it, we will publicly release it. We want to basically \nsee whether it works, whether it works to continue to reduce the \ndeficit, whether it works to continue to reduce the growth in health \ncare costs.\n  We had a caucus after this was submitted to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, where Senator Reid and other Senators who were involved in it \nbasically stood and said: We are sorry, we can't tell you in detail \nwhat was involved. But you will learn, everyone will learn, it will be \nas public information as this bill currently is on the Internet. But \nthe Congressional Budget Office has tied our hands at this point \nputting it forward. Basically, what I know is what you know, having \nread press accounts of what may be included.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my friend from Illinois--and by the way, I \nwould like to do this again. Perhaps when he can get more substance \ninto many of the issues.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Same time, same place tomorrow?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I admit these are unusual times. But isn't that a very \nunusual process, that here we are discussing one-sixth of the gross \nnational product; the bill before us has been a product of almost a \nyear of sausage-making. Yet here we are at a position on December 12, \nwith a proposal that none of us, except, I understand, one person, the \nmajority leader, knows what the final parameters are, much less \ninforming the American people. I don't get it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator is correct, saying most of us know \nthe\n\n[[Page S12984]]\n\nfundamentals, but we do not know the important details behind this. \nWhat I am saying is, this is not the choice of the majority leader. It \nis the choice of the Congressional Budget Office. We may find that \nsomething that was sent over there doesn't work at all, doesn't fly. \nThey may say this is not going to work, start over. So we have to \nreserve the right to do that, and I think that is why we are waiting \nfor the Congressional Budget Office scoring, as they call it, to make \nsure it hits the levels we want, in terms of deficit reduction and \nreducing the cost of health care.\n  It is frustrating on your side. It is frustrating here. But I am \nhoping, in a matter of hours, maybe days, we will receive the CBO \nreport.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Arizona, if he wouldn't mind \nresponding to me on this. Does the Senator believe the current health \ncare system in America is sustainable as we know it, in terms of \naffordability for individuals and businesses? Is the Senator concerned \nthat more and more people do not have the protection of health \ninsurance; fewer businesses offer that protection?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 10-minute time period has \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator concerned as well with the fact that we \nhave 50 million Americans without health insurance and the number is \ngrowing; that in many of the insurance markets across America there is \nno competition, one or two take-it-or-leave-it situations? Does that \nlead him to conclude we cannot stay with the current system but have to \nmake some fundamental changes and reforms?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend, everything he said is absolutely \ncorrect. I am deeply concerned about the situation of health care in \nAmerica. I know the Senator from Illinois is deeply concerned about the \nfact that it is going to go bankrupt, about the fact that the Medicare \ntrustees say that within 6 or 7 years it is broke. From what we hear, \nthere is now a proposal over there to extend eligibility for Medicare, \nwhich obviously puts more people in the system, which obviously, under \nthe present setup, would accelerate a point of bankruptcy, at least \nfrom what I know of this.\n  But the fundamental difference we have, in my opinion, is not what we \nwant--we both share the deep ambition that every American has \naffordable and available health care--it is that we believe a \ngovernment option, a government takeover, a massive reorganization of \nhealth care in America will destroy the quality of health care in \nAmerica and not address the fundamental problem. We believe the quality \nis fine.\n  We think the problem is bringing costs under control. When you refuse \nto address an obvious aspect of cost savings such as malpractice \nreform, such as going across State lines to obtain health insurance, \nsuch as allowing small businesses to join together and negotiate with \nhealth care companies, such as other proposals we have, then that is \nwhere we have a difference. We share a common ambition, but we differ \non the way we get there. I do not see in this bill, nor do most \nexperts, a significant reduction in health care costs except slashing \nMedicare by some $\\1/2\\ trillion, which everybody knows doesn't work, \nand destroying the Medicare Advantage Program of which in my home State \n330,000 seniors are a part.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator two or three things. First, the CBO \ntells us this bill will make Medicare live 5 years more. This bill will \nbreathe into Medicare extended life of 5 additional years. Second, I \nhave heard a lot of negative comments about government-sponsored health \ncare. I ask the Senator from Arizona, is he in favor of eliminating the \nMedicare Program, the veterans care program, the Medicaid Program, the \nCHIP program to provide health insurance for children, all basically \ngovernment-administered programs? Does he believe there is something \nfundamentally wrong with those programs that they should be jettisoned \nand turned over to the private sector?\n  The second question, does the Senator from Arizona want to justify \nwhy Medicare Advantage, offered by private health insurance companies, \ncosts 14 percent more than the government plan being offered, and we \nare literally subsidizing private health insurance companies to the \ntune of billions of dollars each year so they can make more profits at \nthe expense of Medicare?\n  Mr. McCAIN. First, obviously I want to preserve those programs. But \nevery one of those the Senator pointed out is going broke. They are \nwonderful programs. They are great things to have. But they are going \nbroke. He knows it and I know it, and the Medicare trustees know it. To \nsay that we don't want these programs because we want to fix them is \nobviously a mischaracterization of my position, our position. We want \nto preserve them, but we all know they are going broke. It means cost \nsavings. It means malpractice reform. It means all the things I talked \nabout. The Senator mentioned Medicare Advantage. That is called \nMedicare Part C. That is part of the Medicare system. There are \narguments made that there are enormous savings over time because \nseniors who have this program, who have chosen it, who haven't violated \nany law, are more well and more fit and have better health over time, \nthereby, in the long run, causing significant savings in the health \ncare system which is what this is supposed to be all about. I ask in \nresponse: How in the world do you take a Medicare system which, \naccording to the trustees, is going broke and then expand it to people \nbetween age 55 and 64? The math doesn't work. It doesn't work under the \npresent system which is going broke. To add on to it, any medical \nexpert will tell you, results in adverse selection and therefore \nincreases in health care costs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I may respond, why is Medicare facing insolvency? Why \nis it going broke? Why are the other systems facing it? Because the \nincrease in cost in health care each year outstrips inflation. There is \nno way to keep up with it unless we start bending the cost curve. We \nface that reality unless we deal with the fundamentals of how to have \nmore efficient, quality health care. Going broke is a phenomena not \nreflective in bad administration of the program but in the reality of \nhealth care economics.\n  What I am about to say about the expanded Medicare is based solely on \npress accounts, not that I know what was submitted to CBO in detail. I \ndo not. But the 55 to 64 eligibility for Medicare will be in a separate \npool sustained by premiums paid by those going in. If they are a high-\nrisk pool by nature, they will see higher premiums. What happens in \nthat pool will not have an impact on Medicare, as I understand it. It \nwill be a separate pool of those receiving Medicare benefits that they \nwill pay for in actual premiums. It won't be at the expense or to the \nbenefit of the Medicare Program itself. What I have said is based on \npress accounts and not my personal knowledge of what was submitted to \nCBO.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator has seen the CMS estimates this morning that \nthis will mean dramatic increases in health care costs. You may be able \nto expand the access to it, but given the dramatic increase, one, it \nstill affects the Medicare system and, two, there will obviously be \nincreased costs, if you see the adverse selection such as we are \ntalking about.\n  I see the staff is getting restless. I ask my friend, maybe we could \ndo this again during the weekend and during the week. I appreciate it. \nI think people are helped by this kind of debate. I respect not only \nthe passion but the knowledge the Senator from Illinois has about this \nissue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S12984-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 3288, making \n     appropriations for the Departments\n\n[[Page S12985]]\n\n     of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, one of the troubling aspects of this \nconference report is that the appropriators air dropped three very \nsignificant spending bills into the text during conference. In other \nwords, three bills without any debate, discussion or amendment were air \ndropped into this pending legislation. The three bills are the Labor-\nHHS-Education, financial services and general government, and the \nState-Foreign Operations appropriations bills. Combined, these three \nbills spend over $237 billion and contain 2,019 earmarks. It is \nremarkable and unacceptable that the Senate is willing to approve \nexpenditure of such huge sums without the opportunity to debate and \namend their content.\n  I see the Senator from Hawaii, who will say: This is the way we have \nhad to do business before. We have to do this because of the pressure \nof time, the fiscal year ended, et cetera, et cetera. Again, we get \nback to this old line that we heard for an entire year and even early \nthis year about change, about how we were going to change things in \nWashington. We are going to change the way we do business.\n  President Obama said about the last omnibus bill passed last March, 3 \nmonths into the Obama administration:\n\n       The future demands that we operate in a different way than \n     we have in the past. So let there be no doubt: this piece of \n     legislation must mark an end to the old way of doing business \n     and the beginning of a new era of responsibility and \n     accountability that the American people have every right to \n     expect and demand.\n\n  What are we doing today? The exact same thing that we were doing \nbefore.\n  Here is a quote from the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel \nabout the last omnibus bill. This is the one we weren't going to do \nanymore.\n\n       Second, this is last year's business.\n\n  He was talking about the one we passed in March.\n\n       And third, most importantly, we are going to have to make \n     some other changes going forward to reduce and bring more--\n     reduce the ultimate number and bring the transparency. And \n     that's the policy that he enunciated in his campaign.\n\n  Bob Schieffer:\n\n       But it sounds to me like what you're--what he's about to \n     do, here, is say, well I don't like this but I'm going to go \n     ahead and sign it--\n\n  Talking about the last omnibus bill--\n\n     but I'm going to warn you, don't ever do it again. Is that \n     what's about to happen here?\n\n  Emanuel:\n\n       In not so many words, yes.\n\n  And then, of course, the Senate majority leader said about the last \nomnibus:\n\n       We have a lot of issues we need to get to after we fund the \n     government, something we should have done last year but we \n     could not because of the difficulty we had with working with \n     President Bush.\n\n  I wonder if we are going to blame President Bush for this one. If it \nrained, if it didn't rain? We blamed him for almost everything. \nWhatever it is, let's blame President Bush. The point is, what this \nbill is, and another one that will be coming up in a couple days, is \nexactly the same business as usual, a porkbarrel-laden bill with \nincreases in spending when the American people are hurting in the worst \npossible way. The American people are hurting and the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education appropriations bill has $11.3 billion or a \n7-percent increase in spending over last year's spending level. Where \nare we? This is America. Americans are hurting. There is 10 percent \nunemployment. People can't stay in their homes. They can't keep their \njobs. We are passing a piece of legislation with 1,749 earmarks just in \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services piece of over $806 billion.\n  Do you want to hear a few of them? They are fascinating. Here is my \nfavorite of all--there are a lot of good ones--$2.7 million to support \nsurgical operations in outer space at the University of Nebraska. I \nassure my colleagues, I am not making that up. That is an appropriation \nin this bill. Let me repeat: $2.7 million to support surgical \noperations in outer space. There are a lot of compelling issues before \nthe American people. Surgical operations in outer space at the \nUniversity of Nebraska? I guess the University of Nebraska has some \nkind of expertise that they need $2.7 million so we could support \nsurgical operations in outer space. I wonder when the next surgical \noperation is scheduled in outer space? Maybe we ought to go into that.\n  I will be spending more time on the floor on this. But $30,000 for a \nWoodstock film festival youth initiative? Woodstock was a pretty neat \nexperience, but do we need to spend $30,000 to revisit that one? There \nis $200,000 to renovate and construct the Laredo Little Theater in \nTexas. The next time you are in Laredo, be sure to stop by the theater \nand see $200,000 of your money which is going to renovate and construct \nthis little theater. There is $500,000 for the Botanical Research \nInstitute of Texas in Fort Worth; $200,000 for a visitors center in \nBastrop, TX, a visitor center there in Bastrop with a population of \n5,340 people. We are going to spend $200,000 of my taxpayers' dollars \nto build them a visitor center. There is $200,000 for design and \nconstruction of the Garapan public market in the Northern Mariana \nislands; $500,000 for development of a community center in Custer \nCounty, ID, population 4,342. If my math is right, that is about $100 \nper person. Right here in our Nation's Capital, $200,000 to the \nWashington National Opera for set design, installation and performing \narts at libraries and schools. They have an operating budget of $32 \nmillion. Their Web site says the secret of its success is due to its \nposition without the crucial government support typical in most world \ncapitals. Then, of course, we always get back to Hawaii: $13 million on \nfisheries in Hawaii, nine projects throughout the islands ranging from \nfunding the bigeye tuna quotas, marine education and training, and \ncoral research.\n  The list goes on and on. The next time you are in New York, go to \nLincoln Center. We are spending $800,000 of your money for jazz at the \nLincoln Center. Jazz lovers, rejoice. For those who are not jazz \nlovers, we have $300,000 for music programs at Carnegie Hall; $3.4 \nmillion for a rural bus program in Hawaii. Apparently, the $1.9 million \nin the 2009 omnibus was not enough. In other words, we gave $1.9 \nmillion for this rural bus program in Hawaii so we have to now give \nthem $3.4 million more.\n  Custer County, ID, with a population of 4,342, as of the year 2000--I \nam sure they have grown since--$500,000 for development of a community \ncenter in Custer County, ID.\n  The list goes on.\n  Then, of course, it is loaded with controversial policy riders that \nshould have been debated in the Senate.\n  In the Department of Labor bill, the conference rescinds $50 million \nfrom unobligated immigration enforcement funds under section 286(v) of \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act. This will result in a decrease in \nthe enforcement of immigration law. I guarantee you, if that provision \nhad been debated here on the floor of the Senate, that $50 million \nwould never have been removed.\n  The conference agreement includes new language providing authority to \nthe International Labor Affairs Bureau, the agency charged with \ncarrying out the Department of Labor's international responsibilities. \nThis may be a worthy program, but it should be addressed in \nlegislation.\n  There are so many other policy provisions in this bill which have not \nbeen authorized, which is supposed to be done by authorizers.\n  The conference agreement provides $35 million for the Delta Health \nInitiative. The Delta Health Initiative provides a service to \nindividuals in only one area of the country, the delta region of \nMississippi. I have visited the delta region in Mississippi, and there \nare severe health needs. But couldn't we authorize this program? \nCouldn't we authorize it? Couldn't we have the proper debate and \ndiscussion?\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Of course, there is $25 million ``for patient safety and medical \nliability reform demonstrations'' that was not included in the House or \nSenate. Medical liability reform demonstrations--there is a \ndemonstration project already in being. It is called the State of \nTexas, where they have reduced medical malpractice costs dramatically, \nand the physicians and caregivers are flowing back into the State of \nTexas.\n  Mr. President, I will be talking more later this afternoon about all \nthe pork and earmarking that is in this bill.\n\n[[Page S12986]]\n\n  I have to tell you that the anger and the frustration out there is at \nan incredibly high level. Those of us who--I am sure most of us do--\nspend a lot of time at townhall meetings and hearing from our \nconstituents know there is a level of anger out there, the likes of \nwhich I have not seen before. Here they are, hurting so badly because \nthey cannot keep their homes and their jobs. My home State of Arizona \nis No. 2 in the country of homes where the mortgage payment is higher \nthan the home value--48 percent of the homes in my State. So here we \nare with 10-percent unemployment, with deficits--this year of $1.4 \ntrillion--and there are dramatic increases, a 7-percent increase in \nspending in one, a 14-percent increase in spending in the other, and \nthey do not get it. They do not get it. They do not get it. Americans \nare having to tighten their belts.\n  My home State of Arizona is in a fiscal crisis. They are having to \ncut services to our citizens because we cannot print money in Arizona. \nThey only print money here. And here we are with Omnibus appropriations \nbills with as high as a 14-percent increase in spending, loaded down \nwith billions of dollars worth of porkbarrel projects.\n  I predict to my colleagues that the anger out there will be manifest \nin a number of peaceful ways, including in the ballot booth. They are \nsick and tired of this. I saw a poll yesterday where the approval \nrating of Members of Congress has fallen below that of the approval \nrating for used car salespersons. I think it was at 4 percent, as I \nrecall the poll. I have not met any of the 4 percent. I have not met \nanybody who approves of what we are doing.\n  This exercise we are in right here, on December 11, 2009, with a \npork-laden Omnibus appropriations bill which frivolously and \noutrageously spends their dollars when they are struggling to keep \ntheir heads above water is something that is going to be rejected \nsooner or later by the American people. I have warned my colleagues \nthat the American people are sick and tired of this. They did not like \nit before. Now they are fed up with it.\n  We will be hearing more this afternoon.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today to raise a point of order under rule \nXXVIII against H.R. 3288, the Omnibus appropriations bill. I do this to \nensure that this bloated legislation is not permitted to proceed to \nfull consideration by the Senate.\n  Specifically, rule XXVIII precludes conference reports from including \npolicy provisions that were not related to either the House or the \nSenate version of the legislation as sent to conference. Several \nprovisions included in division D--the Departments of Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct--of this omnibus bill are out of scope and were never considered on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the conference report \nviolates the provisions of rule XXVIII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nrule XXVIII, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under rule XXVIII, there is up to 1 hour \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with mixed emotions. When I assumed the \nchairmanship of the Appropriations Committee last January, I \nimmediately reached out to the senior Republican member of the \ncommittee from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, to seek his support in \nachieving my central objective for the fiscal year: to return this \nappropriations process to the regular order. The vice chairman, Senator \nCochran, agreed wholeheartedly, and together we committed to passing \nall 12 appropriations bills individually and to sending each of the \ncompleted bills to the President for his signature.\n  It might be of interest to my colleagues that of the 12 bills \nassigned to this committee, 11 were passed by the end of July, many \nmonths ago. One was held up at the request of the House but passed in \nmid-September. This is December. These bills have been passed. And it \nmight be of further interest to the Senate that of the 12 bills, 9 were \npassed unanimously, bipartisan, 30 to 0. Three passed by one \nobjection--29 to 1.\n  Completing action on our annual appropriations bills is our most \nfundamental responsibility. The Founding Fathers gave us the power of \nthe purse, and for good reason. Our system of checks and balances, \nwhich has served us so well in the last 220 years, allows the executive \nbranch to propose spending initiatives that make clear to us their \nintentions and desires. But the Constitution gives the Congress the \nultimate decisionmaking authority, and it is our responsibility to \nfulfill this obligation.\n  Regular order allows each Senator the opportunity to debate and to \namend each bill on an individual basis. Every Senator on both sides of \nthe aisle recognizes that regular order is the preferred course of \naction.\n  The underlying Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill \nwill provide urgently needed funding so we can keep our transportation \nsystem safe and strong and provide much-needed assistance to our most \nvulnerable populations.\n  In addition, every one of the six bills we consider today was \nreported out by the full committee. As I pointed out, three of them \nwere passed unanimously and the other three by a vote of 29 to 1. Every \none of them has been written in a bipartisan fashion with considerable \ninput on the part of the minority party.\n  The negotiations with our House counterparts have been spirited at \ntimes, but I can assure my colleagues that on the difficult issues, our \nsubcommittee chairmen and ranking members have done an excellent job of \ndefending Senate positions and of coming to fair and equitable \ncompromises when such was necessary.\n  I would also note that on Tuesday evening, we held a full and open \nconference with the House at which every conferee, including 22 Members \nof the Senate, bipartisan Members, and 14 Members of the House, also \nbipartisan, was afforded the opportunity to offer amendments on any \nprovision of the legislation. For the record, comity was demonstrated \nby the Senate conferees, and no amendments--no amendments--were offered \non our side. At the conclusion of the conference, 16 conferees, \nincluding 4 Republican members, signed the conference report.\n\n  Finally, I can say this is a clean bill. There are no extraneous \nmeasures attached. For this reason, as I just mentioned, we have \nbipartisan support of the bill, and I am proud of that fact.\n  Some have criticized this bill as spending too much. I will point out \nthat the amounts recommended in the bill are below the amounts \nrequested by the President and equal to the amount approved by the \nCongress in the Budget Committee. It has been a long process. \nFurthermore, the only area where the committee exceeded the amount \nrequested by the President is for military construction and for \nveterans.\n  Moreover, some have criticized the majority for resorting to an \nomnibus measure once again. Clearly, those who criticize are those \nresponsible for this outcome. When the Senate needs 4 days to pass a \nnoncontroversial conference agreement on the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill, we know the only reason can be that a few Members \nwant to delay our progress. Why do they want to do that? So they can \ncomplain when the calendar has expired and we have no time left for the \nregular order.\n  As a reminder to all of us, the Military Construction bill was \ndelayed for 6 days of debate on this floor. It was a bill that was \nvoted out of the Appropriations Committee unanimously, bipartisan-wise, \nand then delayed. But after the delay of 6 days, this Senate passed it \nby a vote of 100 to 0. What was the opposition all about? What was the \ndelay all about, when everyone here was in favor of it? There was not a \nsingle dissenting vote, so it is obvious there was not opposition to \nthe bill. It was simply that a few Members wanted to delay the bill.\n  Mr. President, now is December 11, and it is nearly time to adjourn \nthe\n\n[[Page S12987]]\n\nSenate for the year. We have not completed our work, and therefore we \nhave consolidated six appropriations bills in one measure. My \ncolleagues know precisely why we have reached this point, and it is not \nthe fault of one member of the Appropriations Committee, nor the fault \nof the majority. It is the fault of a handful of Members who would \nrather see the responsibility for funding our Federal Government turned \nover to the bureaucrats and administration than have the Congress \nexercise its constitutional responsibility. I am a very patient person, \nbut at times the rhetoric of this debate is too much to take.\n\n  With Senator Cochran, my vice chairman, as my partner, we have tried \nto move 12 individual bills only to be thwarted by a few Members--just \na few Members. That is why we are here and where we are today with an \nomnibus bill.\n  As we look ahead to consideration of fiscal year 2011 appropriations \nbills, I hope all Members of the Senate will learn from the \nfrustrations of this year. We can succeed in returning to regular order \nfor appropriations. We only need a modicum of cooperation and a \nrecognition that delay for the sake of delay serves no one's best \ninterests, least of all the people of the United States.\n  I strongly support this clean, bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for several weeks I have been saying, where \nare the appropriations bills? Under Federal law, we are supposed to \nhave those done by October 1--October 1. Let's see. This is December \n10. We must be past that deadline.\n  Well, here come the bills. They are all packed into one. There won't \nbe the debate we would get if we handled them one by one. It is \nfascinating to me that one of them is Health and Human Services. All \nyear we have heard that health is what is breaking the people of this \nNation, how important health care is; why we have to do health care \nreforms under strict deadlines--strict deadlines that have shifted a \nnumber of times and are irrelevant to getting a good bill. But health \ncare is that important, and it is one-sixth of the Nation's economy. So \nwhy haven't we had the health care appropriations debate before October \n1? Why did it get put off until now? I guess it is because all of the \nearmarks weren't ready yet or maybe it is because they thought this \nbill ought to pass and solve all of the problems.\n  I think the bill could have passed much faster. I think it could have \nsolved a lot more problems. If it would have had the kind of \nbipartisanship Senator Durbin keeps describing as having happened, we \nwould already have the bill done. Much of what he keeps repeating--and \nthe more times you repeat it doesn't make it more true--in every speech \nhe gives, he makes the same comments about how long the HELP Committee \nworked on this bill and how many amendments from the Republican side \nwere automatically accepted into the HELP bill. We always have to come \nout and correct that. Yes, there were a number of amendments. That bill \nwas put together over a period of 2 weeks with a new committee \nchairman, without a single input from Republicans. It was brought to \nthe committee for markup. We did have about 3 days to do amendments, \nand we did a lot of amendments. They did accept some of the amendments. \nOf course, we helped correct punctuation, we helped correct spelling, \nand we did have a few amendments that were accepted that actually made \na difference.\n  After the vote, they didn't publish the bill for the public to look \nat--the amended version of the bill for the public to look at. I think \nthat was so they could rip out the Republican amendments they had \naccepted. That has never been done in committees. When amendments are \naccepted, they are left in the bill, or at least the Senator who \nproposed the amendment gets to talk about why maybe it should or \nshouldn't be in there, or at least he is informed that they are going \nto rip it out. Not in this case. The bill is published, we are looking \nfor some of these things and find they are gone. Then they wonder why \nthere is opposition to the bill.\n  Then he talks about the hours we spent together working as the Group \nof 6. I appreciate him mentioning the hours, but hours don't make any \ndifference if ideas aren't taken. The purpose of the hours is to be \nable to express ideas that can be included in a bill. Just getting to \nexpress them isn't enough. To make them bipartisan, they have to be \nincluded. Anybody who looks at the things we have on our Web sites \nwould understand that we did have some good ideas, some things that \nwould make a change in the way we do health care in America. Are those \nin this bill? No.\n  This is the Reid bill. This wasn't put together by the HELP Committee \nor the Finance Committee, although significant parts of both of those \nbills, which we didn't have input into, are a part of it. How was that \ndesigned? That was designed behind closed doors right over there, with \nno Republican input whatsoever. How does that make it bipartisan? How \ndoes that even give us a chance to make it bipartisan? Then they wonder \nwhy we have amendments.\n  Here is a fascinating thing on amendments: In the HELP Committee, the \nDemocrats presented more amendments than the Republicans did. The \nRepublicans did get two that we voted on and passed. The Democrats had \nover 30 that they presented to get passed. How come they even had to \nput in amendments? It was their bill. We are facing the same thing with \nthe bill that is on the floor here. They are putting in more amendments \nthan we are. Every time we put in an amendment they have a side-by-side \non it to give them some cover to say, well, what they said wasn't that \nimportant. It wouldn't make a difference. Besides that, we don't want \nto do it, so we will have something that says we voted for that \nconcept.\n  If you put the bill together, you shouldn't be the ones filibustering \nand doing the amendments. They have a unique position here now. We have \na Democratic amendment and a Democratic side-by-side. I don't remember \never seeing that before. But we had a request this morning for three \nDemocratic votes and one Republican vote. That is real bipartisanship? \nYet they want the cooperation.\n  The thing that upsets me the most is they keep saying this will save \nmoney, this bill is going to save the country money, and we are in this \nappropriations process and we ought to be interested in saving the \ncountry money. But CBO didn't say that. CBO did not say that this bill \nwill save money, unless you use a whole bunch of phony accounting, and \nthere is phony accounting in this bill. That is how they are able to \nsay, Oh, yes, we save money. We save money. This is going to save the \nAmerican people a lot of money. No, it does not. Do not buy that story. \nLook at the accounting. I am the accountant. I have taken a look at it, \nbut I am not that good of an authority.\n  We just got the report from the CMS chief actuary. Yes, that is the \nactuary who is actually in charge of Medicare and Medicaid and he did \nan analysis on it. I am going to go into some more detail on that \nanalysis, because he says this bill does not save money. This bill will \ncost seven-tenths of 1 percent more than if we did nothing. Is that \nhealth care reform?\n  And where is the transparency we were promised would happen under \nthis administration? Transparency? They built the bill behind the \nclosed doors over on that side of the Senate Chamber and now a \nsignificant part of the bill--which is called the public option, \ngovernment option, government-run program, whatever you want to call \nit--has been drastically changed. The newspapers have written about it. \nPeople have seen it. But the newspapers haven't seen what is in there. \nThe Democrats, according to Senator Durbin, the majority whip, have not \nseen that bill. The only one who has seen it is Senator Reid and the \nCongressional Budget Office. He is not going to disclose any of that--\nany of that--until after he sees what the score is going to be. That is \nthe ultimate in transparency, in my opinion. If you think\n\n[[Page S12988]]\n\nyou have a good idea, maybe you ought to let people see what the score \nis and see what the bill is, and you ought to if you expect us to \ndebate it in a hurry. That is what we are under, this hurry-up \nsituation. Hurry up so a bill that isn't going to do anything until \n2014 can be passed by Christmas.\n\n  This side is ready to reform health care. This side is ready to stay \nin through the weekend. We already stayed in through last weekend. We \nwill stay in until Christmas. We will stay in the days after Christmas. \nWe will stay in next year. But it has to be right. The American public \nexpects this to be right.\n  There has never been a major piece of legislation passed by this body \nin the history of the United States that was passed by one party. Not \nyet, there hasn't been. There is a good reason for that. It is full of \nflaws if just one side's ideas are incorporated in the bill, and this \nis no exception. This has a lot of flaws. This is a real move to the \nleft to incorporate most of the people over there, but they weren't \nable to incorporate all of them, so now they are doing a secret public \noption to expand Medicare to distract people without telling them what \nis in it and expecting us in a few days to vote on this thing.\n  Well, I am going to share some of these numbers from the CMS chief \nactuary a little later, but I see my colleague is here and is actually \ngoing to talk mostly on the appropriations bill. I will say that what I \nhave had to say ties in directly to appropriations. It is spending \nmoney. We are going to spend $464 billion of Medicare money from a \nsystem that is going broke and we are going to raise taxes--that is \nkind of an appropriation too--to cover the other $\\1/2\\ trillion in new \nprograms that are not going to lower premiums or save the United States \nmoney, according to the CMS Chief Actuary Rick Foster.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Enzi for not just \nwhat he said today but for what he has been doing throughout this whole \ndebate to make very complex issues much simpler so that people can \nlisten in to what is being said here and understand what we are doing. \nIt has been a frustrating process here dealing with this attempted \ngovernment takeover of health care. While the majority has us here on \nthe floor debating one bill, they are behind a closed door over here \ncreating a whole new bill and making periodic announcements about what \nmight be in it. It is kind of like a magician who gets you looking at \none hand while the sleight of hand is actually doing the magic with the \nother hand, and that is what we see happening here today. The majority \nwants to force this major piece of legislation through before Christmas \nwhile people aren't paying attention.\n  In the middle of this, they have decided to take a break to expand \nspending at unprecedented levels. I am here right now to support \nSenator McCain's rule XXVIII point of order that points out that the \nmajority, the Democratic majority, has violated all of these so-called \nethics and transparency improvements that they were bragging about only \na year ago. We are not supposed to take bills and in the secret of \nconferences add things that weren't in the House or the Senate version. \nThat violates a specific rule, an ethics rule that the majority \ntrumpeted not too long ago. This bill contains out-of-control spending. \nIt completely reverses Congress's traditional position on many values \nissues such as taxpayer-funded abortions and needle exchanges in the \nDistrict of Columbia. It ends the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program \nthat has done so much to help a small number of disadvantaged minority \nstudents. It increases funding for Planned Parenthood, the Nation's \nleading provider of abortions, and it legalizes medical marijuana. Yet \nthe overall funding levels of this bill are unconscionable at a time \nwhen we are in recession and so many people are out of work. We have \nmassive debt that threatens our Nation's economic future and our very \ncurrency itself.\n  The bill represents a $50 billion increase or 12.5 percent over last \nyear's funding level. This is not mandated spending; this is \ndiscretionary spending. This is a time the President is saying we have \nto get a handle on our debt. Yet every bill the Democratic majority has \npushed across this floor has major increases in spending. It is \nactually nearly a $90 billion increase over the year before.\n  Mr. President, what the President said he was against, which was \nearmarks, this bill has 5,224 earmarks, costing nearly $4 billion, in \naddition to the other spending. I cannot read all of those, but I think \npeople across the country have learned what earmarks mean. Here are a \nfew examples:\n\n  $500,000 for construction of a beach park promenade; six different \nbike paths totaling $2.11 million; $250,000 for a trail at Wolftrap \nCenter for the Performing Arts; and $250,000 for the Entrepreneurial \nCenter for Horticulture.\n\n  I could go on and on. It makes no sense to be doing this. I think \nmaybe one of the most egregious parts of the bill, which I want to \nfocus on for a few minutes, goes back to those values issues. It is one \nthing to make abortion legal; it is quite another thing to force \nAmericans who consider abortion immoral, based on their beliefs, or \nreligious beliefs--it is immoral to make them pay for it, to actually \npromote abortion.\n  That is what this bill does. Everywhere you turn, this administration \nis promoting anti-life initiatives and advancing policies that most \nAmericans find morally objectionable--namely, taxpayer-funded \nabortions. We have seen that throughout this health care debate, and \nnow in the very set of bills that funds our government, it is promoting \nand funding abortion.\n  This Nation has had a debate about whether we should even allow \nabortions to be legal. But we have been in general agreement as a \nnation, and even here in the Congress, for years that we should not \nforce taxpayers to pay for abortions. That is a terrible use of the \npower of government.\n  The omnibus bill reported by the House-Senate conference allows \ntaxpayer funds to be used to pay for elective abortion in the District \nof Columbia, because Congress controls DC's entire budget, including \nappropriating the city's local revenues. If this omnibus bill passes, \nCongress will be allowing U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund abortion on \ndemand, when it was previously prohibited.\n  This is a major shift in policy. We must step back and see where our \npriorities are as a nation. The values of our country are at stake in \nthis legislation. As we look at this, I hope no American is so naive as \nto think that if they pass this government takeover of health care, no \nmatter what we put in the legislation, they will eventually fund \nelective abortions in this country. It shows everywhere they pass a \npiece of legislation that they are trying to promote abortion in this \ncountry.\n  A vote for the omnibus is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortion. A vote \nagainst Senator McCain's point of order is a vote for taxpayer-funded \nabortion. It is simple and it is clear. Congress is responsible for the \nbudget and the way the funds are spent. If we don't think the \ngovernment should create an incentive for taking unborn lives, we \nshould not allow it in the legislation before us today.\n  In addition to this troubling revelation, the bill contains many \nother egregious reversals of longstanding policy contradicting \ntraditional American values. The underlying bill legalizes medical \nmarijuana and uses Federal funds to establish a needle exchange program \nin Washington, DC. Both encourage the use of drugs.\n  This is another glimpse of what is going to happen with government-\nrun health care. If this Congress is promoting the use of medical \nmarijuana, needle exchange programs, abortion, in this funding bill, \ndoes anyone believe that that won't be a part of a government-run \nhealth care system? Of course not.\n  Additionally, this bill eliminates the successful DC Scholarship \nOpportunity Program, which aids low-income children by giving them \nscholarships to attend private schools in Washington, DC. This affects \nonly about 1,500 children. I have had a chance to meet with some of \nthem who were in schools that were not working. This small scholarship \nprogram allows disadvantaged, primarily minority, students in \nWashington, DC, to go to a private school of their choice. Remarkably, \nin just a few years, the students who moved from the government schools \nto the private schools were 2 years ahead of their peers. It is an \nexample of something\n\n[[Page S12989]]\n\nthat is working, helping disadvantaged students, and it is a good \nexample of an administration that is more interested in paying off \nunion interests--in this case the teachers union--than doing what is \ngood for the children in our country. To eliminate this small, \ninexpensive program is absurd. But it reveals to you----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No, I won't. It reveals to you the true motives of the \nmajority. If we look at this bill and this eventual health care bill--\nif we ever have time to see it before they try to pass it--we are \nbeginning to see a real glimpse, a true picture of where this \nDemocratic majority is going.\n  Finally, this bill increases funding for title X family planning \nservices, of which Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient. Planned \nParenthood is the Nation's largest provider of abortions. Increasingly, \nthey are what we call directed abortions. When people come to Planned \nParenthood and look for advice on family planning, they are more often \nthan not encouraged and pushed toward abortion.\n  All around this bill, you see what is going on. It is a major change \nin policy--not to make abortion available but to make Americans pay for \nit and to promote it.\n  I, along with 34 of my colleagues in the Senate, signed and sent a \nletter to the majority leader regarding the troubling anti-life \npolicies in this omnibus bill. Collectively, we vowed to speak out to \nprotect the longstanding Federal funding limitations on abortion--a \nbelief that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for many years.\n  For this reason, as well as a number of other values issues that are \nirresponsibly addressed in this legislation, I support Senator McCain \nto raise a point of order against the omnibus under rule XXVIII of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I remind my colleagues that a vote against the McCain point of order \nis a vote to force American taxpayers to promote and pay for abortions. \nIt is plain and simple. I am sure there will be a lot of smoke and \nmirrors after my talk that will try to convince you that is not true. \nBut it is in the legislation and it will happen. We need to stop it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from South Carolina \nwon't leave. He would not yield for a question. I want to address his \nremarks, and some of them are not accurate. I don't want him to feel \nthat I am saying this outside of his presence.\n  I ask the Senator from South Carolina, while he has a few minutes, if \nhe could look in the bill and find the provision in the bill that kills \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. Please present it to me now, \nbecause it is not there. It is not there.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is a voucher program, created \nmore than 5 years ago. It was authorized through the Appropriations \nCommittee, not through formal authorization. As many as 1,700 students \nin DC ended up going to school and getting about $7,500 a year to help \npay the tuition for their schools. The program has diminished in size--\nI will concede that--even though I tried in a debate and negotiations \nto change that. It is down to about 1,300 students. It is funded in \nthis bill to the tune of $13.2 million.\n  So for the Senator from South Carolina to stand up and say, as he \ndid, that this program is killed, how does he explain the $13.2 million \nin the bill?\n  Mr. DeMINT. If the Senator will yield, the President has said he is \ngoing to end this program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does this bill end it?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will come to the floor to explain the technical aspects \nof why it is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am anxious to hear it. Explain all the technical \naspects you would like, but the fact is that $13.2 million goes to the \nDC Opportunity Scholarship Program. And the 1,300 students currently in \nthe program will be protected and will receive the tuition--a grant of \n$7,500 per student--in the coming year. That is a fact. To stand there \nand say otherwise is wrong.\n  Mr. DeMINT. You grandfather it in--if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion, does this bill fund the continuation of the program beyond \nthe 1,300 who are already in it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. It limits the program to 1,300.\n  Mr. DeMINT. It kills the program then.\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. If they are why----\n  Mr. DeMINT. But the program will not continue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming my time. What happens is this program next \nyear will be up going through the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. For the Senator from South Carolina to misrepresent \nthe contents of the bill is not fair.\n  Secondly, this idea of government funding abortion, let me say to the \nSenator from South Carolina, here are the basic pillars on this \ncontroversial issue in America. First, the Supreme Court has said \nabortion is a legal procedure in Roe v. Wade.\n  Second, Congress said, through the Hyde amendment, that we will spend \nno Federal funds for abortion except in cases involving the life of the \nmother, rape, and incest.\n  Third, Congress said any provider--hospital, doctor, medical \nprofessional--who in good conscience cannot participate in an abortion \nprocedure will never be compelled to do so.\n  This bill doesn't change that at all. In the Senator's State of South \nCarolina and in my State of Illinois, the leadership of the States--the \nGovernor and the legislature--decide what they will spend their State \nfunds on. That is done in States across the United States. Seventeen \nStates have decided they will have State funds pay for abortions beyond \nthe Hyde amendment. It is their State's decision, not our decision in \nDC. We, in this bill, give them the same authority that the State of \nSouth Carolina has and the State of Illinois has. No Federal funds from \nthe government, from Congress, can be spent on this exercise or use of \nfunds for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment. But if they choose to \nuse their own funds--just as South Carolina and Illinois make their \nchoice--then they make that decision.\n  Many in Congress have a secret yearning to be mayors of the District \nof Columbia. They want to be on the city council--not just in the \nSenate. They want to make every finite decision for the 500,000 or \n600,000 people who live here.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not at this time. When I finish, I will. The people who \nlive here in DC are taxpaying citizens. They pay their taxes and they \nvote for President. They send their young men and women off to war just \nlike every State in the Union. I think they are entitled to some of the \nbasic rights we enjoy in each of our own States.\n  I also want to say a word about the needle exchange program. I get \nnervous around needles. I don't like to run in to the doctor and say \ngive me another shot. So taking an issue like this on is not a lot of \nfun to start with. Why are we talking about needle exchange programs in \nthe District of Columbia? For one simple reason: The HIV/AIDS infection \nrate in the District of Columbia, Washington, DC, the Nation's Capital, \nis the highest in the Nation. We are living in a city with the highest \nincidence of needle-related HIV/AIDS and meningitis and other things \nthat follow. A needle exchange program says to those who are addicted: \nCome to a place where they can at least put you in touch with someone \nwho can counsel you and help move you off your addiction, and they will \ngive you a clean needle instead of a dirty one. I hate it, and I wish \nwe didn't need it. I don't like it. But in States across the Nation \nthey make the decision that this is the humane and thoughtful thing to \ndo to finally bring addicts in before they infect other people and \nspread this epidemic.\n  The doctors are the ones who tell us this works. States make the \ndecisions on it. I think the District of Columbia, facing the highest \nincidence of infection from HIV/AIDS, should also make that same \ndecision in terms of the money they spend. The provision that came over \nfrom the House of Representatives would have limited the distribution \nof this program to virtually a handful of places in DC. We said that DC \ncan make the rules about where the safe places are for these needle \nexchange programs.\n  As I said, I hate to even consider the prospect, but I cannot blind \nmyself to\n\n[[Page S12990]]\n\nthe reality that we have this high incidence of infection in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the medical professionals tell us this is \nworking. We are bringing addicts in. We are bringing them into a safer \nsituation. We are counseling some of them beyond their addiction. We \nare saving lives.\n  Am I supposed to turn my back on that and say, I am sorry, it offends \nme to think of this concept? It offends me to think of people dying \nneedlessly, and that is why we have this program.\n  Let me say a word about the DC Public Schools. I did not ask to take \nthis DC appropriations bill on. This is not something I ran for in the \nHouse of Representatives or the Senate. But it is part of my \nresponsibility. This is a great city with great problems, but there are \nsome shining lights on the horizon, and one of them is Michelle Rhee, \nchancellor of the public school system in the District of Columbia.\n  Michelle is an amazing story of a young woman attending Cornell \nUniversity. She decided, when she graduated, to sign up for one of the \ntop employers of college graduates in America today, Teach for America. \nShe went off and taught in Baltimore. She took a hopeless classroom \nsituation and in 2 years turned it around. Kids from the neighborhood \nhad test scores nobody dreamed of because of Michelle's skill. She \nworked in New York, bringing nontraditional teachers into the teaching \nsituation and then was asked to be chancellor here.\n  She is working on an overall reform for the DC Public Schools, which \nI endorse. It is a reform which will move us toward pay for \nperformance, where those teachers who do a good job and improve test \nscores are rewarded. It is a voluntary program for teachers. The \nresults are starting to show. This week in the District of Columbia, \nthey reported math scores that showed dramatic improvements compared to \ncities around the Nation.\n  She has another responsibility: while 45,000 kids are in the public \nschools of DC, 28,000 are enrolled in public, but independent, charter \nschools. The charter schools have to match the performance of the \npublic schools or improve upon them. It is the same for the voucher \nschools, the DC opportunity scholarships.\n  The Senator from South Carolina stands before us to say I eliminate \nthe program. Where does that $13.2 million go? It goes to the program, \nthe DC opportunity scholarships. I did change the program. I changed \nthe program because I failed initially when I offered amendments.\n  Here are some of the changes I made, and you be the judge as to \nwhether these are unreasonable changes.\n  I said for the voucher schools--half of them are Catholic schools--I \nsaid for the voucher schools, every teacher in basic core subjects has \nto have a college degree. How about that for a radical idea, a teacher \nwith a college degree? It is now required. It was not before.\n  Second, the buildings they teach in--these DC voucher schools have to \npass the fire safety code. Is that a radical idea killing the program? \nIf it means closing a school that is dangerous, sure, I would close \nthat school in a second before I would send my child or grandchild \nthere.\n  Third, we said, if you attend a DC voucher school, the students there \nhave to take the same tests as the DC Public Schools so we can compare \nhow you are doing. If you take a different test, you have different \nresults. We are never going to have a true comparison.\n  I also added in here, at the suggestion of Senator Lamar Alexander of \nTennessee, a former Secretary of Education, that each of the DC voucher \nschools either has to be accredited or seeking accreditation. I don't \nthink that is radical. I don't think it closes a program.\n  The final thing I say is, the people who administer this program have \nto actually physically visit the school at least twice a year. We had a \nhearing where the administrator of the program was shown pictures of \nsome of these DC voucher schools and, frankly, he said: We have not \nbeen there. Maybe once a year we get by. It has to be more than that. \nWe have to make sure these schools are functioning and operating. We \nare sending millions of Federal dollars into them. We expect it at \npublic schools, we expect it at charter schools. Should we not ask the \nsame of the DC voucher schools?\n  I say this, at least those in the Archdiocese of Washington agreed to \nthese things and have said: For our Catholic schools, we are ready to \nmeet these standards and tests. My hat is off to them. It is a \nchallenge, I am sure, but it is one I think they will meet. I want them \nto continue to do that.\n  I did try to expand this program in one aspect in the course of our \nnegotiations, with Senator Collins' assistance, so siblings would be \nallowed to attend this program. I think it would be helpful. We were \nnot successful. There are those opposed to this altogether.\n  I say the Senator from South Carolina has mischaracterized the DC \nvoucher program. He has not fully explained that we have not changed \nthe Hyde amendment, which prohibits Federal funds for abortion \npurposes, other than strict narrow categories. He went on to say \nsomething about the needle exchange program, which does not reflect the \nreality and the gravity of the health crisis facing the District of \nColumbia.\n  This is not a radical bill. This is a bill which I think is in the \nmainstream of America. It is a bill consistent with the same laws that \napply in his State of South Carolina and my State of Illinois and most \nother States across the Nation.\n  I wish we were not in this paternalistic position in relation to the \nDistrict of Columbia. I would rather this city had home rule, had its \nown Members of Congress, could make its own decisions. That is my goal. \nI would like to see that happen. In the meantime, I think we should \ntreat the people who live here fairly, give them a chance to deal with \ntheir significant problems, acknowledge success, as we just reported in \nthe public schools, and try to help them where we can.\n  This is, in fact, a great city and the capital of a great nation. I \nthink the mayor does a good job.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 8 minutes 26 \nseconds. The Democrats have 7 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a new report on Senator \nReid's health care reform bill. This kind of fits in with the \nappropriations that deal with Health and Human Services that is over 2 \nmonths past due.\n  Last night, we received a new analysis of the Reid bill we have been \ndiscussing about 11 days straight, performed by the Center for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services--that is CMS--which is under the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. The chief actuary, Rick Foster--this is the \nguy in charge of all this. He is the chief actuary. This is not \nsomebody outside the system. This is the guy who has to answer for all \nthis. He serves as the independent technical adviser to the \nadministration and Congress on estimating the true costs of health care \nreform. Some of the findings in this report directly contradict some of \nthe claims we heard this week about the Reid bill.\n  For a week now, we have heard how the Reid bill will help slow \nspending growth and reduce how much we as a nation spend on health \ncare. Mr. Foster's analysis shows that statement is false.\n  According to this report, national health expenditures will actually \nincrease by seven-tenths of 1 percent over the next 10 years. That is \nseven-tenths of 1 percent if we did nothing different. Despite promises \nthat the bill would reduce health care spending growth, this report \nshows the Reid bill actually bends the health care cost curve upward.\n  We have also heard, over the past week, how this bill will reduce \nhealth insurance premiums. Again, the administration's own chief \nactuary says this is false. The new report describes how the fees for \ndrugs, devices, and insurance plans in the Reid bill will increase \nhealth insurance premiums, increasing national health expenditures by \napproximately $11 billion per year.\n  We have also heard how the Reid bill will reduce the deficit, extend \nthe solvency of the Medicare trust fund, and reduce beneficiary \npremiums. According to the Foster report, these claims are all \nconditioned on the continued application of the productivity payment \ncuts in the bill which the actuary found were unlikely to be \nsustainable\n\n[[Page S12991]]\n\non a permanent annual basis. If these cuts cannot be sustained, one of \ntwo things will happen. Either this bill will dramatically increase the \ndeficit or beneficiaries will not be able to continue to see their \ncurrent doctors and other health care providers.\n  In reviewing the $464 billion in Medicare cuts in the Reid bill, the \nFoster report found these cuts would result in providers finding it \ndifficult to remain profitable.\n  The report went on to note that absent legislative intervention, \nthese providers might end their participation in the Medicare Program. \nIn addition, if enacted, the report found that the cuts would result in \nroughly 20 percent of all Part A providers--that is hospitals, nursing \nhomes, et cetera--becoming unprofitable within the next 10 years as a \nresult of these cuts.\n  As a former small business owner myself, I understand the impact this \nwill have on doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. In \nrural areas, such as my State, these providers will go out of business \nor have to refuse to take any more Medicare patients.\n  The CMS actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill could \njeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. He said the Reid \nbill is especially likely to result in providers being unwilling to \ntreat Medicare and Medicaid patients. That is what we have been saying \nfor about 11 days.\n  The Reid bill also forces 18 million people into the Medicaid \nProgram. The Foster report concluded this will mean a significant \nportion of the increased demand for Medicaid services will be difficult \nto meet. These are not the claims made by insurance companies or anyone \nwho might have a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. These \ncome directly from the administration's own independent actuary.\n  In light of this report, why are the sponsors of this bill continuing \nto argue for a $2.5 trillion bill of new programs which will increase \nhealth care spending, drive up premiums, and threaten the health care \nof Medicare beneficiaries?\n  We can do better. We need to start over and develop a bipartisan bill \nthat will address the real concerns of American people--develop a \nbipartisan bill. They cannot just exclude one side because there is a \nmajority that won the election and gets to write the bills. We get \ntired of hearing that told to us. Where is your comparable bill? We are \nnot trying to have a comparable bill, we are trying to have input into \nthe current bill or the current bills: Sit down, talk about the \nprinciples, find the actual things that fit into those principles, \ndevelop the details, and have a bill that goes step by step so we get \nthe confidence of the American people. The step we ought to start with \nis Medicare. That is why I present this report from the actuary of CMS, \nwhich is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, which is \nassigned most of the job of coming up with the details of the bill we \nhave before us. That means actual elected officials would not be doing \nit. But this CMS actuary says everything that has been said by that \nside of the aisle is false unless there is some phony accounting that \ngoes into it.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that we divide the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Division F of this omnibus conference \nagreement provides funding for the State Department, Foreign \nOperations, and related programs.\n  I want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator \nGregg, and his very capable staff, Paul Grove and Michele Wymer, for \nonce again working with me and my staff in a bipartisan manner to \nproduce this conference agreement.\n  I also want to thank Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay \nGranger, and their staffs, for working so cooperatively with us \nthroughout this process.\n  The fiscal year 2010 State Foreign Operations conference agreement \nprovides $48.8 billion in discretionary funding, a $3.3 billion \ndecrease from the President's budget request of $52 billion.\n  The bill is $1.2 billion below the fiscal year 2009 level, including \nsupplemental funds. This is an important point that needs to be \nunderstood by all Senators, because yesterday a Senator on the other \nside of the aisle criticized this bill for being 31 percent above \nfiscal year 2009.\n  That is misleading, because it does not account for the billions of \ndollars in fiscal year 2009 ``emergency'' supplemental funding that was \nthe standard way of doing business under the previous administration.\n  To ignore those costs to American taxpayers is disingenuous. \nPresident Obama has made clear that he intends to fund these programs \non budget, not through supplemental gimmicks. That is what the Congress \nurged him to do, and now he is being criticized for doing so.\n  If you compare apples to apples, this bill provides $1.2 billion less \nspending than in fiscal year 2009.\n  Some Republican Senators have made speeches against this omnibus \npackage on account of earmarks they don't like, even though some of \nthem requested their own earmarks. In fact, earmarks comprise a tiny \nfraction of the total package.\n  Like past years, the State-Foreign Operations conference agreement \ndoes not contain any earmarks as defined by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  We do fund many programs that are priorities of Democrats and \nRepublicans, including assistance for countries like Afghanistan, \nPakistan and Iraq, and longstanding allies like Israel, Egypt, and \nJordan.\n  In addition, the conference agreement provides $5.7 billion to combat \nHIV/AIDS, including $750 million for the Global Fund. Funds are \nprovided to combat other diseases, like malaria, tuberculosis, and \nneglected tropical diseases,\n  The agreement provides $1.2 billion for climate change and \nenvironment programs, including for clean energy programs and to \nprotect forests.\n  The agreement provides $1.2 billion for agriculture and food security \nprograms, with authority to provide additional funds.\n  There are provisions dealing with corruption and human rights, \nfunding for international organizations like the United Nations, NATO \nand the International Atomic Energy Agency, and to promote democracy, \neconomic development, and the rule of law from Central America to \nCentral Asia.\n  The conference agreement provides the funds to support our embassies \nand diplomats around the world, public diplomacy and broadcasting \nprograms, the Peace Corps, and many other programs that promote United \nStates interests.\n  I don't support everything in this omnibus package any more than \nanyone else does. I had hoped, as I know did Chairman Inouye and Vice \nChairman Cochran, that we could have brought each of the bills in this \nomnibus, including the State-Foreign Operations bill, to the Senate \nfloor individually.\n  But a handful of Senators on the other side have made clear that they \nwill do whatever is procedurally possible to slow down or prevent \nconsideration of these bills.\n  Despite that, I can say that the State Foreign Operations conference \nagreement was negotiated with the full participation of both House and \nSenate chairmen and ranking members. It was in every sense a \ncollaborative process.\n  It is a balanced agreement and should be supported by every Senator \nwho cares about U.S. security and the security of our allies and \nfriends around the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive all applicable sections of\n\n[[Page S12992]]\n\nrule XXVIII. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), \nthe Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), and the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Burr).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. \nBunning) would have voted ``Nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 372 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Chambliss\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Coburn\n     Hutchison\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas are 60, the nays are 36. Three-fifths \nof the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, \nthe motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that no further points of order be \nin order during the pendency of H.R. 3288.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the next vote will be tomorrow \nmorning at 9:30. We will be happy to come in at 8:30, but I ask \nunanimous consent if we could have that vote at 9:30. We will come in \nat 9, if that is OK with everybody.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the disposition of the pending Dorgan amendment, \ncould we have some idea about that?\n  Mr. REID. I think my friend from Arizona asks a very pertinent \nquestion. We offered a consent request last evening--and I did again \ntoday--that we would have the votes now before the Senate in sequential \norder. I offered a unanimous consent request to do that. We are happy \nto do that. I announced there would be no more votes today. On Monday \nwhen we come in, we will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend the majority leader, the problem \nwith that is we have been going back and forth with an amendment on \neach side, and the agreement that you have proffered, if I understand \nit correctly, basically had two Democratic side-by-sides. Am I not \ncorrect in my understanding of that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, but on all amendments that we have had up to this \npoint, every side, Democrats or Republicans, has had the opportunity to \ndo side-by-sides if they wanted to. In the weeks we have worked on \nthis, what has transpired here, I am quite sure, has happened before. \nSimply stated, we have been requested by Republicans to have some \nvotes, and we have agreed to have the votes. I explained in some detail \nlast evening why we can't do it on a piecemeal basis. Procedurally, it \nputs us into a quagmire. Let's clear the deck. There will be other \namendments after that we would certainly try to have each side offer.\n  But I agree with the Senator from Arizona, we should get rid of the \ndrug reimportation amendment one way or the other, in addition to the \nmotion offered by Senator Crapo.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My point was, typically a side-by-side is offered one \non each side. On the drug reimportation issue, you have basically two \nvotes, both generated on the Democratic side, which created some \nconfusion. But we will have to continue to talk about this and see if \nwe can work our way through it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wanted to ask the minority leader--some \nof us are a little bit perplexed. I know the Senate has its rules, and \nwe try to work through them. But we also at this time of year often try \nto accommodate families and schedules and so forth. I am curious as to \nwhether the minority leader might not consent to allowing us or why it \nis that we couldn't, since Senators are here today, schedule the vote \nand agree to have the vote on the 60-vote margin today rather than \ntomorrow morning, requiring all staff and everybody in the Senate to \ncome in on a Saturday.\n  Mr. REID. If I could make a comment before my friend the Republican \nleader comments, everyone should understand--this should make it easier \nfor everybody--I am going to be home all weekend in Washington. I won't \nbe traveling the country doing any fundraisers that people seem to be \nafraid of.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The answer to it is that our good friend the majority \nleader told us on November 30 we would be here the next two weekends. \nHe said again this past Monday we would be here this weekend. I assumed \nand I know he certainly meant what he said. Our Members are here and \nready to work. We wish to work on health care amendments. But as a \nresult of the privileged status of the conference report that is before \nus, we have had that displaced. But I think everybody was on full \nnotice as to what the work schedule was going to be for last weekend \nand this weekend.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could respond, I don't mean to assert \nmyself in any way that is inappropriate with respect to the leader, but \nwe all know that in the workings of the Senate, what we are doing is \nboth complicated and serious and critical to the country.\n  We are waiting for CBO to appropriately, consistently--as a member of \nthe Finance Committee, we adhered to a very strict notion that we would \ntry to find the precise modeling and cost of whatever it was we might \ndo. It is entirely appropriate, to have a proper debate or discussion, \nthat we know exactly what the cost is of any particular proposal. That \nis what we are waiting for. So the majority leader is appropriately \ntrying to move another piece of legislation that is ripe, that is \nimportant to the country. This is just a question of courtesy to \nSenators and to their families and to the staff of the Senate who have \nbeen working extraordinarily hard. The question is simply, why, as a \nmatter of convenience, we couldn't schedule a vote for today instead of \nbeing scheduled for tomorrow. We could do that by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. If I could have the Record reflect, the Republican leader \nis right. I said we would be in session the next several weekends. But \nif you go back and look at the Record, how many times have I said we \nwould be in session over the weekend and, interestingly enough, around \nhere, magic things happen on Thursdays and Fridays. I have had every \nintention, as I have every time I have said it, that we should be in on \na weekend, and usually we are able to work something out. We haven't \nbeen able to this time. I accept that. I am not complaining. But \ncertainly the question of my friend from Massachusetts is a pertinent \none. Senators are here now. Maybe we could have the vote early. But it \nis set statutorily. My unanimous consent request was, and I am not sure \nit was responded to, that we could have that vote at 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning without having the mandatory 1-hour beforehand.\n  I heard no objection to that. We will just come in at 8:30. We will \ncome in at 8:30 tomorrow morning and have a 9:30 vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote\n\n[[Page S12993]]\n\nscheduled for tomorrow morning be held instead today at some convenient \ntime within the next hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--we have been told by the majority that the single most \nimportant thing we could do would be to work on weekends and try to \npass this health care bill which, according to the CNN poll that came \nout last night, the American people oppose 61 to 36, before Christmas. \nWe are here. We are prepared to work. We would like to get back on the \nhealth care bill as rapidly as possible and vote on amendments to the \nbill. It either is or it isn't important enough for us to be here \nbefore Christmas. My Members are not expecting to take a break. We have \nbeen told by the majority all year long this is important. First we had \nto get it done before August. Then we had to get it done before \nThanksgiving. Now we have to get it done before Christmas. We are here, \nready to work.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the Senator from Arkansas seeking recognition?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I still have the floor. I was just asking a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes and then that the Senator from Arkansas be \nrecognized, and then we will come back to this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I have \nno intention of objecting--I would like to also propound a unanimous \nconsent request that after the Senator from Arkansas has spoken and \nafter the Senator from New Hampshire has spoken, Senator Collins, I, \nand Senator Bayh be recognized for up to 30 minutes for a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Oregon?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would ask \nmy friend from Oregon if he would allow this modification to his \nunanimous consent request. It would be as follows: consent that Senator \nLincoln be recognized and that she be allowed to speak for up to 10 \nminutes; that Senator Gregg be recognized for up to 10 minutes; and \nthen that Senators Wyden, Collins, and Bayh be permitted to engage in a \ncolloquy for up to 30 minutes; that following the conclusion of that 30 \nminutes, Senator Alexander or his designee be recognized for up to 30 \nminutes to engage in a colloquy with other members of the Republican \ncaucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I understand \nthat is in addition to Senator Wyden's request, which is that I should \nbegin with my first 10 minutes, then we would go to the Senator from \nArkansas, then we would go to Senator Wyden, and then we would go to \nthe outline as represented by the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If that is OK with the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak a little bit about this health care \nbill. I know there has been a lot of discussion of it already today, \nbut I think it is important--very important--that as this health care \nbill comes forward, we know what it says.\n  Unfortunately, we received this 2,074-page health care bill about 8 \ndays ago, after it had been worked on for 8 weeks in camera, behind \nclosed doors by the Democratic leadership. We have only had 8 days to \nlook at it. We now hear there is going to be a massive revision of it--\na massive revision--that is going to involve potentially expanding \nMedicare to people who are aged 55.\n  Medicare is already broke, by the way. It is broke. It has a $38 \ntrillion unfunded liability. And we are going to add another 10 million \npeople, maybe, into Medicare? That makes no sense at all.\n  But what I think is important is that what we know so far has been \nreviewed by a lot of different people, but some of them have not been \nall that objective. So there was a request made to CMS, which is an arm \nof the administration--therefore, one would presume it was not \nnecessarily biased toward the Republican side of the aisle; in fact, \nmaybe just the opposite; I do not think it is biased at all, hopefully; \nbut if there was bias here, it certainly would not be Republican--to \nreview the proposal of Senator Reid.\n  Let me read to you what the CMS conclusion is--some of them--on the \nReid bill.\n  According to the CMS Actuary: ``The Reid bill increases National \nHealth Expenditures'' by $234 billion during the period 2010 to 2019. \nWhy is this important? Well, it is pretty darn important because we had \nrepresentations that the purpose of this health care reform was to \ndecrease, to move down, health care costs. Now we find this bill, as \nscored by the CMS Actuary, significantly increases the national health \ncare expenditures.\n  Secondly, they concluded that ``the Reid bill still leaves an \nestimated 24 million people . . . uninsured.'' Twenty-four million \npeople--that is almost half of the uninsured today. Why is that \nimportant? We were told the purpose of this health reform exercise was \nto, one, insure everybody; two, bend the health care costs down; and \nthree, make sure that if you have your own health care that you like, \nyou do not lose it. Well, on two counts, it appears the Reid bill \nclearly fails that test and gets an F--on the issue of bending health \ncare costs down and on the issue of insuring everyone, according to \nCMS, an independent group.\n  Third, it says:\n\n       The new fees for drugs, devices, and insurance plans in the \n     Reid bill will increase--\n\n  Increase--\n\n     prices and health insurance premium costs for customers. This \n     will increase national health [care] expenditures by \n     approximately $11 billion per year.\n\n  So instead of bringing health premiums down, as was represented by \nthe President--he said it was going to go down by $2,100 per family--\nyour health care premiums are going to go up. What happens when health \ncare premiums go up? People stop giving you health care insurance \nbecause they cannot afford it. Employers cannot afford it. So on the \nthird issue, will you lose your health insurance if you like it, yes, \nyou will. Yes, you will because the price of your health insurance is \ngoing to go up under the Reid bill.\n  There are a couple other points they make which are fairly important \nhere:\n\n       The actuary's analysis shows that claims that the Reid bill \n     extends the solvency are shaky.\n\n  They are ``shaky''--the claims that it extends the Medicare trust \nfund solvency.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       Moreover, claims that the Reid bill extends the Medicare HI \n     Trust Fund and reduces beneficiary premiums are conditioned \n     on the continued application of the productivity payment \n     adjustments in the bill, which the actuary found were \n     unlikely--\n\n  That is their concept, ``unlikely''--\n\n     to be sustainable on a permanent annual basis. . . .\n\n  So the idea that this bill somehow assists Medicare--by the way, this \nbill cuts Medicare by $\\1/2\\ trillion, almost, in the first 10 years. \nWhen it is fully implemented, it cuts Medicare by $1 trillion in a 10-\nyear timeframe, and over the next 20 years, it cuts Medicare by $3 \ntrillion. The idea that this is going to somehow help Medicare is \nfraudulent on its face, according to the Actuary. ``Fraudulent on its \nface'' is my term. It is ``unlikely'' to accomplish that.\n  Then it goes into this issue of the CLASS Act, which we have heard so \nmuch puffery about how wonderful this CLASS Act is, which is basically \nanother Ponzi scheme, as it was described by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, not myself. The Actuary said:\n\n       The Reid bill creates a new long term insurance program \n     (CLASS Act) that the CMS actuaries found faces ``a very \n     serious risk''--\n\n\n[[Page S12994]]\n\n\n  This is their term, ``a very serious risk''--\n\n     of becoming unsustainable as a result of adverse selection by \n     participants. . . .\n\n  In other words, only people who are probably going to need long-term \ncare are going to opt into this program. So this plan will basically \nnot be able to pay the costs of the benefits it is proposing because \nthey will not have funds coming in to support the people who need it \nbecause there will be no larger insurance pool of healthy people who \nare using the program. Only the people who need the program will use \nit. So the CLASS Act representations we have heard around here have \nbeen debunked by this CMS report.\n  This is not our side saying these things. It is not our side saying \nthat the cost of this bill will drive up the cost of national health \ncare. It is not our side saying there are 24 million people left \nuninsured when this is fully implemented. It is not our side saying \npremiums will go up when this bill is fully implemented. It is not our \nside saying the CLASS Act will be a seriously unsustainable program. It \nis not our side saying Medicare will not be benefited by this program. \nIn fact, it will be negatively impacted by this program. It is CMS \nsaying that, an independent Actuary--not that independent; an arm of \nthe administration. The administration's Actuary is saying it, not our \nside. So I think it is legitimate to have some serious concerns about \nthis bill.\n\n  The CMS report goes on and says:\n\n       The CMS actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill \n     could jeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care.\n\n  Now, that is serious. That is serious.\n  It found that roughly 20 percent of all Part A providers--hospitals--\nwould become unprofitable--20 percent of all Part A providers, such as \nhospitals, would become unprofitable within the next 10 years as a \nresult of the proposals in the Reid bill.\n  Well, I know ``profits'' is a bad word on the other side of the \naisle, but the simple fact is, if you do not have profit in a hospital, \nthe odds are pretty good you are going to go out of business. You are \ngoing to go out of business because you cannot pay the costs of \noperating that hospital. Even nonprofits have some sort of cushion in \norder to make it through. Now we have the CMS Actuary telling us that \n20 percent of the hospitals in this country are going to go into a \nnegative cashflow and are going to become unprofitable as a result of \nwhat this bill proposes.\n  Well, colleagues, Senators, why would we vote for a bill which \nincreases the cost of health care for the country and does not bend the \nhealth care cost down, which leaves half the people in this country who \nare uninsured still uninsured, which raises the premium costs for \nAmericans, which puts the Medicare system at risk, which will put \nhundreds of providers at risk, hospitals, and which creates a brandnew \nentitlement which is not sustainable? And those conclusions are come to \nby the CMS, the independent CMS Actuary. Why would we want to put that \ntype of program in place? Of course, we should not.\n  Listen, this 2,074 pages of bill--it was put together haphazardly. It \nwas just sheets of paper stuck together. It ends up costing us $2.5 \ntrillion overall. Every page costs us about $1 billion. Obviously, it \nwas not well thought out because the CMS Actuary looked at it and said \nit is not well thought out. It does not accomplish its goals.\n  So rather than moving forward with the bill, why don't we just step \nback and start doing things we know are going to work? Why don't we \nstart doing a few things around here we know are going to work?\n  I know the Senator from Oregon is on the floor, and he happens to be \nthe sponsor of a bill which actually would make some progress in the \narea. Why don't we--I would be willing to step back and start from his \nbill because his bill at least makes sense. If it were scored by the \nCMS Actuary, it would not come out like this. They would not be saying \nthat people would be uninsured, that the price of health care was going \nto go up and that Medicare was going to go into a disastrous strait and \ncreate an unsustainable entitlement.\n  So we have ideas around here that do work or are fairly close or at \nleast have the foundation to work. Why don't we use those rather than \nthis bill? That is my only point. This bill is ill thought out, and \nthat is not my conclusion, that is the only conclusion you can come to \nwhen you look at the CMS Actuary's evaluation of it.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Presiding Officer, \nand I especially appreciate the courtesies of the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, thank you. And I appreciate the \ncourtesies of my colleague from Oregon for allowing me to speak now.\n  I rise today to talk a little bit about the health care concerns, \nparticularly, in our small businesses. I first wish to compliment and \nthank my colleagues, particularly Senator Landrieu, who is chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee, as well as Senator Snowe, with whom I \nhave worked for years on the plight of the small businesses in our \nStates and across the country--their need to be able to really access \nthe kinds of competition and choice that allow them to make good \ndecisions and spend their health care dollars more wisely and being \nable to do what they all want to do in small business, and that is to \nbe able to cover their employees, to make sure their employees and \ntheir employees' families are covered with reasonable and meaningful \nhealth insurance that actually covers what they need but is at an \naffordable price. So I thank those women, as well as Senator Stabenow, \nwho I know has also been working on these issues.\n  But I really come to the floor today to highlight the challenges \nArkansas small business owners face in providing quality, affordable \nhealth care for themselves, their families, and their employees under \nthe current system and to look at what we can do to improve what their \nchallenges are, what it is they face.\n  Small businesses are our No. 1 source of jobs in Arkansas, and they \nare truly the economic engines of our local economies, but they are \nalso the economic engines of our national economy, not to mention \nlearning laboratories for great ideas that will allow us in this great \nNation to be truly competitive in the 21st century.\n  Arkansas's nearly 250,000 small business and self-employed \nindividuals make significant contributions to our State's economy and \ngenerated $7.2 billion in 2008. Small employers account for 97 percent \nof the employers in our State, and I would daresay nationally it is \nsomewhere at that same level.\n  Addressing the needs of small businesses is absolutely critical to \nany health insurance reform legislation we bring forward.\n  As I mentioned before, Senator Snowe and I have worked together for \nmany years to try to address these concerns, talking with small \nbusinesses and their advocacy groups to try to figure out what it is we \ncan provide them, just as we provide ourselves as Federal employees the \nability to access health insurance that has been negotiated, where \npeople have come together, pooled the resources of all of our risks as \nFederal employees--all 8 million of us--to really get a better deal in \nthe marketplace.\n  We want to be able to allow small businesses to do the same, to come \ntogether nationwide, pool themselves in their State exchanges, and be \nable to really take advantage of sharing their assets and their risks \nin the health insurance marketplace and get the best possible product \nthey can.\n  Those small businesses that are able to afford health care coverage \nfor their employees in today's world continue to experience \nskyrocketing costs, jeopardizing our States' and our Nation's \ncompetitive edge, both among themselves nationwide domestically but \nalso internationally. We find that our small businesses are finding \nthemselves more and more in the situation of having to be competitive \nglobally to be able to do the business they do and to create the jobs \nthey need to create.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with a radio station owner from Wynne, AR, in \nCross County, who said high costs have threatened his ability to be \nable to provide coverage for his employees. Or, worse, skyrocketing \ncosts are forcing business owners to consider giving up their \nbusinesses altogether, like the small business owner from Malvern, AR, \nwho wrote me that he was giving up his 17-year-old business because he \ncan no longer afford his rising health care insurance premiums. His \nwife and\n\n[[Page S12995]]\n\nhis daughter each have a preexisting medical condition, and he feels \npressured to find a new job that provides affordable employer-sponsored \ncoverage for his family.\n\n  I heard from another small business owner in Mena who told me that at \nthe age of 65, he continued to keep himself on his own small business's \nhealth insurance plan in order to ensure that he could maintain \nproviding health insurance to his employees, many with whom he grew up. \nThey were friends of his from grade school or church and community \nservices and other places where he had built lifelong relationships, \nnot only as an employer and an employee but as part of a community. \nBeing able to maintain providing that to them was so critical to him \nthat he was willing to ante up.\n  I have heard from small business owners from all across my State who \ndesperately want to offer health care coverage for their employees, but \nit is simply not cost productive. The fact is, so many people think \nsmall businesses just want to opt out, that they don't want to provide \nhealth insurance, but they do. They do because it is important to them \nas a part of that community to do something for their employees who \nalso happen to be their friends and neighbors. They also want to make \nsure their business is the best it can be, and in order to do that they \nhave to compete for those skilled workers. Getting the best workers \nmeans providing good benefits, with health care being at the top of \nthat list.\n  Another Arkansan asked me to please include the self-employed in my \nefforts to secure affordable health care. There are many small \nbusinesses with only one employee, and health care under this scenario \nis extremely expensive. They are put in an individual market where they \nare rated against themselves in many instances and not given the \nbenefit of what we enjoy as Federal employees; that is, pooling \nourselves together, adding our assets and our risks together so that we \ncan mitigate that risk among all 8 million Federal employees.\n  These are just a few of the stories I have heard from Arkansans, and \nthat is why in every Congress since 2004, I have introduced legislation \nto help small business owners afford health coverage for themselves, \ntheir employees, and their families. Several of my provisions are \nalready included in the health insurance reform bill currently before \nthe Senate, including the tax credit to help small businesses afford \ncoverage, and we want to improve upon that. Also included are insurance \nexchanges through which consumers can compare insurance plans side by \nside so that they will be able to choose the option that is best for \nthem, allowing their employees to see what is available to them and \nmaking sure that they are having access to all the options of the \nmarketplace. There are reforms that force insurance companies to change \nthe way they do business by limiting what an insurer can charge based \non age and by banning the practices of denying coverage based on \npreexisting conditions or increasing rates when customers all of a \nsudden get sick.\n  We look at our small businesses and, yes, there are a lot of young \nentrepreneurs, but a lot of our small businesses are those individuals \nin that category above 55. These are people who, unfortunately, are \nstarting to see chronic disease challenges in their life as they age. \nUnfortunately, they become an issue, or certainly their coverage \nbecomes an issue when we talk about preexisting conditions. So it is \ncritical that we make sure we change the way insurers do business as \nusual today and make sure they are playing fair with the small business \nentities out there.\n  Just one more of my efforts is something on which we worked with \nSenator Snowe and Senator Durbin, which is to allow that there would be \nnational private insurers, as there are today, but allowing them to \nsell multistate plans nationwide, to be able to sell their plans in all \n50 States. It would be with a strong Federal administrator who would be \nable to negotiate for quality and affordable coverage. Some of this has \nemerged as another potential part of the framework for national health \ninsurance reform that can help us achieve our goals of more choices and \nmore affordability for consumers, particularly those in the small \nbusiness marketplace.\n  So I wish to thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to share \nwith my colleagues and certainly those Americans out there who are the \ningenuity and the engine of our economy. I know my colleague from \nOregon has talked so much about choice and competition. It is so \nimportant, more important than ever in that small business marketplace \nand in that individual marketplace, as well as providing exchanges and \nthe ability for national insurers, private insurers to be able to \nprovide these types of products across all 50 States. Also, a \nmultistate plan gives our small businesses and our self-employed, our \nindividual marketplace, our independent contractors, such as our \nrealtors and others, the ability to have access to greater choice, \ngreater competition in that marketplace, and, therefore, a better \nproduct--greater, more meaningful coverage at a more reasonable cost, \nand that is what we want to see. More importantly, that is what our \nsmall businesses want to see.\n  So I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor to my \ncolleague from Oregon and my colleague from Indiana, and the Senator \nfrom Maine as well, whom I know will have a great addition to this \nconversation. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I wish to begin by complimenting my friend \nand colleague from Arkansas. We entered this body together, and she has \nconsistently advocated on behalf of small businesses, not only across \nArkansas but across the country. We both want to reform the health care \nsystem. We know this has a major impact on small businesses. They \ncreate most of the new jobs in our society. So if we care about job \ncreation, we need to care about how health insurance costs affect \nbusinesses. They are going up too fast, and Senator Lincoln has \nconsistently advocated for doing what we can to get those cost \nincreases down and, in fact, lower the burden on our small businesses. \nSo this is not only a health issue, it is a jobs issue. She has been a \nreal leader for many years.\n  So it is a privilege to work with the Senator on these important \nissues. Our class is doing well.\n  I also wish to say how much I am privileged to work with my friend \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, who has been one of the most innovative \nthinkers in the area of health reform. Once again, he is leading the \nway on an issue I am going to speak to for just a second.\n  I am happy to see my colleague from Maine is with us. It saddens me \nto say that, regrettably, this is one of the few examples of bipartisan \ncooperation where we have come together across the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans, working together to figure out how in a practical way we \ncan help solve the problem our country faces.\n  Here we have an issue of what to do about the 7 percent of Americans \nwho are the individual insurance market but are receiving no subsidies \nfrom the government. According to the CBO, they are at risk of having \ntheir premiums go up. That is not right, particularly at a time when \neven people who are making more than $88,000 very often are struggling. \nSo the question is, What can we do about it?\n  Senator Collins, Senator Wyden, and myself focused on these \nindividuals because we wanted to do what we could, in the words that my \ncolleague from Oregon emphasizes so often, to provide choice and \nencourage competition to improve both price and quality. That is what \nour amendments are all about.\n  I wish to read a very brief statement and then turn it over to my \ncolleagues.\n  When I go home to Indiana, the health care concern I hear the most \nabout from ordinary Hoosiers, particularly middle-class Hoosiers, is \nwhat are we going to do to make their coverage more affordable. Many \npeople in my State already have insurance, but they are struggling to \nkeep up with the skyrocketing increases and the cost of that care.\n  We began our health care debate and these deliberations in this body \nthis past spring. In mid-October, months into our debate, some of us \nwere struck by the fact that we had not answered the most basic \nquestion: How much is this going to cost, and what do we do to bring \nthose costs down? So I, along with some others, submitted in writing\n\n[[Page S12996]]\n\nthat question to the Congressional Budget Office. What will this do for \npeople in the small group markets such as small business owners, what \nwill this do for individuals in the large group markets who work for \nlarger employers, and what will it do for individuals who are out there \nstruggling on their own to provide health insurance for themselves and \nfor their loved ones?\n  When they released their report, I was pleased to see that the \ncurrent legislation before us would either contain or lower costs for \n93 percent of the American people. For 83 percent of those in small \ngroup and large group plans, it is about holding even or modestly \nlower. For the 17 percent in the individual marketplace, about 10 of \nthat 17 percent get subsidies sufficient to actually bring their prices \ndown, which leaves us with the 7 percent of those individuals in the \nindividual market who get no subsidies and may see serious cost \nincreases if nothing is done. The Wyden-Collins-Bayh amendments \naccomplish just that.\n\n  Our first amendment promotes more health choices for both employers \nand workers who would otherwise have few, if any, choices. It would \nhelp individuals who would be forced to buy their own insurance at \nhigher rates than they currently pay. It would give them the option to \npurchase low-cost plans that offer essential, basic coverage. It would \nensure that Congress does not mandate that anyone buy a more expensive \nplan than they currently have.\n  Our second amendment is a market-based reform that would pressure \ninsurance companies economically to lower premiums and penalize them if \nthey try to raise rates before the new exchanges are fully up and \nrunning. It would immediately adjust the insurer fee in the bill to \ngive insurance companies a strong financial incentive to keep premiums \ndown. It would do this by making it economically smart for companies to \nhold the line on overhead and executive salaries and to root out \nadministrative inefficiencies.\n  Our third amendment would offer vouchers to give consumers who have \nhealth insurance but aren't satisfied with it access to more choices to \nmeet their health care needs. It would offer vouchers that individuals \ncould use to shop in the new insurance exchanges we are creating. Those \nwho prefer their current plan to what is offered in the exchange could \nreturn the voucher and keep their existing coverage.\n  If we pass these amendments, we can credibly tell the American people \nthat our long efforts will have addressed rising health insurance \npremium costs for everyone, and that is at the heart of this effort we \nhave undertaken.\n  In closing, I will say that Americans are not looking for a \nDemocratic solution or a Republican solution to our health care \nchallenge. They are looking for us to come together to pass a reform \nbill that works in practical terms in their daily lives. More choices, \npremium cost increases under control, eliminating preexisting \nconditions--those are the things that will help middle-class families \nin my State and others across the country.\n  I am proud that the Wyden-Collins-Bayh affordability package will \nrepresent one of the few bipartisan efforts in this body. As I was \nsaying, I regret the fact that it is one of the few, but I am proud we \nhave come together to work to address this important challenge. I hope \nmy colleagues will agree that we have a responsibility to restrain \npremium costs for all American families by encouraging consumer choice \nand robust competition in the private marketplace. I hope we will pass \nthese amendments because they accomplish exactly that.\n  Madam President, thank you for your patience. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I wish to begin my part of this colloquy \nwith Senator Bayh and Senator Collins by thanking my colleague from \nIndiana. I also thank my colleague from Maine because both senators \nhave said from the very beginning of this discussion that the bottom \nline for millions of working families, for single moms, for folks who \nare walking on an economic tightrope across the country, they are going \nto see this issue through the prism of what it means for them in terms \nof their premiums and their costs.\n  Over these many months, Senator Bayh and Senator Collins and I have \nbeen toiling to put together some bipartisan ideas. We have filed these \nideas as a package of amendments, submitted them to the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, and we just wanted to take a few minutes today to talk \nin particular about why it is so essential that there be a bipartisan \neffort put together for additional steps to contain costs.\n  Senator Bayh is absolutely right in describing the Congressional \nBudget Office analysis. Certainly, many people were fearful the CBO \nreport would come out and say that on day one after enactment premiums \nwould rise into the stratosphere as a result of the legislation. \nFortunately, that was not the case in the report for most people.\n  We also believe there is a whole lot more that can be done. So we \nhave said, Democrats and Republicans are going to try to prosecute that \ncase. What it comes down to is ensuring that, in the text of this \nlegislation, there is more choice and more competition.\n  The reality is, ever since the 1940s, the days of the wage and price \ncontrol decisions that have done so much to shape today's health care \nsystem, most Americans have not had real choice in the health care \nmarketplace and have not been able to enjoy the fruits of a competitive \nsystem. Most Americans have little or no choice. Most Americans don't \nget a chance to benefit when they shop wisely.\n  As Senator Bayh noted--and as Senator Collins and I have noted over \nthe last few days--that is something we ought to change. It is \ncertainly not a partisan idea. Senator Reid and Senator Baucus, to \ntheir credit, have agreed with me that there ought to be more choice \nfor those folks who have what, in effect, are hardship exemptions under \nthis legislation. There are people, for example, who spend more than 8 \npercent of their income on health who aren't eligible for subsidies, \nwho have these hardship exemptions; and Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, \nand I have agreed they ought to be able to take any help they are \ngetting from their employer in the form of a voucher and go into the \nmarketplace. These people should be able to put into their pockets any \nsavings that come about because they have shopped wisely.\n  But as Senator Bayh has noted, we have an opportunity to go further. \nIf an employer in the exchange decides, on a voluntary basis, that \ntheir workers should have a choice, under the proposal advanced by the \nSenator from Indiana, the Senator from Maine, and myself, they would be \nable to do it.\n  It is the voluntary nature of our idea that Senator Bayh has \noutlined, an approach that gives more options to both employers and \nemployees, that caused our proposal to win an endorsement from the \nNational Federation of Independent Business.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed in the Record \nthat letter from the National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                                December 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Wyden and Collins: On behalf of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's \n     leading small business association, we are writing in support \n     of the Wyden-Collins amendment (Optional Free Choice \n     Voucher--amendment #3117), which provides vouchers as a new \n     voluntary option for employers and employees to purchase \n     health insurance.\n       For small business, the goal of healthcare reform is to \n     lower costs, increase choices and provide real competition \n     for private insurance. The Wyden-Collins amendment achieves \n     what we know are clear bipartisan goals in healthcare \n     reform--expanding access to coverage, increasing consumer \n     choice and improving portability.\n       Free choice vouchers recognize that the employer-employee \n     relationship in America has changed considerably since \n     employer-sponsored insurance began in the 1940s. They give \n     employees tax- advantaged resources to tailor healthcare \n     choices and purchases to their own preferences and needs. \n     Because the employees will be able to choose from more \n     policies, they will be more invested in their healthcare \n     decisions. They will be better\n\n[[Page S12997]]\n\n     consumers because they will be more aware of costs, and this \n     will help ``bend the cost curve.''\n       In today's diverse and highly mobile workforce, people \n     change jobs every few years. Improving portability will \n     reduce the ``job lock'' that currently stifles \n     entrepreneurship. Since free choice vouchers would help make \n     health insurance portable, employees will not be locked into \n     jobs when better opportunities come along.\n       This amendment addresses the shortcomings of the existing \n     employer-based system for small businesses. In the current \n     system, small employers often have few options beyond ``take \n     it or leave it.'' This new and voluntary option will \n     encourage employers to provide insurance coverage for \n     employees. It is the exact opposite of employer mandates that \n     harm struggling businesses, discourage startups and kill \n     jobs.\n       While some may claim this amendment weakens employer-\n     sponsored health insurance, NFIB disagrees. The current \n     system works better for larger firms who can operate more \n     efficiently and effectively, and this inequity must be \n     addressed. Simply put, what works for Wall Street does not \n     work for Main Street. The Wyden-Collins amendment works to \n     address this by making coverage more affordable for many of \n     the nation's job creators.\n       NFIB appreciates your commitment to healthcare reform and \n     your continuous efforts to find solutions that work for small \n     business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will make one last comment and then we \nwill be happy to have our colleague from Maine join us in this \nbipartisan colloquy.\n  As we go forward with this legislation, I hope we will do more to \nlook at the exchanges, which are the new marketplace for American \nhealth care. We haven't had that kind of approach since decades ago \nwhen we had a discussion about a system that, for all practical \npurposes, tethered people to one choice that was a judgment by an \nemployer and insurance company. I wish to make sure, in the days ahead, \nthat as many people as possible can keep exactly what they have today. \nThat is something the President feels strongly about. That is something \nevery Member of the Senate feels strongly about. I also want employers \nand employees to be able to say they are going to have a broader range \nof choices than they do now.\n  I think that can be done in a way that does not destabilize employer-\nbased coverage. In fact, I believe it will strengthen employer-based \ncoverage. I think that is one of the reasons the National Federation of \nIndependent Business has endorsed our proposal.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I think there is a lot of good faith \namong Senators on both sides to get this done. I have always felt that \non issues such as this, when you are talking about one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy, you ought to try to find as much common ground as you \npossibly can. The three of us have come together behind a new set of \namendments that does find some bipartisan common ground, around \nprinciples the President has embraced--choice and competition.\n  At this point, I yield whatever time she desires to our friend from \nMaine, who is a wonderful partner in this, along with Senator Bayh. \nAmericans are looking for commonsense ideas above all else. That is \nwhat we have sought to do in this proposal.\n  I yield to my friend from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, let me thank my two colleagues \nfor their hard work on these amendments. My colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, has been working so hard on health care issues for such \na long time. My colleague from Indiana, Senator Bayh, and I have worked \ntogether on other issues, and I am proud of the fact that the three of \nus have been able to come together, in a bipartisan way, to present to \nour colleagues three important amendments.\n  It is, as Senator Bayh has noted, so unfortunate that the debate on \nthis bill has been so divisive and partisan. Senator Wyden approached \nme about trying to find some common ground on issues that would unite \nus.\n  I should make clear the adoption of these amendments--important \nthough they are and great steps forward though they are--do not solve \nall the problems I have with the legislation before us. But they do \nimprove the underlying bill in important ways because they help to \nadvance the goal of more affordable insurance choices for consumers. \nProviding more choices and more competition and greater affordability, \nafter all, should be major goals of health care reform.\n  The bill before us falls short in meeting those objectives.\n  Let me discuss our amendments. In summary, our amendments would allow \nindividuals, who are not receiving subsidies, to purchase lower cost \nplans if that coverage is more affordable for them and more appropriate \nfor them.\n  We are also proposing health insurance vouchers that would provide \nmore options for employers and employees alike. We are proposing \nincentives to insurers to keep their rates lower than they otherwise \nmight be.\n  Let me further explain our three amendments. First, we would open the \ncatastrophic plan--the so-called young invincibles plan--in the \nindividual market to anyone, regardless of age, who is not eligible for \na subsidy under the bill.\n  It is incredible to me that we are going to so constrain the \ninsurance choices for an individual who is receiving no taxpayer \nsubsidy at all. That does not make sense. We want to ensure not only \nthat people can keep the insurance they have, if they like it, but also \nthat they have more options available to them. Why should we say that \nan individual who is not receiving any help--no subsidy at all--can \nonly purchase one of the four types of plans that are authorized by \nthis bill?\n  Some would say, well, if you do that, you are going to have a problem \nwhere a person will perhaps have a health savings account or a \nsupplemental catastrophic insurance plan and wait until they are ill to \ntrade up to a far better plan. But there is a way to stop that from \nhappening. We have drafted our amendment so that if an individual \nwished to upgrade his or her coverage, he or she would have to wait \nuntil the next plan year and then could only upgrade to what is known \nas the bronze plan--the next higher level of coverage. That would help \ngreatly to avoid the problem of adverse selection and having a \nsituation where an individual simply waits until he or she becomes ill \nbefore upgrading coverage.\n  We also wish to make sure consumers know exactly what they are buying \nand what kind of coverage they are getting. That is why we would \nrequire health plans to disclose fully the terms of the coverage to \nensure that consumers fully understand the limitation.\n  Finally, this amendment makes clear that States have the ability to \nimpose additional requirements or conditions for the catastrophic plans \noffered under this bill.\n  The bottom line is, health care reform should be about expanding \naccess to affordable choices. The bill that is on the floor now would \ncause many Americans in the individual market to pay more for health \ncare coverage than they do today. That isn't right. If their health \ncare coverage is working well for them, if they are higher income and \ncan bear the risk, if they have a health savings plan, if they are not \ngetting a taxpayer subsidy, why should we dictate, to this degree, the \nlevel of coverage they can buy?\n  I believe this amendment is simple common sense. Let me explain what \nit would mean in my home State of Maine because I think it shows that \none size does not fit all. In Maine, 87.5 percent of those purchasing \ncoverage in the individual market have a policy with an actuarial value \nof less than 60 percent. The most popular individual market policy sold \nin Maine costs a 40-year-old about $185 a month. These individuals \noften pair this catastrophic coverage with a health savings account.\n  Under the bill we are debating, unless they are grandfathered and \ndon't have any change--for example, they have not gotten married or \ndivorced--then that 40-year-old would have to pay at least $420 a \nmonth--more than twice as much--for a policy that would meet the new \nminimum standard. Otherwise they would have to pay a $750 penalty.\n  There is an exception in the bill, but it is only for people who are \nunder the age of 30. What we are saying is, let's broaden that, so that \nif you don't receive help from the government, if you don't receive a \ntaxpayer subsidy, you, too, can buy that kind of catastrophic coverage \nplan.\n\n[[Page S12998]]\n\n  A second amendment the three of us are offering would provide more \nchoices to small businesses and to their employees. Giving employers \nand employees more choices should be among the chief goals of health \ncare reform.\n  Our amendment would allow employers who choose to do so to offer \nvouchers to employees so they can purchase insurance on the exchange. \nThis would allow them, for example, to use the employer voucher, plus \ntap into the subsidy available because of their income level, and put \nsome of their own funds into purchasing the kind of coverage they want. \nAs Senator Wyden has explained, this program is completely optional. \nEmployers could offer these vouchers or decide to continue with their \nemployer plan.\n  Let me tell you one reason I think this strengthens the bill. We need \nmore people buying insurance through the exchanges, because if more \npeople are using the exchanges, it broadens the risk pool, and the \nrates will be better for everyone. In insurance, having more people \nover which to spread the risk drives costs and premiums down.\n  So it is not surprising to me that our Nation's largest small \nbusiness group, the NFIB, has endorsed our amendment. Let me read one \nparagraph from the NFIB letter because it really sums it up. The NFIB \nsays:\n\n       This amendment addresses the shortcomings of the existing \n     employer-based system for small businesses. In the current \n     system, small employers often have few options beyond ``take \n     it or leave it.'' This new and voluntary option will \n     encourage employers to provide insurance coverage for \n     employees. It is the exact opposite of employer mandates that \n     harm struggling businesses, discourage startups, and kill \n     jobs.\n\n  I think the NFIB has said it well. This will give more choices both \nto employers and to employees.\n  Finally, let me say a few words about our proposal to modify the \nformula for the allocation of the $6.7 billion annual tax on health \ninsurance providers.\n  There are a lot of problems with that particular tax, not the least \nof which is the gap between when the tax is imposed and when the \nsubsidies are finally available 4 years later. Another problem is that \nthe tax applies to nonprofit insurers as well as for-profit insurers. I \nam working with Senator Carl Levin to try to address that problem.\n  Here is what we are saying. The way the tax is designed in the bill, \nthere is little to keep insurers from jacking up premiums, which is \nexactly the opposite of what we want them to do. They are going to just \npass this tax on. So what we propose is to give insurers an incentive \nto keep premiums as low as possible. Under our amendment, if you are an \ninsurer that is holding down the cost of your premiums, you don't pay \nas large a share of the tax. That makes sense. That helps us be more \nfair to the efficient insurer that is working hard to keep premiums \ndown.\n  Again, I am very pleased to join with my two colleagues in presenting \nto the Senate three amendments that will provide more choices, greater \naffordability, and more options. These should be the goals of health \ncare reform, and these amendments help to advance those goals.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maine for her \ngreat statement. She summed it up so well.\n  To close, I will turn to Senator Bayh, and if we have time, I will \nadd a thought or two.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I will be brief. I compliment Senator \nCollins on an excellent presentation. She summarized it very succinctly \nand in a way that was compelling.\n  I hope our colleagues will take note that among the three of us, we \nhave the east coast represented, the west coast represented, and the \nMidwest represented. So we span the country and this body. I hope that \nwill cause our colleagues to take some note.\n  The Senator from Maine focused on the letter from the NFIB. This \nhelps small businesses at a time when they are struggling to create \njobs. I hope our colleagues will take note of this letter.\n  The Senator from Maine also pointed out, why should we control the \nhealth care choices of individuals who are receiving no subsidies. That \nought to be up to them. We accomplish all of those things.\n  It is a pleasure doing business with Senator Collins. This is a \npractical approach to solving these problems. I hope our colleagues \nwill take notice.\n  The last thing I will say is, I repeatedly have people come up to me \nand say: Boy, Ron Wyden has some great ideas. We need more of these \nideas in this bill. And this is accomplishing that. Senator Wyden has \nbeen a true leader for many years in this area. I am glad choice and \ncompetition is being introduced, and it is because of his good work.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, to close, briefly, I thank my colleagues. \nI don't want to make this a bouquet-tossing contest, but to have \nSenator Bayh and Senator Collins--they are as good of partners as it \ncan possibly get.\n  At the end of the day, Americans are going to watch this bill, they \nare going to watch it next year during the open enrollment season when \nmillions are signing up for their coverage, and they are going to be \nlooking to see if we did everything possible to hold down their \npremiums. Holding down their premiums--there is a variety of ways to go \nabout it, but there is no better tool than to bring the principles of \nthe marketplace, the principles that are used in every other part of \nAmerican life--choice and competition--for the challenge ahead.\n  With the help of Senator Collins and Senator Bayh, we are going to \nprosecute that case. We are going to do it in a bipartisan way.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nRepublican Senators be permitted to engage in a colloquy during our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, my grandfather was a Santa Fe railway \nengineer. He lived in Newton, KS. So far as I can tell, he was one of \nthe most important men in the world. I was 5, 6, 7 years old when I \nwould go out there. He drove one of these great big steam locomotives. \nIf there were as many yellow flags and red flags along the track when \nhe was driving that Santa Fe locomotive as there are with the health \ncare locomotive that is going through the Senate today, I think my \ngrandfather would have been guilty of gross negligence if he did not \nslow it down and see what those red flags and yellow flags meant.\n  There is a lot of talk about making history with this bill, but there \nare a lot of different ways to make history. One of the things I hope \nwe will be very careful to do in the Senate is not to make a historic \nmistake with this health care legislation.\n  Now we have even one more red flag to consider. It came out last \nnight from Chief Actuary Richard Foster of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is \nnot a Republican organization nor a Democratic organization. It is in \nthe Obama administration. But it is the agency in charge of the Federal \nGovernment's spending for health care, which, according to Mr. \nSamuelson, who wrote a column in Newsweek recently, was 10 percent in \nthe year 1980 and 25 percent today of our government's total \nexpenditures.\n  If we go back to the reason we started all this debate on health \ncare, let's remember that the reason we started the debate was first to \nsee if we can bring down the costs of health care because the red flags \nand the yellow flags are everywhere for small businesses, for \nindividuals, for our government. We cannot continue to afford the \nincreasing cost of health care in America. So our first goal here is to \nbring down the costs.\n  Yet, Mr. Foster, the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, in a lengthy report delivered last night on the \nhealth care bill--most of which we have seen but some of which we do \nnot know about yet; it is still being written in the back room--says \nthat it will increase costs. Instead of reducing costs, it will \nincrease costs. It points out the obvious, which is that the taxes in \nthe bill will raise the premiums for the 180 million of us pay who have \nemployer-based insurance, and for those who have individual insurance. \nIt talks about the millions of Americans who will be losing their \nemployer insurance by the\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\ncombination of provisions in this bill, many of whom will end up in \nMedicaid, where 50 percent of doctors will not see a new patient. But \nmaybe the most important finding is the most obvious finding, the one \nwhich we have been suggesting to our colleagues day-in and day-out. It \nis one we ought to pay attention to and one which almost every American \ncan easily understand. And it is this--it has to do with Medicare, the \ngovernment program on which 40 million seniors depend. This bill would \ncut $1 trillion--let's start this way. Medicare, the program we depend \non, its trustees say it is going broke in 5 years. It is already \nspending more than it brings in, and it will be insolvent between 2015 \nand 2017. Those are the Medicare trustees telling us this.\n  What does this bill do to that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may finish my point.\n  What does this bill do? It would cut $1 trillion from Medicare. I ask \nthe Senator from Arizona, if the program is going broke and you cut $1 \ntrillion out--and then it has been suggested over the last few days \nthat we add several million more people into Medicare--what do you \nsuppose the result would be?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The answer is, obviously, that I don't know.\n  I would like to say to the Senator from Tennessee--and Dr. Barrasso \nis here as well--a lot of Americans have heard of the Congressional \nBudget Office. I am not sure many have heard of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. Are they not the people whose entire focus \nis not on the entire budget, as CBO's is, but just on Medicare and \nMedicaid, so that they can make determinations as to the future and the \nimpact of various pieces of legislation on specifically Medicare and \nMedicaid? Is that a correct assessment?\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Arizona is exactly right. I believe I \nhave my figures right. I think Mr. Samuelson said in his column the \nother day that in 1980 the Federal Government was spending 10 percent \nof all our dollars on health care and today it is 25 percent. And this \nis the agency in charge of most of that massive Federal expenditure \nevery year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. Because the findings as of December \n10, 2009, which is entitled ``Estimated Financial Effects of the \n`Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009,' as Proposed by \nthe Senate Majority Leader on November 18, 2009,'' have some \nincredibly, almost shocking results, I say to my friend from Tennessee.\n  We know the bill before us does not bring costs under control. But as \nI understand this--and it is pretty, may I say, Talmudic in some ways \nto understand some of the language that is in this report, but is it \nnot true that the Reid bill, according to this report--this is not the \nRepublican policy committee but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--doesn't it say:\n\n       The Reid bill creates a new long-term insurance program--\n\n  Called the CLASS Act--\n\n     that the CMS actuaries found faces ``a very serious risk'' of \n     becoming unsustainable as a result of adverse selection by \n     participants. The actuary found that such programs face a \n     significant risk of failure and expects that the program will \n     result in ``net Federal cost in the long term.''\n\n  I would like to mention two other provisions to my friend from \nTennessee and Dr. Barrasso, who is very familiar not only with this \ncenter but with Medicare and Medicaid services.\n\n       The Reid bill funds $930 billion in new Federal spending by \n     relying on Medicare payment cuts which are unlikely to be \n     sustainable on a permanent basis. As a result--\n\n  According to CMS--\n\n     providers could ``find it difficult to remain profitable and, \n     absent legislative intervention, might end their \n     participation in the Medicare program.''\n       The Reid bill is especially likely to result in providers \n     being unwilling to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, \n     meaning that a significant portion of the increased demand \n     for Medicaid services would be difficult to meet.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The CMS actuary noted that the Medicare cuts in the bill \n     could jeopardize Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. He \n     also found that roughly 20 percent of all Part A providers \n     (hospitals, nursing homes, etc.) would become unprofitable \n     within the next 10 years as a result of these cuts.\n\n  Finally, he goes on to say:\n\n       The CMS actuary found that further reductions in Medicare \n     growth rates through the actions of the Independent Medicare \n     Advisory Board--\n\n  Which is one of the most controversial parts of this legislation--\n\n     which advocates have pointed to as a central lynchpin in \n     reducing health care spending, ``may be difficult to achieve \n     in practice.''\n\n  This is a remarkable study, I say to my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for being so specific \nabout this and making it clear that this is not a Republican Senator \ntalking, this is a Republican Senator reading the report of the Federal \nGovernment's Chief Actuary for the Medicare and Medicaid Program. \nSenator Barrasso, a physician for 25 years in Wyoming, brought to our \nattention some of these things earlier this week when he pointed out \nwhat this also says.\n  Isn't the point that if we keep cutting Medicare, there are not going \nto be any hospitals and any doctors around to take care of patients who \nneed care?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I also ask, in addition to that question, has Dr. \nBarrasso ever heard of the CMS being biased or slanted in one way or \nanother? Isn't it one of the most respectable and admired objective \nobservers of the health care situation as far as Medicare and Medicaid \nare concerned?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My answer to that is they are objective. That is why we \ndid not get this report--I have the same copy my colleague from Arizona \nhas. This just came out, and the reason is because they wanted to take \nthe time to study the bill which they got in the middle of November. So \nthey needed the time to actually go through point by point what the \nimplications were.\n  The Senator talked about the one segment where they talk about they \n``face a significant risk of failure.'' They actually go on to say: \n``This will eventually trigger an insurance death spiral.'' This is for \npeople who depend upon Medicare for their health care.\n  There is an Associated Press story out today that says this provides \na sober warning--a sober warning--today to Members of the Senate. This \nis a time when the Senate raised the debt limit in this country by over \n$1 trillion. As the old saying goes--I say to my friend who served in \nthe Navy--they are spending money like drunken sailors, and yet they \nwant to keep the bar open longer. They want to increase the debt at a \ntime when our Nation cannot afford it, when we have 10 percent \nunemployment.\n  The folks who know Medicare the best and can look at this objectively \nand share with the American people what their beliefs are as to what \nthe impact is going to be say that is going to be devastating for \npatients who rely on Medicare for their health care--our seniors--and \ndevastating for small community hospitals. I see the former Governor, \nnow Senator of Nebraska, is here, and he knows, as I do from Wyoming, \nthe impact on our small community hospitals.\n  But as the Senator from Tennessee said, this is all being done in a \nback room. We are not privy to the newest changes, which I think are \nactually going to make matters worse. The New York Times today says \nDemocrats' new ideas would be even more expensive. Questions exist \nabout the affordability. What we are dealing with is a situation that \nis unsustainable, and that is why the newest poll out today by CNN--\ncertainly not biased one way or the other--finds that 61 percent of \nAmericans oppose this bill. It is the highest level of opposition to \ndate because more and more people are seeing and learning the truth \nabout what is being proposed in the bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is the information on the bill as it is; correct--\nthe original bill? This is without the expansion of Medicare taken into \nthis study, which already, as the Senator quoted from the New York \nTimes and other health care experts, is going to increase costs even \nmore. As you expand Medicare, among other things, you run the risk of \nadverse selection, which means the people who are the sickest \nimmediately enroll, which then increases the cost, and then who would \nbe paying the increased Medicare payments? The young and the healthy. I\n\n[[Page S13000]]\n\nask my friend from Wyoming, should we do that to the next generations \nof Americans?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, we should not. We need to be fair. We need to \ndeal with this in a realistic way. But the bill in front of us now is \ngoing to raise taxes $500 billion, it is going to cut Medicare by \nalmost $500 billion for our seniors who depend upon it, and for people \nwho have insurance they like, it is going to increase their premiums. \nThey are going to end up paying more than if no bill was passed at all.\n  That is why, across the board, more people would rather have this \nSenate do nothing than to pass this bill we are looking at today. They \nunderstand the impact on this Nation and our future is devastating. \nThis will cause us to lose jobs, with the taxes; it will cause us to \nlose care in small communities; and for our seniors who depend upon \nMedicare, they are going to throw more people into Medicaid, another \nprogram where half the folks now can't find a doctor who will see them.\n  All in all, there is nothing I see about this bill or any of the new \nchanges and certainly nothing in this report that says to the American \npeople: Hey, you might want to think about this. The American people \nhave thought about it. This report tells the American people this is \nnot what they want for health care in this Nation.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the summary of the report of the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for \n           Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary,\n                                 Baltimore, MD, December 10, 2009.\n     From: Richard S. Foster, Chief Actuary.\n     Subject: Estimated Financial Effects of the ``Patient \n         Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009,'' as Proposed \n         by the Senate Majority Leader on November 18, 2009.\n\n       The Office of the Actuary has prepared this memorandum in \n     our longstanding capacity as an independent technical advisor \n     to both the Administration and the Congress. The costs, \n     savings, and coverage impacts shown herein represent our best \n     estimates for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     We offer this analysis in the hope that it will be of \n     interest and value to policy makers as they develop and \n     debate national health care reforms. The statements, \n     estimates, and other information provided in this memorandum \n     are those of the Office of the Actuary and do not represent \n     an official position of the Department of Health & Human \n     Services or the Administration.\n       This memorandum summarizes the Office of the Actuary's \n     estimates of the financial and coverage effects through \n     fiscal year 2019 of selected provisions of the proposed \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009'' \n     (PPACA). The estimates are based on the bill as released by \n     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on November 18 as an \n     amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 3590. \n     Included are the estimated net Federal expenditures in \n     support of expanded health insurance coverage, the associated \n     numbers of people by insured status, the changes in Medicare \n     and Medicaid expenditures and revenues, and the overall \n     impact on total national health expenditures. Except where \n     noted, we have not estimated the impact of the various tax \n     and fee proposals or the impact on income and payroll taxes \n     due to economic effects of the legislation. Similarly, the \n     impact on Federal administrative expenses is excluded. A \n     summary of the data, assumptions, and methodology underlying \n     our estimates of national health reform proposals is \n     available in the appendix to our October 21 memorandum on \n     H.R. 3200.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The table shown on page 2 presents financial impacts of the \n     selected PPACA provisions on the Federal Budget in fiscal \n     years 2010-2019. We have grouped the provisions of the bill \n     into six major categories:\n       (i) Coverage proposals, which include both the mandated \n     coverage for health insurance and the expansion of Medicaid \n     eligibility to those with incomes at or under 133 percent of \n     the Federal poverty level (FPL);\n       (ii) Medicare provisions;\n       (iii) Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (CHIP) provisions other than the coverage expansion;\n       (iv) Proposals aimed in part at changing the trend in \n     health spending growth;\n       (v) The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports \n     (CLASS) proposal; and\n       (vi) Immediate health insurance reforms.\n       The estimated costs and savings shown in the table are \n     based on the effective dates specified in the bill as \n     released. Additionally, we assume that employers and \n     individuals would take roughly 3 to 5 years to fully adapt to \n     the insurance coverage provisions and that the enrollment of \n     additional individuals under the Medicaid coverage expansion \n     would be completed by the third year following enactment. \n     Because of these transition effects and the fact that most of \n     the coverage provisions would be in effect for only 6 of the \n     10 years of the budget period, the cost estimates shown in \n     this memorandum do not represent a full 10-year cost for the \n     proposed legislation.\n\n             ESTIMATED FEDERAL COSTS (+) OR SAVINGS (-) UNDER SELECTED PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2009\n                                                                      [In billions]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                  Fiscal year\n           Provisions           --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Total,\n                                    2010       2011       2012       2013       2014       2015       2016       2017       2018       2019     2010-19\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal \\1\\......................      $16.1      -$1.6     -$18.6     -$35.2      $22.4      $78.1      $83.0      $76.2      $74.5      $71.0     $365.8\n    Coverage \\2\\...............  .........  .........  .........  .........       93.8      141.1      158.3      165.8      178.6      192.3      929.9\n    Medicare...................       11.5        1.3      -13.4      -24.3      -60.5      -52.0      -66.0      -80.9      -95.8     -113.3     -493.4\n    Medicaid/CHIP..............       -0.4       -0.1       -0.7       -5.3       -4.9       -4.9       -4.8       -4.9       -4.8       -4.8      -35.6\n    Cost trends................  .........  .........  .........  .........       -0.0       -0.1       -0.2       -0.4       -0.6       -0.9       -2.3\n    CLASS program..............  .........       -2.8       -4.5       -5.6       -5.9       -6.0       -4.3       -3.4       -2.8       -2.4      -37.8\n    Immediate reforms..........        5.0  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........       5.0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Excludes Title IX revenue provisions except for 9015, certain provisions with limited impacts, and Federal administrative costs.\n\\2\\ Includes expansion of Medicaid eligibility.\n\\3\\ I Includes estimated non-Medicare Federal savings from provisions for comparative effectiveness research, prevention and wellness, fraud and abuse,\n  and administrative simplification. Excludes impacts of other provisions that would affect cost growth rates, such as the productivity adjustments to\n  Medicare payment rates, which are reflected in the Medicare line.\n\n       As indicated in the table above, the provisions in support \n     of expanding health insurance coverage (including the \n     Medicaid eligibility changes) are estimated to cost $930 \n     billion through fiscal year 2019. The net savings from the \n     Medicare, Medicaid, growth-trend, and CLASS proposals are \n     estimated to total about $564 billion, leaving a net cost for \n     this period of $366 billion before consideration of \n     additional Federal administrative expenses and the increase \n     in Federal revenues that would result from the excise tax on \n     high-cost employer-sponsored health insurance coverage and \n     other revenue provisions. (The additional Hospital Insurance \n     payroll tax income under section 9015 of the PPACA is \n     included in the estimated Medicare savings shown here.) The \n     Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation \n     have estimated that the total net amount of Medicare savings \n     and additional tax and other revenues would somewhat more \n     than offset the cost of the national coverage provisions, \n     resulting in an overall reduction in the Federal deficit \n     through 2019.\n       The chart shown on the following page summarizes the \n     estimated impacts of the PPACA on insurance coverage. The \n     mandated coverage provisions, which include new \n     responsibilities for both individuals and employers, and the \n     creation of the Health Benefit Exchanges (hereafter referred \n     to as the ``Exchanges''), would lead to shifts across \n     coverage types and a substantial overall reduction in the \n     number of uninsured, as many of these individuals become \n     covered through their employers, Medicaid, or the Exchanges.\n       By calendar year 2019, the mandates, coupled with the \n     Medicaid expansion, would reduce the number of uninsured from \n     57 million, as projected under current law, to an estimated \n     24 million under the PPACA. The additional 33 million people \n     who would become insured by 2019 reflect the net effect of \n     several shifts. First, an estimated 18 million would gain \n     primary Medicaid coverage as a result of the expansion of \n     eligibility to all legal resident adults under 133 percent of \n     the FPL. (In addition, roughly 2 million people with \n     employer-sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid \n     for supplemental coverage.) Another 20 million persons (most \n     of whom are currently uninsured) would receive individual \n     insurance coverage through the newly created Exchanges, with \n     the majority of these qualifying for Federal premium and \n     cost-sharing subsidies, and an estimated 20 percent choosing \n     to participate in the public insurance plan option. Finally, \n     we estimate that the number of individuals with employer-\n     sponsored health insurance would decrease overall by about 5 \n     million, reflecting both gains and losses in such coverage \n     under the PPACA.\n       As described in more detail in a later section of this \n     memorandum, we estimate that total national health \n     expenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated \n     total of $234 billion (0.7 percent) during calendar years \n     2010-2019, principally reflecting the net\n\n[[Page S13001]]\n\n     impact of (i) greater utilization of health care services by \n     individuals becoming newly covered (or having more complete \n     coverage), (ii) lower prices paid to health providers for the \n     subset of those individuals who become covered by Medicaid, \n     and (iii) lower payments and payment updates for Medicare \n     services, together with net Medicaid savings from provisions \n     other than the coverage expansion. Although several \n     provisions would help to reduce health care cost growth, \n     their impact would be more than offset through 2019 by the \n     higher health expenditures resulting from the coverage \n     expansions.\n       The actual future impacts of the PPACA on health \n     expenditures, insured status, individual decisions, and \n     employer behavior are very uncertain. The legislation would \n     result in numerous changes in the way that health care \n     insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope \n     and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents \n     exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates \n     presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree \n     of uncertainty than is usually the case with more routine \n     health care proposals.\n       The balance of this memorandum discusses these financial \n     and coverage estimates--and their limitations--in greater \n     detail.\n\n\n   Effects of Coverage Proposals on Federal Expenditures and Health \n                           Insurance Coverage\n\n     Federal expenditure impacts\n       The estimated Federal costs of the coverage provisions in \n     the PPACA are provided in table 1, attached, for fiscal years \n     2010 through 2019. We estimate that Federal expenditures \n     would increase by a net total of $366 billion during this \n     period--a combination of $930 billion in net costs associated \n     with coverage provisions, $493 billion in net savings for the \n     Medicare provisions, a net savings of $36 billion for the \n     Medicaid/CHIP provisions (excluding the expansion of \n     eligibility), $2 billion in savings from proposals intended \n     to help reduce the rate of growth in health spending, $38 \n     billion in net savings from the CLASS proposal, and $5 \n     billion in costs for the immediate insurance reforms. These \n     latter four impact categories are discussed in subsequent \n     sections of this memorandum.\n       Of the estimated $930 billion net increase in Federal \n     expenditures related to the coverage provisions of the PPACA, \n     about two-fifths ($364 billion) can be attributed to \n     expanding Medicaid coverage for all adults who make less than \n     133 percent of the FPL and all uninsured newborns. This cost \n     reflects the fact that newly eligible persons would be \n     covered with a 100-percent Federal Medical Assistance \n     Percentage (FMAP) for the first 3 years and approximately 90 \n     percent thereafter; that is, the Federal government would \n     bear a significantly greater proportion of the cost of the \n     newly eligible enrollees than is the case for current \n     Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask the Senator from Georgia, while this is a \ncomplex document, in many ways, isn't it a matter of common sense that \nif you take a program that is going broke and you take $1 trillion out \nof it and you add millions of people to it, isn't the end result going \nto be there is not going to be anyone left to take care of the patients \nwho need help? Isn't that the logical result, just as this report says?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Not only does that report say that, but as you say, \ncommon sense ought to tell you that. Unfortunately, it is pretty \nobvious the folks on the other side of the aisle who are promoting this \nbill don't get that message.\n  Let me quote the chairman of the Finance Committee, who today issued \nthis statement relative to the CMS report the Senator has in his hand. \nHe said:\n\n       The report shows that health reform will ensure both the \n     Federal Government and the American people spend less on \n     health care than if this bill does not pass.\n\n  That statement is directly contrary to the statement in the CMS \nreport that Senator Alexander just referenced, which says:\n\n       . . . we estimate that total national health expenditures \n     under this bill would increase by an estimated total of $234 \n     billion (0.7 percent) during calendar years 2010-2019.\n\n  Not only that, but the report says that national health expenditures \nwould increase as a percentage of GDP from $1 of every $7, which is \nabout 16 percent, to $1 out of every $5, which is 20 percent.\n  What the report concludes is not only are our health care costs going \nto go up, but as the Senator from Arizona said, 20 percent of all Part \nA providers--nursing homes, hospitals, home health--would become \nunprofitable within the next 10 years as a result of the provision in \nthis bill relating to the Medicare cuts the Senator from Tennessee \ntalked about.\n  The American people do get it. That is why these poll numbers the \nSenator from Wyoming just stated coming out of CNN and why the FOX poll \nI saw this morning said 57 percent of the people in America are opposed \nto this bill. The American people are getting it but, for some reason, \nour friends on the other side of the aisle are not.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Nebraska is here, and we had a \nconversation earlier about the attitude of people in Nebraska. It is \nvery helpful to have independent evaluators who tell us that if you cut \n$1 trillion out of a program that is going bankrupt and then add more \npeople to it, doctors and hospitals are going to go broke. We have \nheard that before from the Mayo Clinic, and I think Senator Johanns has \nbeen hearing that in the State of Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I have heard it all over the State. Today, let me say, \nthe fog cleared. The fog cleared and the Sun is shining brightly on \nthis mammoth experiment with 16 percent of the economy. This actuary \nsays, very clearly--and he has no ax to grind with anyone--that costs \nare going to go up under this bill; that care is going to be \njeopardized under this bill; that the very linchpin, the essence of \nwhat this bill was supposed to be all about, can't happen.\n  If I might, I wish to refer to something which I will ask to be a \npart of the Record to gain some perspective.\n  I wish to applaud my colleagues on this side, and here is why. We \nwrote to the majority leader back in the first part of November and we \nsaid CBO had not been able to tell us what the ultimate impact would be \non health care costs and we felt strongly we needed a second opinion. \nSo we asked that this bill be submitted to scrutiny by CMS, and that is \nwhat we are getting today. Twenty-four of us signed onto that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter to the majority leader, dated November 12, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid: This health care bill will be \n     the most significant piece of legislation that Congress \n     considers this year because it would undoubtedly affect every \n     American. Therefore, it is vitally important that we do not \n     make decisions without a complete and thorough analysis of \n     the bill.\n       One of the most important issues facing us as we review \n     this legislation is its effect on overall health care \n     spending. The President has repeatedly stated that he \n     believes health reform should control health care costs. \n     Achieving that objective, as you know, means more than simply \n     employing draconian cuts in Medicare spending and creating \n     numerous new taxes to minimize the effect of creating a vast \n     new health care entitlement on the federal deficit. Bending \n     the cost curve means curbing the rate of all health spending.\n       Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office has been \n     unable to produce an estimate of the effect of the bills \n     before us on overall medical spending though we note that the \n     CMS Actuary has provided such an assessment of an earlier \n     version of the House health reform bill (HR 3200). Such an \n     analysis would be invaluable to the Senate as we consider \n     this important legislation.\n       Therefore, we request that you submit the legislation to \n     the Office of the Actuary at CMS for analysis and make the \n     findings public before you bring the bill to the Senate floor \n     for consideration. We agree with President Obama that health \n     care legislation must ``bend the cost curve so that we're not \n     seeing huge health-care inflation over the long term.'' \n     Therefore, we would specifically like the Office of the \n     Actuary at CMS to determine if this legislation will bring \n     down health care expenditures over the long term.\n       We look forward to your response and the assurance that \n     this secondary analysis will be completed in order to provide \n     us and the American people with the information necessary to \n     make a well-informed vote.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike Johanns; Sam Brownback; Pat Roberts; Robert F. \n           Bennett; Tom Coburn; Richard Burr; Christopher S. Bond; \n           Roger F. Wicker; John Barrasso; Michael B. Enzi; Jim \n           Bunning; Mike Crapo; Orrin G. Hatch; Lamar Alexander; \n           Susan M. Collins; John Thune; George S. LeMieux; Jim \n           DeMint; Mitch McConnell; George V. Voinovich; John \n           Cornyn; James E. Risch; Kay Bailey Hutchison; Lindsey \n           Graham; Thad Cochran.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Today, we finally have come to grips with the fact that \nall the promises made are not being fulfilled by this bill; that the \n$2.5 trillion that will be spent will accomplish nothing; that health \ncare costs would not go down--they will, in fact, go up; and that \npeople will lose their private insurance.\n\n[[Page S13002]]\n\n  I tell you the most heartbreaking thing for me, and any other Senator \nwho has rural hospitals, which is just about every Senator, is that 20 \npercent, as the Senator from Georgia points out, will be underwater. \nThat means nursing homes that provide care for real people, and that \nmeans hospitals that provide services for real people. I tell you, in a \nState such as Nebraska, when hospital care disappears in a small town, \nthat may mean hospital care disappears for hundreds of miles.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I could ask the Senator from Nebraska this \nquestion. Did a rural hospital in Nebraska or Wyoming or some State \nnot--did I notice in a letter from the Mayo Clinic this week, they said \ncuts such as this or an expansion of Medicare under these circumstances \nwould cause them to--well, to drop Medicare, period; they lost $840 \nmillion this year, and they are beginning to say to some citizens from \nNebraska, Montana, other areas: We can't take you if you are a Medicare \npatient or if you are a Medicaid patient.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. They are saying that, and that is what is happening \nbecause they are losing money. They are definitely losing money on \nMedicaid and they are losing money on Medicare.\n  So what the Reid bill does is it says: Mr. Alexander, you sell \nwhatever--cars. Let's use that as the analogy--and I know you are \nlosing $100 on every car. But let's just give you twice as many to \nsell. Well, you are going to lose twice as much money. That is their \nsolution to the health care crisis in this country.\n  But what this actuary points out, what the Mayo Clinic points out, \nand what so many analysts now have pointed out is that this bill is \ngoing to put hospitals under and it is going to put nursing homes \nunder.\n  Here is another point that gets lost in this complex debate. That \nnursing home or that hospital may be the only major employer in that \ncommunity. When you lose that, you not only lose your medical care, but \nyou lose those jobs. I have said on the floor before that this bill is \na job killer. It is a job killer. There is no way of getting around it. \nThose jobs will disappear in that small town, that rural area, and even \nin the big cities.\n  I hope our friends on the other side study this very carefully. This \nis a roundhouse blow to the Reid plan--to the Reid-Obama plan. This, in \nmy judgment, proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this is going to \ncrush health care in our country.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would ask the Senators from Wyoming and Georgia, who \nare here, to go back to the beginning. When we began this debate, the \nPresident, in his summit at the beginning of the year, very correctly--\nand I applauded him for that--all of us said we have to reduce health \ncare costs--costs to us, costs to small businesses, and costs to our \ngovernment. But doesn't this report of the chief actuary of the \ngovernment say the Reid bill will actually increase health care costs?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It does say that. The President has said he wanted to \nbend the cost curve down. This report says, if we do these things that \nare in the Reid bill, costs of care will actually go up faster than if \nwe did nothing at all. That means for people who buy their own \ninsurance, the cost of their premiums will go up faster than if this \nSenate passed nothing at all.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So if I am understanding it, we are going to cut $1 \ntrillion, when fully implemented, out of Medicare; we are going to add \n$1 trillion in taxes, when fully implemented; we are going to run up \nthe debt, we believe on this side; we are going to increase premiums \nand costs are still going up?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. For people all across the country, costs are still \ngoing to go up. The cost of doing business will go up. For families who \nbuy their own insurance, the cost of their premiums will go up. For \npeople who are on Medicare, they are going to see tremendous cuts into \nthat program, and they depend on that for their health care. So costs \nare going up for people who pay for their own and for businesses that \ntry to build jobs.\n  We know small business in this country is the engine that drives the \neconomy, and according to the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, 70 percent of all new jobs come from small businesses. They \nare going to be penalized to the point they are not going to be able to \nadd those new jobs. The NFIB says we will lose across the country 1.6 \nmillion jobs over the next 4 years as the government keeps collecting \nthe taxes but doesn't even give any of these health care services \nbecause those have all been delayed for 4 years.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have about 6 minutes remaining in our time. I \nwonder if the Senator from Georgia, having heard the comments, has any \nadditional recommendations on the chief actuary's report.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I wish to ask a question or two of the Senator from \nWyoming, who is a medical doctor and who, prior to coming to the \nSenate, was an active orthopedic surgeon.\n  I have had physicians come into my office by the droves and talk to \nme about Medicare before we ever got into this health care debate, and \nwhat I heard was in reference to the reimbursement rate under Medicare \nto physicians and to hospitals being so low.\n  In fact, the American Hospital Association has come out just in the \nlast 24 hours and pointed out that hospitals across the Nation get a \nreturn of about 91 cents for every dollar of care provided. That is not \n91 cents of the amount of charges from the hospital to Medicare, it is \n91 cents of the cost of the care provided. So the return is about 10 \npercent less to a hospital than the cost that the hospital has in it.\n  My understanding is that at least 10 percent less than the cost \nprovided for a physician is reimbursed to the physician under Medicare. \nAs a result of that, the younger physicians, particularly, who are \ncoming out of med school with these huge debts they have incurred as a \nresult of the long years they are required to be in school, simply \ncannot afford to take Medicare patients and they are not taking \nMedicare patients. Is that in fact what is happening in the real world? \nAnd will that not get worse under this proposal?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is happening. It will get worse under the proposal \nthat is ahead of us. That 90-percent figure is actually a high number. \nI know a number of physicians and hospitals, especially in rural \ncommunities, that get reimbursed less than that. The ambulance services \ndo not even get reimbursed enough from Medicare--these are volunteer \nambulance services--to fill the ambulance with the gas for taking \nsomebody the long distances from where they may have fallen and hurt \nthemselves, broken a hip, to get them all the way to the hospital. This \nis across the board bad for America.\n  We say we want patients to be able to get care. If you throw a whole \nbunch more people on to this boat that is already sinking, which is \nwhat the Democratic leader is now trying to do, it is going to make it \nthat much harder for our hospitals to stay open, especially in these \ncommunities where there is only one hospital providing care--much more \ndifficult. But with any young physician coming out with a lot of debt, \ntrying to hire the nurse and pay the rent and the electricity and the \nliability insurance and all of that, these do not even cover the \nexpenses. That means they have to charge more to the person who does \nhave insurance, the cost shifting that occurs.\n  As a result, for people who have insurance, they are going to see \ntheir rates going up. For people who rely on Medicare, it is going to \nbe harder to find a doctor. For those who are put onto Medicaid, with \nthe aid for those who need additional help, which the Senate majority \nleader is trying to put more people into that area, it is going to be \nharder for them to find care.\n  Across the board, there is nothing good with this proposal. What we \nhave seen today documented from the folks who are objective and look at \nthe whole picture, they think it is actually as bad--they admit it is \nas bad as we have been saying it is. They say you guys have been right, \nwhat you are saying about the cost of care, the impact on health care. \nAnd their phraseology is such that I think they absolutely pinpoint all \nof the reasons that the American people, now by a number of 61 percent, \noppose this bill we are taking a look at. That is why the Mayo Clinic \nhas said, in the letter from their executive director of their Health \nPolicy Center, ``Expanding this system to persons 55 to 64 years old \nwill ultimately hurt patients by accelerating the financial ruin of \nhospitals and doctors across the country.'' That is what we are looking \nat.\n\n[[Page S13003]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I could conclude our time, with \nthe permission of the Senator from Georgia and Wyoming, instead of \nracing down this train track with yellow flags and red flags flying \neverywhere, people often ask us: What would you do? What we would do is \nwhat we think most Americans would do when faced with a big problem, \nnot try to solve it all at once but to say, What is our goal? Our goal \nis reducing cost. What are the first four or five steps we can take to \nreduce costs? Can we an agree on those? We think we can. Let's start \ntaking them. For example, small business health plans to allow small \nbusinesses to offer insurance to their employees at a lower rate. That \nlegislation is prepared and before the Senate.\n  Reducing junk lawsuits against doctors. That reduces costs.\n  Allow competition across State lines for insurance policies. That \nreduces costs.\n  Going step by step to re-earn the trust of the American people to \nreduce health care costs is the way to go, instead of making what this \nnew report from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services helps to \nshow again would be a historic mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Certainly.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I will be very brief. I thank the \nSenator from Tennessee, not only for his statement but for his constant \nefforts. Facts are stubborn things. Yet he has pointed out basically \nwhat this report now confirms. During the last few months we have seen \nsome commentary that says ``scare tactics,'' of all things. I happen to \nhave the privilege of being the chairman of the Rural Health Care \nCaucus. I was in the House of Representatives when I had the privilege \nof serving there and I am a cochairman with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. \nThere are about 30 of us who, from time to time, will correspond and \nmeet and send messages back and forth to try to keep the rural health \ncare delivery system viable.\n  We have been worried for some time in regard to what is going to \nhappen to Medicare, what is going to happen in regard to cost, what is \ngoing to happen in regard to rationing. Every hospital director, every \nhospital board in rural America has worried about these things--more \nespecially about CMS, which has been described here in detail. That is \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  I have to tell you, if you are a hospital administrator or if you are \non the board of a local hospital in a rural area, and you hear the word \nCMS, it is probably not viewed in the best of considerations, that CMS \nis in charge of enforcing what H2S comes down with. So in terms of \nreimbursement, in terms of all things--competitive bidding--and I am \ntalking about doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home health care, \nhospice, all of this--when they hear the word CMS a cold chill goes \ndown the back of their neck, more or less like expecting Lizzy Borden \nto come in the front door.\n  So I am especially glad that the actuary, Mr. Richard Foster, the \nChief Actuary from CMS, has shined the light of truth into darkness. He \nhas taken the original bill we have been talking about for some time, \nas my colleague has pointed out, and said basically this bill is going \nto increase costs and is going to result in rationing. It does not take \ninto consideration the latest iteration that we hear from the press and \nmedia about including people 55 to 65 into Medicare. It is going to be \ninteresting, if we have enough time--although I know that the \ndistinguished majority leader has asked for a CBO score--but I would \nsure like to know what Mr. Foster would think of that idea. I think it \nwould be far worse.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues who belong to the Rural Health Care \nCaucus to take a very hard look at this. This confirms what we have \nbeen saying for some time. These are not scare tactics, these are \nactual facts.\n  Let me say, too, I know when this debate first started some of the \nnational organizations that represent doctors and hospitals, perhaps \nnursing homes--certainly not any home health care--well, I take that \nback. There was a letter written by the home health care folks at one \ntime, but certainly not hospices--indicating that they were lukewarm, \nwarm to the bill, or would perhaps support it. I think the message was \npretty clear--come to the breakfast or you won't come to lunch. That \nwas pretty bare knuckles but they hoped that at least by insuring those \nwho have insurance, that would make their situation better.\n  Then, of course, came the latest iteration to this bill of putting in \npeople 55 to 65, and the national association, in regard to our doctors \nand our hospitals, said: Whoa.\n  Let me point out in Kansas and in many States throughout the country \nthere never was the support. They knew exactly what would happen if we \npassed this bill and CMS would come knocking on their door. I might add \nit wouldn't be CMS that would actually do that, it would be the \nInternal Revenue Service under this bill, and that was one \nconsideration where I made about a 15-minute speech and obviously not \ntoo many people paid attention. But all patients, all doctors, all \nnurses, all clinical lab folks, anybody connected with the home health \ncare industry or hospice or nursing homes or whatever, should have \nknown it is going to be the IRS that is going to enforce this as well \nas CMS, which has been doing most of the enforcing.\n  In Kansas, the Kansas Medical Society said: No, no, we are not going \nto go along with this bill. I am talking about the bill we have been \ntalking about for some time. The Kansas Hospital Association was \nadamant. They said no. Obviously that was because of advice they got \nfrom 128 hospitals in my State, saying: No, we cannot reconcile with \nthis because of cost, because of the rationing. We are only being \nreimbursed at 70 percent or less, as we talk about it--and the doctors \nabout 80 percent.\n  Many doctors do not serve Medicare now in Kansas. Let me rephrase \nthat. Some doctors don't serve Medicare in Kansas. If this bill passes, \na lot of doctors simply will not serve Medicare. You can have the best \nplan or the best card in the world, it is not going to make any \ndifference if you can't see a doctor. It is not worth a dime.\n  Then I have to say the Kansas Nursing Home Association and Kansas \nHome Health Care folks and the Kansas Hospice folks all said: No, this \nis not where we want to go. This is self-defeating. This is not going \nto do what the sponsors of the bill and what everybody for health care \nreform hoped they would actually see happen.\n  I don't know what the word is, I am--not overwhelmed, I am extremely \nglad; I am somewhat surprised but I am extremely glad that CMS again \nshined the light of truth into darkness. I commend Mr. Foster, the \nchief actuary. I recommend this as required reading for everybody who \nwas going to vote for this bill and certainly with the latest \niteration, where we are adding anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 million \npeople to Medicare, which will make the situation much worse in regard \nto Medicare being actuarially sound and costs going up, premiums going \nup, and also rationing, the dreaded rationing. It is not a scare tactic \nbut actually a fact.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I have been on the floor now for about \nan hour listening to my colleagues on the health care debate. Certainly \nI want to express the opinion from many people in the Northwest. We \nknow that doing nothing about health care certainly will guarantee that \npremiums will go up. We know it happened in the last 10 years; they \nhave gone up 100 percent. We know that doing nothing now means they \nwill go up 8 to 10 percent a year. We also know there is about $700 \nbillion in waste in the system.\n  This is about what we can do to reform the system so we can stop the \nrise, the increase we are seeing in our premiums. There are many things \nin this legislation, changing fee-for-service systems so we are driving \ndown the quantity of health care that is delivered instead of making \nsure that it is quality; making sure we make reforms in long-term care; \nmaking sure we give\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\nthe power to States to negotiate and drive down the costs. I know my \ncolleague Senator Collins was on the floor with some of my other \ncolleagues, the Senators from Oregon and Indiana, to discuss their \nideas about how we improve cost containment.\n  I hope my colleagues in the next days will join us in the discussion \nabout how we continually improve the bill to drive down costs, because \ndoing nothing will not get us to that point.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Collins pertaining to \nintroduction of S. 2827 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nenter into a colloquy with my Republican colleagues for up to 30 \nminutes, and that following those remarks, the Republican leader be \nrecognized, and that following his remarks Senator Durbin be recognized \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I would like to speak on health care. The pending \nbusiness before the Senate right now is actually the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, which the Senate moved to yesterday, after having \nstarted the debate on the health care legislation.\n  My motion is the pending business on the health care legislation, and \nso it is that motion I would like to talk about. Before I do so, I \nwould like to again raise objection and concern to the fact that we \nhave moved off the health care legislation debate to the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, both because I believe we should stay on the \nhealth care issue and work it through, but also because we moved to an \nOmnibus appropriations bill that we have not had an opportunity to \nreview carefully and that raises the spending--I believe for these \nseven appropriations bills that have been compiled together, the \nspending is raised by an average of about 12 percent.\n  Once again, Congress is in a spending free fall, and whether it be \nthe stimulus package or the appropriations for our ordinary operations \nof government or whether it be the bailouts or the tremendous other \naspects of spending pressures and proposals, including the health care \nlegislation we have, there seems to be no restraint in Washington with \nregard to spending the taxpayers' dollars.\n  But let's talk for a minute about the motion that was before the \nSenate before we moved off the health care legislation. It was a motion \nI raised to object to the tax increases on the middle class in America \nthat are contained in the bill.\n  The motion I have is very simple. It focuses on the President's \npledge. The President pledged that ``no family making less than \n$250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income taxes, not your \npayroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.'' \nThe President pledged: You will not see any of your taxes increase one \nsingle dime.\n  So the motion I brought was very simple. It was simply to commit the \nbill to the Finance Committee to have the Finance Committee go through \nthe 2,074-page bill and remove from the bill the taxes that are in it \nthat apply to the middle class in the United States, as defined by the \nPresident here: being those who, as a couple, are making less than \n$250,000 a year, or those, as an individual, who are making less than \n$200,000 a year.\n  What we have seen is that not only has there been delay on reaching \nthat goal but a counterproposal to the amendment has been brought up by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus. His \ncounteramendment says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should reject \n     any procedural maneuver that would raise taxes on middle \n     class families, such as a motion to commit the pending \n     legislation to the Committee on Finance, which is designed to \n     kill legislation that provides tax cuts for American workers \n     and families, including the affordability tax credit and the \n     small business tax credit.\n\n  A number of us are here today to talk about the fact that this sense \nof the Senate is designed to provide cover for those who do not want to \nvote to protect American taxpayers. It is a meaningless sense of the \nSenate. We are going to go through the sense of the Senate phrase by \nphrase.\n  I would like to ask my colleague from the State of Wyoming if he \nwould like to step in on the first phrase and comment. The first phrase \nsays what the amendment is: ``It is the sense of the Senate . . .'' \nWould my friend from Wyoming like to comment on what that means?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would be happy to. OK, so we agree, it is the sense \nof the Senate. It is meaningless in terms of actually having the force \nof law. The Senator talked about the issues of the spending and the \ntaxes, so we came up with a sense of the Senate.\n  This is why we are asking people all across the country to read the \nbill. The sense of the Senate essentially means nothing. It says we \nkind of agree on this, but there is no law applied.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Exactly. It is very critical to point out, a sense of the \nSenate has no binding impact. It is just sort of what we think.\n  Let's go to the next phrase in the amendment: ``that the Senate \nshould reject any procedural maneuver that . . . '' in other words, the \nSenate should reject a procedural maneuver.\n\n  First of all, if the Senate is going to reject a procedural maneuver, \nthat refers to what is happening on the Senate floor, procedural \nefforts. It does not refer to any substantive measure in the bill. The \namendment we had pending--which this is going to be a counterpart to--\nspecifically refers to the substance of the bill and says the substance \nof the bill should be changed to take out the taxes, the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of taxes.\n  I wonder, before we go to the next phrase, does my colleague from \nWyoming care to comment?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I do care to comment. I care to comment that the \nimportant thing is to get the taxes out of the bill--not what a sense \nof the Senate is, not some procedural maneuver. It is the specifics of \nremoving the taxes from the bill.\n  When the President says, ``My plan won't raise your taxes one \npenny,'' which was his quote, we need to be able to make sure the \nPresident is telling us the truth, that we need to remove these taxes \nfrom the bill.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation looked at this bill--specifically \nlooked at this bill--and it said that 38 percent of the people earning \nless than $200,000 a year will see a tax increase--a tax increase under \nthe Reid bill.\n  So we want to make sure the President's words go with what is in the \nbill. So we need to actually remove the taxes--not just have a sense of \nthe Senate.\n  Then, when we look at the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, he was asked a question at the Finance Committee, and he \nsaid, when it all ``shakes out,'' we would expect people who are going \nto be paying taxes are going to have incomes ``less than'' the number \nthe President said.\n  So I want to get to the point of the Crapo amendment, the amendment \nthat actually says: Get these taxes out of the bill. This is a bill \nthat is going to raise taxes by $500 billion, and those are taxes that \nare going to impact all Americans.\n  At a time when we have 10-percent unemployment, when the Senate is \nbeing asked to increase the debt level by another almost $2 trillion, \nthe last thing we need to be spending our time on is a sense of the \nSenate. We need to actually get to those taxes that are going to affect \nthe people, the hard-working people of America get those taxes out of \nthe bill.\n  So as we are looking at that Baucus amendment; it is very nice, but \nit reminds me of the Bennet amendment we had here last week, and I \nthink everybody voted for it. The New York Times, in their editorial, \nsaid it was a meaningless amendment. I want an amendment with some \nteeth in it that I can vote for, and I am ready to vote right now.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my colleague from Wyoming.\n  The next phrase in the amendment--referring to a procedural motion--\nsays that ``would raise taxes on middle class families.''\n\n[[Page S13005]]\n\n  There is nobody bringing a motion to raise taxes. My amendment says \nit is referring the bill to the Finance Committee to take out the taxes \non those who earn less than $200,000 or $250,000.\n  I note that my colleague from Kansas has arrived.\n  Would the Senator care to jump in at this point?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will tread with great care, I would say to my \ndistinguished friend.\n  I thank the Senator for this colloquy. But you asked what it means \nthat ``the Senate should reject any procedural maneuver that''--that is \nin quotes--and what does that really mean?\n  Well, it applies only to the Senate procedural motions. By itself it \nwould have no effect on any substantive provision. That is the way it \nis commonly understood under Senate rules. It means, if adopted, the \namendment would not remove any provision that has been identified as a \ntax increase on middle-class taxpayers, which is precisely what the \nSenator is trying to do. So basically it means nothing.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I think that is exactly the point we are trying to point \nout.\n  The next phrase in the amendment says, ``such as a motion to commit \nthe pending legislation to the Committee on Finance.'' Remember, that \nis referring to the previous phrase that refers to a motion to increase \ntaxes.\n  The only thing we need to say about this phrase is, there is a motion \nto commit the bill to the Finance Committee, but there is not a motion \nto commit the bill to the Finance Committee to raise taxes. It is to \ncut taxes.\n  The next phrase in the amendment is to suggest that there is an \neffort to try to kill the legislation.\n  Now, this is my motion. I suppose the implication there is, by trying \nto take the taxes out of the bill, we are trying to kill the \nlegislation. What does that mean? Well, that means if you take the \ntaxes out of this bill, that the bill does not stand. I assume that is \nwhat the amendment is trying to say. The reason that it does not stand \nis because they are saying the bill does not increase the deficit. \nWell, the only way you can say that the bill does not increase the \ndeficit is if you do not bring into consideration the nearly $500 \nbillion of cuts in Medicare, the nearly $500 billion of taxes which are \nbeing put on the people of this country, and the additional budget \ngimmicks that do not start counting the spending for 4 years, plus a \nnumber of other budget gimmicks.\n  So what they are saying is, you cannot take out one of the key legs \nof this bill, which is the way we raise all the money for this massive \nnew spending, or else it will kill the bill. I think it is a pretty \ninteresting fact that they have actually admitted in their own \namendment what kind of games are being played.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That phrase that the Senator just mentioned is, ``which \nis designed to kill legislation.'' My question has already been \nanswered by the distinguished Senator, what does it mean, but there are \nno motions that have been considered or pending, including the pending \nmotion to commit by the distinguished Senator--is the motion designed \nto kill this legislation? Because that is what you are going to hear on \nthe other side, and that is not the case.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, it seems to me that what the Senator \nis doing with the Crapo amendment is actually trying to help people, \ntrying to help the American people by taking this burden of $500 \nbillion of taxes off of their backs, off of their shoulders, helping \nthe American people. That is what I see he is trying to accomplish, at \na time where with a gimmick they are going to start taxing immediately \nand when the taxes go into play--today is the 11th of December; in 20 \ndays they are going to start collecting taxes for services they are not \ngoing to give for 4 more years. So it seems to me what is going on here \nwith the Crapo amendment is it is saving the American people by keeping \ndollars in their pockets, keeping dollars in the pockets of the hard-\nworking people of our country.\n  I am not the only one who is saying that. There is a new CNN poll out \ntoday that specifically asks the question--because the President has \nmade a statement about the fact that you wouldn't see your taxes go \nup--Do you think your taxes would or would not increase if Harry Reid's \nbill is passed, and 85 percent of the American people in a CNN poll out \ntoday said they believe their taxes are going to go up; 85 percent of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I would say to my colleague from Wyoming that they are \nright, if this bill is not committed back to the Finance Committee to \ntake those taxes out.\n  The next phrase in the amendment is--this is referring to a \nprocedural motion, we call it--``that provides tax cuts for American \nworkers and families.''\n  In other words, they don't want to send it back to committee to have \na procedural motion put into place that would stop them from providing \ntax cuts for American families.\n  Again, it is rhetoric. Read the motion. The motion does not say to \ntake out any benefits in the bill for anybody in America, unless you \nconsider taxing people to be a benefit to them, but it simply says the \ntaxes in the bill that are imposed on people that the President \nidentified to be in the middle class and would be protected must be \nremoved from the bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. As Republicans, there is probably no principle that \nunifies us more than keeping taxes low on American workers and \nfamilies, and I don't think our friends on the other side would dispute \nthat notion. Indeed, the Democratic Party assumed control of the White \nHouse almost a year ago, as everybody knows, and seated large \nmajorities here in the Congress. The one unmistakable distinction \nbetween the parties is this: Our party has respectfully opposed--I \nunderline the word respectfully--opposed numerous efforts by the \nmajority party to impose broad-based taxes increases on American \nworkers and families. So one only need to look at the stimulus debate \nor the budget debate or the cap-and-trade legislation, and I could go \non and on and on, more especially with the health care debate, and the \nbill before us.\n  Don't you follow from that general principle?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Absolutely. Again, I believe what is going on here with \nthis new amendment is simply an effort to sort of divert attention from \nthe real issue that is before the American people, the motion that was \nbefore the Senate, before we were forced by a procedural vote yesterday \nto move off the bill, and that is the question of the taxes in the \nbill.\n  The final phrase refers to a couple of the provisions in the bill \nthat do have some support for improving the tax circumstances for small \nbusinesses and the affordability tax credit, meaning the tax credit \nthat will be utilized to implement the subsidies for insurance.\n  Again, we can say it any number of times, but the fact is the motion \nthey are trying to avoid does not deal with either of these provisions \nof the bill; it deals with those provisions in the bill that tax the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am fine with voting on this, but it doesn't mean \nanything. I think it is absolutely meaningless, the Baucus amendment. I \nwant to get to the heart of the matter, the meat of the matter, which \nis the Crapo amendment. That is the one I think makes the difference \nfor the American people. If I were a citizen sitting at home watching \nC-SPAN on a Friday afternoon saying, what is going on in the Senate, \nwhat do I want, what is going to help me, I would say I want to call my \nSenator and say: Vote for the Crapo motion because that is the one that \nis actually going to help keep money in my pocket. The sense of the \nSenate? Oh, that is nice, but it is meaningless.\n  I am ready to vote right now for the Crapo motion because that is the \none I think is going to help possibly save my job if I am at home and \nworking. I am worried about unemployment in the country, I am worried \nabout the taxes and the impact that is going to have. Because I worry \nif we don't get these taxes out of here, it is going to be a job killer \nfor our Nation and for families all across this country, in Idaho, in \nWyoming, in Kansas, in Kentucky. I think we have great concerns for the \neconomy and the 10-percent unemployment. We need to get those taxes out \nof there now.\n\n[[Page S13006]]\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator is, in fact, right. If you go back and try to \nget a little perspective on the entire debate, most Americans would \nagree that we need health care reform, but when they say that, they are \ntalking about the need to control the skyrocketing costs of their \nhealth insurance and the costs of medical care, and they are talking \nabout making sure we have real, meaningful access to quality health \ncare in America.\n  In his statements, the President has many times commented about \ndifferent parts of that. We remember when he said, If you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. Well, we have seen that is not true, and there \nwill be and have been already amendments to try to address those \nquestions.\n  Remember when he said it is going to drive down the cost of health \ncare and drive down your health care premiums? Well, we have learned \nnow that it doesn't do that either; it actually drives up the cost of \nhealth care insurance and it is going to drive up the cost of medical \ncare in this country.\n  Remember when he said you will not see your taxes go up? In fact, he \npledged that if you were a member of the middle class, whom he defined \nas those making less than $250,000 as a couple or $200,000 as an \nindividual, you would not see your taxes go up. Well, this motion is \nfocused on that part of the debate. What did we see happen? Instead of \nletting us fix the bill, send the bill back to the Finance Committee to \nmake the bill comply with the President's pledge, we saw two procedural \nmaneuvers, one to maneuver off the bill, to get off the bill and move \nto the omnibus appropriations bill; secondly, to put up a bait-and-\nswitch amendment that makes it look as though there is some kind of \nprotection being put in place when, in reality, it is nothing more than \na sense of the Senate relating to procedural motions that don't exist. \nI agree with my colleague from Wyoming and with my colleague from \nKansas.\n  I see we have several of our other colleagues joining us here now. We \nneed to keep the focus on health care and we need to keep the focus on \nthose core parts of the bill that are critical to the American people.\n  Before I ask my colleague from Kansas if he wishes to make any other \ncomments, I will reiterate the point that my colleague from Wyoming \nmade with regard to the American people's understanding of this issue. \nIn that CNN poll that I believe showed over 60 percent--I think it was \n61 percent--of the people in this country who do not want this bill to \nmove forward because they are now understanding what it does, in that \nsame poll, 85 percent of the people in this country believe that this \npledge of the President is broken by this bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Idaho and the \nSenator from Kansas, both the Senators are on the Finance Committee, I \nbelieve, and have been working on this health care bill for a long \ntime. It is typical of a big, complex bill such as this that it is \ndifficult to pass, and you get a sense every now and then of whether it \nis likely to pass or unlikely to pass. This week has been a \nparticularly difficult week for the bill. I have noticed the majority \nleader trying to create a sense of inevitability about the bill.\n\n  But, increasingly, it seems to me, with it becoming clear that with \nso much of it being paid for by new taxes, and then last night the \nchief actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services saying \nthe cost is going up, premiums are going up; with the Mayo Clinic \nsaying it is beginning to not take Medicare patients, and the idea of \nputting millions more Americans into a program already going broke \nwhich you are taking $1 trillion out of is a bad idea; I wonder if in \nall--and all this talk about history being made and the inevitability \nof this bill, that the Senator from Idaho might not think, looking back \nover this whole debate, that maybe there are a lot of different ways to \nmake it--that maybe a growing number of Senators might be thinking--not \nsaying yet--might be thinking that this bill would be an historic \nmistake and that all the king's horses and all the king's men are not \ngoing to be able to push this up over the top.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The Senator from Tennessee is right, and he has put his \nfinger on one of the key issues that is going on here in the Senate \nthat sometimes isn't highlighted as closely as I think maybe it should \nbe. That is, while we are talking about the need to make sure this bill \ndoes not raise taxes on the middle class, to make sure that the bill \ndoes not increase the cost of health insurance premiums, and to make \nsure that we maintain quality of health care and don't cut Medicaid and \nMedicare, the real battle here is an effort to create a legacy to \nessentially put the government in control of the health care economy. \nThat is the debate. That is the legacy. That is the history that those \nwho are pushing the bill are seeking to make, and they are seeking to \nmake it at the expense of those on Medicare, of those of the taxpayers \nin America; and of the costs, the cost curve that they said they want \nto drive down, dealing with the cost of our health care.\n  I see our leader is here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friends from Tennessee and Idaho, December \n11, 2009 may be remembered as the seminal moment in the health care \ndebate for those who are writing about what finally happened on this \nissue. There were two extraordinary messages delivered on this very day \non this health care issue. They were delivered from CMS and from CNN. \nCNN told us how the American people felt about it: 61 percent, as the \nSenator from Idaho pointed out, telling us please don't pass this bill. \nA week ago, Quinnipiac said 14 percent more disapproved than approved; \nthe week before Gallup said 9 percent more disapproved than approved. \nWe can see what is happening here: widening public opposition.\n  And then CMS, the actuary, the independent government employee who is \nan expert on this, says this bill, the Reid bill, doesn't do any of the \nthings it is being promoted to accomplish. So two important messages on \nDecember 11 delivered from CNN and from CMS.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I wish to thank our distinguished leader for pointing \nthat out. It has been a seminal event. As I said before, I have the \nprivilege of being chairman of the Rural Health Care Caucus. There are \nprobably 30 of us in a bipartisan caucus to try to protect and improve \nthe rural health care delivery system. I took that report by Mr. \nFoster, who is the actuary of CMS, and said, this is required reading. \nI made the point that if you mention CMS to a beleaguered hospital \nadministrator or a member of the board or any medical provider--doctor, \nnursing home, home health care, hospice; even hospice is cut in regard \nto the cuts--they know if a CMS representative is knocking on the door, \nthat is a lot like sending a cold shiver down their spine thinking it \nis Lizzie Borden. Of all of the agencies that now are shining the light \nof truth into darkness in regard to the nature of this bill in \nincreased costs, and yes, rationing--no, it is not a scare tactic--CMS \nis that agency. It would be amazing if we could get CMS to report back \non, if we knew what it was--the media reports are how we get the \ninformation on this new iteration of a bill where allegedly we are \ngoing to add in people from 55 years old into the Medicare system. You \ndo that, and now all of a sudden even the national organizations, let \nalone the State provider associations who have been opposed to this, to \nsay, Whoa, we can't do that. That is going to break the system.\n  What I wish to point out and what I think is another piece of \ninformation that has sort of been overlooked, the CBO has estimated the \ncost to the Internal Revenue Service to implement taxes and penalties \nand enforce them--I am talking about the IRS now, not CMS, but the IRS \nthat is going to implement and administer and enforce taxes and \npenalties on the bill--that cost is $10 billion estimated by CBO. That \nwould double the budget size of the IRS. We have to train these people, \nand then you have to figure out what kind of questions they are going \nto ask of employers and employees in regard to the fines and the fees, \nyou have to read the fine print. The American people understand this \ntremendous tax increase is going to be administered by the IRS and that \nis not going to be a happy circumstance. But those two things that the \nleader has brought out are absolutely primary in this debate.\n  I think a side-by-side is a straw man. I think it is very clear about \nthat. I am\n\n[[Page S13007]]\n\nhappy to comment on that further. I wish to give others an opportunity \nto speak.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I can make a short comment, I thank the Senator \nfrom Idaho for his leadership on taxes. But Senator McConnell's comment \nabout those two events on December 9--the poll from CNN and the report \nfrom the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief actuary--made \nme think about the immigration bill 2 years ago, in 2007. There were a \nlot of our best Senators working to pass comprehensive immigration \nbill, including Senators McCain, Kennedy, Kyl, Martinez, Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, who worked very hard to do it. There seemed to \nbe a sense of inevitability that that bill might pass. The President \nwas even behind it.\n  But then it began to have so many problems, and the red flags began \nto pop up just like they are popping up with this comprehensive health \ncare bill. There came a time, perhaps much like December 10, when the \nsense of inevitability was replaced by a sense that we were making a \nhistoric mistake, and a bill that got on the floor with 64 votes only \nhad 46 to get off.\n  I have a feeling this bill, the more we learn about it, the wiser \nthing to do is to let it fall of its own weight. Then we can start \nover, step by step, to reearn the trust of the American people by \nreducing health care costs. We can do that. That is the sense I have.\n  I appreciate the Republican leader's observation about those \nimportant events on the 9th.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues. I think the \ncomment of our leader is very insightful. As you start seeing the \nevidence mount, and the fact that the American public is understanding \nthe weight of this mounting evidence about this legislation, we could \nbe at the tipping point right now, where it has become so evident that \nthe purpose behind health care reform has not only been missed by this \nlegislation, but it has been made worse--the objectives.\n  I point to this chart, the cost curve. When you talk to most \nAmericans about what they believe the purpose behind health care reform \nis, the vast majority say it is to control the skyrocketing costs. \nWell, those who are promoting the bill say it does that, it bends that \ncost curve. Which cost curve? Is it the size of government? That goes \nup $2.5 trillion in the first full 10 years of implementation. The cost \nof health care--the CMS report came out, it is about the 10th report, \nbut this is from the actuary of the Medicare and Medicaid system who \nanalyzed this independently, and he says health care costs are going to \ngo up, not down.\n  The CBO said the cost of insurance is going to go up, not down. The \nFederal deficit--they say the bill doesn't make the Federal deficit go \nup. In fact, regarding that, the only way they can claim that is if \nthey implement their budget gimmicks of delaying implementation of the \nbill for 4 years on the spending side, while raising taxes now, or if \nthey raise hundreds of billions in taxes and cut Medicare by hundreds \nof billions of dollars.\n  These things are starting to be understood by the American people. \nThat is why I believe we are starting to see those kinds of answers in \nthe polls. It is not just the CNN poll, as the leader knows. Many polls \nare showing the American people get it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to get back to the side-by-side amendment \nallegedly being offered by the chairman of the Finance Committee, the \nSenator from Montana. I said straw man, and that is pretty harsh, but I \nintend it to be. We have seen how, if the language is examined, the \namendment, at a minimum, is a red herring. You can fairly say the \namendment, rather, has no other purpose than to facilitate a strong \nargument.\n  On Tuesday, when Senator Crapo laid down his amendment, the majority \ndidn't show us this side-by-side amendment until shortly before we \nthought--and they thought--we were going to vote. So that very limited \nnotice makes you think it may be more likely to distract from or muddy \nthe clear question the Senator from Idaho brought; that is, the motion \nto commit before the Senate. The motion was designed to be to be \nstraightforward, and the Senator did that.\n  A vote for the motion is a vote to send the Reid amendment and \nunderlying bill back to the Finance Committee. Under the motion, the \nFinance Committee would report back a bill that eliminates the tax \nincreases on middle-income taxpayers. One could not say it anymore \nsimply. That is what the motion does. The other bill is a straw man.\n  After the remarks by the distinguished leader, I would say this may \nbe a seminal event. I think that is one of the key votes where the \nother side could start to realize this and start to finalize this \nwithout all the rhetoric and ideology and philosophical support for \nthis bill, and they could start the road back, if you will, of doing it \nin a step-by-step, thoughtful way--doing it, meaning real health care \nreform.\n  I commend the Senator. Again, this side-by-side is a straw man. The \nSenator is clear in what he wants to do. Under the Senator's motion, \nthe Finance Committee would report back a bill that eliminates the tax \nincreases for middle-income taxpayers. We can restart the debate in a \nbipartisan way, where we can agree on many common goals. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Republican \nleader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this follows along further with my \ncolleagues who were discussing the CMS report.\n  Americans, of course, were told the purpose of reform was to lower \ncosts, to bend the so-called cost curve down. But the report released \nlast night by the administration's own independent scorekeeper, as we \nhave been discussing on the floor of the Senate, shows the Reid bill \ngets a failing grade.\n  The chief actuary is the person the administration depends on to give \nits straightforward, unbiased analysis of the impact the legislation \nwould have. This is an independent expert. It is the official referee, \nif you will. So this is quite significant.\n  According to CMS, the Reid bill increases national health spending. \nAccording to CMS, there are new fees for drugs, devices and insurance \nplans in the Reid bill and they will increase prices and health \ninsurance premiums for consumers.\n  According to CMS, claims about the Reid bill extending the solvency \nof Medicare are based on the shakiest of assumptions.\n  According to CMS, the Reid bill creates a new long-term insurance \nprogram, commonly referred to around here as the CLASS Act, that CMS \nactuaries found faces a ``very serious risk of becoming \nunsustainable.''\n  The CMS found that such programs face a significant risk of failure.\n  The Reid bill pays for a $1 trillion government expansion into health \ncare, with nearly $1 trillion in Medicare payment cuts.\n  All of this, I continue to be quoting from the CMS report.\n  The report further says the Reid bill is especially likely to result \nin providers being unwilling to treat Medicare and Medicaid patients, \nmeaning a significant portion of the increased demands for Medicaid \nservices would be difficult to meet.\n  The CMS actuary noted the Medicare cuts in the bill could jeopardize \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to care.\n  The CMS actuary also found that roughly 20 percent of all Part A \nproviders--that is hospitals and nursing homes, for example--would \nbecome unprofitable within the next 10 years as a result of these cuts. \nAs a result of those Medicare cuts, 20 percent of hospitals and nursing \nhomes would become unprofitable within 10 years.\n  The CMS actuary found that further reductions in Medicare growth \nrates through the actions of the independent Medicare advisory board, \nwhich advocates have pointed to as a central linchpin in reducing \nhealth care spending, ``may be difficult to achieve in practice.''\n  The CMS further found the Reid bill would cut payments to Medicare \nAdvantage plans by approximately $110 billion over 10 years, resulting \nin ``less\n\n[[Page S13008]]\n\ngenerous benefit packages'' and decreasing enrollment in Medicare \nAdvantage plans by about 33 percent. That is a 33-percent decrease in \nMedicare Advantage enrollment over 10 years.\n  What should we conclude from this CMS report? The report confirms \nwhat we have known all along: The Reid plan will increase costs, raise \npremiums, and slash Medicare.\n  That is not reform. The analysis speaks for itself. This day, this \nFriday, as we were discussing yesterday, is a seminal moment. We have \nheard from CMS, the Government's objective actuary, the bill fails to \nmeet any of the objectives we all had in mind. We also heard from CNN \nabout how the American people feel about this package: 61 percent are \nopposed; only 36 percent are in support.\n  The American people are asking us not to pass this, and the Center \nfor Medicaid Services' actuary is telling us it doesn't achieve the \ngoals that were desired at the outset.\n  How much more do we need to hear? How much more do we need to hear \nbefore we stop this bill and start over and go step by step to deal \nwith the cost issue, which the American people thought we were going to \naddress in this debate?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are in our discussion of health care. We \nhave been focused on a couple of major goals. The obvious goals that I \nthink are a major part of the legislation we are debating are \ncontrolling costs, the goal of providing better quality of care, \nproviding health care to millions of Americans--tens of millions, \nreally--who would have no chance to get that kind of coverage without \nthis legislation, and also the concern we have about not only \ncontrolling costs, but we have legislation on the floor that actually \nreduces the deficit by $130 billion and beyond the 10 years by hundreds \nof billions.\n  One of the concerns we have is that in the midst of a health care \ndebate about numbers and the details of the programs is that we also do \nnot forget that some parts of our health care system work well but \noften might need an adjustment or an amendment or a change that would \nbenefit a vulnerable population of Americans who do not have the kind \nof coverage or protection or peace of mind they should have.\n  One of the more successful parts of our health care system as it \nrelates to new parents, especially new mothers and new children, is \nwhat is known by the broad category of nurse home visitation programs. \nThey have been enormously successful over many years.\n  I have an amendment I filed for this health care bill called the \nnurse home visitation Medicaid option amendment. It sounds a little \ncomplicated, but it is actually rather simple. It is part of what we \nneed to do in the next couple of days and weeks as we complete our work \non health care.\n  One point to make initially is that we know these nurse home \nvisitation programs work. They get results for new parents, new \nmothers, and have positive benefits to a new mother and her children.\n  We all have had the experience, if we are parents, of the anxieties \nof what it is like to be a new parent but especially what a new mother \ngoes through--all of the anxiety. It is not limited to one income \ngroup. No matter what income you are, no matter what background, it is \na challenge to fully understand what it is like to have a baby and to \ncare for that child appropriately. That is one of the underlying \nconcerns we have.\n  In our health care system, we have to do everything possible to give \nthat child a healthy start in life, and the best way to give a child a \nhealthy start is to make sure his or her mother--and hopefully both \nparents--is able to handle the pressures and manage the anxieties that \nso many new parents have.\n  The amendment I filed supports optional nurse home visits. That means \nthat if someone chooses not to take advantage of this program, \nobviously, they do not have to. The amendment simplifies the process \nfor providers of nurse home visitation to seek Medicaid reimbursement. \nSome will say there is Medicaid reimbursement now. Yes, there is, but \nit gets complicated to a point where a lot of States are not getting \nthe full benefit of that reimbursement. This amendment will impact the \nlives of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women and their children, and the \nimpact is profound. The amendment is cosponsored by Senator Gillibrand \nof New York. It will allow States the option to seek more adequate \nreimbursement for nurse home visitation services. Again, a State is not \nforced to seek greater reimbursement, but I believe a lot of States \ncould and should take advantage of this kind of an option.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have been trying to do this for years, even in \nthe midst of having very effective nurse home visitation programs. One \ncan just imagine how valuable that is for a new mother, that they can \nget advice and help from a nurse or another kind of professional and \nget them through the early days and weeks of being a new parent.\n  I believe a State such as Pennsylvania that has had a track record of \nthese kinds of programs that have a direct and positive impact on \nchildren and their families, their mothers especially, should be able \nto take advantage of this, as I am sure many other States.\n  The amendment helps States cut through the redtape and allow these \nevidence-based nurse home visitation services--let me say those words \nagain: ``evidence-based.'' This is not some theory; this is not some \nmaybe--let's try to create a program. These programs work. The evidence \nis, in a word, irrefutable over many years that these nurse home \nvisitation programs work. We want to allow States to be reimbursed \nunder a State Medicaid option.\n  We have about 30 years of research to back up the following claims. \nLet me give four or five points.\n  We start with a category for every 100,000 families who are served by \nnurse home visitation programs or nurse-family partnership programs--\nall in that same category.\n  For every 100,000 families, 14,000 fewer children will be \nhospitalized for injuries and 300 fewer infants will die in their first \nyear of life. That alone, that number alone is worth making sure States \nhave this option. What is the price of saving 300 infants a year out of \n100,000 families? It is incalculable. There is no value we could put on \nthat kind of lifesaving as well as down the road saving money.\n  Let me give a couple of other examples.\n  For every 100,000 families served by these nurse home visitation-type \nprograms, 11,000 fewer children will develop language delays by age 2. \nThat is a profound impact on the child--his or her ability to achieve \nin school and then his or her ability to develop a high skill and \ntherefore contribute positively to our economy. There is no price one \ncan put on 11,000 new children learning more at a younger age.\n  Out of 100,000 families, 23,000 fewer children will suffer child \nabuse and neglect in the first 15 years of life. Again, there is no way \nwe can quantify that with a number or budget estimate. But I would like \nto say we support strategies around here that are evidenced-based and \nscientifically based to make sure children are not abused, that they \nlive through the first couple years of their lives when they are at \nrisk of dying.\n  One more statistic. Out of the 100,000 families we use as a \nmeasurement, 22,000 fewer children will be arrested and enter the \ncriminal justice system in the first 15 years of their lives. Just like \nthe statistic about the first year of life and surviving the first year \nof life or not having in this case 23,000 more children suffer child \nabuse and neglect, these are impossible to measure. In a sense, it is \nthe measure itself that we save children's lives, we make them \nhealthier. They and their families are able to contribute more to \nsociety.\n  This is the right thing to do to give our States the option--just the \noption--of seeking greater reimbursement for these important services. \nI have seen it firsthand.\n  Many years ago--it must be at least 10 years ago--in Pennsylvania, I \nactually went to the home of a brand-new mother, a lower income mother \nin northeastern Pennsylvania. We walked\n\n[[Page S13009]]\n\nin the door, with her permission, with the nurse who was working with \nher after she left the hospital with her new baby. There is no way to \nput into words how valuable that relationship was between a new mother \nand a nurse, between a new mother and a health care professional to \ngive her the start in any circumstance but especially if a new mother \nhas financial pressures which are extraordinary and almost unbearable \nfor some new mothers or has pressures as it relates to her husband or \nboyfriend, whoever is part of her life. Sometimes there is violence. \nSometimes there are other pressures that some of us cannot even begin \nto imagine, in addition to the obvious pressure of being a new mother, \nbeing a new parent, and wanting to do the right thing.\n  These programs, as the evidence and science tell us, work to give new \nmothers peace of mind and to give States the ability to directly and \npositively impact the lives of that new mother and her child.\n  So we should give States this option, and that is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support the nurse home visitation Medicaid option \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks Senator Brown of Ohio and then Senator LeMieux of Florida be \nrecognized in that order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, each day it seems there is a new analysis of \nthe Democratic proposal on health care that suggests it is not such a \ngreat idea. Today, a devastating report was made public by the Obama \nadministration itself--the Department of Health and Human Services--and \ntheir group that is in charge of Medicare and Medicaid. It goes by the \ninitials CMS. Specifically, the Chief Actuary, Richard S. Foster, of \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, issued a report about \nthe effect of the Reid legislation on health care as it pertains to a \nwhole variety of things--the cost of the legislation, the effect it is \ngoing to have on taxes, on premiums, on benefits, the cost with respect \nto Medicare and the kinds of things that will occur to beneficiaries in \nMedicare, and so on. It is a complete report by a person who I think \nall would agree is not only qualified to speak to these things but also \nquite objective, as the chief actuary of CMS. He reached a number of \nvery interesting conclusions, and I want to briefly discuss eight of \nthem.\n  The first thing is that he noted his estimates were actually not a \nfull 10-year estimate, and I will quote what he said here.\n\n       Because of these transition effects and the fact that most \n     of the coverage provisions would be in effect for only 6 of \n     the 10 years of the budget period, the cost estimates shown \n     in this memorandum do not represent a full 10-year cost for \n     the proposed legislation.\n\n  The reason that is important is we have been saying here for quite a \nlong time that you can't just look at the first 10 years in order to \nsee the full impact of this legislation because for the first 4 years \nmost of the benefits don't exist. They are simply collecting taxes and \nfees and revenues, and then is when the benefits kick in, as a result \nof which, when they say it is all in balance, it is in balance because \nthey are collecting money for 10 years but they only have to pay for \nbenefits for 6 of those 10 years. So the real question is: What does it \ncost over the first full 10 years of implementation? And it turns out \nthat is about $2.5 trillion.\n  We have known this, and we have made the point. I think even the \nchairman of the Finance Committee has acknowledged the $2.5 trillion if \nyou take the first 10 years of implementation. But I think it is good \nto actually have that confirmed now by the Chief Actuary of CMS.\n  Secondly, a point I have been making all along is that when the \nPresident said repeatedly: If you like your insurance, you get to keep \nit, that is not true; and it is not true for a variety of reasons under \nthe bill, and again this report confirms what we have been saying is in \nfact true; namely, that a number of workers who currently have \nemployer-sponsored insurance would lose their coverage. In addition to \nthat, seniors who are enrolled in private Medicare plans, which are \nknown as the Medicare Advantage plans, would lose benefits, and many of \nthem would no longer be covered.\n  Let me read two quotations, first relative to employer-sponsored \ninsurance; and, second, people who are on Medicare Advantage plans. I \nam quoting now.\n\n       Some smaller employers would be inclined to terminate their \n     existing coverage, and companies with low average salaries \n     might find it to their and their employees' advantage to end \n     their plans. The per-worker penalties assessed on \n     nonparticipating employers are very low compared to \n     prevailing health insurance costs. As a result, the penalties \n     would not be a significant deterrent to dropping or forgoing \n     coverage.\n\n  What does that mean? The employer under this bill has an obligation \nto provide insurance to his or her employees. If they don't do that, \nthen they pay a penalty. The problem is that the penalty is much less \nthan the cost of buying the insurance. So what we have been saying all \nalong, and what the CMS actuary confirms here, is that in a lot of \ncases, small employers--and particularly companies with low average \nsalaries--will find it to their advantage to drop the insurance \ncoverage and have their folks go into the so-called exchange programs. \nThe penalty these employers pay will be much less than what they are \npaying now to provide insurance.\n  So these folks who are very happy with the insurance they have right \nnow are not going to be very happy when they get something \nsubstantially less than that through the so-called exchange. They may \nlike the coverage they have now, but, unfortunately, what the President \npromised, that they would get to keep it, is not true. And this is \nconfirmed by what I read to you.\n  What about folks on Medicare Advantage? These are senior citizens \nabove 65 who are on Medicare, and what they have chosen to participate \nin is the private insurance coverage component of Medicare called \nMedicare Advantage. Here is the quotation.\n\n       Lower benchmarks would reduce Medicare Advantage rebates to \n     plans and thereby result in less generous benefit packages. \n     We estimate that in 2015, when the competitive benchmarks \n     would be fully phased in, enrollment in Medicare Advantage \n     plans would decrease by about 33 percent.\n\n  Everybody has acknowledged there would be a reduction, but there has \nbeen little debate about how much it would be. Our initial projections \nare borne out by the CMS actuary--a decrease in enrollment in Medicare \nAdvantage by about 33 percent. That is a third. This is important to me \nbecause 337,000 Arizonans participate in Medicare Advantage--almost 40 \npercent of all our seniors. And a third of them, if this works across \nthe board, are going to lose their plan because of this. In any event, \nthey are all going to lose benefits because of ``the result in less \ngenerous benefit packages.''\n  This hasn't been much in dispute, because the Congressional Budget \nOffice itself has described precisely how much the benefit packages \nwill be reduced by, and it is 90-some dollars. It is from 130-some \ndollars in actuarial value down to 40-some dollars in actuarial value, \nwhich is a huge reduction, obviously. So reduction in benefits; a third \nof the people no longer on Medicare Advantage. The bottom line, whether \nyou are privately insured through your employer or you are a senior \ncitizen in Medicare Advantage, you are not going to be able to keep the \nbenefits and the plan you like and have, notwithstanding the \nPresident's commitment to the contrary.\n  Third, Medicare cuts. We have been talking a lot about Medicare cuts, \nand my colleagues on the other side say: Well, we don't think that the \nMedicare cuts are the way you describe them. Seniors are still going to \nhave access to doctors and so on. This report is devastating in blowing \na hole in that argument. Let me quote a couple of the things they say.\n\n       Providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive \n     portion of their business could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end \n     their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing \n     access to care for beneficiaries).\n\n  This is what we have been predicting. If you impose extra costs and \nmandates\n\n[[Page S13010]]\n\non the people who are providing the care--whether it be the hospitals, \nthe physicians, home health care, or if you are taxing something such \nas medical devices--all of those impose costs on the people who are \nproviding these medical benefits. What the CMS actuary is saying here \nis that the combination of those things would potentially jeopardize \naccess to care for the beneficiaries. There aren't going to be as many \nof these people in business to provide care for an increasing number of \npeople.\n  Let me go on with the quotation that I think will make this clear:\n       Simulations by the Office of the Actuary suggest that \n     roughly 20 percent of Part A providers [hospitals, nursing \n     homes, home health] would become unprofitable within the 10 \n     year projection period as a result of the productivity \n     adjustments.\n\n  In other words, 20 percent of the hospitals, home health care folks \nand others are not going to be profitable anymore. They are going to be \nout of business because of the burdens that are being placed upon them \nin this legislation. What happens when you have the baby boomers going \ninto the Medicare Program? Under the latest idea from the other side of \nthe aisle, we are even going to have 30 million potentially being able \nto join Medicare--the folks from 55 up to 65--but you are going to \nreduce by 20 percent the number of folks to take care of them--the \nhospitals and home health care and so on. Obviously, you have a big \nproblem. Access will be jeopardized, as the actuary says.\n  This is where rationing, in effect, comes in. There simply aren't \nenough doctors, hospitals, and others to care for the number of \npatients who want to see them. This is how it starts. First, long \ndelays, long lines, long waiting periods before you can get your \nappointment, and eventually denial of care because there is simply \nnobody to take care of you.\n  This is exacerbated by something else in the legislation, which is \nthe fourth point here. The actuary talks about the independent Medicare \nadvisory board. What is happening is that Medicare is being cut in \nthree different ways: one, Medicare Advantage, which I mentioned; two, \nthe providers are being slashed in the reimbursements that they are \nreceiving; and three, this legislation creates an independent Medicare \nadvisory board that is supposed to make recommendations on how to \neffect huge reductions in the cost of Medicare, and the primary way \nthey will do that is by reducing the amount of money paid to doctors, \nto hospitals, to others who take care of patients. That, obviously, \nwill also result in less care for the senior citizens.\n  If the cuts are so drastic that Congress says no, we are not going to \ndo them, then you don't have the savings the bill relies upon to pay \nfor the new entitlement. So one of two things happens, and they are \nboth disastrous: Either you have these huge cuts, which are devastating \nfor access to care or the cuts are so unrealistic they do not go into \neffect, in which case the legislation can't be paid for. And then I \nguess you are going to have to raise taxes on the American people \nbecause you aren't able to effect the savings from Medicare.\n  Here is what the actuary says:\n\n       In general, limiting cost growth to a level below medical \n     price inflation alone would represent an exceedingly \n     difficult challenge.\n\n  That is the challenge being put before them here--an exceedingly \ndifficult challenge.\n\n       Actual Medicare cost growth per beneficiary was below the \n     target level in only 4 of the last 25 years, with 3 of those \n     years immediately following the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; \n     the impact of the BBA prompted Congress to pass legislation \n     in 1999 and 2000 moderating many of the BBA provisions.\n\n  What does that mean? In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget \nAct, which drastically reduced the payments to these providers in order \nto cut the cost of Medicare. Three out of the four years in which the \ncosts were reduced, it was immediately following that legislation. But \nstarting in 1999 and into the year 2000, Congress realized those cuts \nwere too deep; you were not going to get doctors and hospitals to \ncontinue to take care of patients if we continued to cut what they were \npaid for their services. So the cuts were ameliorated and, as a result, \nthe savings were not achieved.\n  What the actuary is saying here is if that same thing happens again, \nif these cuts are so drastic we actually don't let them go into effect \nbecause they would be self-defeating, then you will not have the \nsavings that have been promised and scored here as enabling this \nlegislation to be so-called ``budget neutral.'' It won't be budget \nneutral. So as I said, one of two things will happen, and both are bad. \nEither you have the cuts, which are devastating for seniors or you \ndon't have them and they are devastating to taxpayers.\n  Five is Medicare expansion. I think all of us agree on both sides of \nthe aisle that Medicaid is a very vexing problem because the States \nhave to pay for a percentage of the Medicaid patients and the States \nare generally in very poor financial shape and they do not need more \npeople added to the Medicaid rolls that can't pay for them.\n  My Governor was in town earlier this week, and she said: Please, \nplease, don't add people to the Medicaid rolls and expect the States \nare going to be able to pay for them. Let me read a couple of the \nquotes from this actuarial report.\n\n       Providers might tend to accept more patients who have \n     private insurance (with relatively attractive payment rates) \n     and fewer Medicare or Medicaid patients, exacerbating \n     existing access problems for the latter group.\n\n  That latter group, of course, is the Medicaid group. The problem is \nthat reimbursement is so low for Medicaid, frankly, they are the last \npatients a doctor sees, and their care is not the best. If we are going \nto provide care for a group of people, we need to do it right. \nUnfortunately, this is how rationing begins if you don't have enough \nmoney to do it right.\n  Then let me conclude with this quotation.\n\n       [This] possibly is especially likely in the case of the \n     substantially higher volume of Medicaid services, where \n     provider payment rates are well below average.\n\n  And that is my point.\n\n       Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a significant \n     portion of the increased demand for Medicaid would be \n     difficult to meet, particularly over the first few years.\n\n  What they are saying is that there aren't going to be the physicians \nand the other people to care for the Medicaid patients here and, as a \nresult, the promise we have made to these people we are not going to be \nable to keep.\n  Enrolling in Medicaid does not guarantee access to care by a long \nshot.\n  No. 6. Again, this is something we have been saying. This is not \nreally too controversial because the Congressional Budget Office has \nsaid the same thing that the Actuary here says. But it is always good \nto have a backup opinion. This is the tax on drugs, on devices, and on \ninsurance plans. We have all been saying of course those costs are \npassed on to the consumer in the form of higher premiums or, in a \ncouple of cases, higher taxes. That is what is demonstrated:\n\n       Consumers will face even higher costs as a result of the \n     new taxes on the health care sector.\n\n  I might just say before I read the quotation here, it doesn't make \nany sense to me why, in order to pay for this new entitlement, you \nwould tax the very people you want to take care of. Tax the doctors, \ninsurance companies, device manufacturers that make the diabetes pump \nor the stent for a heart patient or some other device that improves our \nhealth care these days? Let's tax them? I am saying maybe you want to \ntax liquor or tobacco or something, but why tax the things that make \npeople healthier? Go figure. That is what the bill does.\n  Here is what the Actuary says:\n\n       We anticipate that such fees would generally be passed \n     through to the health consumers in the form of higher drug \n     and device prices and higher insurance premiums, with an \n     associated increase of approximately $11 billion per year in \n     overall national health expenditures, beginning in 2011.\n\n  Remember how we were going to drive costs down with this bill? We \nweren't going to be paying as much? The Actuary says:\n\n       We anticipate such fees would be generally passed through \n     to the consumers in the form of higher drug and device prices \n     and higher insurance premiums, with an associated increase of \n     $11 billion a year.\n\n  This is going backward, not forward. The whole idea was to reduce \ncosts and premiums. Instead, they are going up.\n  No. 7. Here is another tax. We are going to tax the higher premium \nplans. In response--this is a 40-percent tax on\n\n[[Page S13011]]\n\nthese plans. What will employers do? According to the Actuary:\n\n       . . . employers will reduce employees' health care \n     benefits.\n\n  That makes sense. If you are going to tax an insurance plan that has \na lot of good benefits in it, then the employer is going to say: Rather \nthan paying that tax, I will reduce the benefits--precisely what CMS \nsays. This is another case in which if you like what you have, sorry, \nyou are not going to get to keep it. We are going to tax it. Then the \nemployer is going to reduce the benefits.\n  Here is the quotation from CMS:\n\n       In reaction to the excise tax, many employers would reduce \n     the scope of their health benefits.\n\n  This is exactly what we have been saying.\n  Here are seven specific ways in which the CMS Actuary, working for \nthe Obama administration Department of Health and Human Services, has \nverified the complaints Republicans have been making about this \nlegislation for weeks--that it will raise premiums, it will raise \ntaxes, it will raise costs. It will raise the cost of health care. It \nwill raise the cost to the government. It will provide fewer benefits. \nIt will result in the transition of people from private insurance to \nthe exchange which is created in here and will result in less access to \ncare because there will be fewer providers to take care of more people. \nWhat a wonderful reform.\n  This is why, when I talk about this legislation, I do not talk of \nhealth care reform. I am reminded of the line from a novel in which the \nindividual says:\n\n       Reform, sir? Don't talk of reform. Things are bad enough \n     already.\n\n  Indeed, they are. We do have problems. One of those problems is \npremium costs going up.\n  I note that my colleagues in the House of Representatives on the \nRepublican side offered an amendment which, according to calculations \nof the Congressional Budget Office and according to the House \nRepublicans, would have actually reduced premiums by $3,000 a year for \nthe average family rather than increasing them. Republicans have good \nideas about attacking the specific problems we face today. What we do \nnot need is something under the guise of reform which is so massive, so \nintrusive into our lives and, with all due respect, not well thought \nout in terms of its long-range implications.\n  What you end up with at the end of the day, according to CMS now, \naccording to the Actuary of the U.S. Government Health and Human \nServices, CMS, it raises premiums, raises taxes, reduces access to \ncare, increases the cost, and provides fewer benefits. I cannot imagine \nhow we could go home at Christmastime and say to our constituents: This \nis what we are giving you for Christmas this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to a \nprovision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that would \nimpose a 40 percent excise tax on certain health insurance plans.\n  It is my strong belief that a benefits tax is the wrong way to pay \nfor health reform legislation.\n  Beginning in 2013, this legislation would impose an excise tax of 40 \npercent on insurance companies and plan administrations for any health \ninsurance plan that is above the threshold of $8,500 for singles and \n$23,000 for family plans.\n  The tax would apply to the amount of the premium in excess of the \nthreshold.\n  This tax would not only be imposed on basic health benefits, it would \nbe imposed if the combined value of basic benefits, dental benefits, \nand vision benefits reaches the $8,500 limit.\n  In other words, Americans would be better off without dental and \nvision coverage than with it.\n  How could a disincentive to dental and vision coverage be a good \nidea? The answer is, ``it's not.''\n  In subsequent years, increases in the benefit thresholds will be tied \nto the consumer price index plus one percent.\n  What this means is that more and more workers and employers will be \naffected in subsequent years.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that, by \n2016, this benefits tax would affect 19 percent of workers with \nemployer-provided health coverage.\n  CBO further projects that revenues resulting from the tax would \nincrease by 10-15 percent every year in the second decade after the tax \ntakes effect.\n  And though this appears to be a tax on insurance companies, we should \nnot be fooled.\n  Insurance companies are likely to pass these costs onto their \ncustomers--forcing employees to pay higher premiums or encouraging \nemployers to cut or limit coverage.\n  Health reform legislation should not penalize middle-income Americans \nwho have forgone salary and wage increases in return for more generous \nhealth benefits.\n  I remember, as the Presiding Officer in his leadership in the Banking \nCommittee remembers, during the auto discussions, when President Bush \nfirst moved to help the auto companies that were under such duress, \nmany people on the other side of the aisle saw the legacy costs as \nsomething bad, the legacy costs the auto companies had. In fact, these \nlegacy costs were benefits negotiated by unions. Those workers had been \nwilling to give up present-day wages to have better health insurance \nand better pensions. This is the same kind of issue.\n  And health reform legislation should not encourage the elimination of \nexisting health benefits.\n  Instead, health reform legislation should ensure that Americans who \nhave negotiated good health benefits--including dental and vision \ncoverage--are able to keep those benefits without punishment.\n  I have heard many of my colleagues argue that this excise tax will \n``bend the cost curve'' of health care costs and expenditures.\n  However, the Commonwealth Fund found that ``there is little empirical \nevidence that such a tax wcould have a substantial effect on health \ncare spending.''\n  And is makes no sense to bend the cost curve by compromising access \nto needed health services now--leading to higher health care costs \nlater.\n  You are squeezing on a balloon, not changing the long-term trajectory \nof health spending.\n  To bend the cost curve, we need to identify and reward the provision \nof the right care, in the right settings, at the right time.\n  We need to target duplication, promote best practices, and clamp down \non those who overprice health insurance and health care products and \nservices--exploiting their role in ensuring the health of the American \npeople.\n  We need to give Americans more purchasing power and inject more \ncompetition into the health care marketplace.\n  We don't need to reverse the clock on health care progress by \ndiscouraging Americans from having good health coverage.\n  There is so much that is critically important in health reform \nlegislation--from delivery system reforms to prevention and wellness \ninitiatives to provisions which strengthen Medicare to making insurance \nmore affordable and accessible for all Americans--but this \ncounterproductive tax on middle-income Americans is not a provision I \ncan support.\n  That is why I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator Sanders of \nVermont that would eliminate this benefits tax and instead impose a \nsurtax on the very wealthiest earners--those who benefitted so much \nfrom the Bush-era tax cuts.\n  Our amendment, as modified, would replace the benefits tax on health \ninsurance plans with a 5.4 percent surtax on adjusted gross income for \nindividuals who earn more than $2.4 million a year and couples who earn \nmore than $4.8 million per year.\n  Instead of taxing middle class Americans for having good health \ncoverage, our amendment would help address the disproportionate impact \nof the Bush tax cuts--which were outrageously tilted toward the \nwealthiest of the wealthy.\n  Multimillionaires and billionaires fared far better than middle-class \nfamilies under the Bush Administration. Let's not continue that \ntradition in this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, it is always good to follow my colleague \nfrom\n\n[[Page S13012]]\n\nOhio. I rise to speak about the health care bill. I, specifically, wish \nto speak about this new report we have received from the Office of the \nActuary from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This report, \nunfortunately, confirms many of the problems we already knew. This \nreport comes from an independent actuary who works in the very agencies \nthat have to implement our Federal health care programs. This actuary \nhas reviewed the proposal before us, the proposal that is intended to \nbe health care reform. The review and report of this actuary shows \nsignificant problems with this proposal and why we must start over and \ntake a step-by-step approach.\n  I had the opportunity to read this report this afternoon in my \noffice, word for word, and go through it line by line. I hope all my \ncolleagues do on both sides of the aisle. There are many troubling \nthings this report shines light upon. First, the proposal we are \ndebating increases the cost of health care. For Americans who are at \nhome and might be watching this to see various Senators on the floor of \nthis great body, they think the reason we are here is to reduce the \ncost of health care and to promote more access. Those are the two big \ngoals. That is what the President told us. We are going to lower the \ncost of health care. This report shows, national health care \nexpenditures are going to go up from 16 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct to 20 percent.\n  The chief actuary says, on page 4 of this report, we are going to \nspend $234 billion more on health care over the next 10 years. We are \ngoing to spend more on health care. We are not going to reduce costs. \nWe are going to increase costs.\n  Moreover, the Federal Government, in its provision of health care, is \ngoing to spend $366 billion more in health care provisions. We are told \nthis proposal is budget neutral or it actually creates less of a \ndeficit. It cuts the deficit of the Federal budget. But as has been \nrevealed this week--and this is just gimmickry--the taxes start before \nthe benefits. For 4 years, we pay the taxes and the benefits don't \nstart until 2014. So 4 years of penalties without any benefits. This is \nsimilar to if you were to go buy a home and you went to buy the home \nand you said: We are going to live here for the next 10 years, and the \nreal estate agent said to you: That is fine. You are just going to pay \nfor the first 4 years, but you don't get to move in until 2014.\n  For families sitting around the kitchen tables, that is not how they \nbalance their budgets. But that is this strange world that Washington \nis, that you can set up this budget gimmickry in order to get it to so-\ncalled budget neutrality. The actuary of CMS recognizes that. He says, \non page 2, most of the coverage provisions would be in effect for only \n6 of the 10 years of the budget period.\n\n       The cost estimates shown in this memorandum do not \n     represent a full 10-year cost of the proposed legislation.\n\n  It is not budget neutral. It is just a gimmick.\n  The second problem the actuary points to is, it jeopardizes access to \ncare for seniors. My colleagues have been saying this for the past \ncouple weeks. You can't take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and have \nit not hurt the provision of health care for seniors. This plan is \ngoing to gut Medicare as we know it. It severely cuts funding for \nMedicare.\n  In this report, it goes through all the cuts to Medicare Advantage, \nto home health, to hospice. The actuary goes through all these cuts. \nWhat does the actuary conclude is going to be the result? Our friends \non the other side of the aisle say this is not going to cut Medicare; \nit is going to save Medicare. How do you take $\\1/2\\ trillion out and \nsave Medicare? The actuary understands it. He knows that doctors who \nprovide services under Medicare for seniors or for the poor under \nMedicaid aren't going to take these reimbursements anymore. They will \nnot see people and provide health care. So it is not health care reform \nif the doctor will not see you.\n  Right now, in this country 24 percent of doctors aren't taking \nMedicare; 40 percent are not taking Medicaid. The actuary says \nproviders for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive portion of their \nbusiness could find it difficult to remain profitable and might end \ntheir participation in the program, possibly jeopardizing access to \ncare for beneficiaries.\n  The second reason we are doing health care reform, access to care, is \ngoing to be hurt for seniors by this bill. That is on page 9, for those \nwho are following at home. By the way, we are going to put this report \non our Web site at lemieux.senate.gov. If you want to read it, you can \nread all the details.\n  The next thing the actuary discovers as a problem with this bill is \nthat for the 170 to 180 million Americans who have health insurance, \nyour premiums are going to go up, not down. We are not going to bend \nthe cost curve down. Health care will be more expensive, more expensive \nthan if we were to do nothing and not implement this bill at all.\n  The chief actuary says premiums for the government-run plan, for \nexample, would be 4 percent higher than for private insurers. So we \ndon't achieve that goal. What is going to happen when we put all this \nburden on businesses? Because we know that under this program we are \ngoing to penalize businesses if they don't provide health insurance. We \nare going to penalize individuals if they don't provide health \ninsurance. So what are small businesses going to do who are hardly \nmaking it now? In Florida, we have 11 percent unemployment. Our small \nbusinesses are suffering.\n  The actuary says on page 7, some small employers would be inclined to \nterminate their existing coverage. So they will drop their health \ninsurance. You are an employee in a small business, they drop your \nhealth insurance. Now you must go buy the Federal program, where you \nwill be subsidized. What does that mean? It means every man and woman \nwill be paying taxes to help pay for health care insurance, taxes we \ncan't afford, spending we can't afford, not in a world where we have a \n$12 trillion budget deficit. We are just pushing the cost off on our \nchildren and grandchildren. That is when this deficit is going to come \nhome to roost.\n  The actuary also says the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance is going to cause employers to scale back coverage. So \nif you have one of the better health care plans, the Cadillac plans, \nyour employer will not be incentivized to give you less coverage, less \nbenefits, less access. Is that what we thought reform was supposed to \nbe?\n\n  Now we also know from the actuary we are going to raise taxes in this \nbill. As my friend, the Senator from Arizona, was saying, we are going \nto tax device makers. We are going to tax pharmaceutical companies, the \nimplements and devices and medicines that save our lives. We know there \nis $64 billion in penalties in this bill. The actuary says, on page 5, \nif you are a small business or you are an individual and you don't \nprovide the insurance, you are going to be taxed, penalized, $64 \nbillion in penalties.\n  The actuary says:\n\n       We anticipate that such fees would generally be passed to \n     health consumers--\n\n  These are the taxes on the devices and the drugs--\n\n     in the form of higher prices and higher insurance premiums.\n\n  I also wish to address one point before concluding. My friends on the \nother side have been saying there are not going to be any cuts to \nbenefits because we will run a more efficient system. There is going to \nbe less fraud and abuse and waste.\n  We all want that. That makes a lot of sense. But the actuary, in \nevaluating this--and he talks about it on page 12--finds that the cuts \nand the reductions are negligible. In fact, he can't even sufficiently \nprovide evidence to know what the estimates of savings might be; at \nbest, $2.3 billion for all the efficiency and savings. Remember, this \nis a $2.5 trillion program. There is $2.3 billion in savings, like 1 \npercent. So it is not the efficiency that is going to make up the cuts; \nit is going to be a cut in benefits to seniors. It will be higher \ninsurance premiums for Americans. That is not health care reform.\n  It is why the Wall Street Journal called this bill the worst bill \never. In talking about this new proposal to expand Medicare and drop \nthe age for Medicare, this morning the Wall Street Journal corrected \nitself and said that is even worse than the worst bill ever.\n  Similar to the Presiding Officer, I am new to this Chamber. I have \nbeen here\n\n[[Page S13013]]\n\nabout 90 days. It is a great honor to serve in the Senate, representing \n18 million people from Florida, but it is also a little bit \nfrustrating. The way the Senate works is not the real world. It is not \nlike moms and dads who sit around the kitchen table and try to figure \nout how to make ends meet and they can only spend as much money as they \ntake in. That is not how we work in this institution. We don't work in \na reasonable way.\n  My colleague from Utah will speak in a minute. He was on the floor \nthe other night talking eloquently about how, when you do real reform, \nyou get 80 Senators to vote on a proposal. If this bill passes, 60 \nDemocrats will vote for it, 40 Republicans will not. If just one \nDemocrat would feel their conscience and not vote for this bill, we \ncould start over. We could work together in a bipartisan way and help \nthose 45 million Americans who don't have health insurance. But we \nwouldn't do it by robbing from Medicare. We wouldn't do it by raising \ntaxes. We wouldn't do it by creating a $2.5 trillion new program.\n  I have struggled to try to figure out a way to explain to the people \nhow bad this bill is. I know it is hard. You are sitting at home, \naround the kitchen table, trying to understand what Washington is up \nto. It is hard to understand. I have thought about cultural references \nand historical references, maybe even things in pop culture that I \ncould use as an analogy to try to explain what is going on in the \nSenate. The only thing I can think of is the ``Wizard of Oz.'' In the \n``Wizard of Oz,'' Dorothy gets thrown into the tornado in sort of an \nalternate reality, a place that doesn't play by the same rules. That is \nsort of the Congress. Dorothy and the lion and the tin man and the \nscarecrow are told: Follow the yellow brick road, you will get there. \nAll your answers will be solved. Everything will be great.\n  That is sort of like this phrase we hear around here: Make history, \nmake history, just get it done. Pay no attention to the cuts in \nMedicare. Pay no attention to the Medicaid you will put on the States \nthat can't afford it. Pay no attention to the higher taxes and the \nhigher premiums people will have to suffer under. Similar to the \nscarecrow, who doesn't have a brain, it is not very thoughtful to put \nmore expenses and more taxes on the States with Medicaid when they \ncan't afford it. Similar to the tin man, who doesn't have a heart, it \nis not very thoughtful to take money out of health care for seniors. \nSimilar to the lion, who has no courage, we don't have the courage to \ndo what is right and work together in a bipartisan way. When you get to \nthe end of the yellow brick road and you get to Oz, you find out there \nis nothing behind the curtain.\n  This isn't health care reform. We need to start over, and we need to \nget it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida. People need to listen to him. I \nam grateful to have him in the Senate, a fine man he is and a good \nexample to all of us. I appreciate his remarks.\n  I rise to explain why I believe the Reid health care bill is not only \nbad policy for this country but also undermines the Constitution and \nthe liberty it makes possible. I urge my colleagues to resist two \nerrors that can distort our judgment and lead us down the wrong \npath. Those errors are assuming that the Constitution allows whatever \nwe want to do and ignoring this question altogether.\n\n  We have only the powers the Constitution grants us because liberty \nrequires limits on government power and we have our own responsibility \nto make sure we stay within those limits.\n  James Madison said that if men were angels, no government would be \nnecessary, and if angels were to govern men, no limits on government \nwould be necessary. Because neither men nor the governments they create \nare angelic, government and limits on government are both necessary to \nprotect liberty--not just government but limits on government as well. \nThose limits come primarily from a written Constitution which delegates \nenumerated powers to the Federal Government.\n  Here is how the Supreme Court put it just a few years ago. This is in \nUnited States v. Morrison in 2000, quoting Marbury v. Madison--one of \nthe most important decisions ever by the Supreme Court, probably the \nsingle most important decision--back in 1803:\n\n       Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more \n     of its powers enumerated in the Constitution. ``The powers of \n     the legislature are defined and limited; and that those \n     limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is \n     written.''\n\n  The important word there happens to be ``limits.''\n  No one likes limits, least of all politicians with grand plans and \naggressive agendas. It is tempting to ignore or forget the limits the \nConstitution imposes on us by pretending the Constitution means \nwhatever we want it to mean. But we take an oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution, not to make the Constitution support and defend us. \nThe Constitution cannot limit government if government controls the \nConstitution.\n  In April 1992, during a debate on welfare reform legislation, the \nsenior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, with whom I served, made a \npoint of order that an amendment offered by a Republican Senator was \nunconstitutional. Here is what Senator Moynihan said:\n\n       We do not take an oath to balance the budget, and we do not \n     take an oath to bring about universal peace, but we do take \n     an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n\n  Applying that sage advice today, we do not take an oath to reform the \nhealth care system or to bring about universal insurance coverage, but \nwe do take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  For the past 8 years, my friends on the other side of the aisle \ninsisted that the Constitution sets definite and objective limits that \nthe President must obey. The Constitution, they said, does not mean \nwhatever the President wants it to mean. Compelling circumstances or \neven national crises, they said, cannot change the fact that the \nConstitution controls the President, not the other way around.\n  It is easy to insist that the Constitution controls another branch of \ngovernment, that the Constitution does not mean whatever another branch \nof government wants it to mean. The real test of our commitment to \nliberty, however, is our willingness to point that same finger at \nourselves.\n  I ask my colleagues, is the Constitution rock solid, unchanging, and \nsupreme for the executive branch but malleable, shape-shifting, and in \nthe eye of the beholder for the legislative branch?\n  A principle applied only to others is just politics, and politics \nalone cannot protect liberty. We must be willing to say that there are \nlines we may not cross, means we may not use, and steps we may not \ntake.\n  The Constitution empowers Congress to do many things for the American \npeople. Just as important, however, is that the Constitution also sets \nlimits on our power. We cannot take the power without the limits.\n  I want to address several constitutional issues raised by this \nlegislation.\n  The first is the requirement in section 1501 that individuals obtain \nnot simply health insurance but a certain level of insurance. Failure \nto meet this requirement results in a financial penalty which is to be \nassessed and collected through the Internal Revenue Code.\n  We hear a lot about how Senators on this side of the aisle are \nsupposedly defending the big, evil insurance companies, while those on \nthe other side of the aisle are defenders of American families. This \ninsurance mandate exposes such partisan hypocrisy.\n  Let me just ask you one simple question. Who would benefit the most \nfrom the unprecedented mandate to purchase insurance or face a penalty \nenforced by our friends at the Internal Revenue Service? The answer is \nsimple. There are two clear winners under this Draconian policy and \nneither is the American family. The first winner is the Federal \nGovernment, which could easily use this authority to increase the \npenalty or impose similar ones to create new streams of revenue to fund \nmore out-of-control spending. Second, the insurance companies are the \nmost direct winners under this insurance mandate because it would force \nmillions of Americans who would not otherwise do so to become their \ncustomers. I cannot think of a bigger\n\n[[Page S13014]]\n\nwindfall for corporations than the Federal Government ordering \nAmericans to buy their products.\n  Right now, States are responsible for determining the policies that \nbest meet the particular demographic needs and challenges of their own \nresidents. That is the States. Massachusetts, for example, has decided \nto implement a health insurance mandate, while Utah has decided not to \ndo so. This bill would eliminate this State flexibility so that the \nFederal Government may impose yet another one-size-fits-all mandate on \nall 50 States and on every American. I cannot think of anything more at \nodds with the system of federalism that America's Founders established, \na system designed to limit government and protect liberty.\n  I can understand why this mandate is so attractive to those who \nbelieve in an all-powerful Federal Government. After all, raising the \npercentage of those with health insurance is easy by simply ordering \nthose without insurance to buy it. But while government may choose the \nends, the Constitution determines the permissible means. That is why \none of the basic principles is that Congress must identify at least one \nof our powers enumerated in the Constitution as the basis for any \nlegislation we ultimately pass.\n  The health insurance mandate is separate from the penalty used to \nenforce it. The only enumerated power that can conceivably justify the \nmandate is the power to regulate interstate commerce. For more than a \ncentury, the Supreme Court treated this as meaning what it says. \nCongress cannot use its power to regulate commerce in order to regulate \nsomething that is not commerce. Congress cannot use its power to \nregulate interstate commerce in order to regulate intrastate commerce.\n  In classic judicial understatement, the Supreme Court has said that \n``our understanding of the reach of the commerce clause . . . has \nevolved over time.'' Indeed, it has. Since the 1930s, the Supreme Court \nhas expanded the power to regulate interstate commerce to include \nregulating activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. \nThat is obviously far beyond, by orders of magnitude, what the commerce \npower was intended to mean, but that is where things stand today, and \nsome say it justifies this health insurance mandate in this bill.\n  Using the Constitution or even the Supreme Court's revision of the \nConstitution as a guide requires more than a good intention fueled by \nan active imagination. The Supreme Court has certainly expanded the \ncategory of activities--get that word ``activities''--that Congress may \nregulate. But every one of its cases has involved Congress seeking to \nregulate just that: activities in which people have chosen to engage. \nEven the Supreme Court has never abandoned that category altogether and \nallowed Congress instead to require that individuals engage in \nactivities, in this case by purchasing a particular good or service. \nThe Court has never done that.\n  Let me mention just three of the Supreme Court's commerce clause \ncases. In its very first case, Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824, Thomas Gibbons \nhad received a Federal license to operate a steamboat between New \nJersey and New York and wanted to compete with Aaron Ogden, who had \nbeen granted a steamboat monopoly by New York State. In Wickard v. \nFilburn, Roscoe Filburn used the winter wheat he planted on his Ohio \nfarm to feed his livestock and make bread for his own dinner table. In \nthe winter of 1942, he grew more wheat than allowed under the \nAgricultural Adjustment Act and challenged the resulting fine. And in \nHodel v. Surface Mining & Reclamation Association, companies challenged \na Federal statute regulating surface coal mining.\n\n  These cases have two things in common. The Supreme Court upheld \nFederal authority in each case, but each case involved an activity--\nremember the word ``activity''--in which individuals chose to engage. \nThere would have been no Gibbons v. Ogden if Thomas Gibbons had not \nchosen to operate a steamboat. Congress could regulate his activity but \ncould not have required that he engage in it. There would have been no \nWickard v. Filburn if Roscoe Filburn had not chosen to grow wheat. \nCongress could regulate his activity but not have required that he \nengage in it. And there would have been no Hodel case if companies had \nnot chosen to mine coal. Congress could regulate their activity but \ncould not have required that they engage in it.\n  The key word in the commerce clause is the word ``regulate,'' and the \nkey word in every Supreme Court case about the commerce clause is the \nword ``activity.'' Regulating an activity in which individuals chose to \nengage is one thing; requiring that they engage in that activity is \nanother.\n  The Congressional Budget Office examined the 1994 health care reform \nlegislation which also included a mandate to purchase health insurance. \nHere is the CBO's, the Congressional Budget Office's, conclusion. This \nis August 1994, the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health \n     insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. \n     The government has never required people to buy a particular \n     good or service. . . .Federal mandates typically apply to \n     people as parties to economic transactions, rather than \n     members of society.\n\n  That is pretty important language. In other words, Congress can \nregulate commercial activities in which people choose to engage but \ncannot require that they engage in those commercial activities.\n  Just a few months ago, as Congress once again is considering a health \ninsurance mandate, the Congressional Research Service examined the same \nissue. Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded. This \nwas in July 2009. The CRS concluded:\n\n       Whether such a requirement [to have health insurance] would \n     be constitutional under the Commerce Clause is perhaps the \n     most challenging question posed by such a proposal, as it is \n     a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require \n     an individual to purchase a good or service.\n\n  Can Congress use this clause to require an individual to purchase a \ngood or service?\n  One thing did change in the legal landscape between 1994, when CBO \ncalled the health insurance mandate ``unprecedented,'' and 2009, when \nCRS called it ``novel.'' The Supreme Court twice found that there are \nlimits to what Congress may do in the name of regulating interstate \ncommerce.\n  In United States v. Lopez, the Court rejected a version of the \ncommerce power that would make it hard ``to posit any activity by an \nindividual that Congress is without power to regulate.''\n  If there is no difference between regulating and requiring what \npeople do, if there is no difference between incentives and mandates, \nif Congress may require that individuals purchase a particular good or \nservice, why did we even bother with the Cash for Clunkers Program? Why \ndid we bother with TARP or other bailouts? We could simply require that \nAmericans buy certain cars or appliances, invest in certain companies, \nor deposit their paychecks in certain banks. For that matter, we could \nattack the obesity problem by requiring Americans to buy fruits and \nvegetables and to eat only those.\n  Some say that because State governments may require drivers to buy \ncar insurance, the Federal Government may require that everyone \npurchase health insurance. That is too simplistic, that argument. \nSimply stating that point should be enough to refute it. States may do \nmany things that the Federal Government may not, and if you do not \ndrive a car, you do not have to buy car insurance. This legislation \nwould require individuals to have health insurance simply because they \nexist, even if they never see a doctor for the rest of their lives.\n  The defenders of this health insurance mandate must know that they \nare on shaky constitutional ground. The bill before us now includes \nfindings which attempt to connect the mandate to the Constitution. I \nassume they are the best arguments that this unprecedented and novel \nmandate is constitutional.\n  Those findings fail in at least four ways.\n  First, the findings say that the requirement to purchase health \ninsurance will add millions of new consumers to the health insurance \nmarket. I cannot dispute the observation that requiring more people to \npurchase health insurance will result in more people having health \ninsurance. I think that seems quite self-evident. But the question is \nnot the effect of the mandate but the authority for the mandate. \nLiberty requires that the ends cannot justify the means. The findings\n\n[[Page S13015]]\n\nalso fail to establish that the insurance mandate is constitutional by \nfailing to offer a single example--a single precedent, a single case--\nin which Congress has required individuals to purchase a particular \ngood or service or the courts have upheld such a requirement. The cases \nI described are typical, and similar examples are legion. Every one \ninvolves--every one of those cases I have cited--the regulation of \nactivity in which individuals choose to engage. Requiring that the \nindividual engage in such activity is a difference not in degree but in \nkind.\n\n  The findings also fail to answer the question by observing that \nStates such as Massachusetts have required that individuals purchase \nhealth insurance. As I noted regarding the example of car insurance, \nour Federal and State system allows States to do many things that the \nFederal Government may not. That is one of those limits on the Federal \nGovernment that is necessary to protect liberty.\n  The findings fail to answer the question by mistakenly focusing on \nwhether Congress may regulate the sale of insurance. That misses the \npoint in two respects. Simply because Congress may regulate the sale of \nhealth insurance does not mean that the Congress may require it. Simply \nbecause Congress may regulate the sale of health insurance does not \nmean that Congress may regulate the purchase of health insurance. This \nlegislation requires you to believe that nonactivity is the same as \nactivity; that choosing not to do something is the same as choosing to \ndo it; that regulating what individuals do is the same as requiring \nthem to do it. That notion makes no common sense, and it certainly \nmakes no constitutional sense. If Congress can require individuals to \nspend their own money on a particular good or service simply because \nCongress thinks it is important, then the Constitution means whatever \nCongress says it means and there are and will be no limits to the \nFederal Government's power over each and every one of our lives.\n  That version of Federal power will be exactly what the Supreme Court \nin Lopez prohibited; namely, that there would be no activity by \nindividuals that the Federal Government may not control. Neither the \npower to regulate interstate granted by the Constitution nor the power \nto regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce \ngranted by the Supreme Court go that far. They don't go that far.\n  The American people agree. A national poll conducted last month found \nthat 75 percent of Americans believe that requiring them to purchase \nhealth insurance is unconstitutional because Congress's power to \nregulate commerce does not include telling Americans what they must \nbuy. By a margin of more than 7 to 1, Americans believe that elected \nofficials should be more concerned with upholding the Constitution \nregardless of what might be popular than enacting legislation even if \nit is not constitutional.\n  Some defenders of this legislation such as the House majority leader \nhave said that Congress may require individuals to purchase health \ninsurance because it can pass legislation to promote the general \nwelfare. The only thing necessary to dismiss this argument is to read \nthe Constitution. Read the Constitution. That dismisses this argument. \nJust read it. Read the Constitution. Article I refers to general \nwelfare as a purpose, not as a power. It is a purpose that limits \nrather than expands Congress's power to tax and to spend. The \nrequirement that individuals purchase health insurance is not an \nexercise of either the power to tax or the power to spend, and so even \nthe purpose of general welfare is not connected to it at all. Needless \nto say, it makes no sense to include in a written Constitution designed \nto limit Federal Government power an open-ended, catchall provision \nempowering Congress to do anything it thinks serves the general \nwelfare.\n  If America's Founders wanted to create a Federal Government with that \nmuch power, they could have written a much shorter Constitution, one \nthat simply told Congress to go for it and legislate well. That is what \nthey could have done. They didn't do that, thank goodness.\n  The Heritage Foundation has just published an important paper arguing \nthat this health insurance mandate is both unprecedented and \nunconstitutional. It is authored by Professor Randy Barnett, the \nCormack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory at the George Washington \nLaw Center; Nathaniel Stewart, an attorney with the prestigious law \nfirm of White & Case, and Todd Gaziano, Director of the Center for \nJudicial and Legal Studies at the Heritage Foundation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the conclusion portion of the Legal \nMemorandum published by the Heritage Foundation printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       In theory, the proposed mandate for individuals to purchase \n     health insurance could be severed from the rest of the 2,000-\n     plus-page ``reform'' bill. The legislation's key sponsors, \n     however, have made it clear that the mandate is an integral, \n     indeed ``essential,'' part of the bill. After all, the \n     revenues paid by conscripted citizens to the insurance \n     companies are needed to compensate for the increased costs \n     imposed upon these companies and the health care industry by \n     the myriad regulations of this bill.\n       The very reason why an unpopular health insurance mandate \n     has been included in these bills shows why, if it is held \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of the scheme will prove \n     politically and economically disastrous. Members need only \n     recall how the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo--\n     which invalidated caps on campaign spending as \n     unconstitutional, while leaving the rest of the scheme \n     intact--has created 30 plus years of incoherent and \n     pernicious regulations of campaign financing and the need for \n     repeated ``reforms.'' Only this time, the public is aligned \n     against a scheme that will require repeated unpopular votes, \n     especially to raise taxes to compensate for the absence of \n     the health insurance mandate.\n       These political considerations are beyond the scope of this \n     paper, and the expertise of its authors. But Senators and \n     Representatives need to know that, despite what they have \n     been told, the health insurance mandate is highly vulnerable \n     to challenge because it is, in truth, unconstitutional. And \n     political considerations aside, each legislator owes a duty \n     to uphold the Constitution.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I also wish to share with my colleagues a letter I \nreceived from Dr. Michael Adams and attorney Carroll Robinson. They are \non the faculty of the Barbara Jordan Mickey Leeland School of Public \nAffairs at Texas Southern University. Mr. Robinson, a former member of \nthe Houston City Council, was named by the Democratic Leadership \nCouncil in 2000 to its list of ``100 to Watch.''\n  I ask unanimous consent their entire letter, which is dated October \n25, 2009, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me share just an excerpt from these two people. This \nis an excerpt from Michael Adams, Ph.D., and Carroll G. Robinson, \nEsquire, from the Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland School of Public \nAffairs, Texas Southern University:\n\n       Our reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent \n     could not identify any reasonable basis, expressed or \n     implied, for granting Congress the broad, sweeping and \n     unprecedented power that is represented by the individual \n     mandate requirement. In fact, we could not find any court \n     decision, state or federal, that said or implied that the \n     Constitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buy \n     a particular good or service or be subject to a financial \n     penalty levied by the government for not doing so.\n\n  That is pretty impressive stuff.\n  It is certainly possible to achieve the goal of greater health \ninsurance coverage by constitutional means, not unconstitutional means. \nI am quite certain, however, that those means are politically \nimpossible.\n  Liberty requires that the Constitution trump politics, but in the \nlegislation before us, politics trumps the Constitution.\n  Another provision in this legislation that is inconsistent with the \nConstitution is section 9001, which imposes an excise tax on high-cost \nemployer-sponsored insurance plans differently in some States than in \nothers. The legislation imposes a tax equal to 40 percent of benefits \nabove a prescribed limit but raises that limit in 17 States to be \ndetermined by the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human \nServices.\n  My colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, spoke against this provision \non policy grounds earlier.\n  The Constitution allows Congress to impose excise taxes but requires \nthat\n\n[[Page S13016]]\n\nthey be ``uniform throughout the United States.'' This is one of those \nprovisions that will be dismissed with pejorative labels such as \narchaic by those who find it annoying. But it is right there in the \nsame Constitution that we have all sworn to uphold. We have all sworn \nthat same oath to protect and defend, and we are just as bound today to \nobey it.\n  Frankly, a good test of our commitment to the Constitution is when we \nmust obey a provision that limits what we want to do.\n  The Supreme Court has had relatively few opportunities to interpret \nand apply the uniformity clause, but its cases do provide some basic \nprinciples which I think easily apply to the legislation before us \ntoday. The Court has held, for example, that a Federal excise tax must \nbe applied ``with the same force and effect in every place where the \nsubject of it is found.''\n  The Congress has wide latitude in determining what to tax and may \ntailor a regional solution to a geographically isolated problem, but \nlaws drawn explicitly in terms of State lines will receive heightened \nscrutiny. By the plain terms of the legislation before us, insurance \nplans providing a certain level of benefits in one State will be taxed \nwhile the very same plans providing the very same benefits in another \nwill not be taxed. We do not yet know what States will be treated \ndifferently, but we do know, according to this bill, that 17 of them \nwill. That actually makes the constitutional point more clearly by \nidentifying the State-based discrimination more starkly. Congress may \ndecide to tax insurance plans with benefits that exceed a particular \nlimit, but the tax must have the same force and effect wherever that \nsubject of the tax is found. That is the clear meaning of the \nconstitutional provision and the clear holding of the Supreme Court's \nprecedents. Taxing the same insurance plans differently in one State \nthan in another is the opposite of taxing them uniformly throughout the \nUnited States.\n  I commend to my colleagues the work of Professor Thomas Colby of the \nGeorge Washington University Law School, whose comprehensive work on \nthe uniformity clause was published in volume 91 of the Virginia Law \nReview.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service to look at this uniformity \nclause issue. Its report confirmed that this differential tax on high-\ncost insurance plans is drawn explicitly along State lines and that a \ncourt will more closely scrutinize the reasons for the State-based \ndistinction. It also concluded that Congress has not articulated any \njustification for singling out certain States for different treatment. \nI have raised this issue over and over throughout the process of \ndeveloping and considering this legislation. I serve on both of the \nSenate committees that are involved in this process. In fact, I can say \nI have served on three: not only the HELP Committee--the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee--but also the Finance \nCommittee, as well as the Judiciary Committee that, for some reason, \nhas some great interest in the Constitution. I have never heard any \njustification for singling out certain States for different tax \ntreatment.\n  The attitude seems to be that this is what the majority wants to do, \nso they are going to do it no matter what the Constitution says. That \nmay be politically possible, but that does not make it constitutionally \npermissible.\n  Other legal analysts and scholars who are examining this health care \ntakeover legislation are raising additional constitutional objections. \nProfessor Richard Epstein of the University of Chicago School of Law, \nfor example, focuses on provisions that restrict insurance providers' \nability to make their own risk-adjusted decisions about coverage and \npremiums. He argues these restrictions amount to a taking of private \nproperty without just compensation and in violation of the fifth \namendment.\n  Others have observed that the legislation requires States to \nestablish health benefit exchanges. It does not ask, cajole, encourage, \nor even bribe them. It simply orders State legislatures to pass \nlegislation creating these health benefit exchanges and says if States \ndo not do so, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish \nthe exchanges for them. How thoughtful.\n  But as the Supreme Court said in FERC v. Mississippi in 1982:\n\n       This Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal \n     command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and \n     regulations.\n\n  The Supreme Court reaffirmed a decade later in New York v. United \nStates that ``the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers \nupon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.''\n  In that case, the Court struck down Federal legislation that would \npress State officials into administering a Federal program.\n  More recently, in Printz v. United States, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n       We have held, however, that State legislatures are not \n     subject to Federal direction.\n\n  Yet this legislation does what these cases said Congress may not do. \nIt commands States to pass laws, it regulates States in their capacity \nas States, and it attempts to make States subject to Federal direction.\n  Let me return to the principles with which I began. Liberty requires \nlimits on government power. Those limits come primarily from a written \nConstitution which delegates enumerated powers to Congress. We must be \nable to identify at least one of those enumerated powers to justify \nlegislation, and those powers should not mean whatever we, in our \ndelightful wisdom, want them to mean.\n  Those principles lead me to conclude that Congress does not have the \nauthority to require that individuals purchase health insurance, and \nthat Congress cannot tax certain health insurance plans in some States \nbut not in others.\n  These, and the others I have mentioned, are only some of the \nconstitutional issues raised by this legislation. Any of these, and \nothers I have not mentioned, could well be the basis for future \nlitigation challenging this legislation should it become law.\n  Writing for the Supreme Court in 1991, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nreminded us:\n\n       The Constitution created a Federal Government of limited \n     powers.\n\n  America's Founders, she wrote, limited Federal Government power to \n``protect our fundamental liberties.''\n  Here is the way Justice O'Connor put it, writing for the Supreme \nCourt in New York v. United States in 1992:\n\n       But the Constitution protects us from our own best \n     intentions: It divides power among sovereigns and among \n     branches of government precisely so that we may resist the \n     temptation to concentrate power in one location, as an \n     expedient solution to the crisis of the day.\n\n  That is a pretty remarkable statement. I could not have said it \nbetter myself. Those are either principles we must obey or cliches we \nmay ignore.\n  If the Constitution means anything anymore, if it does what it was \ncreated to do by not only empowering but, more importantly, limiting \ngovernment power, then now is the time to stand on principle rather \nthan to slip on politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 October 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We support reducing the cost of health \n     insurance and expanding access to quality, affordable \n     prevention, wellness and health care services for all \n     Americans. Despite our support for health care reform that \n     empowers consumers, we have serious concerns about the \n     constitutionality of the individual mandate requirement being \n     proposed by Congress.\n       At least one scholar has argued that the individual mandate \n     requirement is constitutional because Congress has unlimited \n     authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the economic \n     activity of individual American citizens no matter how \n     infinitesimal.\n       We do not agree with that position. In Philadelphia, the \n     Framers established a federal government of limited powers. \n     If Congress has unlimited power under the Commerce Clause to \n     regulate the economic activity of citizens, then the \n     Constitution is no longer (and never was) ``a promise . . . \n     that there is a realm of personal liberty which the \n     government may not enter.''\n       We believe that this promise still exists and is not a \n     mirage. The Supreme Court said so, at least as recently as \n     2003.\n       It has also been argued that the individual mandate is \n     constitutional because citizens have ``no fundamental right \n     to be uninsured'' or ``to decline insurance.'' These are \n     strawman characterizations intended to distract attention \n     from the real constitutional question: Does Congress have the \n     power to mandate citizens buy a specific good or service or \n     be subjected to a financial penalty for not doing so?\n\n[[Page S13017]]\n\n       Our reading of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent \n     could not identify any reasonable basis, expressed or \n     implied, for granting Congress the broad, sweeping and \n     unprecedented power that is represented by the individual \n     mandate requirement. In fact, we could not find any court \n     decision, state or federal, that said or implied that the \n     Constitution gave Congress the power to mandate citizens buy \n     a particular good or service or be subject to a financial \n     penalty levied by the government for not doing so.\n       There are cases that say Congress can tell consumers what \n     products to buy if they choose to buy, but no cases that say \n     Congress can mandate that a citizen must buy a particular \n     good or service or be fined for not doing so.\n       The individual mandate requirement directly burdens the \n     fundamental meaning of being an American citizen as embodied \n     in the Ninth Amendment reaching back through the Declaration \n     of Independence to the Magna Carta and its expansion coming \n     forward from the 3/5ths Clause of Article I of the \n     Constitution and the Court's Dred Scott decision to the \n     Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth \n     and Twenty-Sixth Amendments as well as through Supreme Court \n     decisions related to these amendments, legislation adopted \n     pursuant to them, the Bill of Rights and its penumbra.\n       The Supreme Court has ruled that freedom of speech, \n     expression and association are constitutionally protected. \n     Our right to freely move around the country is also \n     constitutionally protected. Congress can regulate the size of \n     political donations but has no authority to tell a citizen \n     which political candidate or party they can lawfully \n     contribute to.\n       Like political donations, how a citizen legally spends \n     their money in the market place is clearly a form of \n     expression and association that requires strict scrutiny, or \n     heightened, protection.\n       Calling the individual mandate a tax raises another \n     constitutional concern. Under the mandate, American citizens \n     are essentially subject to a financial penalty simply for \n     being a citizen of the United States residing in a state of \n     the Union. It is essentially an existence fee, a fee for \n     existing.\n       Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the definition of \n     citizenship does not include any requirement that Americans \n     pay a ``tax'' simply because we are citizens. In fact, the \n     Twenty-Fourth Amendment and related Supreme Court decisions \n     expressly prohibit financially burdening the rights of \n     citizens to prevent them from exercising a right of \n     citizenship. Citizens have a liberty interest in deciding \n     when to buy a good or service and which to buy form the \n     legally available options.\n       The Supreme Court has said, ``Had those who drew and \n     ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or \n     the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in \n     its manifold possibilities, they might have been more \n     specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They \n     knew times can blind us to certain truths and . . . laws once \n     thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. \n     As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can \n     invoke its principles in their own search for greater \n     freedom.''\n       We believe that reducing the cost of health care insurance \n     and expanding coverage can be achieved without opening the \n     constitutional Pandora's Box of the individual mandate \n     requirement.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carroll G. Robinson, Esq.\n     Michael O. Adams, PhD.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to follow my colleague \nfrom Utah. I am pleased he has raised these constitutional issues, \nwhich I think are significant to this bill. The idea that we could have \na constitutional mandate to buy health insurance, to me, is highly \nquestionable under our rights under the role of the Federal Government \nand under the Constitution. Senator Hatch has been on the Judiciary \nCommittee for many years and he understands these issues very well.\n  We are now on our sixth iteration of the health care reform bill. \nThis one talks about expanding Medicare, basically as one of the key \ncomponents of solving the problem. Here is a quote from the Mayo Clinic \nI found, and others have also been cited. I found this interesting, \nsuccinct, and accurate:\n\n       Any plan to expand Medicare, which is the Government's \n     largest public plan, beyond its current scope does not solve \n     the Nation's health care crisis, but compounds it. It is also \n     clear that an expansion of the price control of the Medicare \n     payment system will not control overall Medicare spending or \n     curb costs. This scenario follows the typical pattern for \n     price control, reduced access, compromised quality, and \n     increasing costs anyway. We need to address these problems, \n     not perpetuate them through health reform legislation.\n\n  That was the Mayo Clinic. It is clearly not the way to go to solve \nthe crisis or the problems. It probably hastens the day Medicare goes \nbankrupt, which is set to happen in 2017, 7 years away.\n  I want to talk about the possibility that this health care bill puts \nthis very early piece of economic recovery that we are having at risk. \nThe latest reports on unemployment provide some hope that our battered \neconomy may be showing some tentative signs of economic recovery, as \nthe job loss continues to slow. Most of this is based off of monetary \npolicy. We are seeing some of this taking place.\n  Consumer confidence is still low. Unemployment hovers at 10 percent, \nand over 7 million jobs were lost since the beginning of the recession.\n  It should be clear that any potential recovery is incredibly fragile. \nThat being the case, Congress and the administration should focus like \na laser beam on policies that encourage economic growth and put \nAmericans back to work. That seems to be obvious.\n  Instead, though, the administration and the Democratic-controlled \nCongress have taken up crucial months with a proposed revamping of our \nentire health care system that will cost nearly $2.5 trillion over the \nnext 10 years, to be paid for by new taxes and employer mandates, and \nit will impose a grave risk to a sustained rebound of our Nation's \neconomy. This hurts our economic recovery.\n  Not only that, but the Democratic health care bill includes some \npositively perverse incentives that would discourage hiring, work, \nsaving, and even marriage. Again, it would discourage hiring, work, \nsavings, and marriage. Higher taxes, more employer mandates, and \ndisincentives to job creation, productivity, and family formation are \nhardly the prescription for the growth our economy so desperately needs \nright now.\n  Both the House and the Senate bills would, for instance, increase the \nalready existing penalty on work faced by many low-income families who \nreceive tax and in-kind benefits from government welfare programs. We \nalready heard this. Health insurance subsidies in the legislation for \nindividuals and families in poverty would tack on an additional 12 to \n20 percent to marginal tax rates, which already approach 40 to 50 \npercent for families receiving a variety of benefits for those with low \nincomes. This would result in marginal tax rates of 50 to 60 percent \nfor most affected families.\n  If working more hours or obtaining better paying jobs results in more \nthan half of those additional earnings being taken away as a result of \ntaxes or a reduction in benefits--if you are a low-income individual, \nyou are working more, you are getting more money coming in, but your \nbenefits from the government are reduced. So if you are taking 50 to 60 \npercent away in a reduction of benefits or in taxes, the incentive to \nwork harder or to invest in an education is greatly reduced. That is \nobvious on its face. Yet it is in this bill.\n  This is not the only work disincentive in the bill. It is common for \nteenagers and college students to obtain jobs so they can have some \nspending money on their own or to help with their educational expenses. \nThe Senate bill penalizes the families of these younger workers by \nincluding their wages in benefit eligibility calculations. For many \nlow-to-moderate income families, the inclusion of their wages could \nmean a significant increase in their cost of health insurance or even \nin them losing thousands of dollars of health insurance subsidies \naltogether. That is in the bill.\n  And more harmful to the economy, potentially, are the incentives \ndirected at employers. Both the House and Senate bills include \ntemporary subsidies to small businesses to encourage them to offer \nemployer-sponsored health insurance. As the number of employees \nincrease or as salaries increase, the amount of the credit provided to \nthe business decreases. The structure of this subsidy not only \ndiscourages employers from hiring new employees, but it also \ndiscourages them from increasing employees' salaries. We don't want \nthose sorts of disincentives in any bill.\n  Ironically, the incentives in the bill would even work to encourage \nemployers to drop health insurance coverage for individual employees or \neliminate insurance coverage altogether. The Senate bill would cap \nemployee contributions to insurance premiums at 9.8 percent of their \nincome. If an employer\n\n[[Page S13018]]\n\noffered a policy that required employees to pay more than this, the \nemployee would be eligible to purchase insurance through the new \n``health care exchanges.'' The employer would have to pay a fine. \nSince, in many cases, that fine is considerably less than the \nadditional insurance costs the employer would incur if they retained \ncoverage, many businesses concerned about the bottom line would be \nenticed by the bill to stop providing any health insurance coverage. So \nthey are actually enticed here to drop health insurance coverage--\nanother thing we don't want to see happen.\n  Furthermore, employers who offer flexible spending accounts or FSAs \nwill be encouraged to stop providing these tax-free medical spending \naccounts for their employees. Under the Senate Democrats' bill, FSA \ncontributions will be included in the total cost of employees' health \ninsurance benefits for the purpose of calculating the proposed tax on \nhigh-cost health plans--the so-called Cadillac health care plans. \nAdding an FSA contribution could push the total cost of health benefits \nabove the high-cost threshold for many workers, which will result in \nthe employer being liable for a portion of the 40 percent high-cost \nplan's tax. As more and more plans become subject to the high-cost \nplan's tax, it will be in the employer's best interest to eliminate FSA \nofferings altogether. That is another disincentive we don't want to see \nhappening.\n  The proposed legislation would also create new marriage penalties \nacross the income spectrum. We have been working for some years to do \naway with the marriage penalty. Marriage is a good and solid \ninstitution that helps so much in this Nation. Yet it puts in a \nmarriage penalty, penalizes people for getting married; it is built \ninto this legislation. These penalties can be so large that, in some \ncases, couples would have to forgo marriage in order to avoid thousands \nof dollars in new taxes. The penalties are significant. Low- and \nmoderate-income families often have limited savings as well. Given the \nalready significant marriage penalties in low-income benefit programs, \nit seems ironic that the government would create yet another program \nthat penalizes low-income individuals for getting married.\n  Currently, if they are on public assistance and they get married, \ntheir combined incomes often move a couple out of the support they \nreceive for their families, whether it is health support, housing, or \nfood support. By getting married, they often lose their benefits. \nInstead of taking them away, we ought to be helping them form solid \nfamilies. That sort of disincentive is built into this health insurance \nplan as well, where you actually put in disincentives for low-income \ncouples to get married. In other words, to be able to get the health \ninsurance subsidy, they may have to forgo marriage. That is not the \nsort of incentive we want in the system and in the bill. We are trying \nto take it away in the welfare programs, but to add another piece to \nlow and moderate-income couples is the wrong way for us to go.\n\n  That the Democratic health care legislation would set the United \nStates on a path to a single-payer government-run health insurance \nsystem of the sort found in Europe and Canada is bad enough, but even \nmore troubling is the fact that these proposals would create a series \nof perverse incentives ultimately harmful to workers, businesses, and \nthe entire economy. The Senate must reject this poorly conceived, \nruinously expensive scheme and get back to the business of helping our \neconomy recover.\n  I have talked to many people across the United States and \nparticularly in Kansas, many people who are deeply concerned about this \neconomy and the perverse things coming out of Washington. While they \nmight start considering investing in their small business, putting some \nincome or something out to be able to grow and create jobs, people are \nholding back and saying: I don't know how many more taxes you will put \non us or what the health insurance plan will look like. I don't know \nwhat cap and trade will do on raising energy costs.\n  They are holding back. These perverse economic signals, and the \ndiscussion of them in Washington, is perversely affecting the economy. \nIt is hurting the economic recovery. If you put these pieces into place \nstatutorily, you are hurting savings, hurting hiring, hurting marriage \nformation, and you will further hurt an already very tentative recovery \nfrom taking place.\n  This is a bad medicine for the economy. The idea that you would \nexpand Medicare to take care of that is a terrible idea. You will be \nhurting a program that already is not financially solvent in the long \nterm and is looking at something like $30 trillion of unfunded \nobligations already on its books. That alone, if you expand it back to \nage 55, plus the provider community--the American Medical Association \nand the American Hospital Association are opposed to this expansion of \nMedicare. They don't get full reimbursement of costs right now. With \nthe talk about bringing it back to age 55, you will be sweeping a large \nnumber of people into Medicare, so you are sweeping in a lot of people \nwho are already in private insurance plans. When they are pulled out of \nprivate insurance which pays at the full rate to the provider \ncommunity, you are taking those resources away from the provider \ncommunity, from doctors and hospitals. That is why you are seeing the \nAmerican Medical Association and the American Hospital Association come \nout against this proposal on Medicare expansion. How on Earth would it \never be paid for, when the program is already not on a stable financial \ntrack?\n  The Federation of American Hospitals stated this:\n\n       The FAH is strongly opposed to this proposal. A Medicare \n     buy-in would involve Medicare rates, would be controlled by \n     CMS, and would crowd out older workers with private coverage \n     and may choose early retirement as a result. Such a policy \n     will further negatively impact hospitals.\n\n  In my rural State, in particular, it would have a huge negative \nimpact on a number of the hospitals in my State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent order of \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak as in morning business.\n  I would like to say at the outset I respect very much my colleague \nfrom the State of Kansas. He and I have worked on many issues together. \nIn fact, we traveled together to Africa, a memorable trip for both of \nus, I am sure, visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and \nmeeting a lot of people in desperate straits. I thank him for that.\n  I know he is now preparing for another public career in the State of \nKansas, with the blessing of the Kansas voters. But in the meantime, he \ncontinues to be a very important, vital voice in the Senate. I thank \nhim for that as well.\n  We do disagree on health care reform. I know he has had a chance to \nexplain his point of view. I will say I disagree with many of his \nconclusions about what we are about, what we are trying to accomplish.\n  This is the bill that is before us when we return to the health care \nreform debate. It is 2,074 pages long. It is the product of 1 year's \nwork by two major committees in the Senate. The House of \nRepresentatives spent a similar period of time in three different \ncommittees working on it to come up with their work product, which they \npassed just a few weeks ago.\n  This is historic because we have been promising this and threatening \nthis and talking about this for decades. It was Theodore Roosevelt who \nfirst raised the question about whether America could accept the \nchallenge of providing health care for every citizen. That was over 100 \nyears ago. Then, of course, Harry Truman, who, in a more modern era, \nissued the same challenge. He was confronted by his critics who said: \nHe is talking about socializing medicine. Must be socialism that Harry \nTruman is proposing. The idea died.\n  Then, again, Lyndon Johnson raised it in the early 1960s. He was a \nmaster of the Senate, as he has been characterized in a book that has \nbeen written about him. He believed he had the power to make this \nhappen to deal with the health care system across the board in America. \nIt turned out he made a significant contribution with the enactment of \nMedicare and Medicaid but could not reach the goal of universal health \ncare or comprehensive health care reform.\n\n[[Page S13019]]\n\n  This President, President Obama, came to us and issued the same \nchallenge. He said we have reached a point of no return. The current \nhealth care system in America is unsustainable, it is unaffordable, and \nthe cost of health care goes up dramatically. Ten years ago, a family \nof four paid an average of $6,000 a year, $500 a month for health care \ninsurance. Now that is up to twice that amount, $12,000 average for a \nfamily of four, $1,000 a month. In 8 years, with projected increases in \ncosts, we expect that the monthly premium for the family of four to go \nup to $2,000 a month, $24,000 a year. We know that represents 40 \npercent of earnings for many people. That is absolutely unsustainable.\n  What we have tried to do, first and foremost, is address \naffordability. How can we make health insurance protection more \naffordable for more families? How can we start lessening the annual \nincrease in premiums and actually help people by substantially cutting \nthe cost of premiums for many families? It is a big challenge, and we \nhave, I think, risen to the challenge with this bill.\n  The other side of the aisle has ideas, they have amendments, they \nhave speeches, they have charts, but they do not have a comprehensive \nhealth care reform bill. They do not have a bill that has been sent \nover to the Congressional Budget Office, carefully read, and evaluated. \nIt took weeks to do it. They do not have a bill that came back from the \nCongressional Budget Office, considered to be the neutral observer of \naction on Capitol Hill. They do not have a bill that came back from the \nCBO that has been characterized as actually reducing the deficit.\n  This bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will reduce \nAmerica's deficit over the next 10 years by $130 billion and over the \nfollowing 10 years another $650 billion. It is not just dealing with \nhealth care reform; it is dealing with the costs of health care to our \ngovernment and reducing our expenditures by significant amounts. It is \nthe largest deficit-reduction bill ever considered on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Although the Republicans have many ideas, they do not have anything \nthat matches this bill in terms of deficit reduction or bringing down \nthe cost of health care. They have not produced a bill which will \nextend the reach of health insurance coverage to 94 percent of our \npeople in this country, which this bill does.\n  For the first time in the history of the United States of America, 94 \npercent of our American citizens will have peace of mind knowing they \nhave health insurance. Today, 50 million do not. This bill will take 30 \nmillion off the uninsured rolls and put them in insurance plans that \ncan protect their families, and it will help them pay for the premiums. \nIf people are making less than 400 percent of poverty--which in \nlayman's terms is about $80,000 a year in income. If your family makes \n$80,000 or less, we provide in this bill that we will help you pay for \nyour premiums. The lower your income, the more we will help pay.\n  If you are making, for example, as an individual, less than $14,000 a \nyear, you will not pay for your health care. It will be covered by \nMedicaid, the program that is now nationwide, and you will not have to \npay a premium. Then as you make more money, you will pay a little bit \nof a premium with help from this bill.\n  The Republicans have not produced a plan of any kind that deals with \nhelping families of limited means, modest means, pay for their health \ninsurance premiums. We have. The Congressional Budget Office has scored \nit. One of the major provisions in this bill--and one I think most \npeople will identify with quickly--is the fact that health insurance \nreform is included too. There is a Patients' Bill of Rights in this \nbill. It basically says we should bring an end to the discriminatory \npractices of health insurance companies against American citizens. We \nknow what we are talking about.\n  Friends of mine, a family I am closer to than any other family in \nSpringfield, IL, has a son fighting cancer. He is a young man in his \nforties. He has young children in high school. He was diagnosed with \nmelanoma just a few years ago. His oncologist has worked with him with \nchemotherapy and radiation and with the kind of treatment and drugs and \nsurgeries he needed. As a result of it, he has gone through some tough \nsurgeries and tough treatment. His oncologist said at one point: We \nhave a drug we believe will help you. He gave him the drug, and the \ndrug, in fact, arrested the development of his cancer.\n  Shortly after the drug was prescribed and administered, his health \ninsurance company that he paid into for years came back and said: We \nwill not cover that drug. The drug costs $12,000 a month. It is \nimpossible for him, as the coach of a baseball team at one of our \nuniversities, to come up with that kind of money. His family borrowed \nmoney to pay for one of the treatments, and now they are suing the \ninsurance company in the hopes that they can get coverage.\n  After all those years paying in, when they finally needed that \ncoverage, they turned him down. I hope he wins that lawsuit. This is a \nvery profitable insurance company. It is a company that should be \npaying, but they are not. That is one example of thousands we could \ntalk about.\n  The purpose of this bill is to make sure a friend of mine, his \nfamily, and other families just like his have a fighting chance against \nthese insurance companies. We say in this bill we are going to provide \na way for protection for people with a preexisting condition; that if \nyou have a history of high cholesterol or high blood pressure, if you \nhave some cancer in your family, it is not going to disqualify you. You \nare still going to be eligible for health insurance, a policy you can \nafford.\n  We also say, when it comes to your children--you know how it is \ntoday, you learn the hard way--when your kids who are on the family \nplan reach the age of 24, they are off. We extend that to age 26, which \nI think is a little more peace of mind, particularly for students \ngraduating from college looking for jobs these days. It is not easy. We \nwant to make sure they are covered with health insurance while they are \npaying off their student loans and building their career. That is in \nthis bill.\n\n  There is not a bill from the Republican side of the aisle that deals \nwith the Patients' Bill of Rights. In fact, it is a rare Senator on the \nother side of the aisle who even stands and is critical of health \ninsurance companies in the way they are treating people in this \ncountry.\n  I do not know if my friends on the other side of the aisle get back \nhome enough to meet with some of these families. Surely they do. They \nmust receive mail that tells them about these stories we have all heard \nabout. You would think they would be endorsing our approach in this \nbill. Instead, they are critical of it from start to finish.\n  They talk a lot about taxes. I want you to know, under this bill, if \nyou have a small business with 25 or fewer employees, we actually \nprovide tax breaks to help you provide insurance for your employees. \nThere are a lot of businesses, mom-and-pop businesses, for example, \nthat cannot afford health insurance that will have a chance now because \nof tax breaks here.\n  Then, when it comes to paying for premiums, I mentioned earlier, if \nyou make $80,000 or less, we provide tax breaks in helping you pay for \nit. The cost of it in tax breaks is $440 billion over 10 years. It is a \nhuge amount of money we are providing to American citizens to give them \na chance to pay for their health insurance premiums. All we hear from \nthe other side is: Oh, this bill is going to raise taxes. It does raise \nsome. It raises taxes on health insurance companies for what we call \nCadillac health care policies.\n  We can debate for a long time whether that level of policy, $25,000, \nis a reasonable level or should be something different. But the fact \nis, it is a tax on the health insurance company. It will likely result \nin fewer policies that are that grand and that expansive being issued.\n  I think this is a bill that moves in the right direction. It is a \nbill that makes insurance more affordable. It is a bill that does not \nincrease the deficit, it reduces it. It is a bill that gives people a \nfighting chance against health insurance companies that discriminate \nagainst their customers. It is a bill that extends the coverage of \nhealth insurance of 94 percent of Americans. It is a bill that looks at \nputting Medicare on sound footing. It adds 5 years of solvency to \nMedicare--5 years. There has not been a bill produced on the other side \nof the aisle that even adds 1 year,\n\n[[Page S13020]]\n\nthat I am aware of. It adds 5 more years of solvency. That is the \nreason why this bill has been supported by the American Association of \nRetired Persons. We have support of medical professionals, senior \norganizations, and consumer groups all across America. They know, as we \ndo, we cannot wait any longer.\n  I also wish to make the point that the Senate bill offers significant \nsavings for seniors. The CMS Actuary projects a net $469 billion in \nMedicare and Medicaid savings over 10 years, slightly more than the \nCongressional Budget Office. It extends the life of the Medicare trust \nfund, according to the Office of the Actuary, by 9 years. That is \nlonger than anyone has projected in previous forecasts, but it is a \nsignificant increase, almost doubling the life of the Medicare trust \nfund over what it currently would be.\n  It reduces premiums by $12.50 a month by the year 2019 or $300 per \ncouple per year. Slowing Medicare growth will lower health care costs \nfor seniors as well as younger Americans. Not only will there be a \npremium savings, but coinsurance will fall as well.\n  The Senate bill slows the growth of health care costs. The Actuary \nreport we have, for example, says, `` . . . Reductions in Medicare \npayment updates for providers, the actions of the Independent Medicare \nAdvisory Board, and the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance would have a significant downward impact on future \nhealth care cost growth rates.''\n  The bend in the health care cost curve is evident. Health care costs \nunder the Senate bill begin to decline as cost savings begin to kick \nin.\n  I have not mentioned this bill focuses on prevention and wellness \ntoo. If there is one thing we need, it is to encourage people to take \ncare of themselves and to get a helping hand for the tests they need to \nstay healthy and to monitor their conditions. This preventive care and \nwellness, though we have not been credited by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, is an important element of this bill.\n  I think there is one thing on which we should all agree. The cost of \nhealth care, particularly for small businesses, is very difficult. On \nthe Senate floor, both Democrats and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle have recognized small businesses are struggling to pay for \nhealth insurance. But there is a real difference. We have offered a \nsolution, one that is comprehensive and one that has been scored and \ncarefully analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Unfortunately, that has not happened on the other side. Their \napproach is basically to criticize what we have proposed but to offer \nno alternative. If they are happy with the current system, I understand \nthat. If they will concede that it is hard to produce a bill like this, \nI would understand that. But merely to criticize this without \nalternative, a comprehensive alternative that has been carefully \nanalyzed, I don't think is a responsible approach to the serious \nproblem that we face today.\n\n  There are real-life stories of people who have contacted me. One of \nthem I will tell you about involves a small business. Right now we know \nthat one sick employee of a small business can drive the cost of health \ncare for the whole company to limits where they just can't afford it. \nMy friends, Martha and Harry Burrows, whom I have met, are small \nbusiness owners in Chicago, and they have to wrestle with this problem \nand try to run a successful business at the same time. When they opened \ntheir toy store, Timeless Toys, 16 years ago, they promised to provide \nhealth insurance to their full-time employees. Martha Burrows said:\n\n       Since we were covered, we wanted to offer the same benefit \n     to our employees.\n\n  But as their health care premiums have skyrocketed with leaps of more \nthan 20 percent at a time, the commitment has taken its toll on their \nbusiness. Providing health insurance to their full-time staff of seven \nmeant cuts not only to profits but also to the wages of their \nemployees. In general, the older employees faced even higher costs. We \nshouldn't put our Nation's employers in a position where the health \ncosts of an older worker can make such a huge difference.\n  Marcia says:\n\n       I don't like making decisions that way. I want to base \n     hiring decisions on the quality of the person.\n\n  The legislation on the floor, incidentally, deals with the rating of \npremium costs for senior citizens, for example, and makes a fairer \nrating system. Currently, health insurance companies in America are \nexempt from the antitrust laws. Under a bill known as McCarran-\nFerguson, passed in the 1940s, they are exempt, along with organized \nbaseball, which means the insurance companies--health insurance \ncompanies and others--can literally sit down in a room and conspire, \ncollude, agree on prices they are going to charge. If any other \ncompanies that were supposed to be competing did that in America they \nwould be sued but not the insurance companies. So they can set premiums \nand agree on what the premiums will be, and they can divide up the \nmarket for the sale of their products, sending some companies to one \ntown and some to another, making sure they do not compete against one \nanother.\n  That is the reality of health insurance today. What we provide in \nthis bill is protection against the ratings which discriminate against \npeople because they are elderly or because they are women. We put \nlimits to the rating differences that will be allowed in health \ninsurance policies. There is no bill I know of from the Republican side \nthat even considers or addresses that problem.\n  Mr. President, one of the issues that I have tried to focus on in the \nmidst of this recession is our foreclosure crisis. Back in December of \n2006, when the housing markets were humming along and the bankers and \nbrokers were raking in money, the Center for Responsible Lending \npublished a report called ``Losing Ground.'' That report, in December \nof 2006, estimated that nearly 2 million homes would be lost to \nforeclosure in the coming years due largely to shoddy subprime \nmortgages.\n  Here is what the Mortgage Bankers Association told the Washington \nPost when they heard of this study. It was authored by the Center for \nResponsible Lending.\n\n       The report is `wildly pessimistic' because most homeowners \n     have prime loans and are not at financial risk.\n\n  That is what a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association \nsaid in December of 2006. He went on to say:\n\n       The subprime market is a small part of the overall market. \n     Lending industry officials have said that regulatory action \n     could injure the subprime market.\n\n  When he speaks of regulatory action, he means regulating these \nsubprime markets.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I was involved in a debate with a Senator \nfrom Texas named Phil Gramm. I offered an amendment to a bankruptcy \nbill which Senator Grassley and I worked on which said: If you are \nguilty of predatory lending, you will be precluded in bankruptcy from \npursuing your claim. That was debated on the Senate floor, and debating \non the other side against my amendment was Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, \nwho said on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       If the Durbin amendment passes, it will destroy the \n     subprime mortgage market.\n\n  Well, my amendment failed by one vote, and the subprime mortgage \nmarket continued until it collapsed just a couple of years ago. I wish \nI had had another vote for my amendment.\n  At the time this debate took place in December of 2006, about 25 \npercent of home loans were subprime. So the mortgage bankers, \nunfortunately, misled the public about the state of the market at the \ntime to wave away warnings about any crisis that might be following, \nand we all know what that has meant to this country.\n  I go back to that episode now because 3 years later, in 2009, we have \nhad more than 2 million foreclosures, something the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation said wouldn't happen. In fact, the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation has recently announced that in the third quarter of this \nyear, nearly one in seven families paying mortgages in this country \nwere either behind on their payments or already in foreclosure--one out \nof seven people holding mortgages today. It is hard to imagine. That is \nthe highest it has ever been.\n  The statement from the Mortgage Bankers Association said:\n\n       Despite the recession ending in mid-summer, the decline in \n     mortgage performance continues.\n\n  Three years ago, the rosy scenario they painted has now morphed into \na\n\n[[Page S13021]]\n\nmuch more serious situation which they cannot ignore. I have been \ntalking about this foreclosure crisis since early in 2007. I stand here \nwith some regret and say it is getting worse.\n  In Illinois, foreclosure filings in the six-county region around \nChicago went up 67 percent in the last quarter. This isn't just a \nproblem for the city of Chicago. New filings in Cook County, mainly \nsuburban areas, were down 4.6 percent last quarter. The problem, \nunfortunately, has migrated to the suburbs. All of the so-called \n``collar counties'' around Chicago have experienced massive increases \nin foreclosure activity. Kane County, a near-in county to the city of \nChicago, saw foreclosure filings increase 97 percent in the last \nquarter over a comparable period last year.\n  I know the administration is working on this. The Home Affordable \nModification Program is helping some families. I know Treasury has \nstepped up naming and shaming and hoping that it will provide more data \nfor the public on which banks are actually trying. Some are--not much \nbut some are. Many are not trying at all to renegotiate mortgages for \npeople facing foreclosure. But no matter how much the Treasury \nDepartment leans on these bankers, the big banks that service most of \nthese troubled mortgages have simply not stepped up to the plate.\n  Treasury reported yesterday that 3.3 million families are eligible \nfor the Home Affordable Modification Program. Those are the families \nwho are at least 2 months behind on their mortgages and in serious risk \nof being thrown out in the street. How many families, based on this 3.3 \nmillion families eligible for this program, have been able to get a \nbank to commit to a permanent loan modification that will keep them in \ntheir homes? There were 31,000 out of 3.3 million; less than one-tenth \nof 1 percent of the families in trouble have been able to work out a \npermanent solution with their bankers. That is disgraceful.\n  The big banks that created this mess continue to stand in the way of \ncleaning it up. They are making billions of dollars while foreclosing \non millions of American families. Shaming the banks with speeches on \nthe floor of the Senate isn't going to work. We have learned the hard \nway that many banks are beyond embarrassment. You can't embarrass \nbankers who take billions of taxpayer dollars to stay solvent and to \novercome their bad banking policies, then turn around and pay millions \nout in bonuses to the officers of the same banks. You can't publicly \nshame bankers into doing something when they simply don't care.\n  But let's be clear. Congress hasn't done its part either. We have not \ndone enough to make these banks help the American people who need some \nhelp. I will continue to come to the floor to remind my colleagues that \nwe must address this crisis far more aggressively than we have, and I \nwill continue to look for ways to help.\n  One last statistic. The Wall Street Journal ran a front-page story \nrecently highlighting that one in four homeowners who are paying a \nmortgage today owes more on their mortgage than their house is worth. \nOne in four homeowners is making house payments on a home that is now \nunderwater. If you owe more than your house is worth and have no extra \ncash lying around, you are really vulnerable. If there is a sickness in \nyour family, a health care emergency, a job loss, you could lose your \nhome. If you are underwater, you are likely to stay there.\n  The 10.7 million families who find their mortgages are higher than \nthe value of their homes are at serious risk of foreclosure. Over \n400,000 of those families are at risk in my home State of Illinois. \nJPMorgan Chase estimates that home prices won't hit bottom until next \nyear, so it is going to get worse before it gets better.\n  So do we stand idly by and watch this--watch people lose their life's \nsavings and their homes, watch these boarded-up homes spring up across \nour neighborhoods, around towns large and small across America and \nshake our heads and say it is inevitable? We don't have to. What we \nhave to do is lean on these banks legally, with new laws that put \npressure on them to make a difference. Don't appeal to their better \nnature. We have tried that, and it didn't work. We have to use the law. \nWe have to stand up for this economy and putting it back on its feet, \nand we have to make the point of saying to these bankers that they have \nto negotiate these mortgages.\n  We need to do our part in the Senate. As we focus on health care and \njobs and the state of the economy, let's not lose sight of this \nforeclosure crisis that is devastating neighborhoods across the \ncountry. The economy will struggle to fully recover until more families \nare confident enough in their homes that they are willing to go out and \ngo shopping again. We must do more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had a chance to listen to my good \nfriend, the Senator from Illinois; his remarks about why the bill \nbefore the Senate is going to reduce costs and pay down on the national \ndebt. Now, that is the Senator from Illinois. I am the Senator from \nIowa. But I would like to not refer to my judgment about this bill \nright now. What I would like to refer to is the judgment outlined in a \nreport that was issued today from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, a professional person who calls it like it is. That is his \nresponsibility.\n  Remember, I am quoting from a report that was just given today about \nthis 2,074-page bill we have before us, and that my friend from \nIllinois was just speaking very favorably about. So I am going to talk \nabout somebody in the executive branch of government, under the \nPresident of the United States, who says this about this reform bill--\nthat it will cost more than the status quo. The Chief Actuary of the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a report on Senator \nReid's bill which shows that health care costs would go up, not down, \nunder his bill. The Chief Actuary warned that the Democrats' health \ncare bill would increase health care costs, threaten access to care for \nseniors, and force people off their current coverage.\n  In other words, the administration's own Chief Actuary conclusively \ndemonstrates that the Democrats' rhetoric does not match the reality of \nthe bill. The cost curve would bend up, not down. National health \nexpenditures would increase from 16 percent of GDP to 20.9 percent \nunder the Reid bill. The Chief Actuary concluded that the Federal \nGovernment and the country would spend $234 billion more under the bill \nthan without it. The Chief Actuary also says that the bill \n``jeopardizes access to care for beneficiaries'' because of the bill's \nsevere cuts in Medicare.\n  Quoting the Chief Actuary:\n\n       Providers for whom Medicare constitutes a substantive \n     portion of their business could find it difficult to remain \n     profitable and . . . might end their participation in the \n     program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for \n     beneficiaries).\n\n  Then it speaks about the savings in the bill being unrealistic. The \nActuary says that many of the Medicare cuts ``are unrelated to the \nproviders' costs of furnishing services to beneficiaries.'' It is \ntherefore ``doubtful'' that providers could reduce costs to keep up \nwith the cuts.\n  Then the Chief Actuary speaks about new taxes costing consumers $11 \nbillion per year. The new taxes in the Reid bill would increase drug \nand device prices and health insurance premiums for consumers. The \nActuary estimates this would increase costs on consumers by $11 billion \nper year, beginning in 2011--that is 3 years before most benefits kick \nin.\n  Then the Actuary speaks about health care shortages, that these \nhealth care shortages are ``plausible and even probable,'' particularly \nfor Medicare and Medicare beneficiaries. Because of the increased \ndemand for health care, the Actuary says that access-to-care problems--\nagain these words ``plausible'' and even ``probable'' under the Reid \nbill. The access problems will be the worst for seniors on Medicare and \nlow-income people on Medicaid. The Actuary says ``providers might tend \nto accept more patients who have private insurance with relatively \nattractive payment rates and fewer Medicare and Medicaid patients, \nexacerbating existing access problems for the latter group.''\n  Premiums for the government-run plan would actually be higher than \nunder private plans. Agreeing with the Congressional Budget Office, the \nChief Actuary said that because the government plan would not encourage \nhigher\n\n[[Page S13022]]\n\nvalue health care and it would attract sicker people, premiums for the \ngovernment-run plan would be 4 percent higher than for the private \ninsurers.\n  Then there is a point about employers dropping coverage. The Chief \nActuary concluded that 17 million people will lose their employer-\nsponsored coverage. Many smaller employers would be ``inclined to \nterminate their existing coverage'' so their workers could qualify for \n``heavily subsidized coverage'' through the exchange.\n  Then it speaks, lastly, about the long-term health care part of this \nbill called the CLASS Act. The CLASS Act stands for Community Living \nAssistance Services and Support, C-L-A-S-S.\n  The Chief Actuary has determined that the CLASS Act long-term care \ninsurance program faces ``a significant risk of failure'' because the \nhigh costs will attract sicker people and lead to low participation. \nEven though premiums would be $240 a month, the policy would result in \n``a net Federal cost in the long term.''\n  I think quoting the Chief Actuary is a very good way to bring \nattention to the shortcomings that, on this side of the aisle, we have \ntried to discuss about the 2,074-page bill. Members on this side of the \naisle have shown that the Reid bill will bend the health spending curve \nthe wrong way over the next year and that the Reid bill cuts Medicare \nby $\\1/2\\ trillion and jeopardizes seniors' access to care. So, again, \nquoting from the Health and Human Services Chief Actuary's analysis \nconfirms the dangerous consequences of the 2,074-page Reid bill.\n  I would like to highlight some of the findings in a more encompassing \nway than I just did, quoting the Chief Actuary.\n  First, contrary to what Members on the other side of the aisle claim, \nthe Chief Actuary's report confirms that the Reid bill bends the cost \ncurve the wrong way. According to the HHS Chief Actuary, over the next \n10 years--and this chart highlights it--``total national health \nexpenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated total of \n$234 billion.'' And a good portion of the increase in national health \nexpenditures would be caused by the so-called fees in this bill on \nmedical devices and on prescription drugs and on health insurance \npremiums.\n  Here we have a chart where the Chief Actuary found that ``. . . fees \nwould . . . be passed through to health consumers in the form of higher \ndrug and device prices and higher insurance premiums . . .'' This would \nresult in ``. . . an associated increase of approximately $11 billion \nper year in overall national health expenditures.'' This refutes claims \nfrom the other side that the so-called fees won't be passed on to \nconsumers. And this analysis clearly refutes claims from the other side \nthat the Reid bill saves money.\n  Next, the Chief Actuary also confirms that the Reid bill jeopardizes \nbeneficiary access to care. The Chief Actuary tallied up around $493 \nbillion in net Medicare cuts, and he raised concerns in particular \nabout two categories of these Medicare cuts.\n  First, the report warns about the permanent productivity adjustments \nto annual payment updates. These productivity adjustments \n``automatically cut annual Medicare payment updates based on \nproductivity measures for the entire economy,'' not just for that \nsection of health care part of the economy.\n  The Chief Actuary confirms that these permanent cuts would threaten \naccess to care. Referring to these cuts, he wrote that ``. . . the \nestimated savings . . . may be unrealistic'' and ``. . . possibly \njeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries.''\n  ``It is doubtful that many could improve their own productivity to \nthe end achieved by the economy at large.'' This is a direct quote from \nthe Chief Actuary's report. He goes on to say, ``We are not aware of \nany empirical evidence demonstrating the medical community's ability to \nachieve productivity improvements equal to those of the overall \neconomy.''\n  In other words, basically he is saying this: If you are going to make \na judgment that you are going to cut health care costs and that \nproductivity has to be measured by the entire economy, you can't take \nthe entire economy and apply it to a small segment of the economy--\nhealth care--and expect it to be fair and expect that small segment of \nthe economy to be as productive and equal the productivity of the \nentire U.S. economy.\n  You have to listen to these people who are professionals in these \nareas. The Chief Actuary is a professional. In fact, the Chief \nActuary's conclusion is that it would be difficult for providers to \neven remain profitable over time, as Medicare payments fail to keep up \nwith the cost of caring for beneficiaries.\n  Referring to this chart, ultimately, here is the Chief Actuary's \nconclusion: that providers who rely on Medicare might end their \nparticipation in Medicare, ``. . . possibly jeopardizing access to care \nfor beneficiaries.'' That is right out of the Chief Actuary's report, \nis where that quote comes from.\n  He even has numbers to back up these statements. His office ran \nsimulations of the effect of these drastic and permanent cuts. Here we \nhave the quote. Based on the simulations, the Chief Actuary found that \nduring the first 10 years, ``. . . 20 percent of Medicare Part A \nproviders would become unprofitable . . . as a result of productivity \nadjustments.\n  This is going to be horrible on rural America where we already have \ndifficult times recruiting doctors and keeping our hospitals open. As I \nsaid, it is difficult to keep up with these productivity adjustments by \nour providers. It is for this reason that the Actuary found that \n``reductions in payment updates . . . based on economy-wide \nproductivity gains, are unlikely to be sustainable on a permanent \nannual basis.'' That is right out of the report of the Actuary.\n  The second category of Medicare cuts the Chief Actuary raises \nconcerns about would be imposed by the new independent Medicare \nadvisory board created in this 2,074-page bill. This new body of \nunelected officials would have broad authority to make even further \ncuts in Medicare. These additional cuts in Medicare would be driven by \narbitrary cost growth targets based on a blend of general economic \ngrowth and medical inflation. This board would have the authority to \nimpose further automatic Medicare cuts, even absent any congressional \naction.\n  The Chief Actuary gives a reality check to this proposal. He shows \nhow tall an order the Reid bill's target for health care cost growth \nactually is.\n  Again quoting the Actuary:\n\n       Limiting cost growth to a level below medical price \n     inflation would represent an exceedingly difficult challenge.\n\n  He points out in this analysis that Medicare cost growth was below \nthis target in only 4 of the last 25 years. Just think--what this \n2,074-page bill is trying to accomplish is something that has been \naccomplished in only 4 out of the last 25 years.\n  The Actuary also points out that the backroom deals that carved out \ncertain types of providers would complicate this board's effort to cut \nMedicare. So, to this analysis:\n\n       The necessary savings would have to be achieved primarily \n     through changes affecting physician services, Medicare \n     Advantage payments, and Part D.\n\n  So providers, such as hospitals, will escape from this board's cut at \nthe expense of doctors, Medicare Advantage plans, and higher premiums \nimposed on beneficiaries for their Medicare drug coverage, Part D of \nMedicare. If we survey the Nation's seniors, I doubt very much they \nwould say that raising their premiums for Medicare drug coverage is \nwhat they would call health care reform.\n  This board, which can cut reimbursements, is guaranteed to have to \nimpose these additional Medicare cuts. In other words, they can do it.\n  According to the Chief Actuary's analysis of the Medicare cuts in the \nReid bill, even though the Medicare cuts already in the Reid bill are \n``quite substantial,'' they would--the savings ``would not be \nsufficient to meet the growth rate targets.'' This means the board will \nbe required by law to impose even more Medicare cuts, in addition to \nthe massive Medicare cuts already in the bill.\n  This bill imposes a $2\\1/2\\ trillion tab on Americans. It kills jobs \nwith taxes and fees that go into effect 4 years before the reforms kick \nin.\n  It kills jobs with an employer mandate. It imposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in \nhigher taxes on premiums, on medical devices, on prescription drugs and \nmore. It jeopardizes access to care with massive\n\n[[Page S13023]]\n\nMedicare cuts. It imposes higher costs. It raises premiums. It bends \nthe growth curve the wrong way; in other words, up instead of down. \nThis is not what people have in mind when they think about health care \nreform.\n  There is another aspect to this bill that I wish to go over. I hope \nthe third time is the charm. I hope this time the other side of the \naisle will understand that the Reid bill increases taxes on middle-\nincome families, individuals, and single parents. That is because \ncontrary to the claims made by the other side of the aisle, the Reid \nbill clearly raises taxes on middle-income Americans. We have data, not \nfrom this Senator, but as I quoted previously the expertise of the \nChief Actuary, I want to quote the expertise now of the Joint Committee \non Taxation, professionals who are blind to politics, who judge things \nand call them like they see them. Yesterday I pointed out how the same \nJoint Committee on Taxation data led my Democratic friends to proclaim \nthat the Reid bill provided a net tax cut to all Americans. We have \nthis distribution chart I used previously to show that that net really \nis not net.\n  There is no question that the bill does provide a tax benefit to a \ngroup of Americans, a relatively small group. A much larger group, \nhowever, will see their taxes go up. Most, if not all in this group, \nwill not benefit from the government subsidy for health insurance. That \nis part of this 2,074-page bill. As a result, the generous subsidy that \nis in that bill that is going to a small group of Americans cannot be \nused by this larger group to offset their increased tax liabilities. \nThe other side, however, wants to spread the large tax benefit that is \ngoing to this small group of Americans to everybody; in other words, \nall Americans, even among those Americans who are not eligible to \nreceive the subsidy, and then somehow claim that all Americans are \nreceiving a tax cut. How can a person receive a tax cut if they are not \nreceiving some type of tax benefit?\n  Yes, the data shows that some will receive a benefit, but the data \nalso shows that the others will see a tax increase. I have highlighted \nin yellow these various figures, individuals and families who will see \na tax increase. In general, these individuals and families are not \nreceiving the subsidy for health insurance. This means they have no \ngovernment benefit to offset their new tax liability. The most \nimportant point I want to make--for the third time--is that these tax \nincreases fall on individuals making more than $50,000 and families \nmaking more than $75,000. Again, I highlighted this group on the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation chart.\n  The Joint Committee distributed in this chart three separate tax \nprovisions: the high-cost plan tax, the medical expense deduction \nlimitation, and the Medicare payroll tax. Among these tax provisions, \nthe high-cost plan tax seems to be garnering the most attention and \nalso tremendous opposition. I don't have to explain who the opponents \nof this tax increase are. Everybody knows. In fact, yesterday I had \nrepresentatives of the Iowa Education Association, the teachers of \nIowa, saying they are against that high plan tax because it is going to \nhurt Iowa teachers. So if this provision, the high-cost plan tax, were \nto drop out of the Reid bill for one reason or another--and this bill \nis still being written in secret or at least changes in this 2,074-page \nbill are being written in secret so who knows what is going to happen \nto this highly controversial thing--if it is taken out, some Members \nmay feel they have successfully shielded the middle class from a tax \nincrease. Unfortunately, for those Members who may be hopeful of this, \nlesser known tax provisions that are likely to stay in the changes that \ncome through the Democratic health care reform product would still \nraise taxes on the middle class.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. The Joint Committee on Taxation \ntells us so. Specifically, that committee sent a letter to Senator \nCrapo stating that tax provisions such as the cap on flexible savings \naccounts, the elimination of tax reimbursements for over-the-counter \nmedicines and, most importantly, the individual mandate excise tax \npenalty will increase taxes on people making less than $250,000. That \nhappens to be middle-class individual, middle-class families, and \nmiddle-class single parents.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Mike Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: This letter is in response to your \n     request of December 8, 2009, for information regarding the \n     ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,'' as introduced \n     by Senator Reid. In particular, you requested that we provide \n     you with information on the provisions in the bill that would \n     increase tax liability for taxpayers with adjusted gross \n     income (``AGI'') under $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of a \n     joint return).\n       In previous correspondence with you, we provided a \n     distributional analysis of the bill. In estimating the \n     distributional effects of the bill, we distributed items that \n     have economic incidence on individuals, including some items \n     that do not have statutory incidence. We are enclosing a copy \n     of that distributional analysis for reference. Included in \n     the distribution table are the following items that would \n     have statutory incidence as well as economic incidence on \n     individuals and are likely to increase tax liabilities for \n     some taxpayers with AGI below $200,000 ($250,000 in the case \n     of a joint return):\n       1. Raise the 7.5 percent AGI floor on medical expenses \n     deduction to 10 percent; and\n       2. Additional 0.5 percent hospital insurance tax on wages \n     in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 joint).\n       You asked us to enumerate items that we have not previously \n     distributed and that we believe could affect the tax \n     liability of taxpayers with AGI below $200,000 ($250,000 in \n     the case of a joint return). Below is a list of the \n     provisions that we have not previously distributed and that \n     have statutory incidence on individuals, with some of those \n     individuals likely to have income below your threshold:\n       1. Conform definition of medical expenses for health \n     savings accounts, Archer MSAs, health flexible spending \n     arrangements, and health reimbursement arrangements;\n       2. Increase the penalty for nonqualified health savings \n     account distributions to 20 percent;\n       3. Limit health flexible spending arrangements in cafeteria \n     plans to $2,500;\n       4. Impose a five-percent excise tax on cosmetic surgery and \n     similar procedures; and\n       5. Impose an individual mandate penalty.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If we can be of \n     further assistance in this matter, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas A. Barthold.\n       Enclosure.\n\n[[Page S13024]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS11DE09.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S13025]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS11DE09.002\n     \n\n\n[[Page S13026]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In closing, let me turn to one more chart the Joint Tax \nCommittee has provided. This chart shows the effect on the medical \nexpense deduction limitation. This tax increase is just one of the many \ntax increases likely to stay in the new Democratic proposal. On this \nchart, which is for the year 2019, because that is when this bill is \nfully implemented, we see positive dollar figures. I have highlighted \nthese dollar figures in yellow. For those who may not be able to see, I \nwill reiterate that this chart only has positive dollar figures on it. \nBut remember, as I explained yesterday, when we see positive dollar \nfigures from the Joint Committee on Taxation, that committee is telling \nus that taxes for these people are going to go up. That means for all \nof the tax returns listed on this chart, taxes will be going up for \neach. And this tax increase, the medical expense deduction limitation, \nreaches as low as someone making $10,000 a year.\n  Maybe some of these low-income individuals and families who will see \na tax increase under this provision will receive a subsidy for health \ninsurance. These people may be able to offset this new tax liability. \nBut you can bet your bottom dollar that a large portion of the middle-\nincome individuals and families are not receiving a subsidy. This means \nthat this tax liability highlighted in yellow cannot be offset by the \ngovernment benefit.\n  My Democratic friends cannot escape that fact. Even if my friends \ndrop some of the tax provisions in the current Reid bill, many tax \nprovisions will most likely remain. And those tax provisions will \nincrease taxes on middle-class Americans. This not only breaks \nPresident Obama's pledge, but it will arbitrarily burden middle-class \nAmericans for years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report to accompany H.R. 3288.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise about a program funded in that conference report. It is a \nprogram that we put under the framework of Cuba broadcasting. It is \nsurrogate broadcasting into a closed society, a society for which the \nState controls all information or attempts to control all information \nto its 11 million citizens. It is a part of a long tradition of the \nUnited States with the Voice of America type of broadcasting, the \neffort to try to bring a free flow of information into countries in the \nworld which are governed by despotic rulers. We did this successfully \nin the former Soviet Union. We did it successfully in Eastern Europe \nand during the changes in the Czech Republic, then Czechoslovakia, \nPoland, the Solidarity movement, and many others. We have been proud of \nthat history of bringing the free flow of information. We now try to \nuse it in different parts of the world based on the new challenges we \nhave.\n  One of those places in the world in which we do this surrogate \nbroadcasting is into the island of Cuba, because it has a repressive \nregime that will not allow the free flow of information to go to its \npeople. We have a program called Radio and Television Marti. Marti is \nsort of like the George Washington of Cuba. It is named after him.\n  In 1983, Congress passed the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act to \nprovide the people of Cuba, through Radio Marti, with information the \nCuban Government would try to censor and keep from them. Subsequently \nin 1990, Congress authorized U.S. television broadcasting to Cuba \nthrough Radio and Television Marti to support the right of the Cuban \npeople to receive information and ideas they would not normally \nreceive. It opened radio and television broadcasting to Cuba, provided \na consistently reliable and authoritative source of accurate, \nobjective, and comprehensive news commentary and other information \nabout events in Cuba and elsewhere. It did so to promote the cause of \nfreedom inside of Cuba.\n  We know there is a long history of repressive regimes trying to block \nour surrogate broadcasting around the world. They just don't simply sit \nback and say: Send it all in. Let me accept whatever it is you are \nsending in. That is not their effort. Their effort is to block. And our \ndifficulty with broadcasting has never been a justification for cutting \nfunding for these programs. We have never submitted to the proposition \nthat when a regime tries to block our surrogate broadcasting--whether \nit was Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, all of those efforts, there \nwas always blocking taking place--that that is a cause or justification \nfor cutting funding. It should not be a different standard now.\n  I ask, when it comes to Cuba broadcasting, why the double standard? \nIn fact, especially now when change is coming to Cuba, it is in our \ninterest to have the capacity to broadcast information to the Cuban \npeople.\n  I want to show one of the charts that may be a little difficult back \nat home, but these are actual photographs which came from a January \n2009 Government Accountability Office report which were provided by an \norganization that reports on Cuban affairs. It depicts evidence of \nCubans' ability to watch Television Marti despite Cuban jamming \nefforts. These pictures were taken from inside of Cuba. They may not be \nthe best picture quality, although I doubt they have digital television \ninside of Cuba. But nonetheless, they have the ability to see it.\n  There are other pictures of Cubans. Here is a picture of a group of \nindividuals who, in fact, are part of an effort to create a library \nsystem, something as fundamental in the United States as a free public \nlibrary. There isn't that in Cuba, at least not a free public library. \nThey control what books might be found there.\n  So these groups try to create information. One of the things they do \nis, again, to be able to have access--as shown in this picture. This is \na panel that is talking on Television Marti. Here, in this picture, is \na young child watching a Marti program inside of Cuba. You can see the \nlogo here of Marti TV.\n  As shown in this picture, this was a special that was broadcast into \nCuba and was seen in Cuba on the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King on the \nwhole issue of peaceful, nonviolent change--as a message to the Cuban \npeople that, in fact, these things could be achieved.\n  Now, you can see at the bottom of these pictures--it is a little hard \nto see--but here is the Marti logo that is seen on the bottom right-\nhand corner on several of these photographs.\n  This came from that Government Accountability Office report. A \nJanuary 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office noted the \nfollowing:\n  The Broadcasting Board of Governors--which is the oversight we have \nas the Federal Government--and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting and the \nU.S. Interests Section in Havana--which, in essence, is, we do not have \nan Embassy there because we do not have relations, but we have an \nInterests Section there--that Cuba officials emphasized that they face \nsignificant challenges in conducting valid audience research due to the \nclosed nature of Cuban society.\n  U.S. government officials stationed in Havana are prohibited by the \nCastro regime from traveling outside of Havana.\n  We know it is difficult to travel to Cuba for the purpose of \nconducting audience research. We know the threat of Cuban Government \nsurveillance and reprisals for interviewers and respondents raises \nconcerns about respondents' willingness to answer sensitive questions \nfrankly.\n  In this January 2009 Government Accountability Report, U.S. officials \nindicated that research on Radio and TV Marti's audience size faces \nsignificant limitations. For example, none of the data is \nrepresentative of the entire Cuban population. Telephone surveys are \nthe only random data collection effort in Cuba, but it might not be \nrepresentative of Cuba's media habits for several reasons. But here are \ntwo of the main ones.\n  First, only adults in homes with published telephone numbers are \nsurveyed. According to Broadcasting Board of Governors documents, \napproximately 17 percent of Cuban adults live in households with \npublished household numbers. That means that 83 percent of the \npopulation does not have a published telephone number.\n  Second, the Board of Governors and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting \nofficials noted that because individuals in\n\n[[Page S13027]]\n\nCuba are discouraged or prohibited by their government from listening \nto and watching U.S. international broadcasts, they might be fearful of \nresponding to media surveys and disclosing their media habits.\n  If I am told that it is illegal for me simply to watch the \nprogramming of some international organization, and that I can go to \njail for listening to that programming, then ultimately--then \nultimately--am I going to be truthful to some telephone survey about: \nDid I watch TV Marti? Did I listen to Radio Marti?\n  Mr. President, I know about this personally. Years ago, when I was in \nthe House of Representatives, while I had an aunt who was still alive \nat the time, who I had asked never to acknowledge me as her nephew--\nwhich she agreed to--in my second term, however, she was listening to \nme on Radio Marti, and in a moment of pride, she said: ``Oh, that \nMenendez is my nephew.''\n  Unfortunately, she said it in front of some visitors who she thought \nwere her friends. One of them was part of El Comite de Defensa de la \nRevolucion, which means ``The Committee to Defend the Revolution,'' a \nblock watch organization in every city, in every village, in every \nhamlet inside Cuba, whose only job is to go and spy on their neighbors \nand tell the state security who speaks ill or does something against \nthe regime.\n  Unfortunately, for that simple act of speaking out, saying to a \nfriend: ``Oh, that Menendez is my nephew,'' my aunt suffered serious \nconsequences.\n  So the audience size might very well be larger than the survey \nresults would indicate because people are fearful to say: Yes, I am \nlistening to Radio and Television Marti, because I cannot do that and \nnot face the consequences of a regime that would arrest me.\n  Radio and TV Marti have a larger audience in Cuba. Why do I say that? \nBecause a 2007 survey that the Office of Cuba Broadcasting \ncommissioned, intended to obtain information on programming preferences \nand media habits, also contained data on Radio and TV Marti's audience \nsize.\n  While the survey was not intended to measure listening rates or \nproject audience size, this nonrandom survey of 382 Cubans, who had \nrecently arrived in the United States--so now they were free to say \nwhat they actually did back at home because they were not subject to \nbeing arrested simply for listening to Radio and Television Marti--\nfound that 45 percent of all of those respondents reported listening to \nRadio Marti and that over 21 percent reported watching TV Marti within \nthe last 6 months before leaving Cuba.\n  So I rise because I want to bring this data, this information, this \nperspective to the debate.\n  I am happy to see the very deep cuts that were made to the Office of \nCuba Broadcasting that contains both Radio and Television Marti have \nlargely been restored. That is one of the reasons I felt willing to \nvote to proceed with the omnibus bill.\n  One of the body's greatest strengths is the ability to freely debate \nissues in an open format, issues on which, in the end, we might \ncompletely disagree, but issues that need to be brought into clear \nfocus for the American people.\n  However, when I see my colleagues drawing conclusions on their own, \nwithout reasonable data to support those conclusions, I feel compelled \nto come and present an alternative perspective of the facts.\n  Why is this important to us. The United States is a beacon of light \nof freedom and democracy around the world. The promotion of democracy \nand human rights has always been one of the pillars of our foreign \npolicy.\n  Yesterday was Human Rights Day, which is the day that marks the \nanniversary of the United Nations Assembly's adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights in 1948. It is recognized every year on \nDecember 10.\n  Yesterday, in the midst of the recognition of this day in Havana, we \nsaw the brutal Castro regime cracking down on people just because they \nwere trying to exercise their right for peaceful demonstration. We saw \npeople beaten, arrested, and forcibly detained.\n  There is a group of ladies; they call themselves the Ladies in White. \nThey are mothers and sisters and friends of jailed dissidents inside of \nCuba. So these are people of imprisoned family members--their son or \ntheir daughter, their brother or sister, their friends--and the only \nreason those people are in jail is because they have pursued peaceful \nmeans to try to create change inside of their own country. They may \nhave said something. They may have worn a white band that says \n``cambio,'' which means ``change.'' They may have simply uttered the \nfact that: What we need is change inside of Cuba.\n  So these Ladies in White--they dress fully in white so that, in fact, \nit is a form of being noticed, but, again, a peaceful form--held long-\nstem flowers and miniature Cuban flags. They were attacked by hundreds \nof angry pro-government demonstrators who sought to drown out their \nchants of ``freedom'' by yelling ``this street belongs to Fidel.''\n  Now, in Cuba, these groups are not spontaneous. It is not the \ncitizenry. It is something called ``rapid response brigades.'' They are \nstate security dressed as civilians, whose purpose is to make it seem \nthat the populous is against the human rights activists and political \ndissidents. But, ultimately, they are state security agents who act in \na way to make it seem quite different. But they are thugs.\n  Mr. President, the reason the regime organizes protests in this way \nis so if you orchestrate a protest, where it looks like its citizens \nare protesting against each other, then the regime can deny, in fact, \nany role in the event.\n  However, we know very well the role the Castro regime plays in these \ndemonstrations. Especially in light of the events of yesterday and \ntoday, we know the Castro regime is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship \nthat continues to violate the most basic human rights, continues to \ncrush debate and crush dialog.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor as part of my concerns and I spoke \nabout this gentleman and his wife, as shown in this picture. I spoke \nabout Jorge Luis Garcia Perez ``Antunez.'' This is a gentleman who \nsaid, while standing in a plaza in his hometown, which is in the center \nof Havana--it is not where the tourists go, not on the beaches of \nHavana; it is in the heart of Havana--he said what we need is the type \nof change we saw in Eastern Europe.\n  For that simple statement, he was thrown into jail for 17 years--17 \nyears. He came out a couple years ago, but he has not changed. He has \nnot changed his views or his effort to create human rights.\n  He issued a public letter that I read yesterday, an English \ntranslation, of a public letter he wrote to the present dictator, Raul \nCastro, the brother of Fidel Castro, and he said many things. I am not \ngoing to read the whole letter again, but he said things like: Let me \nask you a few questions that I think are important.\n\n       With what right do the authorities, without a prior crime \n     being committed, detain and impede the free movement of their \n     citizens in violation of a universally recognized right?\n\n  The very rights that are being observed in that international Human \nRights Day of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n       What feelings could move a man like Captain Idel Gonzalez \n     Morfi to beat my wife, a defenseless woman so brutally \n     causing lasting effects to her bones for the sole act of \n     arriving at a radio station to denounce with evidence the \n     torture that her brother--\n\n  Her brother; this is his wife shown in the picture--\n\n     received in a Cuban prison.\n\n  I spoke about him yesterday and his letter. What happened today, Mr. \nPresident?\n  Today, the day after Human Rights Day, and the day after I read his \nletter into the Record, and 2 days after he presented that letter to \nRaul Castro, he was arrested again by the regime and arbitrarily \ndetained with his wife and another activist.\n  What is his crime? That I read a letter in the U.S. Senate about his \ncalls for freedom and democracy? And the day after the recognition of \ninternational human rights, he gets arrested today, and his wife gets \narrested today--or detained today. I am not sure. He got arrested for \nsure.\n  TV Marti is one of the many efforts the U.S. Government rightly \ninvests in to try to reach the Cuban people with information, to try to \nreach the people who were beaten today and yesterday and, for decades, \nsimply for trying to demonstrate peacefully, to speak their mind, to \nwalk in peace and in remembrance of their loved ones they lost under \nthe clenched fists of this regime.\n\n[[Page S13028]]\n\n  I feel badly that the day after I spoke about Mr. Antunez, he ends up \nin jail. So we need to have a spotlight, just as we did for Aleksandr \nSolzhenitsyn in the Soviet Union; just as we did for Vaclav Havel as he \nwas trying to create change for the Czech Republic; just as we did with \nLech Walesa when he was having the Solidarnosc Movement inside Poland.\n  For some reason, I can't get anybody to come to this floor and talk \nabout the human rights violations inside Cuba. I hear a lot about: \nLet's trade with Cuba, let's do business with Cuba, let's travel to \nCuba but, God, I never hear anyone talking about these human rights \nactivists like the Lech Walesas, the Vaclav Havels, the Aleksandr \nSolzhenitsyns of that other time.\n  This man got arrested today simply because yesterday we made his \nletter public. That is the Castro regime that I know, not the \nromanticism of what some people have about what goes on at that island.\n  So I am pleased the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has made efforts over \nthe last year to reevaluate the programs they are carrying out and \ncarefully consider creative ways to reach the Cuban people. They have \ndone this with Television Marti. They will continue to do this with \nother programs. I would expect nothing less. The kind of evaluation \nshould continue. We should constantly strive to tailor our programs so \nour investments are reaching those who truly need our help, investments \nthat are advancing U.S. foreign policy interests, the national \ninterests of the United States, and the national security interests of \nthe United States.\n  I have a declaration that came out of Cuba of over 100 human rights \nactivists inside Cuba who are in support of the efforts of the United \nStates as it relates to the surrogate broadcasting that goes into Cuba \nfrom Radio and Television Marti. This broadcasting provides some free \nflow of information of what is happening in the rest of the world, as \nwell as what is happening inside Cuba. Because that is part of what we \nhelp here, to let those who otherwise would not know because of a \nclosed society and a dictatorship that rules with an iron fist what is \nhappening even inside their own country, what is happening to people \nsuch as Mr. Antunez, what is happening to the ladies in white who are \nprotesting peacefully about their loved ones in jail.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. With that letter of over 100 human rights activists is \nthe recognition that we will not let up for Mr. Antunez and the \nrecognition that there are voices who will continue to speak out for \nthe human rights.\n  The last point I wish to make, imagine if you were sitting in a gulag \nsomewhere, if you were beaten simply because you had a few words to say \nabout creating change peacefully in your own country; imagine if you \ncould be swept away by security police and taken to some jail and maybe \nnot seen for years after that. Would you not want someone somewhere in \nthe world to be standing and speaking for you? I would, and that is \nwhat I try to do on this floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the massive, unamendable spending bill \nbefore the Senate includes three bills that the Senate never had a \nchance to consider, and is chock-full of earmarks. At a time of record \nbudget deficits, we should be showing our constituents that we are \nserious about fiscal responsibility. Instead of controlling spending, \nthis bill represents business as usual in Congress.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to address a question \nsubmitted to me from the good Senator from Illinois as to whether the \nDC Opportunity Scholarship Program will in fact end after this year. In \norder to respond to my colleague, I would like to highlight a \nparticular section of the Financial Services and General Government \nAppropriations Act of 2010 that funds the District of Columbia's \nbudget.\n  In title IV, which explains how the District of Columbia is funded, \nit states that $13.2 million will indeed be provided for opportunity \nscholarships for existing students in the DC Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram. However, the very next line clearly states that the funds are \nto ``remain available until expended,'' which means that the program \nwill eventually be phased out and terminated once the funding for \ncurrent students is exhausted. Students in the program will slowly be \nphased out over time, unable to avail themselves of future educational \nopportunities currently given to them through this program.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, which has the overwhelming \nsupport of DC residents, parents, Mayor Adrian Fenty, Chancellor \nMichelle Rhee, former Mayor Anthony Williams, and a majority of the DC \nCity Council, has now been mandated a slow death by House and Senate \nappropriators. This scholarship program, which gives students of \nWashington, DC's poorest families a chance at a quality education, has \nnow effectively been terminated since there is only funding available \nfor existing scholarships and existing students, and not for future \nscholarships and future students.\n  By funding this program in such a manner in the omnibus, Congress is \nultimately signaling the beginning of the end for this scholarship \nprogram. By disallowing future students to take part, the size of the \nprogram will shrink year after year, and will deny entry to siblings of \nexisting participants--punishing many who have been waiting in line for \nthis tremendous opportunity. Additionally, the federal evaluation of \nthis program will be compromised as the numbers of participants \ndiminishes, making it difficult for administrators to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the program.\n  The fact that this administration continues to claim that the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program is not being terminated is yet another \nact of deception on their part to the American people. The President, \nwho himself is a recipient of a K-12 educational scholarship, has \nrefused to stand up for children in our Nation's Capital and fight for \nthe same educational opportunities afforded to him and his family--a \nright he exercises now as he practices school choice with his own \nchildren.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, working families are struggling to pay \nthe costs of health care in this country. As the debate over health \ncare reform progresses, we must keep in mind that Americans need and \ndeserve quality, affordable health care. All too often families learn \nthat the plan they could afford was not adequate when they needed it \nmost.\n  I recently heard from Cory and Erin in Lake Herman, SD. They shared \nthe story of their daughter's birth and how they discovered the \ninadequacies of their seemingly affordable health insurance policy. \nWhen Cory and Erin's daughter Katarzyna was born in 2006, Cory was \nworking as an English and math teacher. At the time, the family health \ninsurance plan available to him through the school district cost nearly \n50 percent of his monthly salary. Cory chose instead to buy a \ncatastrophic, high-deductible policy on the individual market for just \nover 10 percent of his income. Cory and Erin were healthy adults and \nhad no major medical issues until the birth of their daughter. Their \ninsurance policy did not cover prenatal or maternity care.\n  Wanting to be smart health care consumers, Cory and Erin shopped \naround for the best and most affordable hospital to welcome the birth \nof their first child and decided on their nearby community hospitial. \nHowever, when Katarzyna was born, she had a lung infection that \nrequired immediate action. Exhausted and worried for the health of \ntheir new baby girl, Cory and Erin had only moments to decide whether \nto airlift Katarzyna to a hospital with specialized care. At that \nmoment, the last thing they could think about was the cost.\n  Katarzyna spent 3 nights in the Natal Intensive Care Unit of one of \nthe State's largest hospitals, where she received top-notch care and \nsurvived the near-fatal pneumonia. The total cost came to $24,000, of \nwhich Cory and Erin's high-deductible insurance policy covered only \n$12,000. For the next several months, the family faced not only the \nchallenges of a new baby but significant debt and a drawn-out struggle \nwith their insurance company. They found a mistake with nearly every \nbill they received. Since this experience, Cory and Erin have purchased \na new policy but worry that the insurance they can afford is not \nadequate in the face of another unforeseen medical emergency.\n  Like many Americans, Cory and Erin have health insurance. Despite \ntheir limited income, they took the responsibility to buy their own \npolicy and\n\n[[Page S13029]]\n\ntried to be smart health care consumers. Their experience, however, \nillustrates the vulnerability of Americans who purchase insurance on \nthe individual market, as well as the limits to which it is possible \nfor Americans to be informed health care consumers.\n  The health care market does not function like other consumer markets. \nAsk your neighbor what a gallon of milk costs and they could tell you. \nAsk them how much it costs to have a baby and you would likely get a \nvariety of answers, based entirely on their own experience with this \nimportant life event. The fact is the cost of having a baby depends. It \ndepends on how much you pay for health insurance, what your insurance \npolicy will cover and how much of that cost is your share. It depends \non where you live, what complications may arise and whether the \nhospital nearby is equipped to handle an emergency.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will guarantee \nfamilies access to affordable health insurance and coverage for \nessential benefits, including prenatal and maternity care. New health \ninsurance exchanges in every State will provide a menu of quality, \naffordable health insurance plans for the self-employed and those who \ncan't afford the coverage offered by their employer. Families who need \nassistance will be eligible for tax credits to make the plan of their \nchoice affordable. Most importantly, families like Cory, Erin and \nKatarzyna's will have health insurance that covers life's essential \nneeds. The birth of a child should not be a time to worry about what \nyour health insurance will pay for or whether you can afford the \ntreatment you need. Health care reform will give American families one \nless thing to worry about with the security of quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize an \noutstanding Kentuckian for her talented efforts to entertain and \neducate the public about the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park. \nRanger Carol Borneman is the recipient of the 2009 Freeman Tilden Award \nfor the southeast region of the National Park Service. Ranger Carol, as \nshe is commonly known from her television show, ``Wild Outdoor \nAdventures with Ranger Carol,'' has been with the Cumberland Gap \nNational Historical Park for over 15 years and serves as the park's \nsupervisory interpreter.\n  The Cumberland Gap, through the Cumberland Mountains and near the \nKentucky-Virginia border, was America's historical gateway to the West. \nRanger Carol's stories bring to life the travel experiences of \nAmerica's earliest western settlers in a way that is both educational \nand memorable.\n  There is no doubt that it is Ranger Carol's love for the park that \nkeeps her stories entertaining. Mark Woods, Superintendent of the \nCumberland Gap National Historical Park, stated that ``she truly has a \npassion for the work that she does and it definitely comes through on \nthe show. . . . You cannot watch the show without being captivated by \nCarol's knowledge, dedication, and sheer enthusiasm.''\n  The Freeman Tilden Award is the most prestigious award given in the \nfield of interpretation and education within the National Park Service. \nBorneman is not new to such an honor; in fact, this is the second time \nshe has received it. It is with great pride that I rise today to ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating Ranger Carol Borneman on \nreceiving the Freeman Tilden Award, and for her outstanding efforts to \nkeep important Kentucky history alive for future generations to enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13029-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING A. ROBERT DOLL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I would like to reflect on the \nlife of a dear friend, the late A. Robert Doll. Bob, as he was \naffectionately known, was a well-known lawyer, leader, and volunteer in \nhis beloved Louisville community. His passing is a great loss, but his \nlegacy lives on in the business and organizations he so dearly loved.\n  Mr. Doll was a founding member of the law firm Greenebaum, Doll & \nMcDonald in Louisville. He joined the firm in the 1950s after receiving \nhis law degree from the College of William and Mary. During his 50-plus \nyears with Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald, Bob helped the firm grow from a \nmere 20 lawyers to a firm with multiple offices and 120 lawyers. When \nBob was just 30 years old, he argued and won a case before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. Doll showed his respect for his customers with the motto, ``I \nbelieve that a successful law firm must emphasize and create the \ndelivery of prompt and exceptional legal service to the client--we must \nremember that the client is king.'' One of the great successes of his \ncareer was helping to bring the Toyota plant to Scott County. He also \nserved as the president of the Louisville Bar Foundation. In 1986, Mr. \nDoll was named Lawyer of the Year by the Louisville Bar Association.\n  Bob was also active in his community, as he served as president of \nthe Greater Louisville YMCA board of directors and maintained a leading \nrole in the Boy Scouts of America. Phillip Scott, the current firm \nchairman of Greenebaum, Doll & McDonald, stated that ``Mr. Doll was not \njust a great lawyer, but a great man and great leader. He was a \nprogressive leader who made Greenebaum the firm it is today. We deeply \nvalue the friendship, ideals and character he bestowed upon on us, and \nwe'll miss him greatly.''\n  As a leader in his community, Bob Doll was a man of integrity who \nmade a real positive impact in the Commonwealth. His devotion for \ncreating and maintaining a client-focused business shows he always \ncared about serving the community first. He will be missed by all who \nhad the pleasure of knowing him, and I ask that my colleagues join me \nin paying tribute to the wonderful life of Mr. A. Bob Doll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13029-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13029-S13030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EL SALVADOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss a subject that \nshould interest all Senators concerning the country of El Salvador, \nwhich recently elected a new President and last month suffered \nextensive loss of life and devastating property damage as a result of \ntorrential rains caused by Hurricane Ida.\n  First, I congratulate the people of El Salvador on the election, \nwhich was historic in that President Funes is the country's first \nPresident since the end of the civil war who is a member of the FMLN, \nwhich after the 1992 Peace Accords evolved from an armed insurgency \ninto a political party. I am encouraged by what I have heard about \nPresident Funes' policies and wish him the best.\n  Second, the destruction caused by Hurricane Ida was extensive. \nExceptionally heavy and constant rain fell on November 7 and 8, \nresulting in flooding and landslides that killed 192 people. Another 80 \nwere reported missing, and more than 14,295 others were displaced from \ntheir homes. Thousands of homes, as well as roads, bridges, and other \npublic buildings, were damaged or destroyed.\n  On November 10, U.S. Charge d'Affaires Robert Blau declared a \ndisaster in response to the damage, and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development has so far allocated some $280,851 in \nhumanitarian aid. An assessment of the\n\n[[Page S13030]]\n\ntotal damage is underway, but it is expected to be in the hundreds of \nmillions, if not billions, of dollars.\n  Congressman Jim McGovern and I have urged the administration to \nprovide additional aid. We remember how the U.S. Government all but \nforgot about El Salvador after the war ended, and this is a time to \nhelp the Salvadoran people recover from this tragedy.\n  Third, an issue that has deeply concerned me for many years is the \nproblem of corruption and impunity in El Salvador. The police and the \ncourts lack the training and resources they need, crimes are rarely \nsolved and perpetrators are rarely punished. Violent crime and \ncorruption have become endemic. El Salvador's democratic and economic \ndevelopment will continue to be impeded by a justice system that is \nincapable of enforcing the rule of law, and in which the Salvadoran \npeople and foreign investors have little confidence.\n  One of the courageous Salvadorans who is trying to change this is Ms. \nZaira Navas, inspector general of the National Police. She has a \nwoefully inadequate budget and too few staff. But despite that, from \neverything I have heard she is doing an outstanding job for justice and \nthe people of El Salvador.\n  I mention Ms. Navas because of the critical importance of the job she \nis doing, and because she has recently received death threats and I am \nconcerned for her safety. I urge officials at the U.S. Embassy to \ndiscuss with President Funes what steps can be taken immediately to \nprovide her the security she needs, and to increase the budget of her \noffice.\n  El Salvador is a small country but one with which the U.S. has a long \nhistory. We both have newly elected presidents, and I am hopeful that \nwe will see a renewed effort to work together to broaden our relations. \nNothing, in my view, is more important than strengthening the rule of \nlaw and supporting people like Ms. Navas, but we should also expand our \ncollaboration in health, education and exchanges, the environment, \ntrade and investment, science and technology, the arts and culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13030-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 CONGO\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last month, the United Nations Group of \nExperts on the Democratic Republic of Congo presented its latest report \nto the U.N. Security Council. Over the years, the Group of Experts has \nconducted critical investigations into violations of the sanctions and \nthe U.N. arms embargo toward Congo as well as human rights abuses and \nthe linkages between natural resource exploitation and the financing of \nillegal armed groups. Yet, too often, the Group of Experts' reports and \nrecommendations have not resulted in action by the Security Council \nand/or U.N. member states. I hope it will be different with this \nreport, especially since it identifies a number of concrete steps \nthrough which U.N. member states can address the financial and support \nnetworks that fuel the violence in eastern Congo.\n  This new Group of Experts report particularly focuses on the FDLR, \nthe armed group comprising many former Rwandan genocidaires that is at \nthe heart of the instability in eastern Congo. It documents how this \ngroup continues to benefit from ``residual but significant support'' \nfrom top commanders of the Congolese military. It also documents how \nthis group is supported by a far-reaching international Diaspora \nnetwork. Based on records of satellite phones, the Group of Experts \nfound that the FDLR commanders frequently communicate with people in \ntwenty-five different countries in Europe, North America and Africa. \nThe report also mentions credible reports and testimony that the FDLR \nis using Burundi ``as a rear base'' for regrouping and recruitment \npurposes.\n  To address these continued support networks, the Group of Experts \nrecommends that U.N. member states direct their respective law \nenforcement and security agencies to conduct investigations and share \nrelevant information on FDLR Diaspora members providing material \nsupport to the group. The Group also calls on member states to \nprosecute violations of the sanctions regime by their nationals or \nleaders of armed groups that are currently residing within their \ncountries. The report cites three such leaders who have resided in \nFrance and Germany. With regard to the Congolese military, the Group \nrecommends that the Security Council require member states to notify \nand get approval from the Sanctions Committee for all deliveries of \nmilitary equipment and provision of training to Congo. This would help \nensure that international assistance is not contributing to abusive \nbehavior or going to units of the military believed to be colluding \nwith armed groups.\n  Building on its previous reports, the Group of Experts report also \nshows how the FDLR and other armed groups continue to benefit from the \nexploitation of natural resources. According to this Group's \ninvestigations, the FDLR continues to get millions of dollars in direct \nfinancing from gold and cassiterite reserves in eastern Congo. The \nreport illustrates how gold from eastern Congo is smuggled out to \nUganda and Burundi, and then travels on to the United Arab Emirates and \nultimately international markets. Similarly, the report documents how \nformer rebels of the CNDP--who have ostensibly become part of the \nCongolese military--continue to control and exploit mineral-rich areas. \nIn fact, two of the most lucrative mining sites are reportedly \ncontrolled by units of the Congolese military that are composed almost \nexclusively of former CNDP units. This is especially worrying in the \ncontext of the CNDP's integration into the Congolese military, which is \nstill extremely fragile.\n  I have long called for action to address the armed exploitation of \nCongo's minerals, which fuels this conflict. I was pleased to join with \nSenators Brownback and Durbin earlier this year to introduce the Congo \nConflict Minerals Act, S. 891, which would commit the United States to \naddress this issue comprehensively. And I was glad that Secretary \nClinton spoke about this issue during her visit to Congo in August. As \nthe Group of Experts report makes clear, armed groups will continue to \nexploit the region's rich mineral base as long as it is profitable. The \nGroup of Experts recommends that member states take necessary measures \nto clarify the due diligence obligations of companies under their \nrespective jurisdictions that operate with these minerals. The Group \nalso calls for the Congolese government to establish an independent \nmonitoring team, with international support, to conduct spot checks of \nmines and mineral trading routes.\n  I am glad that there is increasing outrage about what is happening in \neastern Congo. It is the single deadliest conflict since the Second \nWorld War and millions have been displaced from their homes, forced to \nlive in squalid conditions. Countless women and girls and some men and \nboys in the Congo have endured rape and sexual violence. But our \noutrage means little unless it translates into concrete actions to \nfundamentally change the situation in Congo. We need to finally get \nserious about addressing the underlying issues that make this war \nprofitable and allow it to persist. The Group of Experts has provided a \nclear picture of some of those issues as well as specific ways that \nU.N. member states can address them, including within our own national \njurisdictions. I applaud the Group for its courageous work. I strongly \nhope that the Security Council will pursue the report's \nrecommendations, and I urge the Obama administration to lead the way in \nthis respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13030-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13030-S13031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING WREATHS ACROSS AMERICA\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Wreaths Across \nAmerica and Morrill and Karen Worcester, whose outstanding vision of a \nnationwide effort to extol America's fallen heroes is now in its 18th \nyear!\n  Nothing could be more central to the Wreaths Across America \norganization--which counts among its many tremendous volunteers and \npartners, The Maine State Society of Washington, DC, the Civil Air \nPatrol, the Patriot Guard Riders, and members of The American Legion \nand Veterans of Foreign Wars--than its noble mission to remember those \nwho made the ultimate sacrifice, honor those who serve, and teach our \nchildren that today's freedoms have been won at a great price. And how \nfitting it is that\n\n[[Page S13031]]\n\nMainers across our State ushered in this week of solemn events and \nwreath-laying ceremonies sponsored by Wreaths Across America, the \nculmination of which will be the delivery of as many as 16,000 wreaths \nfor placement at Arlington National Cemetery on December 12 as well as \nobservances in more than 400 participating locations nationwide, \nincluding 24 overseas veterans cemeteries. Indeed, I could not have \nbeen more gratified to join Senator Collins in introducing legislation, \ndesignating December 12, 2009, as ``Wreaths Across America Day'' which \npassed the Senate unanimously on the first of this month.\n  What an inexpressible source of pride it is that tomorrow, on the \nmorning of the 12th, a convoy of Mainers is scheduled to arrive at \nArlington National Cemetery to lay Maine-made balsam wreaths at the \ngrave sites of our Nation's fallen heroes. The Patriot Guard Riders \nwill continue their tradition of escorting tractor-trailers filled with \nwreaths donated by Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, ME, to \nArlington National Cemetery. On a personal note, I well recall the \nWorcester's initiating the Arlington Wreath Project in December of \n1992, when Morrill called my office to ask if he could place his excess \nwreaths on the graves at Arlington National Cemetery. I never could \nhave imagined that what occurred then would someday evolve into a \nnationwide expression of unfailing gratitude to our troops.\n  The enduring legacy of our bravest and finest for whom service above \nself and country above self-interest is woven into the fabric of our \ngreatness is a powerful reminder that freedom is not free, especially \nas the indelible memories of those heroes who, in the immortal words of \nPresident Lincoln ``gave the last full measure of devotion,'' are \netched forever in our minds and upon our hearts. We also owe an \nenormous debt of gratitude to the men and women extraordinary enough to \nwear the uniform who are currently serving in harm's way and placing \ntheir lives on the line on our behalf, especially in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Indeed, what a fitting remembrance this annual gesture of \nreverence and gratefulness by Wreaths Across America represents, \nespecially during this joyous season of giving, for those who have \nbequeathed this great land so much, and for whom we are truly grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13031-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO FIRST SERGEANT BRADLEY G. SIMMONS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to honor 1stSgt Bradley G. Simmons, \nU.S. Marine Corps, for his year of service to the U.S. Senate and for \nhis continuing service to our Nation and the Marine Corps.\n  For the past year, lstSgt Bradley Simmons has worked in my office and \nserved the people of Ohio as the first enlisted Marine fellow in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Before joining the Senate, lstSgt Bradley Simmons served in Kuwait \nwith the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion. He also participated in the \ninitial attack and continuing operations in Iraq.\n  His heroic service as an AAV section leader during that time earned \nhim the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and a combat \ndistinguishing device for valor.\n  1stSgt Bradley Simmons' strength, dedication, and firsthand \nexperience overseas made him an invaluable resource for my staff and \nour Nation's service members and veterans.\n  Understanding of the difficult transition for returning service \nmembers and veterans, lstSgt Bradley Simmons reached out to help them \nand their families in tangible ways.\n  From helping Ohio veterans with their VA claims; to assisting a \nwounded service member during rehabilitation; to meeting and speaking \nwith the families whose loved ones are overseas, lst Sgt Bradley \nSimmons demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to his fellow service \nmembers.\n  His tireless work on the Visions Scholars Act of 2009 will help \nensure that veterans suffering from eye injuries would not also suffer \nfrom the current nationwide shortage of visions specialists at the VA.\n  The Vision Scholars Act of 2009 passed the Senate last month with \ngreat assistance from Sergeant Simmons.\n  But lstSgt Bradley Simmons has been more than a trusted adviser.\n  He's been a teacher and a friend. As First Sergeant Simmons likes to \nsay, he has been running a full-scale Marine Corps familiarization \nprogram in my office for the past year.\n  With a story-telling talent that left you laughing, with a moment of \ncontemplation on the life of a marine, or with a little PT \nencouragement for the deskbound, First Sergeant Simmons made us \nappreciate the leadership qualities that are found throughout the ranks \nof the Marine Corps, but especially in him.\n  From interns in my office to constituents in the State, to all of my \nstaff in Ohio and Washington, he succeeded in educating us about the \nhonor, tradition, and sacrifices readily made by our Marines and our \nmilitary forces.\n  He made us better at our jobs and better citizens in our communities.\n  He accompanied me to Walter Reed to visit troops recovering from \ncombat injuries and later assisted in helping a few of them transition \nto life as a civilian, or on active duty in the guard or reserve.\n  He invited my staff to the Pentagon to a welcome home those recently \ninjured in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  During this past year, First Sergeant Simmons taught us about the \ndetermination and commitment of the men and women who give honor to the \nMarine Corps.\n  A lot has changed in the past year for our office, and for lstSgt \nBradley Simmons as well. First Sergeant Simmons came to my office as a \ngunnery sergeant.\n  At his promotion ceremony a few weeks back, his superiors explained \nthat the Marine Corps does not base promotion in rank on previous \nperformance and accomplishment.\n  Instead, promotion is based on a candidate's innate capability and \npotential to do the job well and the rank of first sergeant justice.\n  Like his superiors, I am as confident that he will succeed in \nanything he attempts and that he demonstrates the courage and \ncommitment that we recognize in him.\n  His humility belies his dedicated service to our Nation. It provides \ngreat comfort knowing that hundreds of marines will have the \nopportunity to work, live, learn, and serve with First Sergeant \nSimmons.\n  He is a testament to the Marines, to our Nation, to his family, and \nto his home State of Kansas.\n  And to Karen, his wife, thank you for your support and sacrifice \nwhile your husband serves this Nation. I enjoyed meeting you and I know \nthat lstSgt Bradley Simmons can do what he does because of your love \nand support.\n  After having the privilege of working with First Sergeant Simmons \nover the past year and seeing the lasting mark he has left on my \noffice, I am honored to have someone of his caliber and commitment \nrepresenting our Nation.\n  Thank you, 1stSgt Bradley G. Simmons, for your distinguished service \nto the people of Ohio and for your continued commitment to protecting \nour Nation and the prosperity of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13031-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13031-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13031-4", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13031-S13032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4017.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENT ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Webb):\n  SA 2872. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission through fiscal year \n2014, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues to \nintroduce an important and bipartisan piece of legislation that will \nhelp protect our Nation's history for future generations.\n  Our bill reauthorizes the National Historical Publications and Record \nCommission, or NHPRC for short, which was first established by Congress \nin 1934. The Commission is the grant-making body of the National \nArchives and Records Administration and is comprised of representatives \nfrom the President of the United States, the U.S. Senate and House of \nRepresentatives, the Federal judiciary, the Departments of State and \nDefense, the Library of Congress, and six national, professional \nassociations of archivists. Since 1964, the Commission has funded \nprojects that locate, preserve, and provide public access to some our \nnation's most precious historical resources that otherwise would be \nlost and destroyed.\n  For example, some of the history that has been preserved by the NHPRC \nover the years has helped award-winning historian David McCullough \nwrite his biography of John Adams and Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow \nwrite his biography of Alexander Hamilton. Further, the NHPRC has \nhelped establish or modernize public records programs in cities all \nacross America such as the cities of Seattle, Boston, and San Diego. \nThe NHPRC also has been the key federal body to help preserve the oral \nhistories of many Native American tribes such as the Seneca, Blackfoot, \nSioux, Navajo, Apaches, and dozens more.\n  Further, I am proud to say that the NHPRC recently sped up and \ndigitized over 5,000 documents left behind by our Nation's founding \nfathers that were previously unpublished. Congress passed legislation \nlast year that I was honored to co-author with our former colleague, \nSenator John Warner from Virginia, requiring the NHPRC to work with the \ngroups publishing the volumes so that the documents could be made \navailable online at no charge to any student of history. Before, they \nwere walled-up behind the doors of large libraries and expensive to \naccess. To put that into context, the NHPRC has saved anyone who needs \nto view the letters of John Adams thousands of dollars, which would \nhave been the traditional cost of a complete set of published letters.\n  Lastly, the bill I am introducing today removes an artificial profit \ncap that Congress put in place a few years\n\n[[Page S13035]]\n\nago that prevents the National Archives and Records Administration from \noperating its regional facilities more like a business. For example, \nthere are times at the end of the year when the revolving fund that \npays for the operation and maintenance of the regional archival \nfacilities earns a profit. Instead of incentivizing the National \nArchives to save the excess profit for long-term capital investments, \nthe cap incentivizes regional facilities to spend the money on short \nterm projects that they may not be needed. This simply does not make \nsense for the National Archives or for the taxpayer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this important \nand necessary bill enacted before it's too late. I think everyone can \nagree that one of the things our democracy relies on is educated \ncitizenry. The NHPRC is the principle body that helps make that happen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Commission on Measures of Household \nEconomic Security to conduct a study and submit a report containing \nrecommendations to establish and report economic statistics that \nreflect the economic status and well-being of American households; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our government agencies collect and \nreport a range of economic information but much of what we see or hear \nis most suited to describing the general state of the country's \neconomy. This information does not reflect what is happening in and \nwhat matters most to our families and the quality of our lives. For \nexample, our national unemployment figures don't tell us that those who \nare employed may not have benefits, or that they are working two or \nthree jobs to earn the income that they report, or that their mortgage \ndebt and college loans are jeopardizing their ability to repay their \ncredit card debt or their medical bills. By knowing and reporting this \nkind of information we can not only more accurately reflect what our \nfamilies are experiencing economically, we can better inform \npolicymakers about what matters most to people and the steps that need \nto be taken to address household economic needs and concerns.\n  To address this need I am re-introducing the Commission on Measures \nof Household Economic Security Act of 2009. The bill would establish a \nbipartisan congressional commission of 8 economic experts to look at \nexisting government economic data and identify the possible need for \nnew information, more accurate methodologies and better ways to report \nthese economic measures to give a more accurate and reliable picture of \nthe economic well being of American households. As part of their \neffort, the Commission will be asked to meet with representative groups \nof the public so that their views are taken into account in the \nCommission's recommendations.\n  In doing this, the Commission will look at such things as the current \ndebt situation of American individuals and households, including \ncategories of debt such as credit card debt, education related loans \nand mortgage payments; the movement of Americans between salaried jobs \nwith benefits to single or multiple wage jobs with limited or no \nbenefits with a comparison of income to include the value of benefits \nprograms such as health insurance and retirement plans; the percentage \nof Americans who are covered by both employer-provided and individual \nhealth care plans and the extent of coverage per dollar paid by both \nemployers and employees; the savings rate, including both standard \nsavings plans and pension plans; the disparity in income distribution \nover time and between different demographic and geographic groups; and \nthe breakdown of household expenditures between such categories as \nfood, shelter, medical expenses, debt servicing, and energy.\n  In addition, the Commission will consider the relevance of certain \nnon-market activities, like household production, education, and \nvolunteer services that affect the economic well-being of households \nbut are not measured or valued in currently reported economic \nstatistics. As Robert F. Kennedy famously said, some of our economic \nindicators measure ``everything in short, except that which makes life \nworthwhile.'' We need to make an effort to value more than just our \ngross domestic product and sales receipts. We need to better measure \nand understand what matters to American households.\n  This effort to improve how we measure what matters in our economy is \nvery much in the Wisconsin tradition of accountable good government. It \nwas Senator Robert LaFollette, Jr. who, in 1932, introduced a \nresolution requiring the U.S. Government to establish a more \nscientific, specific and accurate set of measures of the health of the \nU.S. economy. From his request, Simon Kuznets, a University of \nPennsylvania economics professor, developed the first set of national \naccounts which form the basis for today's measure of GDP and other \neconomic indicators. Kuznets won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Economics \n``for his empirically founded interpretation of economic growth which \nhas led to new and deepened insight into the economic and social \nstructure and process of development''. His work was the basis for much \nof the New Deal reform policies. Yet Kuznets specifically acknowledged \nthat his measures were incomplete and did not go far enough to measure \nwhat may really matter. In his 1934 report to the Senate on his \ncompilation of statistics associated with Gross National Product he \nconcluded: ``The welfare of a nation can . . . scarcely be inferred \nfrom a measurement of national income as [so] defined. . . .'' This \nbill is intended to advance these earlier efforts to make our economic \nstatistical measures more reflective of the welfare of our families and \nour nation.\n  The cost of this commission will be fully covered by amounts already \nauthorized and appropriated to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I urge \nmy colleagues to support my legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2877. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to establish \na program\n\n[[Page S13036]]\n\nto regulate the entry of fossil carbon into commerce in the United \nStates to promote clean energy jobs and economic growth and avoid \ndangerous interference with the climate of the Earth, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation on my \nbehalf and Senator Collins', the Senator from Maine, dealing with \nputting a market signal on carbon so we can get off of carbon and move \nforward on a green energy economy that will create millions of jobs in \nAmerica.\n  I know we are still on health care so I am not going to take a lot of \ntime right now to talk about this because we in the next several weeks \nand months ahead are going to have a lot of time to talk about this \nissue. But I do want to say for my colleagues, as we are introducing \nthis legislation: The American people have been on a roller coaster \nride with energy prices. I know the Presiding Officer knows this \nbecause she comes from the Northeast and knows what home heating oil \ncosts have done to her State and surrounding States. I know my \ncolleague from Maine knows this as well. That is part of her motivation \nin joining me in this cause, I am sure. The American public cannot \nsustain having oil prices wreak havoc on our economy for the next 30 \nyears.\n\n  We know from economists that sometime in the next 5 to 30 years we \nwill be at peak oil, and once we are at peak oil, the cost to the U.S. \neconomy will be even more extravagant. The American people want to know \nwhat we are going to do to transition off of that and do so in a \nrespectable way. What they are not so interested in is a proposal that \nwould have Wall Street come up with a funding source by doing \nspeculative trading to continue the games that have been played for the \nlast year or 2 years on various commodities that drove the economy into \nthe ditch.\n  I find it interesting that today in the newspapers coming from \nCopenhagen, now they have decided that up to 90 percent of all market \nactivity in the European trading markets was related to fraudulent \nactivity. That tells us that trading markets already existing on carbon \nfutures have had great deals of problems with manipulation. I don't \nthink we need to repeat that. What we want to do instead is say, we are \ngoing to make sure that consumers get a check back to help them with \ntheir energy bills. We want to say we are going to protect them from \nthe skyrocketing prices of energy, but we are going to transition off \nof fossil fuels and onto new sources of energy, of biofuels, of \nalternatives such as wind and solar, of things such as plug-in electric \nvehicles, of an electricity grid that can be more efficient and a smart \ntwo-way communications system.\n  In the end, our economy is going to be better. We are going to create \nmore jobs. We are going to make sure that consumers are not held \nhostage by future huge energy spikes. If we do that, we are going to \nleave to the next generation a better situation. We will leave the \nplanet Earth in better shape. But most importantly, we are going to \ntake the U.S. economy, struggling to move ahead, and we are going to \ncreate thousands of jobs in the short term and millions of jobs in the \nnext several years. That is good news, to think that the United States \ncould become a leader in energy technology, that we are not going to be \nas dependent upon the Chinese for battery technology of the future as \nwe are right now on Middle East oil.\n  I introduce this legislation with the most respect for my colleagues, \nSenators Boxer and Kerry, Lieberman and McCain, many of my colleagues \nhave been involved in this issue for many decades, but to work across \nthe aisle. If health care shows us anything, we have to cut down the \namount of time it takes to move these important pieces of legislation \nby working together in an effort to show that we do understand the \nneeds of the American public. We have to drive down their costs, not \njust on health care but on fuel as well. We have to give them economic \nopportunity for the future. Sending this market signal is the best way \nto create jobs and help protect consumers for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWashington State, Senator Cantwell, in introducing what I believe to be \nlandmark legislation, the Carbon Limits and Energy for America's \nRenewal, or CLEAR Act. Let me commend the Senator for her leadership on \nthis important issue.\n  One of the most appealing parts of this bill is it takes a fresh look \nat the issues facing our country in the area of developing alternative \nenergy, promoting energy independence, and addressing climate change \nand the need for more green jobs in the economy. Indeed, this bill \naddresses the most significant energy and environmental challenges we \nface. It would help to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, promote \nalternative energy and energy conservation, and advance the goal of \nenergy independence for our Nation.\n  The cost of gas and oil imposes a great burden on many Americans, \nparticularly those living in large rural States such as the State of \nMaine. High gasoline prices have a disproportionate impact on Mainers \nwho often have no choice but to travel long distances to their jobs, \ngrocery stores, and doctors offices. This lessens the amount of money \nthey have to spend on other necessities.\n  In addition, 80 percent of Mainers heat their homes with home heating \noil. That is one of the highest percentages in the Nation. The State of \nMaine is one of the States most dependent on foreign oil of any State \nin the Nation. Our Nation must work together on comprehensive long-term \nactions that will stabilize gas and oil prices, help to prevent energy \nshortages, avoid those spikes when we are held hostage to foreign oil, \nand achieve national energy independence. This effort will require a \nstronger commitment to renewable energy sources such as wind energy, as \nwell as energy efficiency and conservation.\n  The development and implementation of these new approaches to \nenvironmental stewardship and energy independence will also provide a \npowerful stimulus to our economy and the creation of green jobs. Like \nmy colleague, I want the United States to lead the way on green \ntechnology, not lose our edge to China, for example.\n  In addition to advancing these goals, the CLEAR Act is the fairest \nclimate change approach from the perspective of consumers. It would \nrebate 75 percent of the proceeds generated by the cap on carbon \nemissions directly to citizens. That is a tremendous advantage of this \nbill over alternative approaches such as the cap-and-trade bill.\n  I also share the concerns of my colleague from Washington State about \nthe abuses we have seen in energy and agricultural markets, when \nspeculators are allowed to participate in the market. That is why in \nour bill, which imposes an upstream cap on carbon, only the producers \nare allowed to participate in the trading. That is a far better \napproach that will guard against market manipulation and excessive \nspeculation.\n  In the United States alone, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas \ncarbon dioxide have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Clearly \nclimate change is a daunting environmental challenge, but we must \ndevelop solutions that do not impose a heavy burden on our economy, \nparticularly during these difficult economic times. That is why I am \npleased to join as the lead cosponsor of the CLEAR Act. Climate change \nlegislation must protect consumers and industries that could be hit \nwith higher energy prices. We must recognize that many of our citizens \nare struggling to afford their monthly energy bills now and cannot \nafford dramatically higher prices. We also must produce legislation \nthat would provide predictability in the price of carbon emissions so \nthat businesses can plan, invest, and create good jobs. Climate change \nlegislation should encourage the adoption of energy efficiency measures \nand the further development of renewable energy.\n  I am very excited about the possibilities for the State of Maine \nbecause of its immense potential to develop offshore wind energy. \nEstimates are that the development of 5 gigawatts of offshore wind in \nMaine would be enough to power more than 1 million homes for a year. It \ncould attract $20 billion of investment to the State of Maine and \ncreate more than 15,000 green energy jobs, jobs that are desperately \nneeded in our State. The CLEAR Act would help to achieve all of those \ngoals.\n\n[[Page S13037]]\n\n  I could not support the bill that was passed to deal with climate \nchange by the House of Representatives. Let me read a couple of the \ndescriptions of that bill. The New York Times described it as ``fat \nwith compromises, carve-outs, concessions, and out-and-out gifts.'' The \nWashington Post in an editorial described it as having pollution \ncredits and revenue that were ``divvied up to the advantage of \npolitically favored polluters.''\n  I do not believe this bill, which is a 2,000-page monstrosity, can \ngarner the necessary 60 votes to proceed in the Senate. The CLEAR Act, \nby contrast, would help to move a stalled debate forward by offering a \nfairer, a more efficient, and a straightforward approach.\n  You have only to look at our bill. It is 39 pages long compared to \n2,000 pages of the House-passed bill.\n  My full statement goes into detail on how the bill would work. I hope \nmy colleagues will look closely at it. But let me talk about one part. \nThat is in the CLEAR Act, 75 percent of the carbon auction revenues \nwould be returned to consumers as tax free rebates. They wouldn't be \nlost to speculation or to $\\1/2\\ billion of fees every year to \ninvestment firms on Wall Street. No, 75 percent of those revenues would \nbe returned on a per capita basis to consumers. That means that 80 \npercent of Americans would incur no net new cost under the CLEAR Act. \nThe average Mainer would stand to actually gain $102 per year from the \nCLEAR Act. I can tell you, Mainers would welcome that. It would help \nthem winterize their homes, meet their energy bills, invest in energy \nconservation and efficiency, or have a little more money to get by.\n  By contrast, under the House-passed cap-and-trade bill, the average \ncitizen in this country would experience a net cost increase of $175 \nper year. That is a big difference and a big advantage of the Cantwell-\nCollins approach.\n  What about the other 25 percent of the auction revenues? What we \nwould propose is that those would go to a trust fund to fund energy \nefficiency programs and renewable energy research and development, to \nprovide incentives for forestry and agriculture practices that \nsequester carbon, to encourage practices that reduce other greenhouse \ngases, to help energy-efficient, energy-intensive manufacturers, and to \nassist low-income consumers. That fund would be called the Clean Energy \nReinvestment Trust, the CERT fund. It would be subject to the annual \nappropriations process so that Congress could adapt assistance for \nclimate-related activities on an annual basis rather than being locked \ninto a complicated allocation scheme that may well favor special \ninterests.\n  I am excited about this bill. It offers us a way forward to a green \neconomy. It will help create jobs. It will alleviate the burden on \nconsumers, particularly in New England, where the Presiding Officer and \nI live, as well as the Northwest. It makes sense. It is a commonsense \napproach. I hope my colleagues will consider joining the Senator from \nWashington and me on this important legislation.\n  Again, I commend Senator Cantwell's leadership. She has done a great \ndeal of work to come up with this approach, and I am excited to be \njoining her in this effort.\n  To reiterate, today I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Cantwell, in introducing landmark legislation, the \nCarbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal, or CLEAR, Act.\n  This bill addresses the most significant energy and environmental \nchallenges facing our country. It would help reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, promote alternative energy and energy conservation, and \nadvance the goal of energy independence for our Nation.\n  The costs of gas and oil impose a great burden on many Americans, \nparticularly those living in large, rural States like Maine. High \ngasoline prices have a disproportionate impact on Mainers who often \nhave to travel long distances to their jobs, doctors' offices, and \ngrocery stores, which lessens the amount of money they have available \nto spend on other necessities. Also, 80 percent of Mainers heat their \nhomes with home heating oil, one of the highest percentages in the \nNation. Our Nation must work together on comprehensive, long-term \nactions that will stabilize gas and oil prices, help to prevent energy \nshortages, and achieve national energy independence. This effort will \nrequire a stronger commitment to renewable energy sources, such as wind \nenergy, and energy efficiency and conservation.\n  The development and implementation of these new approaches to \nenvironmental stewardship and energy independence will also provide a \npowerful stimulus for our economy and the creation of ``green'' jobs.\n  In addition to advancing the goal of energy independence and creating \ngreen jobs, the CLEAR Act is the fairest climate change approach for \nconsumers. It would rebate 75 percent of the proceeds generated by the \ncap on carbon directly to citizens.\n  According to recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, increases in greenhouse gas emissions have already \nincreased global temperatures, and likely contributed to more extreme \nweather events such as droughts and floods. These emissions will \ncontinue to change the climate, causing warming in most regions of the \nworld, and likely causing more droughts, floods, and many other \nproblems.\n  In the United States alone, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas, \ncarbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Climate \nchange is the most daunting environmental challenge we face, and we \nmust develop reasonable solutions to reduce our carbon emissions.\n  I have personally observed the dramatic effects of climate change and \nhad the opportunity to be briefed by the preeminent experts, including \nUniversity of Maine professor and National Academy of Sciences member \nGeorge Denton. In 2006, on a trip to Antarctica and New Zealand, for \nexample, I saw sites in New Zealand that had been buried by massive \nglaciers at the beginning of the 20th century, but are now ice free. \nFifty percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860--an \nevent unprecedented in the last 5,000 years. It was remarkable to stand \nin a place where some 140 years ago, I would have been covered in \ntens or hundreds of feet of ice, and then to look far up the \nmountainside and see how distant the edge of the ice is today.\n\n  The melting is even more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere. In the \nlast 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice cover over an area ten times \nas large as the State of Maine, and at this rate will be ice free by \n2050. In 2005 in Barrow, AK, I witnessed a melting permafrost that is \ncausing telephone poles, planted years ago, to lean over for the first \ntime ever.\n  I also learned about the potential impact of sea level rise during my \ntrips to these regions. If the west Antarctica ice sheet were to \ncollapse, for example, sea level would rise 15 feet, flooding many \ncoastal cities. In its 2007 report, the IPCC found that even with just \ngradual melting of ice sheets, the average predicted sea level rise by \n2100 will be 1.6 feet, but could be as high as 1 meter, or almost 3 \nfeet. In Maine a 1 meter rise in sea level would cause the loss of \n20,000 acres of land, include 100 acres of downtown Portland, including \nCommercial Street. Already in the past 94 years, a 7-inch rise in sea \nlevel has been documented in Portland.\n  The solutions to these problems must not impose a heavy burden on our \neconomy, particularly during these difficult economic times. That is \nwhy I am pleased to be the lead cosponsor of the CLEAR Act.\n  While we must take meaningful action to respond to climate change, it \nmust be a balanced approach. Climate change legislation must protect \nconsumers and industries that could be hit with higher energy prices. \nWe must recognize that many of our citizens are struggling just to pay \ntheir monthly energy bills and cannot afford dramatically higher \nprices. Such legislation also must provide predictability so that \nbusinesses can plan, invest, and create jobs.\n  Climate change legislation should encourage adoption of energy \nefficiency measures and the further development of renewable energy, \nwhich could spur our economy and job creation. For example, Maine has \nimmense potential to develop offshore wind energy. Estimates are that \ndevelopment of 5 gigawatts of offshore wind in Maine--\n\n[[Page S13038]]\n\nenough to power more than 1 million homes for a year--could attract $20 \nbillion of investment to the State and create more than 15,000 green \nenergy jobs that would be sustained over 30 years.\n  The CLEAR Act achieves all of these goals, whereas the bill passed by \nthe House of Representatives earlier this year has been characterized \nby the Boston Globe as ``providing cushions for industry;'' ``fat with \ncompromises, carve-outs, concessions and out-and-out gifts,'' a New \nYork Times article by John Broder, June 30, 2009; and having pollution \ncredits and revenue that were ``divvied up to the advantage of \npolitically favored polluters,'' from the Washington Post editorial, \nJune 26, 2009. This House bill could not garner the necessary 60 votes \nin the Senate. The CLEAR Act will help to move a stalled debate forward \nby offering a more efficient, straightforward approach.\n  Let me discuss how our bill would work. The CLEAR Act places an \nupstream cap on carbon entering the economy. The upstream cap on carbon \nwould capture 96 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions, 93 percent of \ntotal annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by weight, and 82 percent of \ntotal annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by global warming potential.\n\n  The initial annual carbon budget under the cap would be set based on \nthe amount of fossil carbon likely to be consumed by the U.S. economy \nin 2012, the year in which the CLEAR Act regulations would begin, based \non projections by the Energy Information Administration. For the first \n2 years, the cap would stay at the 2012 level to give companies time to \nadapt to the system. Starting in 2015, the carbon budget would be \nreduced annually along a schedule designed to achieve nearly an 80 \npercent reduction in 2005 level emissions by 2050.\n  The cap will recognize voluntary regional efforts like the Regional \nGreenhouse Gas Initiative, RGGI. RGGI is a cooperative effort by 10 \nnortheast and mid-Atlantic States to limit greenhouse gas emissions. \nThese 10 States have capped CO2 emissions from the power \nsector and will require a 10-percent reduction in these emissions by \n2018.\n  Coal companies, oil and gas producers, and oil and gas importers \nwould have to buy permits or ``allowances'' for the carbon in their \nproducts. They would buy the permits in a monthly auction in which \nthose companies would be the only ones allowed to participate. One \nhundred percent of the allowances would be auctioned; no free \nallowances are provided to special interests. Thus, the CLEAR Act does \nnot provide special favors like the House bill.\n  Unlike the House bill, in the CLEAR Act, only the companies directly \nregulated by the legislation would participate in the auction. This \navoids the huge potential for market manipulation and speculation to \ndrive up carbon prices that exists in the House bill. Financial experts \nestimate that under the House bill, carbon permit trading could create \na $3 trillion commodity market by 2020. Do we really want to have \nenergy consumers subsidizing Wall Street traders?\n  In the CLEAR Act, 75 percent of the carbon auction revenues would be \nreturned to consumers as tax-free rebates. Nationwide, this means 80 \npercent of Americans would incur no net costs under the CLEAR Act. The \naverage Mainer would stand to gain $102 per year from the CLEAR Act. By \ncontrast, under the House-passed cap and trade bill, the average \ncitizen would experience a net cost increase of $175 per year.\n  The other 25 percent of the auction revenues generated under CLEAR \nwould go into a trust fund to fund energy efficiency programs and \nrenewable energy research and development, to provide incentives for \nforestry and agriculture practices that sequester carbon, to encourage \npractices that reduce other greenhouse gases, to help energy-intensive \nmanufacturers, and to assist low-income consumers. The fund, called the \nClean Energy Reinvestment Trust, CERT Fund, would be subject to the \nannual appropriations process. This would allow Congress to adapt \nassistance for climate-related activities on an annual basis, rather \nthan being locked into a complicated allocation scheme that favors \nspecial interests.\n  I applaud the leadership of my colleague from Washington for \ndeveloping this straightforward, effective and fair climate bill. I \nurge all my colleagues to consider joining us on this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2879. A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \nconduct a pilot program expanding the Lifeline Program to include \nbroadband service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will enable more low-income households to receive broadband and \nits benefits.\n  Broadband has fundamentally changed the way Americans live their \ndaily lives. It has changed how we do business, get information, find \njobs, learn, communicate, and interact with Federal, State, and local \ngovernments. Over the next few years, we can only expect more \ninnovation and more broadband applications that open doors to new \nopportunities and provide even more benefits to consumers.\n  While broadband has been more quickly deployed and adopted in \npredominantly urban areas, availability and adoption in rural areas has \nlagged behind. Low-income rural households are among the least likely \nto subscribe to broadband. At the same time, businesses and educational \ninstitutions, among others, have migrated many essential services and \nopportunities to the Internet. The result is that people without \nbroadband, particularly in rural areas, are being left behind.\n  Today, 77 percent of Fortune 500 companies only accept job \napplications online. Seventy-eight percent of students regularly use \nthe Internet for classroom work. Similarly, State, and local government \nagencies, as well as vital healthcare services, are increasingly \nmigrating online, especially as budget cuts reduce the availability and \nquality of offline services.\n  All of this means that the children of families without broadband \nlose access to learning opportunities. Qualified workers lose access to \njobs. Low-income Americans waste precious time--sometimes even having \nto take off from their jobs--in government offices, waiting for \nservices that are otherwise available online.\n  This income-based digital divide is stark. Americans who earn less \nthan $30,000 per year have a 50 percent lower rate of broadband \nadoption than those who earn $100,000 annually. What makes it worse is \nthat, in some ways, low-income consumers are the ones who stand to \nbenefit the most from affordable broadband access. Online job \ninformation and educational opportunities can provide low-income \nconsumers with critical means to improve their lives and the lives of \ntheir children.\n  Like basic telephone service, broadband is quickly becoming a \nnecessity. Consumers without access are at risk of becoming second \nclass citizens in a growing digital world. The original Lifeline \nprogram recognized that telephone service was a critical part of \neveryday life and that low-income Americans needed to be connected to \nthe world around them. What was true for telephony then is true for \nbroadband now. That is why the Lifeline program at the FCC should be \nexpanded to support broadband access for low-income households.\n  The legislation we introduce today creates a two-year pilot program \nto expand the FCC's Lifeline program by supporting broadband service \nfor eligible low-income households. It also asks the FCC to provide \nCongress with a report on expanding the Link-Up program to assist with \nthe costs of securing equipment, such as computers, needed to use \nbroadband service.\n  We must make sure that we act now to bridge the divide that threatens \nto make low-income consumers second-class citizens. For this reason, I \nurge my colleagues to join me and support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13038-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13038-S13039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3164.

Such system shall ensure that if an individual \n     applying to an Exchange, to a State Medicaid program under \n     title XIX of the Social Security Act, or to a State \n     children's health insurance program (CHIP) under title XXI of \n     such Act, is found to be ineligible for the program to which \n     the individual applied, the individual shall be screened for \n     eligibility for all other potentially applicable such \n     programs and shall be enrolled in the program for which the \n     individual qualifies.\n       (b) Requirements Relating to Forms and Notice.--\n       (1) Requirements relating to forms.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall develop and provide to \n     each State a single, streamlined form that--\n       (i) may be used to apply for all applicable State health \n     subsidy programs within the State;\n       (ii) may be filed online, in person, by mail, or by \n     telephone;\n       (iii) may be filed with an Exchange or with State officials \n     operating one of the other applicable State health subsidy \n     programs; and\n       (iv) is structured to maximize an applicant's ability to \n     complete the form satisfactorily, taking into account the \n     characteristics of individuals who qualify for applicable \n     State health subsidy programs.\n       (B) State authority to establish form.--A State may develop \n     and use its own single, streamlined form as an alternative to \n     the form developed under subparagraph (A) if the alternative \n     form is consistent with standards promulgated by the \n     Secretary under this section.\n       (C) Supplemental eligibility forms.--The Secretary may \n     allow a State to use a supplemental or alternative form in \n     the case of individuals who apply for eligibility that is not \n     determined on the basis of the household income (as defined \n     in section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).\n       (D) Relevance.--The forms described in subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B) shall not require the applicant to answer any \n     questions that are irrelevant to establishing eligibility for \n     applicable State health subsidy programs.

Such interface shall be compatible with the \n     method established for data verification under section \n     1411(c)(4).\n       (2) Data matching program.--Each applicable State health \n     subsidy program shall participate in a data matching \n     arrangement for determining eligibility for participation in \n     the program under paragraph (3) that--\n       (A) provides access to data described in paragraph (3);\n       (B) applies only to individuals who--\n       (i) receive assistance from an applicable State health \n     subsidy program; or\n       (ii) apply for such assistance--\n\n       (I) by filing a form described in subsection (b); or\n       (II) notwithstanding section 1411(b), by requesting a \n     determination of eligibility and authorizing disclosure of \n     the information described in paragraph (3) to applicable \n     State health coverage subsidy programs for purposes of \n     determining and establishing eligibility; and\n\n       (C) is consistent with standards promulgated by the \n     Secretary, including the privacy and data security safeguards \n     described in section 1942 of the Social Security Act or that \n     are otherwise applicable to such programs.\n       (3) Determination of eligibility.--\n       (A) In general.--Each applicable State health subsidy \n     program shall, to the maximum extent practicable--\n       (i) establish, verify, and update eligibility for \n     participation in the program using the data matching \n     arrangement under paragraph (2); and\n       (ii) determine such eligibility on the basis of reliable, \n     third party data, including information described in sections \n     1137, 453(i), and 1942(a) of the Social Security Act, \n     obtained through such arrangement, provided that if such data \n     do not establish an individual's eligibility for medical \n     assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act, the \n     rules described in section 1902(e)(14)(H) of such Act shall \n     apply to such individual.\n       (B) Exception.--This paragraph shall not apply in \n     circumstances with respect to which the Secretary determines \n     that the administrative and other costs of use of the data \n     matching arrangement under paragraph (2) outweigh its \n     expected gains in accuracy, efficiency, and program \n     participation.\n       (4) Secretarial standards.--The Secretary shall, after \n     consultation with persons in possession of the data to be \n     matched and representatives of applicable State health \n     subsidy programs, promulgate standards governing the timing, \n     contents, and procedures for data matching described in this \n     subsection. Such standards shall take into account \n     administrative and other costs and the value of data matching \n     to the establishment, verification, and updating of \n     eligibility for applicable State health subsidy programs.\n       (d) Administrative Authority.--\n       (1) Agreements.--Subject to section 1411 and section \n     6103(l)(21) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and any \n     other requirement providing safeguards of privacy and data \n     integrity, the Secretary may establish model\n\n[[Page S13041]]\n\n     agreements, and enter into agreements, for the sharing of \n     data under this section.\n       (2) Authority of exchange to contract out.--Nothing in this \n     section shall be construed to--\n       (A) prohibit contractual arrangements through which a State \n     medicaid agency determines eligibility for all applicable \n     State health subsidy programs, but only if such agency \n     complies with the Secretary's requirements ensuring reduced \n     administrative costs, eligibility errors, and disruptions in \n     coverage; or\n       (B) change any requirement under title XIX that eligibility \n     for participation in a State's medicaid program must be \n     determined by a public agency.\n       (e) Applicable State Health Subsidy Program.--In this \n     section, the term ``applicable State health subsidy program'' \n     means--\n       (1) the program under this title for the determination of \n     eligibility for premium tax credits under section 36B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and cost-sharing reductions \n     under section 1402;\n       (2) a State medicaid program under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act;\n       (3) a State children's health insurance program (CHIP) \n     under title XXI of such Act; and\n       (4) a State program under section 1331 establishing \n     qualified basic health plans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3168.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 10103.

The terms ``drug'' and \n     ``device'' have the meanings given such terms in sections \n     201(g)(1) and 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321), respectively, including any component or \n     raw material used therein, but excluding health care \n     services.\n\n     SEC. 10109.

I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak as long \nas I take tonight and then following my comments, the Senate stand in \nadjournment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first, I wish to say to my friend from New \nJersey, I appreciate the remarks he has made. I have stood with the \nCuban people and especially with the dissidents down there for years, \nmany times with my friend from New Jersey. I appreciate the issue he is \nbringing up and fighting for those folks.\n  There have been those cases over the years where American voices have \nreached all the way into those gulags, whether it was the old Soviet \nUnion or North Korea or wherever it may be. America being the beacon of \nhope for so many people around the world, it is critical that Members \nof this body, as well as the President of the United\n\n[[Page S13062]]\n\nStates, speak out for freedom and speak out for those people to give \nthem hope that there are people in America who are listening and who \nare paying attention to them, so they will keep fighting for freedom in \ntheir own country. So I appreciate the comments the Senator from New \nJersey made tonight.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Appropriations\n\n  I rise tonight, though, to speak about the legislation that is before \nthe Senate. It is the Consolidated Appropriations Act or, as some \npeople call it, the mini bus. This is a $447 billion bill. Around here, \nthat seems like a small number. I believe this spending bill represents \nyet another step in the wrong direction for our country. I believe this \nlegislation is only more of the same old recipe of fiscal \nirresponsibility that guides the majority in Congress. In a time of \nsky-high budget deficits and staggering debt, the American people are \nnow demanding a better way forward.\n  I wish to make it clear for the record what this legislation does. As \na Senate Budget Committee analysis shows, this bill increases spending \nby 12 percent over last year's fiscal year for the six spending bills \nthat are wrapped up in this legislation. When we look at each of these \nbills separately, the numbers are even more shocking. The State \nDepartment received a 33-percent increase over last year. \nTransportation, Housing, and Urban Development received a 23-percent \nincrease over last year. Keep in mind that these accounts together \nreceived more than $60 billion of increase in the stimulus bill that \nwas signed earlier this year.\n  When we look at the gritty details, for example, at individual \nprograms, the numbers are just as bad. The bill increases the \nCorporation for National Community Service by 30 percent and includes a \n41-percent increase for bilateral economic assistance. There is also a \n9-percent increase in Amtrak, and keep in mind that Amtrak got a $1.3 \nbillion extra amount of money in the stimulus bill this year.\n  These spending increases are set against a dire economic picture. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in fiscal \nyear 2010, the deficit will be $1.4 trillion. Right now, American \nfamilies are hurting. I know my home State of Nevada has experienced \nsome of the highest unemployment levels in the country--13 percent, \naccording to the Department of Labor. In talking to constituents back \nhome, I can guarantee my colleagues it is actually much higher. We have \na situation where because people quit looking for jobs, the \nunemployment rate is understated. In my State is probably closer to 20 \npercent.\n  Democrats expect this bloated spending bill to receive what has \nbecome a customary rubberstamp when it comes to spending in this town. \nBut I don't see how a $300,000 earmark to Carnegie Hall in New York \nCity or $250,000 for a bike path in Michigan can be considered \nresponsible spending during the economic times we are in. There are \nover 5,000 earmarks in this omnibus bill, this mini bus bill, whatever \nyou want to call it, that is before us today--5,000 earmarks.\n  Not surprisingly, with all this spending, the majority in Congress \nmust increase the debt limit. The debt limit is the limit set by \nCongress of how much debt our country can take on. This is similar, if \nyou think about it, to your credit card limit. Right now, the debt \nlimit is set at a little over $12 trillion--trillion. Let me take a \nlittle side note. We speak about trillions of dollars anymore as though \nit is nothing. Well, to put $1 trillion in a little bit of \nperspective--I have said this on this floor before--if you spend $1 \nmillion a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, to get to $1 trillion, \nyou would have had to start spending that $1 million a day every day \nfrom the time Jesus was born, spend it until now, and you still \nwouldn't be at your first $1 trillion. Yet our country already has $1 \ntrillion in debt.\n  Anyway, the majority is raising the debt limit. This would be akin to \ntaking your credit card and maxing it out but then going to the bank \nand saying: By the way, can I increase my credit limit by 20 percent? \nOh, by the way, I have no idea how I am going to pay it back, except \nmaybe my children will be able to pay it back someday. That is exactly \nwhat this Congress is doing. We are saying: We can't pay this debt \nback. There is no way we can pay this debt back. Maybe our children, \nmaybe our grandchildren can pay it back.\n  Americans across the country are going through tough times and they \nare doing what many in this body are unwilling to do. They are \ntightening their belts and cutting back on spending. According to the \nFederal Reserve, household debt has been reduced by $351 billion in the \nlast quarter. This is the largest quarterly decline in our Nation's \nhistory. That is right. American families see the danger of fiscal \nirresponsibility and they are cutting back on borrowing the money they \nmay have trouble paying back. State governments, local governments, \nbusinesses are doing the same as American families: They are cutting \nback.\n  We also have interest we must pay on this debt. Just like the \ninterest you pay on your credit card when you carry a balance, \nAmericans pay interest on the debt this country continues to \naccumulate. CBO estimates today the annual interest on this Nation's \ndebt last year was around $179 billion--a big number, $179 billion. A \nlot of good could be done with that if we weren't just spending that, \npaying the interest on the debt. Well, that $179 billion by the year \n2019 is projected to go to almost $800 billion, not including any of \nthe new spending programs that are being proposed out there--$800 \nbillion a year. As much as we are spending on our national defense will \njust be interest on our debt.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have made it a habit to \ncome down to the Senate floor and say: Well, where were Republicans \nwhen President Bush was in office, adding to the debt, increasing the \ndeficit? Well, I was right here saying many of the same things I am \nsaying today. Not only did I vote against many of the spending bills \nthat were passed during the previous administration, but I would have \nliked to have seen President Bush put his foot down and veto some of \nthese bills and force Congress to cut back on out-of-control spending.\n  If President Obama is worried about the debt that his children and \ngrandchildren are going to inherit, he has a hard time showing it. It \nseems to me the President is in denial regarding the fiscal train wreck \nthat is taking place in this country.\n  In July of this year, President Obama said he understands the concern \nabout the debt and admitted his recovery plan has added to the growing \ndebt. But he stated at the time that now is not the time to tighten our \nbelt and stop spending.\n  In November, however, President Obama said:\n\n       I think it is important, though, to recognize that if we \n     keep adding to the debt, even in the midst of the recovery, \n     that at some point, people could lose confidence in the U.S. \n     economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip \n     recession.\n\n  First, the President says we must keep spending, even during the \nrecession. Then he says that continued spending and increasing the debt \nduring the recession could lead to a lack of confidence in the U.S. \neconomy by the American people and by people around the world.\n  The President remains in his state of denial because before us is a \n$447 billion bill that he will likely sign into law.\n  I challenge President Obama to show leadership and veto this bill. \nSay to the Senate and the House of Representatives: Get your fiscal \nhouse in order. It is time we show responsibility to our children and \ngrandchildren. Spending this year has added up a little bit. The TARP--\nan additional $350 billion was added to the TARP program this year. \nThis has now become a slush fund. The stimulus bill was $787 billion. \nIt was supposed to not allow the unemployment rate to go over 8 \npercent. We now know the unemployment rate is 10 percent. There were \nsupposed to be millions of jobs saved or created. That certainly \ndoesn't appear to be the case. In this stimulus bill, we see that $6 \nmillion will go to a PR firm whose head is a former pollster for a \nhigh-ranking member in the Obama administration. Again, that was for $6 \nmillion. That was to educate folks on what it means to go from analog \ntelevision to digital. I don't know if anybody watched TV this last \nyear, but the cable companies, the broadcasters, spent tens and tens of \nmillions of dollars to tell folks about the transition and what it \nmeant to\n\n[[Page S13063]]\n\ntransition from analog to digital. Walmart and other companies that \nwere selling the converter boxes were telling people about it. The \ngovernment didn't need to spend this money. The private sector was \nhandling it just fine.\n  That is just one small example of the wasteful spending that was part \nof the stimulus bill. My State has a 13-percent unemployment rate, as I \nmentioned before. So the stimulus bill certainly doesn't seem to have \nhelped my State.\n  I want to show you what we are facing with this debt. Under the \nPresident's budget that was passed earlier this year, the debt will \ndouble within 5 years, and it will actually triple within 10 years. The \ndebt that this country is taking on will double within 5 years and \ntriple within 10 years.\n  Now we are going to add a $2.5 trillion health care bill, which is \nwhat the spending will be when it is fully implemented. The other side \nof the aisle has said that it actually decreases the deficit. That is \npart of the smoke and mirrors. You get all of the tax increases and the \nMedicare cuts in the first few years, but the actual benefits don't \nstart until 2014. So if you look at a true 10-year picture, the \nspending in the bill is about $2.5 trillion.\n  On top of that, the bill I am talking about today, the $447 billion \n``minibus'' of appropriations bills, is a 12-percent increase from last \nyear to this year. When are we going to get the message from the \nAmerican people? In the past, it doesn't seem like they cared that much \nabout the debt and deficit. We are hearing about it all across the \ncountry today. That is the reason you're seeing in poll after poll that \nit is one of the big things the American people are concerned about \nnow. I am happy they are finally paying attention. I just hope this \nbody starts paying attention to what the American people are saying.\n  Mr. President, now I want to turn my attention to the DC Opportunity \nScholarship Program and how the bill that is before us would eliminate \nthis vital and successful program.\n  This omnibus bill would accomplish this by restricting the enrollment \nof any new students and lead to the end of the program. As many of you \nknow, the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is part of a comprehensive \nstrategy designed to provide a quality education for every child in the \nDistrict, regardless of income or neighborhood.\n  The District roundly supports this program. DC's mayor, Adrian Fenty, \ntestified in favor of the program. He has sent letters of support to \nMembers of Congress regarding the scholarship program.\n  Other DC leaders have also expressed their support, including City \nCouncil Chairman Vincent Gray, DC Public School Chancellor Michelle \nRhee, and former Mayor Anthony Williams.\n  The residents support the program too. A Greater Washington Urban \nLeague Poll found that almost 70 percent of DC residents support this \neducation funding.\n  Although the Chancellor of Public Schools, Michelle Rhee, has made \nmuch progress reforming DC's public schools, there is still much work \nto do.\n  The statistics paint a grim picture. According to the Department of \nEducation's National Assessment of Education, DC ranked last in the \nNation based on fourth and eighth grade reading assessments.\n  In 2007, only 14 percent of fourth graders--14 percent--were \nproficient in reading and math in DC schools. DC's overall performance \non SATs is not much better. Reading scores are 32 points below the \nnational average, while math scores are 60 points below the national \naverage.\n  DC has some of the highest levels of per-pupil spending in the \nNation. Unfortunately, this large investment is bearing little fruit.\n  The biggest tragedy of all is that a quality education represents the \nbest chance for most of these children to escape the cycle of poverty \nthat so many of their families are in today. For many, the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program provides that chance.\n  The average household income of participating families that get these \nscholarships is $22,000 a year for a family of four. All participating \nstudents come from families below 185 percent of the poverty line. \nNearly 100 percent of the participating students are minorities.\n  Eighty-six percent of the scholarship students would otherwise be \nassigned to attend a DC public school that did not meet the ``adequate \nyearly progress'' standards in 2006 and 2007 and are in need of \nimprovement, corrective action, or restructuring.\n  Unfortunately, many of the Democrats in this body continue to put \npolitics ahead of a program that is helping to ensure low-income \nchildren have the ability to attend safe and effective schools.\n  Some opponents of the DC Opportunity Scholarship say the program \nisn't effective. They say it doesn't work and only diverts money from \nDC public schools. I simply disagree, and I believe the facts paint a \nvery different picture, a more accurate representation of the success \nof the scholarship program.\n  According to Dr. Patrick Wolf at the University of Arkansas, the \nprincipal investigator studying the scholarship program, this program \nis working.\n  DC opportunity scholarship recipients show the largest achievement \nimpact in reading of any education policy program yet evaluated in a \nrandomized control trial. These randomized trials are the gold standard \nwhen it comes to figuring out whether a program works.\n  While the numbers paint an encouraging picture, I think 90 percent of \nparents of children in the program who say that the scholarship program \ngives their child a chance at a quality and safe education is a better \nmeasure.\n  David Martinez, whose daughters, Brenda and Katherine, already attend \nSacred Heart through the scholarship program, wanted his youngest \ndaughter, Heidi, to enroll as well.\n  David writes:\n\n       I wanted my 5-year-old daughter, Heidi, to attend a private \n     school, as well. I was overjoyed when we received a letter--\n     telling us that the scholarship had been granted. Then, two \n     weeks later--because President Obama, the Congress, and \n     Education Secretary Arne Duncan sided against my daughter--we \n     received another letter. This letter said that Heidi wouldn't \n     receive her scholarship. We were devastated when we read \n     the letter.\n\n  Patricia Williams writes of her son Fransoir. Before the program, she \nworried how she could help Fransoir get a good education and make sure \nhe was safe and supervised. Patricia hopes that all her children attend \ncollege in the future.\n  Despite the fact that the parents and students involved in the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship have pleaded with lawmakers to preserve the \nprogram, Democrats continue to advocate eliminating the opportunity for \nmore than 1,700 students to continue attending private schools.\n  When you look close at the data on DC schools, it is no wonder that \nthe DC Opportunity Scholarship parents are so vocal about keeping the \nprogram alive. Per-pupil expenditures in the District public schools \nare more than $14,000 per pupil per year, and DC class size is one of \nthe lowest, 14 to 1 student-teacher ratio. Yet reading scores continue \nto languish at or near the bottom in every national assessment.\n  Recent data shows that 69 percent of fourth graders are reading below \nbasic levels, as defined by the Department of Education in Washington, \nDC.\n  DC students in DC public schools rank last in the Nation in both SAT \nand ACT scores.\n  Beyond the low performance in the classrooms, DC schools are often \nviolent and dangerous. A Federal Government study found that 12 percent \nof DC students were threatened or injured by a weapon on school \nproperty during a recent school year--well above the national average.\n  Would most Americans put up with those kinds of statistics, or would \nthey fight for change? This body has to fight for the students and the \nparents in Washington, DC.\n  According to the Washington Post, Anacostia High School alone saw 61 \nviolent offenses, including 3 sexual assaults and 1 instance of the use \nof a deadly weapon.\n  Perhaps these facts are why President Obama has chosen to enroll both \nof his daughters in a private school in Washington.\n  Clearly, we can do better, and the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program \nis a means to achieve better results for low-income children in \nWashington.\n  There are promising signs that this program works. My colleagues, \nincluding Senators on both sides of the aisle--Senators Lieberman, \nCollins,\n\n[[Page S13064]]\n\nFeinstein, Voinovich, Byrd, and Alexander--have joined in a bipartisan \nbill to improve and extend this successful program.\n  This program should not see its death through the appropriations \nprocess.\n  In conclusion, what this ``minibus''--the bill before us today--is \ndoing is rolling over the future of this country. Call it what you \nwant--minibus, omnibus, or 18 wheeler--it is carrying a load of debt \nand wasteful spending and government irresponsibility. It is a reminder \nto the American people that while they balance their budgets and scrape \nto pay their bills and try to save something for the future, the \nFederal Government continues its reckless shopping spree and just \nprints the money. This is not what we are sent here to do. I hope the \nPresident sees that and vetoes this irresponsible legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/11/senate-section/article/S13064-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
